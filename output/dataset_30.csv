ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Appeals—Jurisdiction
of Supreme Court of Canada—Right to appeal limited to questions of law on which
there was a dissent in the Court of Appeal—Confession—Whether voluntary—Dissent
as to admissibility—Whether dissent on a question of law—Criminal Code , 1953-54
(Can), c. 51, ss. 79(1)(a), 597(1)(a).

The appellant, a Sons of Freedom Doukhobor, was convicted on a
charge of having placed an explosive substance with intent to cause an
explosion that was likely to cause serious damage to property, contrary to s.
79(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code . A confession was put in evidence
at the trial. His appeal was dismissed by a majority judgment of the Court of
Appeal, the dissent being as to the admissibility of the confession. The
appellant appealed to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

Under s. 597(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , this
Court is incompetent to entertain an appeal if the ground of appeal raises only
a question of mixed law and fact. The ground of appeal must raise a question of
law in the strict sense and in respect to which there is a disagreement,
expressed or implied, between the minority and the majority in the Court of
Appeal. In the case at bar, the difference of opinion was attributable to
different inferences drawn by the dissenting judge and by those of the majority
from the accepted evidence relevant to the voluntariness of the confession.
Consequently, the ground of appeal did not raise a question of law in the
strict sense and this Court had no jurisdiction.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the appellant's conviction for an offence
under s. 79(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code . Appeal dismissed.

Sydney B. Simons, for the
appellant.

W. G. Burke-Robertson,
Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

FAUTEUX J.:—This is an appeal
from a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Province of
British Columbia[2]
dismissing the appeal of the appellant from his

[Page 80]

conviction for the offence
described under s. 79(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code . 

The appeal is taken under.
579.(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  which provides that: 

597. (1) A person who is
convicted of an indictable offence other than an offence punishable by death
and whose conviction is affirmed by the court of appeal may appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada

(a) on any question
of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents, or

Under these provisions, this
Court is incompetent to entertain an appeal if the ground alleged in support
thereof raises only a question of mixed law and fact. It is indeed well settled
by the decisions of this Court that the ground of appeal must raise ""a
question of law in the strict sense"", The King v. Decary[3],
and that this question of law, involved in the ratio decidendi, must be
one in respect to which there is a disagreement expressed or implied between
the minority and the majority in the Court of Appeal. Rozon v. The King[4]

In the case at bar, the majority
and the minority disagreed with respect to the admissibility, as a voluntary
statement, of a confession of guilt made by the appellant. It does not appear
from the reasons of Davey J.A., dissenting, and from those of his colleagues
Bird and Wilson JJ.A., of the majority, that this disagreement is based on a
conflicting view of the law governing the admissibility of confessions; a
careful consideration of the reasons for judgment reasonably indicates that the
difference of opinion is attributable to different inferences being drawn by
the dissenting Judge and by those of the majority from the accepted evidence
relevant to the voluntariness of the confession. On this view of the matter,
the ground of appeal alleged by the appellant does not raise a question of law
in the strict sense. The Queen v. Fitton[5].

[Page 81]

Hence, this Court has no
jurisdiction and the appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Driving motor vehicle while
ability impaired by drug—Drug administered as anaesthetic by dentist—Accused
warned not to drive until his head was perfectly clear—Whether driver
guilty—Whether mens rea a necessary element of the offence—Criminal Code ,
1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 222, 223.

[Page 747]

The accused went to his dentist by
appointment to have two teeth extracted. He was injected with a drug known as
sodium pentothal, a quick-acting anaesthetic. Earlier, he had been required to
sign a printed form containing a warning not to drive after the anaesthetic
until his head had cleared. After he regained consciousness, the nurse in
attendance, to whom he appeared to be normal, warned him not to drive until his
head was “perfectly clear”. He replied that he intended to walk. The accused
said that he heard no such warning and did not remember signing any form
containing a warning. He remembered getting into his car and that while driving
he became unconscious. His car ran into the rear of a parked vehicle. Medical
evidence was given that his mental and physical condition (he was staggering
and his co-ordination was poor) was consistent with the after-effects of the
drug in question which may induce a state of amnesia accompanied by a period
during which the subject may feel competent to drive a car and in the next
second be in a condition in which he would not know what was happening. The
accused stated that he did not know anything about this drug.

He was charged and convicted of the offence
of driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by a drug,
contrary to s. 223  of the Criminal Code . After a trial de novo before
a County Court judge under s. 720 of the Code, his conviction was affirmed. The
Court of Appeal granted him leave to appeal and quashed the conviction. The
Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the question as to whether mens
rea relating to both the act of driving and to the state of being impaired
was an essential element of the offence.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Taschereau
J.: There can be no actus reus unless there is a willpower to do an
act whether the person knows or not that it is prohibited by law. In the
present case, intention was not to be confused with mens rea. Intention
is an element of the offence in question only when the offender voluntarily
takes liquor or a drug. There must be an act proceeding from a free will which
may bring about the mental condition necessary to meet the requirements of
s. 223 . When a doctor has given an injection of a drug to a patient, who
is not aware of the state of mind it may produce, there is no volitive act done
by the patient and he could not be convicted under s. 223 .

Per Locke and
Judson JJ.: The question of law propounded did not arise upon the facts found
at the trial de novo by the County Court judge who found as a fact that
the accused knew that he had had a drug and that he was warned not to drive
after the anaesthetic, but did not find that the accused’s condition was such
that he could not appreciate the warnings given to him. The Court of Appeal
found that the accused believed that the drug did not possess properties which
would impair or were likely to impair his ability to drive or that he was led
to believe and honestly believed that the drug could not have the effect of
impairing such ability. These findings were directly in conflict with those of
the trial judge. However, as the Crown did not ask leave to appeal on the
ground that the Court of Appeal had exceeded its jurisdiction and that question
was not argued, the proper course was to dismiss the appeal.

Per Martland
and Ritchie JJ.: The enactment of s. 223  of the Criminal Code  added a
new crime to the general criminal law, and neither the language in which it was
enacted nor the evil which it was intended to

[Page 748]

prevent are such as to give rise to a
necessary implication that Parliament intended to rule out mens rea as
an essential ingredient of the crime therein described. When it has been proved
that a driver was driving while his ability was impaired by alcohol or a drug,
a rebuttable presumption arises that his condition was voluntarily induced. But
if it appears that the impairment was produced as a result of using a drug in the
form of medicine on a doctor’s order or recommendation and that its effect was
unknown to the patient, the presumption is rebutted. Mens rea need not
necessarily be present in relation both to the act of driving and to the state
of being impaired in order to make the offence complete. The defence that the
accused became impaired through no act of his own will and could not reasonably
be expected to have known that his ability was impaired or might thereafter
become impaired when he undertook to drive and drove his motor vehicle, was a
good defence in this case.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], reversing the
conviction of the accused. Appeal dismissed.

W.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the appellant.

Irving Himel, Q.C., for the respondent.

TASCHEREAU J.:—I substantially agree with the
reasons of my brother Ritchie, and I only wish to add a few personal
observations.

In his judgment the trial judge, His Honour
Judge Timmins, came to the conclusion that s. 223  of the Criminal Code  is
an express prohibition in respect to driving a motor car when the driver had a
drug impairing his driving, and that the defence set up by the accused that
this was all involuntary, was not a defence against this section. The Court of
Appeal of Ontario1 reached a different conclusion and held that no
moral fault could be imputed to the accused and that the act committed in the
circumstances of this case must be regarded as involuntary. It held also that
the undertaking of the accused to drive the motor car was not a conscious act
of the respondent’s volition.

The trial judge found the accused guilty, but
the Court of Appeal directed a verdict of acquittal. In this Court, special
leave to appeal was granted on the following question:

Whether the Court of Appeal erred in law in
holding that mens rea relating to both the act of driving and to the state of
being impaired by alcohol or drug is an essential element of the offence
of driving while impaired contrary to section 223  of the Criminal Code .

[Page 749]

This section 223 Cr. C., under which the
respondent was charged, reads as follows:

223. DRIVING WHILE ABILITY TO DRIVE IS
IMPAIRED.

Every one who, while his ability to drive a
motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol or drug, drives a motor vehicle or has the
care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not, is guilty
of an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary conviction and is
liable…

The Crown’s contention is that under s. 223 Cr.
C., the driver of an automobile, whether conscious or not, if he has imbibed
liquor or drugs, is guilty of driving while impaired. The result is, as found
by the trial judge, that although involuntarily impaired, the accused cannot be
absolved.

The Crown did not appeal to this Court that part
of the judgment of the Court of Appeal dealing with the mental capacity of the
respondent. Therefore, the question of jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to
deal with the mental capacity of the respondent is not before this Court. The
real question arises from the statement of the trial judge (trial de novo) who
said in his judgment: “The defence set by the accused that this was all
involuntary is not a defence as against this section.” The majority of the
Court of Appeal took the opposite view.

I entirely disagree with the proposition of the
Crown that whether the accused knew he was impaired or not he must be found
guilty, and that under s. 223 Cr. C., no mental element has to be considered,
and that the mere fact of impairment is sufficient to create the offence.

It is my view that there can be no actus reus unless
it is the result of a willing mind at liberty to make a definite choice or
decision, or in other words, there must be a willpower to do an act whether the
accused knew or not that it was prohibited by law.

These words mens rea, though they are in
common use, are, as Stephen J. said in The Queen v. Tolson[2], most unfortunate and not only
likely to mislead but actually misleading. In the present case, intention must
not be confused with mens rea. Intention is not an element of the
offence of driving while impaired by liquor or drugs, when the offender
voluntarily takes liquor or drugs, and then drives a motor vehicle or takes the
care or control of it. There must be an

[Page 750]

act proceeding from a free will that may bring
about the mental condition necessary to meet the requirements of s. 223 Cr. C.

When a doctor has given an injection of a drug
to a patient, who is not aware of the state of mind it may produce, there is no
volitive act done by the driver and he cannot be convicted.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Locke and Judson JJ. was
delivered by

LOCKE J.:—The charge laid against the respondent
and which was tried by a magistrate in Toronto was that he did on October 8, 1959, at the Municipality
 of Metropolitan Toronto,
unlawfully:

While his ability to drive a motor vehicle
was impaired by a drug, drive a motor vehicle License No. 94,547 for the year
1959, at about 3.35 p.m. on Indian Grove near Dundas
 St. W., contrary to the Criminal Code ,
section 223 .

Section 223  reads in part:

Every one who, while his ability to drive a
motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol or a drug, drives a motor vehicle or has
the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not, is
guilty of an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary conviction…

The Crown elected to proceed by asking for a
summary conviction and the matter was so dealt with by the police magistrate
who found the respondent guilty and imposed a fine.

The respondent appealed from this conviction to
a County Court judge of the County of York, under the provisions of s. 720  of
the Criminal Code . After a trial de novo, as required by
s. 727 , before His Honour Judge Timmins, the conviction was affirmed and
the appeal dismissed. The learned County Court judge gave reasons for his
judgment and made findings of fact upon which he based his conclusion.

The appeal to the Court of Appeal was taken
under the provisions of s. 743  of the Criminal Code  with leave of that
Court. The section, so far as relevant, reads:

An appeal to the Court of Appeal as defined
in section 581 may with leave of that court be taken on any ground that
involves a question of law alone, against

(a) a decision of a court in
respect of an appeal under section 727.

[Page 751]

The application for leave to appeal to the Court
of Appeal was made upon various grounds and, while leave was granted, the
question of law in respect of which the leave was granted is not stated in the
judgment of that Court.

The Crown applied to this Court for leave to
appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal[3]
and that leave was granted on the following question of law:

Whether the Court of Appeal erred in law in
holding that mens rea relating to both the act of driving and to the
state of being impaired by alcohol or drug is an essential element of the
offence of driving while impaired, contrary to section 223  of the Criminal
Code .

At the outset of this appeal there lies the
question as to whether this question of law arises upon the facts which are to
be considered. This is an appeal and not a reference and, unless the question
arises upon the facts as found by the learned County Court judge, it should
not, in my opinion, be answered.

The judgment of the majority of the Court of
Appeal, to which I will hereafter refer, disagreed with the findings made by
the learned County Court judge but, as to this, and with the greatest respect,
it is upon the facts as found by the County Court judge alone that we can deal
with this matter.

The findings of the learned County Court judge
were, so far as they need be considered, expressed as follows:

The accused King had gone to see an oral
surgeon and had made an appointment to have two teeth extracted on the 8th of
October 1959. He attended at the office, the dentist office around two o’clock in the afternoon and he was asked to
fill out a form to give the dentist certain written instructions and he says
that he filled out the form and then he says that the dentist gave him a
needle. The teeth were then extracted and he was taken into the recovery room
where he remained for, I believe, half an hour and after that when he came to
there was a nurse who had conversation with him, gave him certain instructions
and asked him how he was going home and warned him about driving a motor
vehicle and then she gave him a receipt and then he left. He walked over to
where he had his motor car parked and he proceeded to drive away. He hadn’t
gone very far when he said he became unconscious and had a slight accident with
another car. Now in a general way that is the evidence.

After referring to the statement of the accused
that he did not know anything about sodium pentothal or what its effect would
be and that he remembered signing a form but did not admit that there was any
warning on the form in respect

[Page 752]

of the drug and that he did not deny the
conversation with the nurse, merely saying that he did not remember it, the
learned judge said:

He says at the time that he was leaving the
office he was not asked if his head was clear although he says that his head
was clear. Now the serious defence of the accused is that he had no knowledge
of the drug, he did not know anything about the effect of the drug on him and
that there was nothing voluntary on his part in respect to driving of the motor
car because he was unconscious at the time of the accident and that he cannot
be responsible for something that he did involuntarily. The next thing is that
he did not know what effect the drug would have therefore he did not know that when
he got into his motor car that he might not he subject to further effects of
the drug. In other words he says I had no knowledge that it was this drug that
was administered to me, I had not knowledge of what the effect would be on me
and I have no recollection of this warning that was said to have been given to
me and if I did anything that was wrong it was involuntary.

After referring to s. 223 of the Code, the
reasons proceed:

Now having regard to the evidence of the
accused, he knew that he had a drug and he was given a warning, with respect to
not driving a motor car. The section is an express prohibition in respect
to driving a motor car when you have had a drug which will impair your driving
and that the defence set up by the accused that this was all involuntary is not
a defence as against this section. There were certain warnings that we have
heard in evidence here today and I have got to pay some attention to. First is
that he was expected to sign a form, and that form contained a warning,—”Patient
is cautioned not to drive after anaesthetic until head clears.” I would have
thought that that warning in itself was sufficient and the accused does not
admit that he signed this form, he admits he signed some form.

* * *

Now the other warning was that Nurse Childs
saw him when he regained consciousness in the recovery room and that she talked
with him, she gave him some instructions, his account was paid and she asked
him how he was going home and he said that he was walking, she told him you
can’t drive until your head is perfectly clear, he said that he was walking and
he left.

* * *

This young man apparently had his motor car
in the district to drive home. He knew that he was going to get some treatment,
some injection or he was going to be given something in the doctor’s office in
order to have his teeth extracted. He was given a drug intravenously and a
certain state of amnesia was produced. He was given a warning I find by the
dental nurse. I find as a fact that he was given that warning but whether he
deliberately lied to the nurse or whether he unconsciously lied to her the fact
of the matter is that he did misinform the nurse that he was walking. He took
the responsibility of going to the car, he took the responsibility of driving
his car knowing that he had had a drug, he was driving his car and the charge
is that he was in charge of a motor vehicle when his ability was impaired.
There is no doubt that on all the evidence that he was impaired. In argument by
counsel for the accused there were reflections cast upon the dental profession
that they should never allow persons who have had this drug in respect to
extractions of teeth to leave their office unless he

[Page 753]

is accompanied by some other adult person
so that he cannot get into trouble. In this case there were warnings and the
accused paid no attention to them.

The judgment of the majority of the Court of
Appeal was given by Schroeder J.A. and it is upon the facts as found by him
that the case for the respondent has been argued before us. In the reasons
delivered by that learned judge the following appears:

The learned County Court judge reached the
conclusion upon the evidence that the appellant was or should have been aware
that his ability to drive a motor car might be impaired by the use of this drug
and accordingly he held that he was bound to uphold the conviction. In my
respectful opinion the evidence falls far short of supporting that conclusion.
On the contrary, the evidence indicates at most that the accused was advised by
the nurse and at a time when his mind was probably in a muddled or confused
state (undetected mental impairment as described by Dr. Lucas) that he should
not drive “until his head was perfectly clear.” It is highly probable that, as
he stated, he did not observe the caution on the printed form mentioned by Dr.
Richards. The evidence of Dr. Lucas suggests rather forcibly that the appellant
would not have been fully restored to normalcy for at least eight hours, yet he
was told that he should not drive until “his head was perfectly clear.” This
was left to the judgment of a man who, at that time, was probably in a state of
“undetected mental impairment.” In that condition, he would unwittingly delude
both the nurse and himself. The evidence overwhelmingly supports the view that
when the appellant undertook to drive his motor car he did not know and could
not reasonably be expected to have known that his ability to drive was then or
might thereafter become impaired, and in a criminal case any contrary view
would, in my opinion, be untenable.

The question to be determined is whether
the absence of such knowledge on the part of the appellant in the particular
circumstances is sufficient to exculpate him.

Later the reasons continue:

The problem thus presented is this: If A
attends at the office of a duly qualified surgeon where a drug is administered
to him, and he honestly believes that such drug does not possess properties
which will impair or are likely to impair his ability to drive a motor car; or
to fit the case at bar more precisely—if he is led to believe and honestly
believes that when his head is perfectly clear the drug cannot then have the
effect of impairing his ability to drive and he, in good faith, believes that
advice and acts upon it, would A, in the supposed circumstances, be guilty of
the crime of driving a motor car while his ability to drive was impaired if
that condition should develop unexpectedly after he had entered his motor car
and had commenced to operate it?

And again:

Where, therefore, a person is given a drug
by his physician who does not warn him that it is likely to affect his ability
to drive, and the patient not being negligent in failing to realize that fact,
the drug takes sudden effect while he is driving he would not, in my view, be guilty
of an offence against section 223 . The facts must be viewed as a whole
commencing at

[Page 754]

the point when the drug was first
administered by the doctor. The conclusion cannot be avoided that in that case
the patient was not even negligent.

* * *

Here the appellant had no reason to
anticipate that the drug administered to him would impair his ability to drive
a motor car “after his head had cleared.” His undertaking to drive or his
driving of the motor car was not, in the circumstances, a conscious act of the
appellant’s volition.

* * *

Unless the appellant knew or ought to have
known that when he undertook to drive, the effect of the drug would
incapacitate him within the meaning of section 223 , he could not have
entertained the will to drive while his ability to do so was impaired or was
likely to become impaired.

McKay J.A., who dissented and would have
dismissed the appeal, agreed with the findings of fact made by the learned
trial judge but pointed out that the form signed by the respondent which
contained the warning against driving was signed on Tuesday October 6th, two
days in advance of the extraction of his teeth, at which time there is no
suggestion that he was under the influence of any drug, and the further fact
that when he was apprehended by the police officer he told him that he had been
to the dentist and been given sodium pentothal, which is at variance with the
respondent’s evidence that he did not know what drug had been given to him, and
that this fact was stated by him as his explanation for the accident.

It will be seen from the foregoing that the
trial judge found as a fact that the respondent knew that he had had a drug and
that he was warned not to drive after the anaesthetic. In referring to the
warning on the form, the learned judge said that he would have thought that
warning was sufficient and found further as a fact that the respondent had been
warned by the nurse and that he had made the statement to her that he was
walking after leaving the dentist’s office, which was untrue, and that his
action in driving the car in these circumstances was deliberate. The learned
judge did not find that the condition of the respondent was such that he could
not appreciate the warnings given to him.

Schroeder J.A. did not proceed upon the footing
that there was no evidence to support these findings but, upon his own view of
the evidence, he considered that at the time the warning was given by the nurse
the respondent was in a muddled or confused state and that it was highly
probable

[Page 755]

that he did not observe the caution on the
printed form and that, in the condition he was, “he would unwittingly delude
both the nurse and himself.” It was said further that the evidence
overwhelmingly supported the view that he “did not know and could not
reasonably be expected to have known that his ability to drive was then or
might thereafter become impaired.” The statement thereafter made as to the
question to be determined is based upon the premise that the respondent
honestly believed that the drug did not possess properties which would impair
or were likely to impair his ability to drive or that he was led to believe and
honestly believed that the drug could not have the effect of impairing such
ability. These findings directly conflict with those of the judge at the trial.

In my view, the question of law upon which leave
to appeal was granted upon the application of the Crown does not arise upon the
facts found by the learned County Court judge and these are the facts upon
which the appeal must be determined. Upon those findings of fact, in agreement
with McKay J.A. I consider that the accused was properly found guilty and the
judgment should not have been set aside.

While the findings of fact made in the majority
judgment in the Court of Appeal do raise the question propounded, since this is
not a reference I do not consider that we should answer the question since it
is unnecessary for the disposition of the appeal. Had the respondent been
successful in obtaining a finding of fact from the learned County Court judge
that he was unaware of the probable effect of the drug and had not been warned
as to this, issues which were matters of defence, the situation would be
otherwise, but there are no such findings.

The Crown, however, did not ask leave to appeal
on the ground that the Court of Appeal had exceeded its jurisdiction and the
question was not argued before us. In these circumstances, the proper course to
be pursued, in my opinion, is to dismiss this appeal.

The judgment of Martland and Ritchie JJ. was
delivered by

RITCHIE J.:—This is an appeal by the Crown at
the instance of the Attorney-General for Ontario from a judgment rendered by the majority of the Court of Appeal of

[Page 756]

that province[4]
(MacKay J.A. dissenting) which allowed the respondent’s appeal from a
conviction entered against him after a trial de novo held before Judge
Timmins of the County Court of the County of York for the offence of driving a
motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by a drug contrary to s.
223  of the Criminal Code .

The circumstances giving rise to this appeal are
that on October 8, 1959, the respondent went to his dentist’s office, by
appointment, for the purpose of having two teeth extracted, and that he was
there injected with a drug known as sodium pentothal, a quick-acting
anaesthetic which produces unconsciousness, removes pain and gives a certain
amount of relaxation during the period of an operation, and before using which
the dentist stated that it was the practice of his office to have patients sign
a printed form containing the following warning: “Patients are cautioned not to
drive after anaesthetic until head clears.” After he had regained
consciousness, the respondent paid his bill by cheque to a nurse who was in
attendance and who states that at this time he appeared “perfectly normal” and
that she warned him not to drive his car until his head was “perfectly clear”
to which he replied that he intended to walk. The respondent says that he heard
no such warning and remembers signing no form containing any warning, but he
does remember getting into his car which he had parked about a block away and
proceeding across an intersection, after which he became unconscious, and his
car ran into the left rear portion of a parked vehicle, whereafter the police
appeared to find that he was staggering and that his physical co-ordination was
poor. This was later verified by a sergeant at the police station where the
respondent was submitted to certain tests. Medical evidence was given to the
effect that this mental and physical condition was consistent with the
after-effects of being injected with sodium pentothal and that this drug may
induce a state of amnesia accompanied by a period during which the subject may
feel perfectly competent to get in a car and drive and in the next second or so
be in a condition in which he would not know what was happening. The respondent
stated that he did not know anything about the drug which was administered to
him.

[Page 757]

The learned County Court judge convicted the
respondent on the ground that “he knew that he had a drug and he was given a
warning with respect to driving a motor car” and also that “he took the
responsibility of going to the car, he took the responsibility of driving his
car knowing that he had had a drug”.

The respondent’s sole defence was that he had no
knowledge of the effect of the drug which resulted in his being unaware of any
warning and unaware of the fact that he was impaired when he took the
responsibility to drive and did drive his car.

The County Court judge expressed the following
view of the evidence as to the effect of the drug:

Evidence seems to point out that this would
produce amnesia and that the patient would go unconscious and that this may
last for some considerable time or it might last just for a short time.

If the County Court judge had found that the
respondent knew of the possible effects of the drug before he took it or that
he was capable of being aware of the fact that he was impaired when he started
to drive and drove his car, then the question now before this Court would not
have arisen in this case, but the judge made no such finding but disposed of
the respondent’s only defence in accordance with his view of the legal effect
of s. 223  of the Criminal Code  which he expressed as follows:

The section is an express prohibition
in respect to driving a motor car when you have had a drug which would impair
your driving and that the defence set up by the accused that this was all
involuntary is not a defence against this section. (The italics are mine.)

Expressing the same opinion in slightly
different language, he later said: “There is nothing in Section 223 of the
Code about an involuntary act. The section is specific.”

The question of law so determined was made a
ground of appeal and for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal of Ontario, and
Mr. Justice MacKay, in the course of his dissenting opinion, stated the
issue before that Court in the clearest terms, saying: “I think all these
grounds of appeal raise only one issue, that is, to what extent, if at all,
does the doctrine of mens rea apply to this offence.”

Just as the learned County Court judge dealt
with this issue in the concluding paragraph of his reasons by saying: “In this
case the accused was impaired by reason of a drug.

[Page 758]

I cannot hold anything else, and, therefore,
the conviction will be affirmed…”, so Mr. Justice MacKay expressed the
same conclusion rather more fully by saying:

For these reasons I have come to the
conclusion that the offence here charged is one of strict liability in which
proof of actus reus alone is required, that is, proof that
the defendant drove his car and was in fact impaired. In this particular case
the defendant knew he had been given a drug and he intentionally drove his car.
Even if it was a fact that he did not know or did not believe that he was
impaired such knowledge or belief is not material and is not a defence.

On the other hand, Mr. Justice Schroeder,
speaking for the majority of the Court, stated the exactly opposite view in
these words:

Even in the case of statutory crimes,
therefore, the offender should not be condemned if his conduct was not
voluntary, save in cases where such exception is expressly or by necessary
implication excluded in the Act creating the offence…

Unless the appellant knew or ought to have
known that when he undertook to drive, the effect of the drug would
incapacitate him within the meaning of section 223 , he could not have
entertained the will to drive while his ability to do so was impaired or was
likely to become impaired. This is a true case of ignorantia facti which
should have been held to have excused the actus reus prohibited
by the statute.

These quotations are sufficient to indicate the
sharp difference of opinion which existed in the Courts below as to a decisive
question of law, and although it may be said, with all respect, that the judges
in the Court of Appeal strayed into the making of some unnecessary observations
on the facts, it is nonetheless the question of law which gave rise to this
difference which has been made the subject of the sole ground upon which leave
to appeal to this Court has been granted under the provisions of s, 41(3) of
the Supreme Court Act. That question is expressed in the order by which
leave to appeal was granted as follows:

Whether the Court of Appeal erred in law in
holding that mens rea relating to both the act of driving and to the state of
being impaired by alcohol or drug is an essential element of the offence of
driving while impaired contrary to Section 223  of the Criminal Code .

The provisions of s. 223 of the Code are as
follows:

223. Every one who, while his ability to
drive a motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol or a drug, drives a motor vehicle
or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not,
is guilty of an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary
conviction and is liable

[Page 759]

(a) for a first offence, to a fine
of not more than five hundred dollars and not less than fifty dollars or to
imprisonment for three months or to both,

(b) for a second offence, to
imprisonment for not more than three months and not less than fourteen days,
and

(c) for each subsequent offence, to
imprisonment for not more than one year and not less than three months.

The cases in England and Australia which
have been so fully reviewed by the Court of Appeal indicate that there have
been differences in approach in determining the extent to which “knowledge of
the wrongfulness of the act” is to be regarded as a constituent in statutory
offences.

In the decision of Wright J. in Sherras v. De
Rutzen[5], that
learned judge stated:

There is a presumption that mens rea, an
evil intention, or a knowledge of the wrongfulness of the act, is an essential
ingredient in every offence; but that presumption is liable to be displaced
either by the words of the statute creating the offence or by the
subject-matter with which it deals and both must be considered.

On the other hand, in the case of Hobbs v.
Winchester Corporation[6], which
involved the sale of tainted meat contrary to the Public Health Act, Kennedy
L.J. concluded that “there is a clear balance of authority that in construing a
modern statute this presumption as to mens rea does not exist”.

The weight of opinion, however, clearly favours
the view expressed by Wright J. and the rule has been forcefully stated on more
than one occasion by Lord Goddard C.J. who expressed himself in the following
language in Harding v. Price[7]:

The general rule applicable to criminal
cases is actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea, and I venture to repeat what I
said in Brend v. Wood, (1946) 62 T.L.R. 462, 463: “It is of the utmost
importance for the protection of the liberty of the subject that a court should
always bear in mind that unless a statute either clearly or by necessary
implication rules out mens rea as a constituent part of a crime, the court
should not find a man guilty of an offence against the criminal law unless he
has a guilty mind”.

(See also Younghusband v. Luftig[8], and the decision of the Supreme
Court of Nova Scotia in Regina v. Jollimore[9] per Mr. Justice V.C. MacDonald
at p. 306 et seq.)

[Page 760]

This view has been adopted by this Court in
unmistakable terms in Beaver v. The Queen[10], where Cartwright J., speaking for
the majority of the Court at p. 538, adopted the following statement made by
Estey J. in Watts and Gaunt v. The Queen[11]:

While an offence of which mens rea is
not an essential ingredient may be created by legislation, in view of the
general rule a section creating an offence ought not to be so construed
unless Parliament has, by express language or necessary implication, disclosed
such an intention.

As there is no express language in s. 223  of the
Criminal Code  disclosing the intention of Parliament to rule out mens
rea as an essential ingredient of the crime therein described, it becomes
necessary to determine whether it can be said that such an intention is
disclosed by necessary implication.

In classifying the types of statute in which
such an intention has been implied, the learned authors, writing under the
title “Criminal Law and Procedure” in vol. 10 of Halsbury’s Laws of England,
3rd ed., at p. 275, adopt the three exceptions to the general rule which are
suggested by Wright J. in Sherras v. De Rutzen, supra, at p. 921 and
state:

Most statutes creating a strict liability
fall under three heads. First, where the acts are not criminal in any real
sense, but are prohibited under a penalty in the public interest. Secondly,
where the acts are public nuisances; thus, an employer has been held liable on
indictment for a nuisance caused by workmen without his knowledge and contrary
to his orders. Thirdly, where, although the proceeding is criminal in form, it
is really only a summary mode of enforcing a civil right.

Mr. Justice MacKay concluded that s. 223  of
the Criminal Code  comes within the first exception to the general rule
in that it is “an act perhaps not criminal in any real sense but which is in
the public interest prohibited”. He finds that:

A person whose ability to drive is impaired
by alcohol or drugs, driving on the highway, is a danger to the general public
and in my view the offence falls within the first classification referred to by
Wright J. in the Sherras case. It is an act perhaps not criminal in any
real sense but which is in the public interest prohibited.

I am, with respect, unable to agree that the
offence created by s. 223  is “perhaps not criminal in any real sense”. On the
contrary, it appears to me that if a person takes charge of a motor vehicle on
the highways of this country knowing that his ability to do so is impaired by
alcohol or

[Page 761]

a drug, he is doing an act which is not only
criminal in the sense of being punishable by the Criminal Code  but which
is also criminal in the “real sense” as those words were used by Wright J.
because such a driver must be taken to be aware that his impaired condition
constitutes a danger to the life, limb and safety of other users of the
highway, and the question of whether he acted knowingly or not, therefore, seems
to me to be all the more important.

It is to be observed also that when Wright J.
was referring to acts “which…are not criminal in any real sense,…” he was
referring to such things as the possession of liquorice by a beer retailer, the
possession of adulterated tobacco, the possession of game by a carrier and such
like matters, all of which are far removed from the offence of driving a
potentially highly dangerous machine when your ability to do so is impaired.

In my view the seriousness of the offence created
by s. 223  removes it entirely from the categories referred to by Wright J. and
this will be seen to be recognized by the mandatory provisions in s. 223 (b)
and (c) which provide for imprisonment for a second or subsequent
offence.

In the course of his decision in Beaver v.
The Queen, supra, at p. 542, Cartwright J. had occasion to observe that in
that case:

Counsel informed us that they have found no
other statutory provision which has been held to create a crime of strict
responsibility, that is to say, one in which the necessity for mens rea is
excluded, on conviction for which a sentence of imprisonment is mandatory.

No such statute has been referred to us in the
present case, and it appears to me that the nature of the penalty imposed by s.
223 (b) and (c) affords an indication that Parliament did
not intend to exclude mens rea as an essential ingredient of the offence
which it created.

It is, however, submitted on behalf of the
appellant that s. 223  ought to be construed to create an offence of absolute
liability on the ground that “the object of the legislation is patently to
protect the public from danger”, but I am unable to agree that the legislative
intention to protect the public from harm or danger can, of itself, provide an
exception to the general rule as to the existence of mens rea. If

[Page 762]

this were so, it would indeed encompass a wide
variety of criminal acts, for as Rand J. said in Lord’s Day Alliance v. Attorney-General for British Columbia[12]:

Undoubtedly criminal acts are those forbidden
by law, ordinarily at least if not necessarily accompanied by penal sanctions, enacted
to serve what is considered a public interest or to interdict what is deemed a
public harm or evil. (The italics are mine.)

In the course of his most interesting dissenting
opinion, MacKay J.A. refers to the decision of Dixon J. of the High Court of
Australia in Proudman v. Dayman[13].
The learned judge in that case was dealing with an offence against the Road
Traffic Act of South Australia which is a jurisdiction where no code of criminal law exists, and
he had occasion to say of the presumption as to the existence of mens rea as
an essential ingredient of crime:

The strength of the presumption that the
rule applies to a statutory offence newly created varies with the nature of the
offence and the scope of the statute. If the purpose of the statute is to add a
new crime to the general criminal law, it is natural to suppose that it is to
be read subject to the general principles according to which that law is administered.
But other considerations arise where in matters of police, of health, of safety
or the like the legislature adopts penal measures in order to cast on the
individual the responsibility of so conducting his affairs that the general
welfare will not be prejudiced.

In my view the enactment of s. 223  of the Criminal
Code  added a new crime to the general criminal law, and neither the
language in which it was enacted nor the evil which it was intended to prevent
are such as to give rise to a necessary implication that Parliament intended to
impose absolute liability unless the impaired condition which the
section prohibits was brought about by some conscious act of the will or
intention.

Consideration of this phase of the question
should not be concluded without noting the decision in Armstrong v. Clark[14], in which the Queen’s Bench
Division had to consider the question of

…whether the taking of insulin by the
respondent was, in the circumstances which occurred, to be regarded as taking a
drug which would make him liable to be found guilty of an offence under s.
15(1)…

of the Road Traffic Act, and in which
Lord Goddard said:

This case must go back with a direction
that the justices may take into account a great many things, but they must
remember, and everyone must remember, that this section was designed for
the protection of the

[Page 763]

public, and if people happen to be in a
condition of health that renders them subject to going into a coma, or forces
them to take remedies which may send them into a coma, the answer is that they
must not drive because they are a danger to the rest of Her Majesty’s subjects.

I do not think that anything that was said by
Lord Goddard in that case can be taken as changing the law with respect to mens
rea in statutory offences as it was stated by the same learned judge and
adopted by this Court in the cases hereinbefore referred to. It is noteworthy,
however, that in the course of this decision, Lord Goddard does make the
observation with respect to the statutory offence with which he was dealing:
“The penalty, I need hardly say, is entirely at the discretion of the bench.”

The existence of mens rea as an essential
ingredient of an offence and the method of proving the existence of that
ingredient are two different things, and I am of opinion that when it has been
proved that a driver was driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was
impaired by alcohol or a drug, then a rebuttable presumption arises that his
condition was voluntarily induced and that he is guilty of the offence created
by s. 223  and must be convicted unless other evidence is adduced which raises a
reasonable doubt as to whether he was, through no fault of his own, disabled
when he undertook to drive and drove, from being able to appreciate and know
that he was or might become impaired.

If the driver’s lack of appreciation when he
undertook to drive was induced by voluntary consumption of alcohol or of a drug
which he knew or had any reasonable ground for believing might cause him to be
impaired, then he cannot, of course, avoid the consequences of the impairment
which results by saying that he did not intend to get into such a condition,
but if the impairment has been brought about without any act of his own will,
then, in my view, the offence created by s. 223  cannot be said to have been
committed.

The existence of a rebuttable presumption that a
man intends the natural consequences of his own conduct is a part of our law,
but its application to any particular situation involves a consideration of
what consequences a man might be reasonably expected to foresee under the
circumstances.

[Page 764]

In the course of the lecture on “The Criminal
Law” which is contained in the well-known work by O.W. Holmes Jr. on the
“Common Law”, that learned author says:

As the purpose is to compel men to abstain
from dangerous conduct, and not merely to restrain them from evil inclinations,
the law requires them at their peril to know the teachings of common
experience, just as it requires them to know the law.

It seems to me that it can be taken as a matter
of “common experience” that the consumption of alcohol may produce intoxication
and, therefore, “impairment” in the sense in which that word is used in s. 223 ,
and I think it is also to be similarly taken to be known that the use of
narcotics may have the same effect, but if it appears that the impairment was
produced as a result of using a drug in the form of medicine on a doctor’s
order or recommendation and that its effect was unknown to the patient, then
the presumption is, in my view, rebutted.

For all the above reasons, I do not think that
the Court of Appeal erred in holding that mens rea was an essential
element of the offence of driving while impaired contrary to s. 223  of the Criminal
Code , but I am of opinion that that element need not necessarily be present
in relation both to the act of driving and to the state of being impaired in
order to make the offence complete. That is to say, that a man who becomes
impaired as the result of taking a drug on medical advice without knowing its
effect cannot escape liability if he became aware of his impaired condition
before he started to drive his car just as a man who did not appreciate his
impaired condition when he started to drive cannot escape liability on the
ground that his lack of appreciation was brought about by voluntary consumption
of liquor or drug. The defence in the present case was that the respondent
became impaired through no act of his own will and could not reasonably be
expected to have known that his ability was impaired or might thereafter become
impaired when he undertook to drive and drove his motor vehicle.

I would dismiss this appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA.

Criminal law—Appeal by way of stated case—Whether
questions of law raised—Whether necessary facts before the Court—Whether proper
procedure.

The appellant, who had been an employee of the respondent,
laid an information under The Employment Standards Act, 1957 (Man.), c.
20, charging that the respondent had unlawfully failed to pay him overtime
rates. When the matter came before the magistrate, he, without hearing any
evidence, ordered the charges dismissed on the grounds that the information was
for an offence which took place more than six months before the time when the
proceedings were commenced and that the information was void for duplicity and
could not be amended. On appeal by way of a stated case, the respondent moved
in the Court of Appeal, before any hearing on the merits, to dismiss the appeal
upon grounds that the stated case did not raise a question of law; that the

[Page 565]

stated case was defective in form in that it did not contain a
statement of facts sufficient to enable the Court to come to a decision of the
question of law; and that the appellant's proper procedure was not to appeal by
way of stated case but to move for a mandamus to compel the magistrate
to exercise his jurisdiction. By a majority decision the motion was allowed and
the stated case quashed. Pursuant to special leave, the appellant appealed to
this Court.

Held: The appeal should be allowed and the order of the
Court of Appeal set aside.

The rules of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba which prescribed
what was to be contained in a case stated under the Code were made by the
Judges of the Court of Appeal under the powers vested in them by the Code on
May 13, 1930. The case in the present matter complied with these requirements.

The points referred to in the stated case were matters of law
which had in fact been dealt with by way of written submissions to the
magistrate. Every fact necessary to decide the questions of law was before the
Court and the points of law were arguable upon the face of the information
itself. As to the objection that the proper procedure was not by way of stated
case but by mandamus to compel the magistrate to exercise his
jurisdiction, this was not the case of a magistrate declining to enter upon a
hearing because he was of the opinion that he had no jurisdiction, but one in
which, exercising his jurisdiction, he had dismissed the information on grounds
of law which appeared to him sufficient.

The motion to dismiss or quash the stated case, as it was
expressed, should have been dismissed and the questions of law, which were
clearly raised, determined.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba1, which dismissed an appeal from a
decision of Police Magistrate Kyle dismissing an information laid under The
Employment Standards Act, 1957 (Man.), c. 20. Appeal allowed.

D. Gibson, for the complainant, appellant.

G. A. Higenbottam, and R. B. Goodwin, for
the defendant, respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Locke J.:—This
is an appeal brought by special leave of this Court from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Manitoba2 which dismissed the appeal of the
present appellant from a decision of Police Magistrate Kyle of the Provincial
Police Court, dismissing an information laid against the respondent under the
provisions of The Employment Standards Act, 1957 (Man.), c. 20.

[Page 566]

At the request of the present appellant, the magistrate
stated a case under the provisions of s. 734  of the Criminal Code . The
respondent moved before the Court of Appeal to ""quash or dismiss the
appeal"" and it was upon this motion that the appeal to that Court was
dismissed and, accordingly, the questions of law propounded were not
considered.

Section 27 of The Employment Standards Act provides
that no employer shall require or permit an employee to work or be on duty for
more than 8 hours in a day and, if a male employee, for more than 48 hours in
any week unless in place of the rate of wages ordinarily paid the employer pays
him overtime rates for each hour in excess of these limits the employee is
required or permitted to work.

Section 14 declares, inter alia, that every person
who contravenes any provision of the Act is guilty of an offence and, if no
other penalty is by the Act provided, is liable on summary conviction to a
fine, in the case of an employer, of $500, and to imprisonment or to both. By
subs. (2), where the contravention continues for more than one day, the person
is guilty of a separate offence for each day that it continues.

Section 16(2) provides that in default of payment by an
employer of wages found to be due by him, the magistrate may issue his warrant
to levy the amount of the wages and costs by seizure and sale of the goods and
chattels of the employer.

Prosecutions for offences under this statute are subject to
the provisions of The Summary Convictions Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 254. By
s. 7 of that Act, Part XV of the Criminal Code  applies and, inter
alia, the present s. 693(2) . This provides that no proceedings may be
instituted more than six months after the time when the subject-matter of the
proceedings arose.

The information charges the respondent with having permitted
Dressier

to be on duty for more than eight hours on various days between
the 9th day of February, AD. 1959 and the 28th day of November, A.D. 1959; and
between the 6th day of April, A.D. 1960 and the 18th day of May, AX). 1960, did
(sic), on the 18th day of May AX). 1960, unlawfully fail to pay to the said
Walter Dressier, overtime rates for each hour or part of an hour in excess of
the said eight hours worked on the said days in place of the rate of wages
ordinarily paid to the said Walter Dressier, contrary to the provisions of the
Employment Standards' Act R.S.M. 1957, Chap. 20.

[Page 567]

The matter came before the magistrate on November 21, 1960,
and, without hearing any evidence, he ordered that the charges be dismissed on
the following grounds, namely that:

(1) The Information was defective in that it disclosed the occurrence
of an offence the subject matter of which took place in part more than six
months before the time that the proceedings were instituted

(2) The Information was void for duplicity and not capable
of being amended.

The respondent moved in the Court of Appeal, before any
hearing on the merits, to dismiss the appeal upon grounds only three of which
require consideration, namely, that the stated case did not raise a question of
law: that the stated case was defective in form in that it did not contain a
statement of facts sufficient to enable the Court to come to a decision of the
question of law: and that the appellant's proper procedure was not to appeal by
way of stated case but to move for a mandamus to compel the magistrate
to exercise his jurisdiction.

The learned Chief Justice of Manitoba, with whom Schultz and
Guy JJ.A. agreed, considered that the stated case was defective in not
disclosing that the dismissal was made on preliminary objections without
hearing evidence: that the facts upon which the magistrate based his ruling
that the information was void for duplicity and not capable of being amended
were not set out in the case as stated: that while reference was made to the
information the case did not state what evidence was offered by way of admission
of facts or otherwise to contradict or support the charges made and that there
was not a sufficient disclosure of the grounds upon which the magistrate based
his decision. Accordingly, he considered that the stated case should be
quashed. The learned Chief Justice, while mentioning an objection raised that
the stated case should not have been entitled ""In the Court of
Appeal"", considered that it was unnecessary to deal with it.

In the dissenting judgment of Tritschler J.A. (now
C.J.Q.B.), with whom Freedman J.A. agreed, there is a résumé of the contents of
certain affidavits filed before the Court of Appeal by the parties which
described what had taken place before the magistrate and the manner in which
the stated case had been approved before being signed by him and its terms are
stated in extenso.

[Page 568]

The rules of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba which
prescribe what is to be contained in a case stated under the Code were made by
the Judges of the Court of Appeal under the powers vested in them by the Code
on May 13, 1930 (see the Canada Gazette, June 7, 1930, vol. 63, p. 4464). The
case in the present matter, in my opinion, complies with these requirements.

Dealing with the objections advanced in the respondent's
motion to the Court, Tritschler J.A. said in part:

As to ground 1, that the stated case does not raise a
question of law: Defendant's counsel submits that what the magistrate decided
were questions of fact; it was a matter of knowing the calendar and applying
simple mathematics; he had only to count back from August 15, 1960. the date of
the information, to certain dates mentioned in the information or to count
forward from those dates to August 15 and see if the period exceeded 6 months;
if there was an error it was an error of calculation; as to the alleged
duplicity of the information, it was simply a question of counting the charges
and if there was an error it was a mistake of counting. I found it difficult to
believe, and still do, that these submissions could be seriously put forward.
The points involved were matters of law which had in fact been dealt with by
way of written submissions to the magistrate by solicitors for both sides. The
complainant's position as outlined in his factum to us is: that the six months'
limitation period is not applicable because the Legislature has ""otherwise
specially provided"" (The Summary Convictions Act, R.S.M. 1954, Cap. 254,
Sec. 7); that employment at overtime is not an offence but the offence is
failure to pay for overtime; the offence takes place at termination of
employment if overtime wages are left outstanding; sec. 14(2) of The Employment
Standards Act makes the non-payment for overtime a continuing offence; if the
six months' limitation was applicable and part of the offence took place six
months prior to the date of the information, the magistrate should not have
dismissed the information but should have allowed recovery in respect of that
part of the wages claimed which were earned and not paid within a period of six
months before the date of the information; there was one offence and not two
and it occurred on May 18, 1960; in any event the magistrate had the right
under sec. 704 of the Code to permit amendment.

And again:

Every fact necessary to decide the questions of law is
before the Court. As appears from what has been said under the head of ground
1, the points of law are arguable upon the face of the information itself. The
learned Magistrate's question (i) raises the issue whether ""the
Information was defective in that it disclosed"", etc. The only fact
necessary here is the Information itself, which is fully set out in the case.
Question (ii) raises the issue whether the Information was void for duplicity.
Here again the Information is the only fact required. Obviously what the learned
Magistrate said is that, looking at the Information alone, he could see
duplicity in it; that it showed duplicity on its face. No amount of facts other
that the Information could be relevant here. Whether the Information was
capable of amendment is pure law.

[Page 569]

As to the objection that the proper procedure was not by way
of stated case but by mandamus to compel the magistrate to exercise his
jurisdiction, he pointed out that this was not the case of a magistrate
declining to enter upon a hearing because he was of the opinion that he had no
jurisdiction, but one in which, exercising his jurisdiction, he had dismissed
the information on grounds of law which appeared to him sufficient.

With these conclusions I agree and, with the greatest
respect for the contrary opinion of the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba, I
consider that the motion of the respondent to dismiss or quash the stated case,
as it was expressed, should have been dismissed and the questions of law, which
appear to me to be clearly raised, determined.

If it were the opinion of the Court that any clearer
statement of the questions of law to be determined was required, the proper
course, in my opinion, was to send the case back to the magistrate for
amendment and to deliver judgment after it had been amended under the powers
contained in s. 740  of the Criminal Code .

I would allow this appeal and set aside the order of the
Court of Appeal with costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal, to be paid
by the respondent to the appellant in any event of the appeal forthwith after
taxation.

Appeal allowed, the order of the Court of
Appeal set aside and the matter returned to that Court to be dealt with on the
merits. Respondent to pay in any event costs in this Court and costs in the
Court of Appeal.

The reasons for judgment of
Locke J., who retired from the bench on September 16, 1962, were handed down by

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Conviction for
counterfeiting—Monies in possession of accused at time of arrest filed as
exhibits—Disappearance of monies from registry—Application for return of
exhibits or equivalent sum—Alternative claim a claim to recover monies from
Crown—Proceedings to be initiated by petition of right—Crown's liability to be
first determined by Supreme Court of the province.

The respondent was convicted on charges of counterfeiting. At
the time of his arrest he had in his possession two envelopes, each of which
was said to contain a specified amount of American currency, and the envelopes
said to contain these monies were filed as exhibits at the trial. After his
conviction they remained in the custody of the registrar of the Court, but
later they disappeared from the registry. An application for an order that the
money exhibits be returned to the respondent or alternatively that a sum of
money equivalent in value to the said money exhibits be paid to the respondent
in lieu of the return of the money exhibits was dismissed. On appeal, the Court
of Appeal held that the appeal should be allowed and an order made that the
money exhibits be returned to the respondent. By leave of this Court the Crown
appealed from that judgment.

Held: The appeal should be allowed.

The alternative claim advanced was a claim to recover monies
from the Crown. The Court of Appeal dealt with the matter on the footing that
the monies were then in the custody of the registrar, whereas there were no
such monies. Since this was made known to the Court in a report made by the County
Court judge and was common ground between the parties, the proper construction
to be placed upon the judgment was that it constituted an award against the
Crown in favour of the respondent in the amount stated. The respondent's
remedy, if any, was by proceedings initiated by petition of right under the
provisions of the Crown Procedure Act. The question of the Crown's
liability must first have been determined by the Supreme Court of the province
before the Court of Appeal acquired jurisdiction to deal with the matter. The
order dismissing the application should therefore be restored upon the ground
that the County Court was without jurisdiction to deal with the money claim
made against the Crown.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], setting aside an order of Remnant C.C.J. Appeal
allowed.

[Page 4]

W. G. Burke-Robertson,
Q.C., for the appellant.

H. Rankin, for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

LOCKE J.:—This is an appeal
brought by leave granted by this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia[2] setting
aside an order made by His Honour Judge Remnant in the County Court of
Vancouver and directing that a sum of $3,275 in American funds, or the
equivalent thereof in Canadian funds, be paid to the respondent.

The respondent Doig was on April 25, 1957,
found guilty in the County Court Judge's Criminal Court of Vancouver of four
charges of counterfeiting and conspiracy to counterfeit and sentenced to four
years' imprisonment. At the time of his arrest he had in his possession two
envelopes, one of which was said to contain $2,200 in American currency and the
second $1,075 of such currency, and the envelopes said to contain these monies
were filed as exhibits at his trial. After his conviction they remained in the
custody of the registrar of the Court.

Following the release of Doig
from the penitentiary, his solicitor served a notice on counsel for the Crown
which was entitled ""In the County Court Judge's Criminal Court In the
Matter of Regina vs. William Thomas Alexander Doig"" and which stated that
an application would be made before the judge in chambers on September 19,
1960, for an order

that the money exhibits in
the criminal case of Regina vs. Doig, number 31/57 be returned to the Defendant.

This application was supported by
an affidavit of Mr. Lawrence E. Hill, the solicitor for Doig, which stated, inter
alia, that he had been advised by the registrar that:

the original money exhibit
is no longer within the custody of the said Registrar, the said original
exhibit having disappeared from the said Registry and that whatever disposition
is made of the monies hereinbefore referred to it will be necessary that the
Province of British Columbia replace the said monies with an equivalent amount.

Thereafter, a notice dated
October 3, 1960, was served by the solicitor for Doig informing the Crown that:

the application will be for
an Order directing that the money exhibits in the criminal case of Regina vs.
Doig be returned to the Defendant or alternatively that a sum of money
equivalent in value to the said money exhibits be paid to the Defendant in lieu
of the return of the said money exhibits.

[Page 5]

While the amended notice did not
say in terms that what was proposed was an order against the Crown to pay the
missing monies, it is common ground that this was the relief sought.

The learned County Court judge
dismissed the application and while no written reasons were given at the time,
when the appeal was taken by Doig from the order the learned judge made a
report to the Court of Appeal, stated to be made pursuant to s. 588(1)  of the Criminal
Code , in which it was said that all the monies were proved to be the
proceeds of the criminal activities of Doig and that they should remain in
custody of the Court. The report concluded by stating that the fact that the
money had disappeared from the registry was beside the point.

The formal order dismissing the
application was entitled ""In the County Court Judge's Criminal Court""
and the style of cause was ""Regina vs. William Thomas Alexander Doig.""

The judgment delivered by the
learned Chief Justice of British Columbia did not mention the fact that the
monies were missing. After saying that it had been agreed by counsel on the
hearing of the appeal that it had not been established that the money had been
obtained by the commission of the offence for which the appellant had been
convicted, he said:

It is clear as a result of
the foregoing that the question here and the order appealed from affect a right
to property in the custody of the County Court in respect of which there is no
applicable provisions of the Criminal Code . The order sought by the appellant
is not one to be made or refused under the criminal jurisdiction of the County
Court. This Court, in my opinion, has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal and
the motion of the Crown to quash should be denied.

After referring to authorities
indicating that monies taken from an accused person, unless they are shown to
have been obtained by the commission of an offence, should be returned to him,
the learned Chief Justice said:

This Court has jurisdiction
to make the order that should have been made in the Court below, the appeal
should be allowed and an order made that the money be paid out to the
appellant.

The style of cause in the formal
judgment entered in the Court of Appeal was ""Regina,
Respondent, William Thomas Alexander Doig, Appellant."" After stating that
the appeal was allowed, the judgment reads:

and the said money exhibits
amounting to Three Thousand Two Hundred and Seventy-five dollars in American
funds or the equivalent thereof in Canadian funds are hereby ordered returned
to the appellant.

[Page 6]

It will be seen from the
foregoing that the matter has been treated in both Courts as if the monies in
question were in the hands of the proper official of the Court, the registrar,
presumably as a servant of the Crown. While, as I have pointed out, it was
known to the parties before the matter came before the learned County Court
judge that the monies were missing, the solicitor for the present respondent,
while appreciating that he could not obtain the form of relief sought in the
original notice of motion, failed to appreciate that the alternative claim
advanced was a claim to recover monies from the Crown.

If there was any basis for such a
claim, presumably it would be for damages for conversion or for negligence of
some servant of the Crown. In whatever form the claim might have been advanced,
the matter would be governed by the provisions of the Crown Procedure Act,
R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 89, and the Court having jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of
British Columbia, if a fiat were obtained from the Lieutenant-Governor in
Council, and the proceedings would be by petition of right.

This aspect of the matter does
not appear to have been drawn to the attention of the learned County Court
judge who treated the application as if it were made in the criminal
proceedings against the respondent which had been terminated years before. The
appeal to the Court of Appeal which was brought by leave was not one under Part
18 of the Criminal Code  and s. 588(1) , requiring a report by the judge
in appeals and applications for leave to appeal taken under that part, was
inapplicable.

In the judgment of the Court of
Appeal it was pointed out that the order sought was not one to be made or
refused in the exercise of the criminal jurisdiction of the County Court.
However, that judgment, with great respect, dealt with the matter on the
footing that the monies were then in the custody of the registrar, whereas
there were no such monies.

Since this was made known to the
Court in the report made by the County Court judge and was common ground
between the parties, the proper construction to be placed upon the judgment is,
in my opinion, that it constitutes an award against the Crown in favour of the
respondent in the amount stated.

[Page 7]

Claims of this nature against the
Crown may not be established in proceedings initiated by notice of motion in
the County Court. As I have pointed out, the respondent's remedy, if any, was
by proceedings initiated by petition of right under the provisions of the Crown
Procedure Act. The question of the Crown's liability must first have been
determined by the Supreme Court of the province before the Court of Appeal
acquired jurisdiction to deal with the matter.

The appeal should be allowed with
costs and the order dismissing the application be restored upon the ground that
the County Court was without jurisdiction to deal with the money claim made
against the Crown. The dismissal should be without prejudice to any claims the
respondent may be advised to make in the matter in proceedings properly
constituted.

Appeal allowed and the
order dismissing the application restored.

appellant: George L. Murray, Vancouver.

respondent: Lawrence E. Hill, Vancouver.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Evidence—Circumstantial
evidence—Corruption—Trial—Charge to jury—Whether s. 110(1)(b) of Criminal Code 
requires proof of intent—Correct application of “rule in Hodge’s case”—Whether
jury misled as to need for proof beyond reasonable doubt—Whether judge erred in
using words not found in s. 110(1) (b) to describe the offence—Criminal Code , s.
110(1) (b).

Respondent was charged with conferring a
benefit on a Government employee with respect to dealings which respondent had
with the Government contrary to s. 110(1) (b) of the Criminal Code . The
procedure adopted at the trial was unusual in that the case for the Crown was
composed entirely of a statement of facts agreed to by both Crown and defence
counsel. Respondent at the material times controlled and managed a number of
companies and applied to the Department of Regional Economic Expansion for
grants in respect of two of these companies of which he was president. These
grants were approved and contracts entered into by the companies and the
federal government, the latter being represented in one contract by the
Director of the Special Analysis Group of the Department and in the other by
his immediate superior. The Director, McK had met the respondent around the
time when the applications were made and had spent two week-ends in Florida as his guest before the contracts
were signed and two more week-ends shortly thereafter. Taken together the
agreed facts disclosed that benefits had accrued to McK and constituted an
admission that certain benefits were conferred by respondent on a government
employee. Respondent then adduced evidence in an attempt to show that the
benefits were not conferred “with respect” to the dealings that respondent had
with the government employee’s department, an essential element of the offence.
In his charge to the jury the trial judge directed them in accordance with the
rule in Hodge’s Case, (1838) 2 Lewin in 227, 168 E.R. 1136. After
objection by Crown counsel on the basis of R. v. Mitchell, [1964]
S.C.R. 471, that Hodge’s Case had no application to a

[Page 861]

case turning upon the intention of the
accused, the jury were recalled and re-instructed in effect to disregard the
rule in Hodge’s Case and to decide the issue on the basis of reasonable
doubt. The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial on the basis that the trial
judge had erred in withdrawing the rule in Hodge’s Case from the jury.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Judson and Dickson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: The present case is almost the exact
converse of Hodge’s Case. In the latter there was no doubt that a crime
had been committed and the only question for the jury was whether the accused
was the person who had committed it; whereas in this case there is no doubt
that the respondent was the person who conferred the benefits and the only
question is whether he intended them to be benefits conferred with
respect to his dealings with the Government, such intent being a necessary
element of the offence charged under s. 110(1) (b). The trial judge was
right in correcting himself to the effect that Hodge’s Case did not
apply and in recharging the jury accordingly. There was nothing exceptionable
in the recharge which adequately covered the principle of reasonable doubt and
contained nothing to indicate that the rule in Hodge’s Case, where it
applies, does not contain a formula to assist in applying the accepted standard
of proof nor to suggest that the formula does not afford a graphic illustration
of the principle in such cases.

Although respondent submitted alternatively
that the trial judge had erred in charging the jury that they should find
respondent guilty if they were satisfied that the benefits were conferred directly
or indirectly in relation to the dealings with the Government when
the words “directly” or “indirectly” did not occur in s. 110(1) (b), this
error did not justify quashing the conviction.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Judson and Dickson JJ. dissenting: This case turns entirely on
the inference to be drawn from undisputed facts as to the accused’s intention.
Under s. 110(1)(b) the words are “with respect to those dealings”; that
is, there can be no conviction unless it is shown beyond reasonable doubt that
benefits were conferred “with respect to” the dealings with the government as
alleged. The trial judge’s charge and recharge were confusing and a lay jury
was unlikely to

[Page 862]

have had the clear view that it should have
on the applicable law. Recent doubts have been cast, in England and in Canada,
as to the inexorability of the formula in Hodge’s Case and although a
judge might refer to that case, the traditional formula requiring proof beyond
reasonable doubt is the safest and simplest way to bring a lay jury to the
appreciation of the burden of proof resting on the Crown in criminal cases.

The use of the words “directly or indirectly”
could not but have the effect of qualifying the element of intent adversely to
the accused so as to direct the jury to a wider scope of the offence than that
which is defined in s. 110(1)(b). It was a clear error in law justifying
a new trial.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], quashing a
conviction, by Graburn Co. Ct. J. with a jury, of unlawfully conferring a
benefit on a Government employee contrary to s. 110(1)  of the Criminal Code .
Appeal allowed, Laskin C.J. and Judson and Dickson JJ. dissenting.

D.H. Doherty, for the appellant.

J.J. Robinette, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Judson and
Dickson JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—I have had
the advantage of reading the reasons of my brother Ritchie, and they lead me to
take two points, both of which bring me to a conclusion different from his.
This is a case which turns entirely on the inference to be drawn as to the
accused’s intent from the undisputed facts of the relationship between the
accused and McKendry, arising out of the former’s applications for government
grants.

[Page 863]

There was, admittedly, no taint, no impropriety
in the grants themselves; approval for them was given on the merits of the
applications. On the other hand, there was no doubt too that the accused had
conferred benefits upon McKendry, who was the government official with whom
negotiations for the grants took place.

Under s. 110(1)(b) of the Criminal
Code  the key question of intent is raised by the words “with respect to
those dealings”. In short, before there can be a conviction under s. 110(1)(b)
of a person who, having dealings with the government, confers a benefit upon a
government employee with whom he deals, it must be shown, by way of proof
beyond a reasonable doubt, that the benefit was conferred “with respect to
those dealings”.

As my brother Ritchie noted, the trial was
unusual in that the Crown made its case by putting in an agreed statement of
facts. Many witnesses were called for the accused, including McKendry and the
accused himself. In charging the jury on the issues in the case, it was of
course necessary for the trial judge to ask them to consider all the
circumstances touching the dealings with McKendry, which included the four
Florida trips for which the accused paid, and the explanations given by the
witnesses, and especially by the accused and by McKendry, about how those trips
came about, whether their timing alone was sinister, and whether they were a
spontaneous result of an association which revealed a common interest in horses
or were offered and accepted with respect to the dealings then on foot between
the accused and McKendry. Since the evidence on the question of intent could
only come from the defence witnesses in this case and was circumstantial only,
the trial judge charged the jury in terms of the so-called rule in Hodge’s case.
After the charge, when counsel were invited, as is usual, to state any
objections that they had to it, Crown counsel adverted to the judgment of this
Court in The

[Page 864]

Queen v. Mitchell[2], and contended that the trial judge should
not have charged in terms of Hodge’s case on the question of intent.
Thereupon the trial judge recalled the jury and said this on the question of
circumstantial evidence:

It has been brought to my attention, ladies
and gentlemen, that I was clearly wrong in my charge to you, as a matter of
law, because that particular rule which I gave to you this morning about having
to find the circumstances consistent with guilt and inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion does not apply when we are talking about things like
intent, or we are talking about things like the purpose. It does apply as to an
act.

In other words, if we are trying to
determine whether such-and-such an act was done, such-and-such a physical act
was done, then the rule I indicated to you is applicable, but when we are
talking about intent, purpose, things in a man’s mind, that rule does not
apply. That is clear, and that matter has been pointed out to you, so I was
wrong giving you the example about circumstantial evidence, and I was wrong to
charge you about circumstantial evidence at all. And I ask you, and you must
disregard in your deliberations the charge I gave you in relation to
circumstantial evidence.

In all other respects, what I indicated to
you is correct so far as counsel are concerned, and hopefully so far as I am
concerned.

The reference back to the charge as originally
given, coupled with the portion of the recharge just quoted leads me to
conclude, as the Ontario Court of Appeal concluded, albeit for different
reasons, that an order for a new trial was the proper order in this case, and
particularly so in the light of the second point that I take in relation to the
charge, as discussed later in these reasons. Sitting as we are in calm
contemplation of the issues and of the judge’s charge and recharge, I still
find his entire exercise confusing, and I cannot believe that a lay jury would
have the clear view it should have on the law by which it should be guided when
confronted with the passages I have quoted after

[Page 865]

having been so categorically charged otherwise
earlier in the proceedings.

There are a few observations I would make on Hodge’s
case specifically. Intent is no less a question of fact than is identity or
the actus reus
of an offence. I would not condone a situation
where a trial judge may properly charge a jury under Hodge’s case in
respect of identity, and all other issues except intent, and then in the same
case tell them to approach the Crown’s burden of proof on a different basis on
the question of intent. There must be consistency in a charge where burden of
proof is concerned; and to have two different formulae in one case is as unjust
to the Crown as it is to an accused.

The judgment of the House of Lords in McGreevy
v. Director of Public Prosecutions[3]
rejects the notion that there ever was any rule arising from Hodge’s case
which judges in England were
required to follow where all or most of the evidence in a jury trial was
circumstantial. In Comba v. The King[4], this Court referred to the formula in Hodge’s
case as “the long settled rule of the common law which is the rule of law
in Canada” (at p. 397).
Notwithstanding this pronouncement, this Court attenuated the rule in its
judgment in The Queen v. Mitchell, supra, and manifested its
discomfort with Hodge’s case in Alec John v. The Queen[5]. The time has come to reject the forumula
in Hodge’s case as an inexorable rule of law in Canada. Without being dogmatic against any use of the formula of the
charge in Hodge’s case I would leave the matter to the good sense of the
trial judge (as was said in McGreevy), with the reminder that a charge
in terms of the traditional formula of required proof beyond a reasonable doubt
is the safest as well as the simplest way to bring a lay jury to the
appreciation of the burden of proof resting on the

[Page 866]

Crown in a criminal case.

The second point I take arises from the error of
the trial judge, a clear error in my opinion, in telling the jury that if they
found that the benefit conferred on any one occasion “was related in whole or
in part, directly or indirectly, to Cooper’s dealings with the government” they
must find the accused guilty. The offence under which the accused was charged
does not use the words “directly or indirectly” in defining it; those words are
used in the definition of two other offences, described respectively in s.
110(1)(a) and in s. 110(1)(c). Not only did the trial judge
originally charge the jury in that erroneous way several times, but in his
recharge he repeated the error, again telling the jury that they could convict
if they found beyond a reasonable doubt that benefits “were conferred by the
accused in McKendry in relation to the dealings with the government, in whole
or in part, directly or indirectly so far as Cooper was concerned”.

In my opinion, the use of the words “directly or
indirectly” could not but have the effect of qualifying the element of intent
adversely to the accused so as to direct the jury to a wider scope of the
offence than that which is defined in s. 110(1)(b). It is patent to me
that if the accused had been tried under s. 110(1)(a), and the jury had
been charged in words which omitted the reference in that provision to
“directly or indirectly” and had acquitted, there would be every reason to
order a new trial on the ground of an error of law. Equally, there should be a
new trial here where added words were used to describe the offence in terms
wider than its definition, especially when the charge was also unsatisfactory
on the other ground discussed herein.

I would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Beetz and de
Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought by the
Attorney General of Ontario with leave of this

[Page 867]

Court, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of
that Province quashing the conviction entered against the respondent at a trial
held before His Honour Judge Graburn sitting with a jury, for the offence of
unlawfully conferring a benefit on a Government employee with respect to
dealings with the Government contrary to s. 110(1) (b) of the Criminal
Code  which provides that:

110. (1)
Every one commits an offence who 

(b) having dealings of any kind with
the government, pays a commission or reward to or confers an advantage or
benefit of any kind upon an employee or official of the government with which
he deals, or to any member of his family, or to any one for the benefit of the
employee or official, with respect to those dealings, unless he has the consent
in writing of the head of the branch of government with which he deals, the
proof of which lies upon him;…

The procedure adopted at the trial before His
Honour Judge Graburn was unusual in that the case for the Crown was composed
entirely of a statement of facts agreed to by both counsel for the Crown and
counsel for the accused (the respondent). By order of the presiding judge this
statement of facts was not marked as an exhibit in the case and was not
available to the jury with the result that it was not before us in this appeal
and the facts must accordingly be garnered from the opening address of the
Crown Prosecutor which purports to incorporate all that was agreed upon.

The facts so stated with which counsel for the
respondent expressed his total agreement are partially summarized in the
reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal where Mr. Justice Arnup stated:

These facts are briefly as follows. At all
material times the appellant (i.e. Cooper) directly or indirectly
controlled and managed a number of companies; two of these companies of which
the appellant was president were Jacques Cartier Mint Inc. (Jacques Cartier)
and Silver Shields Mines Inc. (Silver Shields). The former company was
incorporated in January, 1972, for the purpose of operating a private mint. The
latter was incorporated in June, 1971 and was a mining company with interests
in various properties in the area of Cobalt, Ontario. Both companies were based at Toronto.

[Page 868]

In late February and the first week of
March, 1972, both Jacques Cartier and Silver Shields, under the guidance of the
appellant, applied to the federal Department of Regional and Economic Expansion
(DREE) for economic grants under The Regional Development Incentives Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. R-3 . Generally speaking, this Act, which is administered by DREE,
provides for grants to applicants proposing to establish new production
facilities in what are referred to as ‘designated regions’.

Jacques Cartier sought a grant to assist it
in establishing a mint for the purpose of manufacturing silver medallions and
commemorative items. Silver Shields sought a grant for the purpose of
rehabilitating and modernizing a silver refinery. Both applications related to
the Cobalt area of Ontario,
which was a designated region.

Both applications were duly received and
processed by DREE and were eventually approved. Jacques Cartier was awarded a
grant of $617,000 and Silver Shields was awarded a grant of $119,970. On April
5, 1972, formal contracts with respect to the grants were entered by the
Federal Government (DREE) and the respective companies. It is agreed that the
viability of the projects is not relevant to these proceedings.

At all material times, Gerald William
McKendry was employed by the federal government, in DREE, as a director of the
Special Analysis Group. McKendry was thus an ‘employee of the government’
within the meaning of section 110(1) (b) of The Criminal Code .

On March 3, 1972, McKendry travelled to Ocala, Florida, with the appellant and
spent the weekend on the appellant’s ranch, returning to Toronto on March 5, 1972.

On March 17, 1972, McKendry and the
appellant, this time accompanied by their wives, again travelled by plane to Ocala, Florida. Mr. and Mrs. McKendry spent the evening of March 17 and part of
March 18 at the appellant’s ranch and returned to Toronto on March 19, 1972.

Again, on April 7, 1972, Mr. McKendry
accompanied the appellant to Florida and spent the weekend on the appellant’s ranch.

Finally, Mr. and Mrs. McKendry and another
couple accompanied the appellant and his wife to their ranch in Florida for the weekend of May 5, 1972, to May 7, 1972.

With respect to each of the above mentioned
four trips from Toronto to Florida, travel arrangements were

[Page 869]

made by or on behalf of the appellant, and
the cost of the various return flights from Toronto to Tampa were in
each case eventually paid for by cheques drawn on the account of Newtor
Holdings Ltd., a private investment and management company owned and controlled
by the appellant. No amount was received by the appellant from McKendry with
respect to the repayment of the travel costs, but an account receivable was
opened on the books of Newtor Holdings Ltd., relating to the costs of the trip
of March 17, 1972.

The agreed statement of facts also discloses
that the contract for the Jacques Cartier grant of $617,000 was signed on
behalf of the Government by Mr. James Smart who was the Executive Director of
the Industrial Incentive Branch in DREE and was McKendry’s direct superior
while the $119,970 contract with Silver Shields Mines was signed for the
Government by McKendry himself.

I think it important also to note that Cooper
and McKendry first met on February 29, 1972 and that, according to McKendry,
their meeting had been arranged for the purpose of discussing whether Cooper’s
proposals would be eligible for a DREE grant. Mr. McKendry put it this way:

Mr. Cooper was interested in one matter
primarily, and that is this: would his project for Cobalt be eligible under the
R.D.I. Act to be eligible for incentive assistance through DREE.

I will consider hereafter at greater length the
evidence given by McKendry and Cooper as to their relationship, but there is no
dispute about the date or purpose of their first meeting and I think that the
jury was entitled to view it in the context of McKendry’s first trip to the
Cooper ranch in Florida three days later and the signing of the substantial
DREE grant contracts exactly one month after his return (April 5th), having
regard also to the fact that Mr. and Mrs. McKendry had spent at least two
days there (March 17th, 18th) at Cooper’s expense during the same month.

Referring to the various trips taken by McKendry
at Cooper’s expense, counsel for the respondent, in my opinion, put the whole
issue very clearly to the jury when he said in closing:

[Page 870]

Well, the issue remains at the end what it
was at the beginning, and that is, whether or not the benefits that were
conferred were benefits with respect to the transactions that were taking place
with DREE; that is the issue in this case.

In considering the direct evidence contained in
the agreed statement of facts bearing on this important issue, the following
passages from that statement which relate to the air tickets for the trip of
March 17th appear to me to be relevant:

The cost of these McKendry tickets was
charged to the account of The Jacques Cartier Mint, which was in the books of
Newtor Holdings Ltd. And you heard me say that The Jacques Cartier Mint was
incorporated in January of 1972, and the accounts were being handled in Newtor
Holdings and there was an account there headed ‘Jacques Cartier Mint,’ and the
McKendry tickets were charged to that account.

The statement also contains the following
passage relating to the same trip:

These tickets were paid for, as indicated,
by cheque of Newtor Holdings; Mr. Fred Munger issued the cheque. And in the
case of the McKendry tickets, the $378 charged to The Jacques Cartier Mint
account, and in the books of Newtor Holdings and subsequently Mr. Munger opened
an account with the heading of ‘Receivable from G. McKendry,’ and debited the
account in the amount of $378. So that on the second trip it was originally set
up in the books of Newtor Holdings as being attributable to Mr. and Mrs.
McKendry, but then subsequently an account was opened indicating it was
receivable from Mr. McKendry in that amount. But that account, I believe there
is agreement, was never paid.

It will be seen that the $378 benefit which
accrued to McKendry was initially charged to the Jacques Cartier Mint account
on the books of Cooper’s “private investment and management company” and
although the amount at some subsequent date was debited to an account entitled
“Receivable from G. McKendry”, no money was ever received from this source and
the fact remains that the Jacques Cartier Mint Inc., was one of the companies
in respect of which Cooper was then seeking and ultimately received a DREE
grant, and I think that the admission contained in the last-quoted paragraph is
at least open to the construction that at the time when the benefit was
conferred, it was treated as being a disbursement

[Page 871]

in respect of that company’s dealings with the
government through McKendry.

There was no suggestion here, as there was in
the case of R. v. Paul[6], that a
prima facie case had not been made out by the prosecution and the agreed
statement of facts, in my opinion, clearly discloses evidence from which a
properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, could have drawn the inference
that the respondent was guilty of conferring a benefit on a government employee
with respect to dealings with the government without having the consent in
writing of the head of the branch of government with which he was dealing. This
position was clearly recognized by counsel for the defence as is evidenced by
the following passage from his address to the jury:

Now, if there was no defence evidence
called, if there wasn’t a jot of evidence called by the defence at the
conclusion of the case for the Crown, the agreed-upon set of facts, you would
have to ask, “Why were the trips made?” And you might have come to the
conclusion they were only made for one purpose; and that is somehow for the
trips to tie in in some way with respect to the grant. And it is for this
reason, because that’s the inference that you might draw, that an attempt was
made by the defence to outline to you in every detail that it could what took
place, why it took place, and who was there.

The defence called fifteen witnesses, the most
important of whom were McKendry and the respondent himself. The obvious purpose
of this evidence was to explain that although the benefits were conferred, they
were not conferred in respect of dealings with the government, but rather were
the product of a new-found and rapidly maturing friendship between McKendry and
Cooper which started on the day when they met to discuss new business and grew
through a mutual interest in horses.

McKendry’s evidence disclosed that after his
first meeting with Cooper in his office, the two men walked over to lunch at
the Chateau Laurier and it was during this walk that the subject of horses was
first discussed between them. The conversation, as McKendry recounts it,
developed into

[Page 872]

a discussion of Cooper’s ranch in Florida and some matched horses which he
had for sale. The following sequence of events is then described by McKendry:

He said, “I commute back and forth every
weekend to my home,” and he said, “If you want to come down some weekend, that
would be great”. I said, “When are you going next?” He said, “Pretty well every
weekend; I’ll give you a call in the next day or two and see if you are free
for this weekend”. I said, “Fine; I would want my wife to come. One horse would
be for me and one horse would be for my wife, and you can’t buy a horse for
your wife; she has to see it”. He said “Fine, she can come.”

So he phoned me in a day or two and he
said, “I’m going down this weekend; can you come?” I said, I can, but Tia can’t;
she’s working this weekend and can’t get off, and she said for me to go ahead
and if I like them she’ll come later.”

The immediate result of this conversation was
McKendry’s first free trip to the Cooper ranch.

Cooper tells much the same story except that he
does not think that he invited McKendry to his ranch on the first occasion
because as he says, “I don’t believe I would have done it that spontaneously”.

The explanation given of the second trip is that
it was arranged so that McKendry and his wife could both see the horses which
he was contemplating purchasing. These two trips, which were made while the
grants to Mr. Cooper’s companies were still being negotiated, appear to me to
be of more significance than the last two visits to Florida which took place
after the contracts has been signed. The first of these later trips (April 7th)
is explained by Cooper and McKendry as having to do with McKendry obtaining a
manager for Cooper’s ranch in Florida, while the second (May 3rd) is said to
have been made because Cooper wanted to discuss with McKendry an offer to
become the President of Jacques Cartier Mint Inc. I agree with the Court of
Appeal that the evidence relating to these last two trips is admissible, but as
I have indicated, I think that the benefits received

[Page 873]

during the course of the negotiations for the
grants is the more significant.

Counsel for the prosecution appears to me to
have accurately reviewed the statement of agreed facts in the following
paragraphs of his opening address:

So those are the facts as they are agreed
upon, and you will note that there are four trips to Florida that are involved;
the two involving Mr. McKendry alone, as far as the charge is concerned, and
two involving Mr. and Mrs. McKendry. And I think the benefits would total up to
nearly twelve hundred dollars for those four trips.

Also, there is no reference to the fact that Mr.
and Mrs. McKendry ever paid anything for these tickets to Mr. Cooper or to any
of the companies involved. So then it would appear that the situation is that
there was, I think it would go without saying, and in any circumstances the
trip to Florida on these four
occasions would be a benefit; I don’t think there’s any dispute about that. It
was a benefit provided through Mr. Cooper, or through one of Mr. Cooper’s
companies, it was conferred on Mr. McKendry, who was an official of DREE, and
it was conferred at the time that Mr. Cooper was having dealings with the
Canadian Government, in particular with that branch of the Canadian Government.

After having weighed this evidence in light of
the explanation given by Cooper and McKendry, the jury found the respondent to
be guilty as charged, but the Court of Appeal for Ontario quashed this conviction and directed a new trial on the ground that
there were serious misdirections in the trial judge’s charge to the jury. Judge
Graburn’s charge initially contained the following direction with respect to
circumstantial evidence:

If you find those to be the facts of these
circumstances, you might say a rational inference is, or the circumstances are
consistent with the conclusion, that Cooper invited McKendry to Florida in
relation to the DREE grant, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly.

In this case circumstantial evidence is
very important, and I direct you as a matter of law that where the evidence on
which you rely is mainly circumstantial, before you may find an accused guilty
on such evidence standing alone, you must be satisfied that such evidence is
consistent only with the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion. By that,

[Page 874]

ladies and gentlemen, I mean a reasonable
conclusion on the evidence that you have heard.

Therefore, in the example that I have given
you, and of course it is only an example in the total body of evidence which is
before you, but I deal with this one example for a moment. In the example that
I gave you, you must be satisfied that the evidence is consistent only with the
conclusion that Cooper invited McKendry to Florida in relation to the DREE
grant, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, and inconsistent with any
other rational conclusion, such as the evidence that the invitation was
extended so that McKendry could look at, and perhaps purchase, horses down in
Florida.

As I said to you, ladies and gentlemen, I
gave you that as an example only of circumstantial evidence. The way in which
you approach that circumstantial evidence is important in this case, and you
must consider the evidence as a whole.

This direction was in accordance with what is
sometimes referred to as the rule in Hodge’s case[7]. The report of that case, is a reproduction
of a charge delivered by Baron Alderson to a jury at the Liverpool Assizes at a
time when the accused, as a person interested in the result, was prohibited
from testifying on his own behalf. The pertinent part of the charge reads as
follows:

Alderson, B., told the jury, that the
case was made up of circumstances entirely; and that, before they could
find the prisoner guilty, they must be satisfied, ‘not only that those
circumstances were consistent with his having committed the act, but they must
also be satisfied that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion than that the prisoner was the guilty person.’ [The
italics are my own.]

At the conclusion of Judge Graburn’s charge to
the jury in the present case, counsel for the Crown pointed out, correctly in
my view, that it had been decided in this Court in The Queen v. Mitchell[8], that Hodge’s case was concerned
only with the identification of the accused as being the person who had
committed the crime and that it had no application to a case turning upon
the intention of the accused.

[Page 875]

I think it should be stated here also that in my
view the present case is almost the exact converse of Hodge’s case. In
the latter case there was no doubt that a crime had been committed and the only
question for the jury was whether the accused was the person who had committed
it; whereas in the present case there is no doubt that the respondent was the
person who conferred the benefits and the only question is whether he intended
them to be benefits conferred with respect to his dealings with the government.

It was contended on behalf of the respondent
that criminal intent was not an element of the offence created by s. 110(1)(b)
of the Code, but this involves the proposition that the acts thereby
prohibited “are not criminal in any real sense but rather acts which in the
public interest are prohibited under a penalty”. See Sherras v. DeRutzen[9], which was recently affirmed in this Court
in R. v. Pierce Fisheries[10],
at p. 14. In my opinion the provisions of s. 110(1) (b) are directed
toward the preservation of integrity amongst employees of the government and
those who deal with them, and it is the importance of preserving this aspect of
national life that persuades me that the offence created by that section is in
a real sense a criminal offence of which “intention” to confer the benefits
“with respect to” dealings with the government is a necessary ingredient.

As I have indicated, the issue in the present
case is, as stated by counsel for the defence, whether Cooper conferred the
benefits in this case “with respect to” the DREE grants and contracts. It is
admitted that the benefits were conferred on a government employee at a time
when Cooper was involved in dealing with the Government through that employee.
There is no suggestion that consent was obtained from the head of the branch of
government concerned. Whether or not the benefits were conferred “with respect
to” his dealings with the government must depend on his intention in conferring
them and the evidence for the defence was directed towards showing that they
were conferred because of his friendship with McKendry and their identity of
interest in horses.

[Page 876]

In the course of the reasons for judgment which
he delivered on behalf of this Court in the Mitchell case, Mr. Justice
Spence departed from the approach which had been almost slavishly followed in
the courts of this country for more than fifty years wherever the evidence was
solely or mainly circumstantial, and instead of parroting the language used by
Baron Alderson, he engaged in a realistic analysis of the actual circumstances
of Hodge’s case concluding that the direction there given “was concerned
only with the identification of the accused as being the person who had
committed the crime”. Mr. Justice Spence then went on to say, at p. 479:

This does not, in the slightest degree,
reduce the onus of proof which rests upon the Crown in criminal cases and does
not substitute any other rule. The direction in Hodge’s case did not add
to or subtract from the requirement that proof of guilt in a criminal case must
be beyond a reasonable doubt. It provided a formula to assist in applying the
accepted standard of proof in relation to the first only of the two essential
elements in a crime; i.e., the commission of the act as distinct from the
intent which accompanied that act. The first element, assuming every
circumstance could be established by evidence, would be capable of proof to a
demonstration. The latter element, save perhaps out of the mouth of the accused
himself, could never be so proved. The circumstances which establish the former
not only can be, but must be consistent with each other, as otherwise a
reasonable doubt on the issue arises. The circumstances which establish the
latter, being evidence personal to one individual, will seldom, if ever, be
wholly consistent with only one conclusion as to his mental state and yet the
weight of evidence on the issue may be such as to satisfy the jury, beyond a
reasonable doubt, as to the guilty intent of the accused. The instruction of
Baron Alderson in Hodge’s case does not apply and was never intended to
apply to an issue of this kind.

When this case was cited to Judge Graburn by
Crown counsel, he recalled the jury and instructed them that he had been wrong
in leaving the issue of the appellant’s intention in conferring the benefits to
be decided in accordance with the Hodge’s rule. In so doing, Judge
Graburn gave the following amended instruction to the jury:

[Page 877]

It has been brought to my attention, ladies
and gentlemen, that I was clearly wrong in my charge to you, as a matter of
law, because that particular rule which I gave to you this morning about having
to find the circumstances consistent with guilt and inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion does not apply when we are talking about things like
intent, or we are talking about things like the purpose. It does apply as to an
act.

In other words, if we are trying to
determine whether such-and-such an act was done, such-and-such a physical act
was done, then the rule I indicated to you is applicable, but when we are
talking about intent, purpose, things in a man’s mind, that rule does not
apply. That is clear, and that matter has been pointed out to you, so I was
wrong giving you the example about circumstantial evidence, and I was wrong to
charge you about circumstantial evidence at all. And I ask you, and you must
disregard in your deliberations the charge I gave you in relation to
circumstantial evidence.

In all other respects, what I indicated to
you is correct so far as counsel are concerned, and hopefully so far as I am
concerned.

In the reasons for judgment which he delivered
on behalf of the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Arnup placed his own construction
on the Mitchell case saying:

The Queen v. Mitchell, supra
does not detract from the general rule where what is sought to be proved by
circumstantial evidence is a fact essential to the proof of the offence
charged. It holds that insofar as the intent of the accused is concerned, the
rule in Hodge’s case does not apply to circumstantial evidence led to
prove intent, although of course the rule as to reasonable doubt continues to
apply. In my view it is impossible to read the several judgments of the Supreme
Court in John v. The Queen, [1971] S.C.R. 781 without coming to
the conclusion that the rule in Hodge’s case remains as an established
principle of criminal law in Canada. If it is to be declared that the rule is no longer to be
applicable in Canada to proof
of facts by inference from circumstantial evidence, then such a declaration can
come only from the Supreme Court itself.

With the greatest respect, it appears to me that
the learned judge is saying in effect that the rule in Hodge’s case
applies “where what is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence is a fact
essential to the proof of the offence charged.” As I view the present case,
however, the only fact “essential to the proof of the offence charged” which
has not been admitted is the “intention” of Cooper in

[Page 878]

conferring the benefits and Mr. Justice Arnup
appears to recognize the Mitchell case as having held that the “rule in Hodge’s
case does not apply to circumstantial evidence led to prove intent”.

There is, of course, no doubt that the charge
must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt in order to support a conviction and
where, as here, the accused has called evidence directed towards providing an
explanation of incriminating circumstances, the question is whether, when the
whole evidence is considered together in light of that explanation, the jury is
nonetheless satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to the guilty intention of the
accused in conferring the benefits which he did on McKendry.

The Court of Appeal summarized the submission of
the present respondent’s counsel in the following paragraphs of the reasons for
judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Arnup:

In this case Mr. Robinette submitted that
in order to prove the commission of the offence set out in s. 10(1)(b)
of The Code, the Crown must prove, as matters of fact:

i—that the accused conferred a benefit on
an employee f the government, and 

ii—the accused conferred it with respect to
the dealings of the accused with the government.

He submitted that unless the Crown proved
both aspects of this factual proposition, the Crown had not proved the
commission of the offence, and that the rule in Hodge’s case applied to
both branches of the factual proposition, where the essential facts were sought
to be proved by circumstantial evidence. I accept this proposition.

It follows, in my view, that the trial
judge correctly charged the jury in the first instance, and was wrong when he
withdrew that charge and told the jury to disregard it. I am further of the
opinion that the consequent misdirection is fatal to the conviction, which
cannot stand. Mr. Powell candidly conceded in argument that if the trial judge
was wrong in changing his mind, there must be a new trial.

As to the first branch of the factual
proposition referred to in this passage, I can only say that the statement of
facts, and indeed the evidence of Cooper himself, appear to me to constitute a
clear admission by the respondent that he had conferred

[Page 879]

benefits on McKendry. It is not disputed that
the trips were paid for by Cooper through his companies and that McKendry and
sometimes his wife enjoyed the Cooper hospitality on more than one occasion.

As to the second branch of Mr. Justice Arnup’s
proposition, it will be apparent that I consider it to turn on a pure question
of “intention” to which the Hodge’s rule does not apply, and that there
was ample evidence to justify the jury in drawing an inference of guilt beyond
a reasonable doubt. It will be seen that in my opinion the learned trial judge
was correct in recharging the jury in the language which he employed.

In the alternative, it was submitted on behalf
of the respondent that by withdrawing his initial instructions as to
circumstantial evidence in proof of intent, the trial judge “seriously diluted”
his charge as to reasonable doubt in which he had said in part:

There is a very important rule of law which
applies in this case, and applies in every criminal case, and that is known as
the presumption of innocence. It means that an accused person is presumed to be
innocent until the Crown has proven his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The
presumption of innocence and the burden of proof in a criminal case are inseparable.
The onus, or burden of proving the guilt of an accused person beyond a
reasonable doubt rests with the Crown, and that burden never shifts. There is
no burden on an accused person to prove his innocence. The Crown must prove
each and every ingredient of the offence charged beyond a reasonable doubt.

In support of this alternative submission which
was not made to the Court of Appeal, counsel for the respondent contended that
the judge’s recharge on the circumstantial evidence “…would convey to the jury
that his instruction previously given in the language of Hodge’s case
was neither a formula to assist in applying the accepted standard of proof nor
a graphic illustration of the principle of reasonable doubt.” (This quotation
is taken verbatim from the factum filed on behalf of the respondent).

The phrase “a formula to assist in applying the
accepted standard of proof is obviously taken

[Page 880]

from the reasons for judgment of Spence J. in The
Queen v. Mitchell, supra, at p. 479, and the phrase “graphic
illustration of the principle of reasonable doubt” from what was said in this
Court in John v. The Queen, supra, at p. 791, where the Mitchell
case was expressly approved. In both these cases, when the language
referred to is read in context, it is found to apply only to “the commission of
the act as distinct from the intent which accompanied that Act”. I can find
nothing in the recharge to indicate that the Hodge test, where it
applies, does not contain a formula to assist in applying the accepted standard
of proof, nor is there anything to suggest that the formula does not afford a
graphic illustration of that principle in such cases.

In the course of his recharge to the jury and
after he corrected himself in relation to the rule as to circumstantial evidence
in regard to proof of intention, Judge Graburn once again stressed the
necessity of the jury being satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt before
convicting. He there said:

Therefore, the issue is left as follows,
ladies and gentlemen. The Crown must satisfy you beyond a reasonable doubt that
the benefits, if you find them to be benefits, were conferred by the accused on
McKendry in relation to the dealings with the government, in whole or in part,
directly or indirectly, so far as Cooper was concerned. And the Crown must do
that on the basis of the evidence they have presented to you, and on the basis
of the case as a whole. If that has been done, then you will find the accused
guilty.

On the other hand, if you believe, or have
a reasonable doubt about it, that the benefits were wholly unrelated to the
dealings but dealt rather with horses to be purchased, the introduction of a
manager and the job offer, as far as the accused is concerned, then the accused
is not guilty.

These were the last words spoken to the members
of the jury before they retired to consider their verdict, and when the charge,
as corrected, is read as a whole and in light of this final admonition, I am of
opinion that no reasonable juror could have been confused as to the obligation
to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt before entering a conviction. Nothing
was said to suggest any

[Page 881]

other standard of proof and in my opinion the
instructions as to reasonable doubt are in no way diluted by charging the jury
in accordance with the law established in this Court that the Hodge’s formula
does not apply in determining the “intention” of the accused. The language
employed by Mr. Justice Spence in the passage from his reasons in The Queen
v. Mitchell, supra, has been reaffirmed in this Court in John v.
The Queen[11], at p.
791, The Queen v. Bagshaw[12],
at p. 6 and R. v. Paul[13], at p.
4, and must, I think, be taken to have been accepted as confining the
application of the Hodge’s case formula in the manner there stated. This
is not to say that, even where the issue is one of identification, the exact
words used by Baron Alderson must necessarily be incorporated in a judge’s
charge. It is enough if it is made plain to the members of the jury that before
basing a verdict of guilty on circumstantial evidence they must be satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt that the guilt of the accused is the only reasonable
inference to be drawn from the proven facts. In this regard it will be seen
that I agree with the Chief Justice in his rejection of the Hodge formula
as an inexorable rule of law in Canada.

Finally, and in the further alternative, it was
submitted on behalf of the respondent that by telling the members of the jury
that they should find him guilty if they were satisfied that the benefits were
conferred “directly or indirectly” “in relation to the dealings with the
government”, the trial judge misdirected them in that the words “directly or
indirectly” do not occur in s. 110(1) (b) although they are to be found
elsewhere in the description of offences created by s. 110. Notwithstanding the
persuasive argument addressed to us on this point, I do not regard this as an
error justifying the quashing of the conviction. It must be plain that if the
jury was satisfied that the benefits were conferred “directly” in
relation to dealings with the government, they should convict the accused; and
notwithstanding the fact that the word “indirectly” is not included in
s. 110(1) (b), I take the view that if the jury was satisfied that

[Page 882]

Cooper’s conferring of the benefits was
indirectly connected with the dealings which he had with the government through
McKendry, a verdict of guilty could not be set aside.

The submission as to the trial judge’s use of
the word ‘directly or indirectly’ was made before the Court of Appeal where Mr.
Justice Arnup considered it in the following passage of his reasons for
judgment:

While the words “directly or indirectly”
appear in s. 110(1)(a) of The Code, which contains within itself
a separate offence, the words do not appear at all in s. 110(1) (b). I
therefore agree that the trial judge erred in using the words “directly or
indirectly” as he did. Neither word is used in s. 110(1) (b) and he ought
not to have used either of them in his charge. If this error had stood
alone, we would have had to give serious consideration to the question of
whether s. 613(1)(b)(iii) should be invoked on the facts of this
particular case. However, since in my view the appeal should be allowed on the
ground already stated, it is unnecessary to consider the weight to be given to
this error of the trial judge. I draw attention to it so that it will not be
repeated on the new trial. [The italics are my own.]

As I have indicated, I differ, with respect,
from the conclusion of the Court of Appeal that the use of the words in
question constitute an error, but it will be apparent that if I shared that
view I would have regarded it as an error which stood alone, and while we are
without the benefit of the concluded view of the Court of Appeal as to whether in
this event it would have been an error in respect of which s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
should be applied, I have given the question the best consideration which I can
and I am satisfied that under these circumstances that section would have
applied.

I do not think that any importance is to be
attached to the fact that the judge used the words “in relation to the dealings
with the government” instead of the words “with respect to” those dealings as
they are found in the statute.

For all these reasons I would allow this appeal,
set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the conviction
entered at trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Accused charged of two
offences—Plea of guilty to the more serious charge—Defence of res
judicata—Application of the Kienapple principle—Criminal Code , ss. 83 , 302 (d),
421 (a).

The respondents were charged in two counts
with (1) attempted armed robbery by use of a knife (which carries a penalty of
up to fourteen years’ imprisonment) and (2) possession of a weapon, namely, a
knife, for the purpose of committing an offence (which carries a penalty of up
to five years). They pleaded guilty to the second count (for which they
received a suspended sentence) and were acquitted on the first count. The trial
judge found that the Crown had established culpability of attempted robbery
(the first count) beyond a reasonable doubt but concluded that the accused were
entitled to an acquittal on the defense claim of res judicata on the
basis of Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. On appeal by the
Crown from this acquittal, the Quebec Court of Appeal took the position that
the appeal raised a question of mixed law and fact, which made it unnecessary
to decide on the application of the Kienapple case and affirmed the
judgment of the trial judge. Hence the appeal to the Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

In Kienapple this Court concluded that
if there is a verdict of guilty on a first count and the same or substantially
the same elements make up the offence charged in a second count, the situation
invites the application of a rule against multiple convictions. However the
present case is not one where the offences charged against the accused are of
the same order of gravity, as they were in Kienapple. The Kienapple doctrine
cannot apply to bar a conviction of the more serious offence of which (as here)
the accused would otherwise, on the evidence, be found guilty simply by
offering a plea of guilty to the less serious offence and having the plea
accepted. In short, where an accused is charged on two or more counts with
offences of different degrees of gravity, and the same delict or matter under-

[Page 632]

lies the offences in two of the counts, the
accused should be acquitted on the less serious charge if he is found, or
pleads, guilty to the more serious one. However, if, as was the case here, the
accused pleads guilty to the less serious charge, the plea should be held in
abeyance pending the trial of the more serious offence. If there is a finding
of guilty on that charge, and a conviction is entered accordingly, the plea already
offered on the less serious charge should be struck out and an acquittal
directed.

Kienapple v. The
Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729, considered; R. v. Siggins, [1960]
O.R. 284; Côté v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 303; R. v. St-Jean (1970),

73; R. v. Cole, [1965] 2 Q.B. 388, referred to.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
of Quebec[1] dismissing an appeal from an acquittal by a judge of the Court of
the Sessions of Peace[2] on a
charge of attempted armed robbery. Appeal allowed: acquittal of attempted armed
robbery set aside and conviction entered; the conviction and sentence on the
charge of possession of an offensive weapon set aside, and case remitted to the
Court of Appeal to sentence the accused for attempted armed robbery.

Guy Lemoine, for the appellant.

Jean-Claude Hébert, for the respondents.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The issue in this Crown
appeal, which is here by leave, is whether the trial judge made a proper
application of the principle of Kienapple v. The Queen[3], under the facts before him.

Briefly, the two accused were charged in two
counts with (1) attempted armed robbery by use of a knife, contrary to ss. 302 (d)
and 421 (a) of the Criminal Code  and (2) possession of a weapon,
namely, a knife, for the purpose of committing an offence, contrary to
s. 83 . They pleaded not guilty to the first count and guilty to the
second. The Crown proceeded against them on the first count

[Page 633]

by putting in evidence (1) admissions by the
accused, (2) two knives found in their possession when arrested (put in with
consent of the defence) and (3) also with consent, a motel registration card
made out under a false name by one of the accused. No evidence was offered by
the defence.

The accused relied on two grounds of acquittal
of the charge of attempted armed robbery; first, on an absence of proof to
support the charge and, second, on the rule against multiple convictions of
offences arising out of the same transaction, under the principle of the Kienapple
case. The trial judge found that the Crown had established culpability of
attempted armed robbery beyond a reasonable doubt but concluded that the
accused were entitled to an acquittal on the defence claim of res judicata on
the basis of Kienapple. Subsequently, the trial judge sentenced the
accused on the second charge, suspending sentence and putting them on probation
for three years.

On appeal by the Crown from the acquittal on the
first count, the Quebec Court of Appeal, speaking through Lajoie J.A., took the
position that the Crown’s appeal did not raise a pure question of law in
respect of the issue of res judicata but at the most a question of mixed
law and fact, and hence it was not necessary to decide on the application of
the Kienapple case. That Court came to its conclusion on the footing
that factual determinations had to be made before there could be a basis for
considering whether Kienapple applied, namely, whether the same acts
were involved in the commission of the two offences charged. The trial judge
having so determined and there being no ground for taking a different view,
there was equally no reason to arrive at a different legal result.

It seems to me perfectly clear that, accepting
the facts as found by the trial judge and as confirmed by the Court of Appeal,
a pure question of law does arise under them, namely, whether a conviction on
the charge of attempted armed robbery is foreclosed by the Kienapple case
by reason

[Page 634]

of the plea of guilty to the charge of possession
of an offensive weapon.

Kienapple was
also a case where two counts were laid, one of rape and the other a charge of
unlawful carnal knowledge of a female under age fourteen. Convictions were
entered on both counts, and the issue before the Court was whether the accused,
having been convicted of rape, should have been convicted, in respect of the
same single act of intercourse, of the offence in the second count. The
majority judgment of this Court quashed the conviction of unlawful carnal
knowledge on the ground that, consent being ruled out in respect of the two
charges, there was the one act of intercourse that underlay both charges, which
should therefore be considered as alternative, each carrying the same maximum
penalty, namely, imprisonment for life. The reasons of the majority include the
following passage (at p. 744):

It is plain, of course, that Parliament has
defined two offences in ss. 143 and 146(1), but there is an overlap in the
sense that one embraces the other when the sexual intercourse has been with a
girl under age fourteen without her consent. It is my view that in such a case,
if the accused has been charged, first, with rape and, secondly, with a
s. 146(1) offence, and there is a verdict of guilty of rape, the second
charge falls as an alternative charge and the jury should be so directed.
Correlatively, however, the jury should also be directed that if they find the
accused not guilty of rape they may still find him guilty under s. 146(1)
where sexual intercourse with a girl under age fourteen has been proved.

It was there pointed out that the term res
judicata best expresses the theory of precluding multiple convictions for
the same delict, although the matter is the basis of two separate offences;
and, further, that if there is a verdict of guilty on the first count and the
same or substantially the same elements make up the offence charged in a second
count, the situation invites the application of a rule against multiple
convictions.

The present case is not one where the two offences
charged against the accused are of the

[Page 635]

same order of gravity. Attempted robbery carries
a penalty of up to fourteen years’ imprisonment; the dangerous weapon
possession offence carries a penalty of imprisonment up to five years. The Kienapple
doctrine cannot apply to bar a conviction of the more serious offence of
which (as here) the accused would otherwise, on the evidence, be found guilty
simply by offering a plea of guilty to the less serious offence and having the
plea accepted. This case presents an opportunity to set out some guidelines on
proper resort to the Kienapple principle where the facts justify its
invocation by the Court.

Where a trial before a judge alone or before a
judge and jury proceeds on two or more counts of offences of different degrees
of gravity, and the same delict or matter underlies the offences in two of the
counts, so as to invite application of the rule against multiple convictions,
the trial judge should direct himself or direct the jury that if he or they find
the accused guilty on the more serious charge, there should be an acquittal on
the less serious one; but if he or they should acquit on the more serious
charge, the question of culpability on the less serious charge should be
pursued and a verdict rendered on the merits.

Again, if at the trial, there is a plea of
guilty to the more serious charge, and a conviction is registered, an acquittal
should be entered or directed on the less serious, alternative charge. However,
if, as was the case here, the accused pleads guilty to the less serious charge,
the plea should be held in abeyance pending the trial on the more serious
offence. If there is a finding of guilty on that charge, and a conviction is
entered accordingly, the plea already offered on the less serious charge should
be struck out and an acquittal directed.

Of course, there is always the central question
whether the situation is an appropriate one for the application of res
judicata as dealt with in Kienapple. Typical cases of its
application are those where an accused is charged both with theft and with
unlawful possession, such possession being

[Page 636]

that obtained by the theft: see, for example, R.
v. Siggins[4]. In
such cases there cannot be a conviction on the possession count if the accused
has been found guilty of theft. Yet there may be cases where the possession,
obtained subsequent to the theft of the same articles, will support a separate
conviction of unlawful possession despite an earlier conviction of theft: see Côté
v. The Queen[5]. However,
even in the ordinary case of concurrent charges of theft and unlawful
possession, it has been held that an accused cannot frustrate the trial on the
more serious charge by pleading guilty to the less serious one: see R. v.
St-Jean[6].

R. v. Cole[7], in the English Court of Criminal Appeal, in a case referred to in
the St-Jean case, bears some similarity to the present case. There the
accused was charged, inter alia, with armed robbery and with receiving.
He pleaded guilty to receiving and the plea was recorded. The accused contended
that he could not thereafter be obliged to stand trial on the more serious
charge of armed robbery which involved theft of the very goods involved in the
charge of receiving. I pass over various proceedings in the case, involving
successive new trials, and note only that on the third trial the accused was
found guilty of armed robbery. It was his position on appeal that the recording
of the plea of guilty to receiving amounted to a conviction and precluded any
trial on the alternative charge of armed robbery. This submission was rejected.
Lord Parker, speaking for the Court said this (at pp. 394-5):

This court has been invited to lay down
what is the proper practice. It is merely sufficient to say that in the
ordinary case a judge should allow the plea of guilty to stand. In those
circumstances a defendant will only be put in charge of the jury on the serious
charge, in this case, armed robbery. If he is acquitted of the armed robbery,
then he can be sentenced on the count to which he has pleaded guilty. If, on
the other hand, he is convicted of the armed robbery then the proper course for
the judge is to allow the count to which he has pleaded guilty to remain on the
file and not to proceed to sentence him.

[Page 637]

In the case before us, the accused had been
sentenced on their plea of guilty to the less serious charge, upon which a
conviction was entered; and hence if, as I think is the proper course here, the
acquittal on the charge of attempted armed robbery should be set aside and a
conviction entered, then the conviction on the less serious charge must in turn
be set aside in recognition of our rule against multiple convictions for the
same delict or matter.

In the result, the appeal is allowed, the
acquittal of attempted armed robbery should be set aside and a conviction
should be entered on that charge in accordance with the finding of the trial
judge. The conviction and sentence on the charge of possession of an offensive
weapon should be set aside, and the case remitted to the Quebec Court of Appeal
to sentence the accused for attempted armed robbery.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Conspiracy—Conspiracy to
traffic in a controlled drug—Evidence establishing conspiracy—Facts
constituting conspiracy to traffic—Food and Drugs Act, R.S.C 1970, c. F‑27,
s. 34(1)—Criminal Code , s. 423(1) (d).

In April 1972 the police had under
surveillance a motor vehicle driven by one Davis. When apprehended Davis was seen to pass a white powder substance (methamphetamine) to a
companion who then threw it out of the window. After the arrest of Davis and
his companion the police searched Davis’ premises and found drug trafficking paraphernalia. In the course
of the search the telephone rang, and was answered by a police officer. The
caller, the appellant, asked the officer believing him to be Davis “Did that stuff finally came in?” The
officer replied that it had and arranged a meeting with appellant to deliver it
to him. It was agreed that appellant would have a cheque for $1,100 and the
amount of the substance to be purchased was one pound. The evidence at trial
disclosed the drugs would have a resale value of $9,000. The trial judge
acquitted the appellant of conspiring with others to traffic in a controlled
drug because the Crown failed to prove an agreement between the appellant and Davis to traffic. The Court of Appeal
however set aside the acquittal and entered a conviction.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Judson, Spence and Dickson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be
dismissed.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: It was an error in law to hold that
to establish conspiracy as charged it was necessary to prove an agreement
jointly to manufacture, sell, transport or deliver the drug without authority.
The deal was for the sale of drugs with a resale value of $9,000 not for the

[Page 524]

appellant’s own consumption but for the
purpose of trafficking and this constituted a conspiracy to traffic.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Judson, Spence and Dickson JJ. dissenting: The question on
appeal was whether a person purchasing a controlled drug may be found quilty of
conspiracy with the seller to traffic in that drug by reason only of agreeing
to purchase or have the drug delivered to him by the seller. The importance of
the question lay in the fact that it is not an offence to buy or be in
possession of a controlled drug. The only basis of an unlawful conspiracy would
have been by proof of an agreement, which the trial judge said he could not
find, between the appellant and Davis for the resale of the drug supplied by Davis.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario setting aside an acquittal at trial and entering a conviction of
conspiring with others to traffic in a controlled drug, methamphetamine,
contrary to s. 34(1) of the Food and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. F-27 and
s. 423 (1) (d) of the Criminal Code .

Charles Ryall, for the appellant.

S.M. Froomkin, Q.C., and A. Fradkin, for
the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Judson, Spence
and Dickson JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—The short
and important question in this appeal is whether a person who purchases a
controlled drug, for example methamphetamine, may be found guilty of conspiracy
with the seller to traffic in that drug by reason only of agreeing to purchase
or agreeing to have the drug delivered to him by the seller. The importance of
this question lies in the fact that it is not an offence to buy a controlled
drug, and it is not an offence to be in possession of a controlled drug. It is
an offence to be in possession for the purpose of trafficking, but Crown
counsel in this appeal made it clear that he was not contending that the
conspiracy alleged lay in any agreement between the seller and the accused
buyer to obtain the drug for the purpose of resale. What we are

[Page 525]

faced with is the resort—apparently for the
first time since we are told that there are no reported cases of a similar
kind—to a charge of conspiracy against a buyer who could not be charged with
unlawful purchase nor with unlawful possession because neither of these is an
offence.

The accused was acquitted at trial, and I shall
refer later to the trial judge’s findings of fact. They are important because
on a Crown appeal against acquittal the Crown is limited to questions of law
only: see Criminal Code , s. 605(1) (a). Needless to say, any
further appeal to this Court can only be on a question of law, whether the
appeal be by the Crown or by an accused: see ss. 618 , 621 . The Crown in the
present case appealed the acquittal and the Ontario Court of Appeal, in reasons
by Dubin J.A., set it aside and entered a conviction. The result is, on the
view taken by the Ontario Court of Appeal, and this was the Crown’s position in
argument before this Court, that any purchaser of a controlled drug, perhaps a
school boy, is party to a conspiracy to traffic in that drug, regardless of the
quantity sold, and becomes liable, if prosecuted by indictment, to a penalty of
imprisonment of up to ten years: see Criminal Code , s. 423(1) (d) and
Food and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. F-27, s. 34(3). I repeat that he
cannot be prosecuted for mere purchase nor for mere possession. The laying of a
charge of conspiracy in such circumstances seems to be an abuse if not also a
distortion of the concept of conspiracy in our law.

It is said, however, that the result aforesaid
inexorably follows from the definition of “traffic” in s. 33  of the Food and
Drugs Act , this provision being in Part III of the Act entitled “Controlled
Drugs”. The definition is as follows:

“traffic” means to manufacture, sell,
export from or import into Canada, transport or deliver, otherwise than under the authority of this
Part or the regulations.

[Page 526]

This definition must be amplified by importing
into it the definition of “sell”, found in s. 2 of the Act; it is defined to
include

sell, offer for sale, expose for sale, have
in possession for sale, and distribute.

Applying the law as reflected in the judgment of
the Ontario Court of Appeal, and in the Crown’s argument before us, an accepted
offer to sell a controlled drug makes the offeree liable, without more, to a
conviction of conspiracy to traffic in that drug.

The trial judge made certain findings of fact,
and I quote from his reasons:

The agreement to purchase that drug by the
accused, Sokoloski, was not an unlawful act as far as he was concerned, I
cannot find that there was an agreement between the accused, Davis, and the accused Sokoloski, that they
would transport or deliver the Methamphetamine or that they would sell it.
Certainly, the accused, Sokoloski, appreciated that the accused, Davis, would
have to transport and deliver the drugs to carry out their agreement and by
agreeing to purchase that drug, he may well have furthered the transporting and
delivering but in my view, those acts would, at most, constitute aiding and
abetting. From those acts, I cannot draw an inference of agreement to transport
and deliver made by both of the accused before the Court.

I would be prepared to find that the
accused, Sokoloski, agreed to buy Methamphetamine and I would be prepared to
find that he bought it for the purpose of resale in view of the substantial
amount that he was purchasing and in view of the evidence that such an amount
would be sufficient to constitute at least four hundred dime bags, that these
dime bags being the usual small amounts which, on the evidence, I find was sold
by a seller of drugs. But I am unable to find that the accused, Davis, agreed to such a resale of the drugs
although he may well have known that in all probability that was the reason for
the purchase.

What I have been saying, in greater detail, is
aptly reflected in the foregoing quoted reasons of the trial judge. His
findings are findings of fact, and I do not think that there is any opening for
saying that he has made errors in law because of any inferences he drew from
the facts as found: see

[Page 527]

Sunbeam Corp. (Canada) Ltd. v. The Queen[1];
Lampard v. The Queen[2]. Ciglen
v. The Queen[3] has no
application to the present case.

In my opinion, the learned Justice of the Court
of Appeal has, in his reasons, based the conviction of conspiracy on the mere
consummation of a contract for sale and purchase of controlled drugs, not
pointing out that purchase as such is not unlawful and that hence an agreement
to purchase is likewise not unlawful. The relevant part of his reasons is as
follows:

On the evidence accepted by the trial Judge
Sokoloski agreed that Davis at the request of Sokoloski would do that which is
prohibited by the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act , and, therefore, the
learned trial Judge erred in holding that Sokoloski had not participated in an
unlawful act. The trial Judge found that the accused Davis agreed to sell and the accused Sokoloski agreed to buy a prohibited
drug, but held that the Crown had failed to prove that there was an agreement
between the two that Davis
would transport and deliver the drug to Sokoloski. With deference to the
learned trial Judge, it is clear that that is the very agreement which the
evidence established. He appears to have been of mind that, although he found
that Sokoloski was purchasing the drug for the purpose of resale, it was
incumbent upon the Crown to establish the offence alleged that Davis had agreed with Sokoloski that
Sokoloski would in fact sell the drugs. Although in the circumstances of this
case that inference seems to be irresistible, it was not necessary for the
Crown in order to prove the case against the accused to prove that fact.

I do not doubt that a person who sells or offers
to sell a controlled drug is guilty of the offence of trafficking under s.
34(1) which says, clearly enough, that “no person shall traffic in a controlled
drug or any substance represented or held out by him to be a controlled drug”.
I do not understand, however, how a seller and a buyer can be guilty of
conspiracy by the one being willing to sell and the other being willing to buy
when it is not an offence to buy, and hence not an offence to agree to buy.
There is no agreement here between them to support a charge of conspiracy,
although one is likely to be misled by ordinary parlance,

[Page 528]

that is, the reference to a seller agreeing to
sell and a buyer agreeing to buy. This is merely the indication of contract,
and it is a distortion of conspiracy to say that there is an agreement between
seller and buyer to sell so as to found a charge of conspiracy to traffic. The
agreement between them is simply a reflection of different promises in a
bilateral contract; they are not parties to the same promise.

I am of the view that the position is the same
with respect to the elements of transport or delivery which are the only other
parts of the definition of “traffic” remotely applicable here. Again, it seems
to me to be a mistaken proposition to argue, as did Crown counsel, that the
accused and the seller conspired to traffic because they “arranged” to have the
drug transported or delivered. The introduction of contract language into this
case to support a charge as serious as conspiracy is to me very odd. Every
contract for the sale of goods can be said to involve delivery in execution of
the contract, and if, as in my view is the case, by offering to buy there is no
unlawful conspiracy in the act of selling or agreeing to sell, then there is
equally no unlawful conspiracy in the delivery of the goods by the seller to
the buyer. The delivery by the seller is a normal incident of a sale by him.
Certainly, if the buyer himself picked up the goods, e.g. drugs, at the
seller’s premises, it would be incongruous to urge that this amounts to a
conspiracy to traffic, although the pick-up was “arranged” between the parties.

The problem raised in this case is one of a
number of related problems arising in the law of criminal conspiracy, problems
such as those arising where the consummation of the allegedly illegal design
would not result in a known offence (cf. R. v. Chow Sik Wah and Quon Hong[4]) or where circumstances attending it
indicate that it could not be carried out, this not being, however, a likely

[Page 529]

defence (see R. v. Northern Electric Co.[5] at p. 263): see Development Note, Criminal
Conspiracy (1959), 72 Harv. L. Rev. 920, at p. 944; Goode, Criminal
Conspiracy in Canada (1975), at pp. 41-46. The immediate one
here is of a differrent order, touching not the position of all parties to an
alleged conspiracy but the position of one of them who could not be found
guilty of any substantive offence in carrying out the transaction on which the
charge of conspiracy is based.

The statutory framework of the present issue
suggests very strongly that Parliament was content, having made clear the
liability of a seller of a controlled drug, to limit culpability of the buyer
to those situations in which his purchase—and here quantity would be
relevant—was for resale and thus to punish his possession only in that event.
To mount conspiracy against a buyer on the basis of the seller’s culpability in
selling is, in my opinion, an overreaching of policy, not desirable in the
criminal law field when effected by the Courts.

Although there do not appear to be any decisions
directly in point in this country, there are conflicting decisions in the United States. Nigro v. United States[6] offers a parallel with the present case
because there a charge against a physician for conspiracy with a drug addict to
whom he gave numerous prescriptions for drugs was set aside because under the Anti‑Narcotic
Act, which prohibited the sale or the giving away of drugs, except in
prescribed situations, the buyer was not guilty of an offence save in
circumstances not present in the case. The Court held, accordingly, that since
the legislative policy was to leave the buyer unpunishable, the prescribing
physician could not be guilty of conspiring with himself. To a different effect
are Vanatta v. United States[7] and May
v. United States[8], holding
that the person not punishable under the statute (in the Vanatta case,
the buyer of liquor which it was unlawful to sell and in the May case,
the person giving a bribe to a

[Page 530]

Congressman in whom it was a crime to receive
it) could nonetheless be successfully prosecuted for conspiracy.

The issue is dealt with by Williams, Criminal
Law (2nd ed. 1961) at pp. 356-357, in terms which commend themselves to me,
as follows:

Where a statute refers to a bilateral
transaction and makes it a crime in one of the parties to that transaction (e.g.,
a seller), the courts pass immediately to the conclusion that the other
party can be charged as a principal in the second degree. They will not
generally construe such a statute as impliedly excluding the guilt of the other
party. Thus if a statute makes it an offence for a person to procure carnal
connection or to receive a bribe, the person who is procured or who gives the
bribe, as the case may be, is convicted as a party to the offence without express
words in the statute. So also the two can be convicted of conspiracy to commit
the forbidden act. In bigamy, the other party to the bigamous marriage is a
principal in the second degree.

It may be thought that this rule is of
doubtful policy. In the first place, where the legislature has specified a
bilateral transaction and specified it as an offence in one party only, there
is a strong argument for saying that the legislature must have intended the
other party to go quit. For the concurrence of the two parties must have been
present to the mind of the legislature, and the specification of the one should
be an implied exclusion of the other. In the second place, to extend the number
of accomplices aggravates the difficulty of convicting the principal offender.
For (a) these accomplices will be reluctant to testify, (b) they will generally
not be compellable to testify, (c) if they do testify, the “accomplice warning”
will have to be given to the jury. For these solid reasons, the American Law
Institute’s Model Penal Code proposes that in such bilateral transactions only
the party or parties named by the legislature should be responsible in crime.

The Model Penal Code of the American Law
Institute, approved in 1962, provides in s. 2.06(6)(b) that “Unless
otherwise provided by the Code or by the law defining the offense a person is
not an accomplice in an offense committed by another if the offense is so
defined that his conduct is inevitably incident to its commission”. It pro-

[Page 531]

vides further in s. 5.04, dealing with
“incapacity, irresponsibility or immunity of party to solicitation or
conspiracy”, as follows:

5.04...

(1) Except as provided in
Subsection (2) of this Section, it is immaterial to the liability of a
person who solicits or conspires with another to commit a crime that:

(a) he or the person whom he
solicits or with whom he conspires does not occupy a particular position or
have a particular characteristic which is an element of such crime, if he
believes that one of them does.; or

(b) the person whom he solicits or
with whom he conspires is irresponsible or has an immunity to prosecution or
conviction for the commission of the crime.

(2) It is a defense to a charge of
solicitation or conspiracy to commit a crime that if the criminal object were
achieved, the actor would not be guilty of a crime under the law defining the
offense or as an accomplice under Section 2.06(5) or 2.06(6)(a) or
(b).

The reference in sub. (2) aforesaid to
section 2.06(6)(b) is a reference to the type of situation present
here.

It is clear to me that the only basis of an
unlawful conspiracy would have been by proof of an agreement between the seller
Davis and the accused for the resale of the drugs supplied by Davis. It is such an agreement that the
trial judge said he could not find and, moreover, counsel for the Crown was
explicit that he did not—as, indeed, he could not in view of the adverse
finding—rely on it on the argument of this appeal. In view of the fact that
there is no offence in buying a controlled drug, but it is an offence to sell
one, conspiracy could at best only be charged against the seller and not
against the buyer: cf. R. v. Duguid[9].
This is not a case where the conduct on which conspiracy is based is itself a
crime which, if carried out, would make each of the alleged conspirators liable
to conviction apart from conspiracy. Even in such a case, this Court has held
that

[Page 532]

neither party to an alleged conspiracy can be
convicted of the crime if one does not have the requisite mens rea for
the substantive offence: R. v. O’Brien[10]. Although the correctness of this decision
has been doubted (see Williams, Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1961), at pp.
672-73), it does not call for any re-examination here.

The Ontario Court of Appeal referred in its
reasons to Poitras v. R.[11]
Although it was a drug trafficking case, it did not involve a charge of
conspiracy and I do not consider it to have any bearing on the present case.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Ontario Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of acquittal.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz
and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—The appellant is appealing from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which reversed the judgment of the
trial judge who had acquitted the appellant on a charge of conspiring with
others to traffic in a controlled drug, methamphetamine, contrary to s. 34(1)
of the Food and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. F-27, and s. 423(1) (d)
of the Criminal Code .

The facts are set out in the reasons for
judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered by Dubin J.A. They are as follows:

On or about April 17, 1972, members of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police, together with members of the Hamilton Police
Department, took up surveillance of a motor vehicle driven by the accused Davis in company with the said Irene
Bojkiwskij. In the course of his being apprehended, Davis was observed passing a white powder substance, which was
methamphetamine, to Miss Bojkiwskij, who proceeded to throw the same out the
window. Davis and Bojkiwskij were arrested, and the police proceeded to the
premises of Davis. A search was
conducted and paraphernalia used for trafficking in drugs was found. While the
police were in the Davis’

[Page 533]

premises the telephone rang and the accused
Sokoloski was on the phone. The officer disguised his voice as that of Davis and a telephone conversation ensued.
During the telephone conversation Sokoloski asked the person whom he believed
to be Davis, “Did that stuff
finally come in?”. The police officer advised him that it had and arranged a
meeting with Sokoloski to deliver the same to him. It was agreed that Sokoloski
would have a cheque for $1100.00, and the amount of the substance to be
purchased was one pound. Sokoloski attended at the place agreed upon at which
time he was arrested and had a cheque in his possession payable to the accused Davis for the sum of $1100.00. Sokoloski
was thereupon arrested, taken to the jail and placed in a cell two away from
that of Davis. A police officer
was put in the cell between them and overheard conversations between Sokoloski
and Davis in which Davis
reported that he had gone to Toronto to buy the stuff for Sokoloski.

The evidence further disclosed that the
drugs would have a resale value of $9,000.00.

The relevant provisions of the Food and Drugs
Act  are as follows:

2. In this
Act

“sell” includes, sell, offer for sale,
expose for sale, have in possession for sale, and distribute.

33. In this
Part

“Controlled drug” means any drug or other
substance included in Schedule G.

“traffic” means to manufacture, sell,
export from or import into Canada, transport or deliver, otherwise than under the authority of this
Part or the regulations.

34. (1) No
person shall traffic in a controlled drug or any substance represented or held
out by him to be a controlled drug.

(2) No person shall have in his possession
any controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking.

Schedule G

Methamphetamine and its salts.

Section 423(1) (d) of the Criminal
Code  provides that:

423. (1)
Except where otherwise expressly provided by law, the following provisions
apply in respect of conspiracy, namely,

(d) every one who conspires with any
one to commit an indictable offence not provided for in paragraph (a), (b)
or (c) is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to the same
punishment as that to which an

[Page 534]

accused who is guilty of that offence
would, upon conviction, be liable.

(Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are
not applicable.)

The trial judge, in his reasons, accepted the
evidence of the police officer as to the details of his telephone conversation
with the appellant, and also the evidence of the police officer who had heard
the conversation in the cell block between the appellant and Davis.

He found that there was an agreement by Davis to sell Methamphetamine to the
appellant and an agreement by the appellant to buy it from Davis.

He also stated:

I would be prepared to find that the
accused, Sokoloski, agreed to buy Methamphetamine and I would be prepared to
find that he bought it for the purpose of resale in view of the substantial
amount that he was purchasing and in view of the evidence that such an amount
would be sufficient to constitute at least four hundred dime bags, that these
dime bags being the usual small amounts which, on the evidence, I find was sold
by a seller of drugs. But I am unable to find that the accused, Davis, agreed to such a resale of the drugs
although he may well have known that in all probability that was the reason for
the purchase.

His decision that a conspiracy between the
appellant and Davis had not
been proved is based upon his view that it would be necessary for the Crown to
establish an agreement between them jointly to traffic in the controlled drug.
This is made clear in the following passage from his reasons:

I cannot find that there was an agreement
between the accused, Davis, and
the accused, Sokoloski, that they would transport or deliver the
methamphetamine or that they would sell it.

[The emphasis is mine.]

Similarly, in the passage previously quoted
involving the finding that the appellant purchased the drug for resale, he
says:

But I am unable to find that the accused, Davis, agreed to such resale of the drugs
although he may well have known that in all probability that was the reason for
the purchase.

In my opinion it was an error in law to hold
that in order to establish a conspiracy, as charged, it

[Page 535]

was necessary to prove an agreement between the
parties jointly to manufacture, sell, transport or deliver a controlled drug, without
the requisite authority. The evidence establishes that Davis agreed with the appellant, at the appellant’s request, to obtain
for him, and to transport and deliver to him a substantial quantity of
prohibited drugs. The appellant agreed to pay Davis for these services.

This was a deal for the sale of drugs with a
resale value of $9,000. The purchase by the appellant was not for his own
consumption, but, as found by the trial judge, for the purpose of resale, i.e.
for trafficking. Had the deal been consummated and the drugs received by
the appellant, in the light of the trial judge’s finding, the appellant would
have been in breach of s. 34(2)  of the Food and Drugs Act  by being
in possession of prohibited drugs for the purpose of trafficking. In those circumstances
what Davis and the appellant were to do constituted trafficking within the
meaning of the Food and Drugs Act .

In my opinion that agreement constituted a
conspiracy to traffic.

I agree with the conclusion stated by Dubin
J.A. in the Court of Appeal:

It is clear in my opinion that on the
evidence accepted by the trial judge and the facts found by him, the Crown had
proved every essential element of a conspiracy between the two to traffic in a
controlled drug as defined in the Food and Drugs Act .

With great respect for those members of this
Court who have taken the contrary view, I do not regard the view expressed by
the Court of Appeal in this case as resulting in the proposition that any
purchaser of a controlled drug, perhaps a school boy, is party to a conspiracy
to traffic in that drug regardless of the quantity sold. The opinion of that
Court and my own opinion, as previously expressed, relate to the existence of a
conspiracy upon the facts of this case.

For these reasons, and for those stated by the
Court of Appeal, I would dismiss this appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Committal for trial—Application
for habeas corpus with certiorari in aid to review the sufficiency of
evidence—Issue already determined adversely to accused on previous certiorari
appeal from which leave to appeal refused—Criminal Code , s. 475 , 719(3) .

APPEALS from a judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario dismissing
an appeal from a judgment of Morden J.[1]
dismissing the applications for habeas corpus with certiorari in
aid. Appeals dismissed.

Douglas K. Laidlaw, Q.C., and Roy E.
Stephenson, for the appellant Martin.

H. Lorne Morphy, Q.C., Charles F. Scott and
Marilyn L. Pilkington, for the appellants Simard and Desjardins.

R.M. McLeod and S.C. Hill, for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered orally
by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—We do not need to hear you,
Mr. McLeod and Mr. Hill. We are all of the opinion that the appeals
fail for the reasons which follow.

The appellants claim the right to habeas
corpus in order to have a judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario pass on the
sufficiency of the evidence to support the committal of the accused for trial.
The claim is made under the pre-Confederation Habeas Corpus Act, in
force in Ontario, under which on habeas corpus with certiorari in
aid, the

[Page 512]

Court is entitled to review the sufficiency of
the evidence upon which an accused has been confined or restrained. It is
conceded that without certiorari in aid, a review of the evidence would
not be open.

In the present case, Morden J. refused to grant habeas
corpus with certiorari in aid for reasons that need not be canvassed
here, but he went on to consider the challenge of the accused to their
committal for trial under a separate and concurrent application for certiorari.
It was his view that he was not precluded by any judgments binding on him,
such as R. v. Pickett[2], from
extending review by certiorari beyond jurisdictional error and from
examining the proceedings, including the evidence, to determine whether there
was any error of law on the face of the record. He considered that the question
whether there was any evidence to warrant the committals for trial was included
among the errors of law examinable on certiorari alone. Indeed, he was
invited by all counsel to consider on the merits what he called the substantive
issue of no evidence, which was the basis of the applications by the accused to
quash their committals for trial.

Morden J. concluded on the certiorari application
that there was no evidence to warrant committal of the accused Martin on count
4, the only count on which he stood committed for trial, no evidence to support
the committal of the accused Simard on count 3, being one of three counts on
which he stood committed, and no evidence to support the committal of the
accused Desjardins on counts 3 and 4, leaving only count 6 outstanding against
him and, accordingly, he quashed the committals on those counts. The Court of
Appeal rejected the accused’s appeal against the refusal of habeas corpus with
certiorari in aid, but went on to allow the Crown’s appeal on the certiorari
application and reinstated the committals on all counts on which the
committals had been quashed by Morden J. In the course of its reasons, it made
the following relevant pronouncements:

…It remained therefore to examine the
excerpts of evidence, as placed before this Court from the lengthy transcript
taken at the preliminary hearing, in order to determine whether there was any
evidence at all on

[Page 513]

which the committing tribunal was able to
base its opinion to commit, as required by the terms of the Code already cited.
There is, of course, a considerable volume of evidence, testimonial and
documentary, and it is my view that in the case of each of the three
respondents there is sufficient evidence relating to the charges and the counts
in issue to call upon the learned Provincial judge to form an opinion as to
whether there was sufficient evidence to commit the accused for trial, pursuant
to s. 475 , set out above. Having properly directed his mind to the evidence and
to the question of whether there was “sufficient evidence” to commit, his
decision is not subject to review.

The accused applied here for leave to appeal
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal but leave was refused, and so the
judgment of the Court of Appeal stands against them as a judgment in which that
Court had determined that there was sufficient evidence upon which the
committing Judge was in a position to form an opinion on whether there was
enough to send the accused to trial.

Counsel for the appellants allege that the
determination by the Court of Appeal does not foreclose their right to habeas
corpus because, if granted, it will give them a right to a wider review
than that afforded to them under certiorari alone. What they point to,
of course, is the scope of review by habeas corpus with certiorari in
aid. Assuming for the purpose of this case, that their right of appeal to this
Court under Criminal Code  s. 719(3) , which refers only to habeas
corpus ad subjiciendum, embraces habeas corpus with certiorari in
aid, it does not follow that their position will be any different than that
considered and already adjudicated upon by the Court of Appeal on the certiorari
appeal alone.

There are a number of reasons which point to
this conclusion. It should be said, first, that the argument of the appellants
as to habeas corpus with certiorari in aid makes it unnecessary
for this Court to review its decisions in Patterson v. The Queen[3], or in Masella v. Langlais[4]. On their own assertion, the appellants
have a statutory right to a

[Page 514]

review on the sufficiency of the evidence, and
neither of the aforementioned cases touches this point. The first was concerned
with the scope of review where there was no such statutory direction on the
matter as exists here, and the second was concerned, inter alia, with
the question whether habeas corpus lies where the applicant is on bail.
Second, the question of sufficiency cannot be considered at large, but only in
relation to the statutory authority of the committing provincial Judge, as
spelled out in Criminal Code , s. 475 . That provision, so far as
relevant, provides that “When all the evidence has been taken by the justice he
shall if, in his opinion, the evidence is sufficient to put the accused on
trial commit the accused for trial”. It cannot be that the pre-Confederation
statute can enlarge the authority to review the determination of the committing
justice, but the position is rather that it must be read in consonance with the
later enacted provisions of the Criminal Code . Third, the review on
sufficiency must be a review to determine whether the committal was made
arbitrarily or, at the most, whether there was some evidence upon which an
opinion could be formed that an accused should go to trial.

Counsel for the accused Martin, supported by
counsel for the accused Simard and Desjardins, argued strenuously that the
Court of Appeal had applied a narrower test in their reversal of Morden J. on
the certiorari application than the test applicable to review by habeas
corpus with certiorari in aid; and that, if otherwise entitled to habeas
corpus, they were not precluded from having the committals for trial
reviewed merely because of the Court of Appeal’s ruling adverse to them on certiorari.
Since Morden J. had addressed himself to the issue of no evidence or some
evidence, (and it was conceded that he gave full review) and this same issue
was considered by the Court of Appeal, with an assertion by the Court that it
had reviewed the evidence as to its sufficiency for the purpose of seeing
whether it provided the platform for the committing Judge’s exercise of his
powers under Criminal Code , s. 475 , there is difficulty in understanding
what different review would be open on habeas corpus with certiorari in
aid, once it is

[Page 515]

conceded (as counsel for the accused did) that
the review contemplated under the Habeas Corpus Act is not a straight
appeal. Whatever difficulty accused’s counsel see in reconciling certain
statements of principle by the Court of Appeal, their dispositive reasons make
clear enough the scope of review that they gave to the sufficiency of the
evidence.

Having regard to the determination that they in
fact made on the certiorari appeal, the present applications become
moot. In short, even assuming that in the circumstances of this case, they
would have been entitled to the grant of habeas corpus and to certiorari
in aid, the issue that would have been open for review has already been determined
adversely to the accused. They cannot claim to have the same merits reviewed
under a different procedure when there has been review of the same scope under
a procedure which they had previously invoked.

This is sufficient to dispose of these appeals
without canvassing the other issues raised by the appellants on which we
express no opinion, and the appeals are, accordingly, dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Gaming and Betting—Keeping
common gaming house—Definition—A place “kept or used” for the purpose of
playing games—Use of premises on one occasion—Criminal Code , s. 179(1) .

Criminal
law—Statutes—Interpretation—Definition of common gaming house—Examination of
historical antecedents and development of offences relating to disorderly
houses—Criminal Code , s. 179(1) .

Appellants were convicted on a charge of
unlawfully keeping a common gaming house. The trial proceeded on an agreed
statement of facts and the only question to be determined was whether the use
of the premises, an arena in Toronto, on one occasion, in the circumstances set out in the agreed
statement of facts, was sufficient to constitute the premises a common gaming
house within s. 179(1)  of the Criminal Code . The trial judge held that
the definition in s. 179(1) (b)(i) applied and convicted the appellants.
The Court of Appeal agreed, concluding that such a single use of the premises
would bring the arena within the definition of a common gaming house so long as
the gaming activities were “carried on in a place in the way of a business by
those conducting such activities”.

Held (Ritchie
and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Martland, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz, Estey and Pratte JJ.: The definition
of common gaming house as found in s. 179(1)  has two parts, (a) and
(b). Section 179(1) (a) defines a common gaming house
as a place “kept for gain”. The Courts have interpreted kept as
connoting frequent or habitual activity. If the definition in s. 179(1) (b)
were to be interpreted in isolation and not in tandem with that of
s. 179(1) (a) the construction by the Court of Appeal would not have been
unreasonable. In the context of s. 179(1)  it is unreasonable to import a
business purpose test into the definition in s. 179(1) (b) in the
face of the

express words employed by Parliament in s.
179(1) (a), importing the closely related notion of gain.

Further, the words “used” and “kept” are not
employed to describe the frequency of the prohibited activity, but refer
instead to the type of activity carried on. A place is “kept” by a person who
allows others to use it for a prohibited purpose. A place is “used” by a person
conducting the forbidden activities.

The application of a definition of “used” as
referring to a single use to the circumstances of this case would be to put an
unnatural extension on the simple language used. The word “used” in
section 179(1) (b) connotes a practice of so employing the premises,
or at least a practice consisting of more than one use or occasion. This
conclusion as to the construction of the word “used” is reinforced both by
examination of certain other provisions of the Criminal Code  and of the
historical antecedents and development of the offences relating to disorderly
houses.

Per Ritchie
and Spence JJ., dissenting: The analysis of the effect of the definition
of common bawdy-house, common betting house and common gaming house in s.
179(1)  of the Criminal Code  by Martin J.A. in the judgment of the Court
of Appeal correctly disposed of the issue. In particular the requirement of
frequent habitual use of the place before there could be a conviction for
keeping a “common bawdy-house” [Patterson v. The Queen, [1968]
S.C.R. 157] does not apply to a prosecution of keeping a “common gaming
house”.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Martland,
Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz, Estey and Pratte JJ. was delivered by

ESTEY J.—The Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed
an appeal from the conviction of the appellants on a charge of keeping a common
gaming house contrary to s. 185(1)  of the Criminal Code . On the hearing
of the appeal therefrom, the argument in this Court was limited to the question
as to whether the interpretation of the term “common gaming house” by the
Ontario Appeal Court was right in law, that Court having interpreted the term
in such a way as to permit a conviction where the premises in question had been
used by the accused on only one occasion. Put in its simplest term, the
contention of the appellants was that a place could not be a common gaming
house in the absence of evidence that it was “kept” or “used” frequently or in
an habitual manner for purposes prohibited by the Criminal Code .

Section 179 of the Code defines a
common gaming house as follows:

“common gaming house” means a place that is

(a) kept for gain to which
persons resort for the purpose of playing games, or

(b) kept or used for the
purpose of playing games

(i) in which a bank is kept by one or more
but not all of the players,

(ii) in which all or any portion of the
bets on or proceeds from a game is paid, directly or indirectly, to the keeper
of the place,

(iii) in which, directly or indirectly, a
fee is charged to or paid by the players for the privilege of playing or
participating in a game or using gaming equipment, or

(iv) in which the chances of winning are
not equally favourable to all persons who play the game, including the person,
if any, who conducts the game;

The facts are set out by Martin J.A., writing on
behalf of the Court of Appeal, reported at (1976), 14 O.R. (2d) 604, and need
not be repeated here.

The Courts in this country, and in dealing with
similar statutes, the Courts in the United Kingdom, Australia and elsewhere,
have interpreted the word “kept” as it is employed in subs, (a) of
the definition as connoting frequent or habitual activ-

[Page 707]

ity. The evidence before the learned trial judge
in these proceedings indicated a single use of the arena for gambling purposes.
Consequently, the Crown, in this circumstance, has argued that the arena was a
common gaming house within the meaning of that term as defined in subs, (b)
above, that is, that the arena had been “kept or used” for the specified prohibited
purposes.

Martin J.A., delivering judgment on behalf of
the Court of Appeal, concluded that such a single use of the premises would
suffice to bring the arena within the definition of a common gaming house so
long as the gaming activities were “carried on in a place in the way of a
business by those conducting such activities”. This is the crux of the
interpretative exercise performed by the Court of Appeal and with which, with
the greatest respect, I am unable to agree.

It must be conceded at once that if the second
definition of common gaming house (subs. (b) above) were to be
interpreted in isolation and not in tandem with subs. (a) above,
such a construction would not be unreasonable. The definition has two parts, (a)
and (b), the first of which defines a place “kept for gain”. In
construing the word “used”, Martin J.A. referred to a decision of Salmond J. in
Weathered v. Fitzgibbon[2]. It
should be noted, however, that this decision was made in relation to a statute
(The Gaming Act, 1908) which did not include an alternate provision
comparable to the first part of the definition of a common gaming house, that
is, a place kept for gain.

It is unreasonable, in my opinion, to import a
business purpose test into the second definition in the face of the express
words employed by Parliament in the immediately preceding portion of the
definition which imports the closely related notion of gain. That requirement
has for many years been interpreted loosely as “kept for business purposes” (vide
R. v. James[3]; R.
v. Hoeltje[4]. More
importantly, other provisions in this part of the Criminal Code  deal
expressly with the offences of engaging

[Page 708]

in the business of betting or placing or
agreeing to place bets on behalf of others. The interpretation of the word
“use” by the Court below in effect creates a new offence of engaging in the
business of gaming once the prohibited activities can be proven to have been
localized to the degree necessary to meet the definition of the word “place” in
the Code.

In addition, it should be observed that the
Courts have held, even in the case of the “business offences”, that there must
be a “course of conduct” amounting to the carrying on of a business in order to
justify a conviction for engaging in the business of betting and that, for
these purposes, an isolated act will not suffice (vide R. v. Hynes[5]).

In view of the first definition of a “common
gaming house” in s. 179, and taking into account the specific offences related
to engaging in business activities in this field, it is difficult to conclude
that Parliament, in omitting any reference to “gain”, in the second or
alternative definition of “common gaming house” could have intended that the
meaning attributed to it by the Court of Appeal below should be imported into
this part of the definition section.

The second proposition fundamental to the
judgment of the Court of Appeal in interpreting the term “kept or used” as
employed by Parliament in the definition of “common gaming house”, is that some
meaning must be assigned to the word “used” other than that assigned to the
word “kept” which, as we have already noted, has been interpreted by the Courts
for many years as connoting an habitual or repeated act of gaming. Otherwise,
there would have been no reason for Parliament to have employed both words in
this alternative definition. The Court then concluded that “used” in contrast
to “kept” indicated a single or isolated use of the premises for the prohibited
purposes and, therefore, a single use would be sufficient to support a
conviction. Such an analysis depends, of course, on a preliminary determination
that the two words are referable to the same sort of activity and to the same
class of actor. Turning

[Page 709]

back to the question as to whether or not “used”
has been employed by the legislative draftsman in contradistinction to “kept”
(which latter term is based in the context of repeated or habitual use), it is
helpful to examine several related provisions of the Criminal Code  which
indicate that the words “kept” and “used” have different meanings apart
altogether from plurality and singularity as assigned to them by the Court of
Appeal below.

“Keeper”, in s. 179 of the Code, is
defined so as to include a person who:

(a) is an owner or occupier
of a place,

(b) assists or acts on behalf
of an owner or occupier of a place,

(c) appears to be, or to
assist or act on behalf of an owner or occupier of a place,

(d) has the care or
management of a place, or

(e) uses a place permanently
or temporarily, with or without the consent of the owner or occupier;

In R. v. Kerim[6], Martland J., speaking also for
Ritchie and Cartwright JJ., held that a person may be convicted under what is
now s. 185(1)  only where there is “…some act of participation in the wrongful
use of the place…” (at p. 131). The combined effect of the definition of
“keeper” in s. 179, and the interpretation of the word “keeps” in s. 185(1) ,
laid down in R. v. Kerim, supra, suggests that a place is “kept” by a
person who allows others to use it for a prohibited purpose. It is observed
that the definition of “keeper” employs the word “use” in connection with both
the words “permanently” and “temporarily”. That construction is reinforced by
s. 185(2)(b) which imposes a lesser liability on a “keeper” who does not
himself participate in (that is, use the premises for) the illegal activities
but merely “knowingly permits a place to be used” for the purposes of a common
gaming house.

Conversely, the word “used” in the definition of
a common gaming house is directed not at the person in control of the place who
makes it available to others, but rather at the person conducting

[Page 710]

the forbidden activities, whether or not he is a
“keeper” who keeps the place for the purposes condemned by s. 185(1) .
Accordingly, one should not compare “kept” and “used” in an attempt to find a
difference in meaning based on frequency of use. The two words refer to
different activities which in some cases are carried on by different persons.
These words describe in their employment in connection with gaming activities,
two separate and distinct roles, the one being partly active and partly passive
(“kept”), and the other (“use”) being active.

It, therefore, follows in the interpretative
sequence that a Court must next determine whether the word “used” employed in
the above sense properly connotes either a single use or repeated, frequent, or
habitual use.

The words “used” and “kept” have, when assigned
the foregoing meanings, at least in some contexts, the same connotation in the
sense of a requirement of a repeated action. The word “used”, on the other
hand, may in some applications indicate a single use.

In the Oxford English Dictionary, “used”
is defined as follows:

“That is or has been made use of;
utilized.”

In ordinary speech, the past participle “used”
employed with the present tense of the verb ‘to be’ indicates a repeated use;
in contrast perhaps to the past and imperfect tenses. The definition of ‘common
gaming house’ employs the former:

“…means a place that is…used for the
purpose of playing games…”

Applying the dictionary terms mentioned, the
word “used” might be replaced with “that is made use of”. The plain meaning in
ordinary parlance requires a practice of so employing the premises, or at least
a practice consisting of more than one use or occasion in order to qualify
within the definition. In my view, the application of the definition to embrace
the circumstances of this case would be to put an unnatural extension upon the
simple language form used to describe the “place” which the accused must “keep”
under s. 185(1)  in order to constitute the offence.

[Page 711]

This interpretation of s. 179(1)  is reinforced
by other provisions of the Code relating to disorderly houses. The first
is the definition of a “common betting house”, which is defined in s. 179 of
the Code as follows:

“common betting house” means a place that
is opened, kept or used for the purposes of

(a) enabling, encouraging or
assisting persons who resort thereto to bet between themselves or with the
keeper, or

(b) enabling any person to
receive, record, register, transmit or pay bets or to announce the results of
betting.

It has been generally held by the Courts over
the years that ‘resorting’ connotes habitual or frequent activity; vide
Patterson v. The Queen[7], where
the expression is discussed at p. 162 with reference to a ‘common bawdy house’.
It is impossible to see how a place can be “used” (once) as a common betting
house for certain purposes by persons who “resort thereto” (frequently or
habitually). It is, of course, possible that the word “used” in the definition
of a common betting house was intended to have a different meaning than the
same word in the case of a common gaming house in the same subsection, but that
surely is highly unlikely.

The second provision of the Criminal Code  which
reinforces the construction of ‘use’ as connoting frequent or habitual activity
is the charging section of the Code, (s. 185) which, in express
terms, makes it an offence not to ‘use’ a place, but rather provides that
“everyone who keeps a common gaming house…”, which word ‘keeps’, on authority,
as mentioned above, connotes frequent or habitual behaviour.

This conclusion as to the proper construction of
the word “used” as employed in the definition of ‘common gaming house’ in s.
179 of the Code is further reinforced by an examination of the
historical antecedents and development of the offences relating to disorderly
houses. These offences are collectively dealt with in Part V of the Code. This
task was ably carried out by the learned trial judge in the case at bar with
refer-

[Page 712]

ence to common gaming houses, and it is
sufficient in this regard to refer to that part of his reasons for judgment in
which he discussed this point:

Historically, the keeping of a common
gaming house was also a common or public nuisance, as distinct from a private
nuisance, and as such was also an offence, indictable as a misdemeanour, at
common law. Common gaming houses were said to be “detrimental to the public, as
they promote cheating and other corrupt practices; and incite to idleness and
avaricious ways of gaining property persons whose time might otherwise be
employed for the good of the community.” Bac. Abr. Tit. “Nuisances” (4);
1 Hawk. c. 75, s. 6; Russell on Crime, 12th ed., vol. 2, p. 1442.

The authorities leave little, if any, doubt that
the mischief to which these offences were directed was not the betting, gaming
and prostitution per se, but rather the harm to the interests of the
community in which such activities were carried on in a notorious and habitual
manner. (Vide Jenks v. Turpin[8].)

A similar historical analysis of the offence of
keeping a common bawdy house was carried out by Schroeder J.A. in R. v. Patterson[9], at p. 46 C.C.C., cited with approval by
this Court on appeal [1968] S.C.R. 157 at p. 161:

Viewed in historical perspective the
keeping of a brothel or a common bawdy-house was a common nuisance and, as
such, was indictable as a misdemeanour at common law. It was treated as a
public nuisance “not only in respect of its endangering the public peace by
drawing together dissolute and debauched persons but also in respect of its
apparent tendency to corrupt the manners of both sexes, by such an open
profession of lewdness”: Russell on Crime, 12th ed., vol. 2, p. 1440. It
consisted of maintaining a place to the disturbance of the neighbourhood or for
purposes which were injurious to the public morals, health, convenience or
safety. The maintenance of a nuisance of this character later became the
subject of legislation in England in 1752 when the Disorderly Houses Act, 1752
(U.K.), c. 36, was enacted and the offence is now embraced (sic) in the
provisions of the Sexual Offences Act, 1956 (U.K.), c. 69, s. 33, the
English counterpart of s. 168 (1) (b), (h) and (i) of our Criminal Code .

[Page 713]

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set
aside the conviction of the appellants, and direct the acquittal of the
appellants.

The judgment of Ritchie and Spence JJ. was
delivered by

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an
appeal, by leave, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario
pronounced on the 15th of September 1976 whereby that Court dismissed an appeal
from the judgment of Cannon, Prov. Court Judge, convicting the four appellants
upon a charge of keeping a common gaming house contrary to s. 185  of the Criminal
Code .

The reasons of Martin J.A., giving judgment for
the Court of Appeal for Ontario,
are reported in (1976), 14 O.R. (2d) 604, and contain a complete recital of the
agreed statement of facts which, therefore, need not be repeated here.

The single issue before the Court of Appeal for
Ontario and this Court was whether a place could be found to be a common gaming
house within the definition contained in s. 179(1)  of the Criminal Code  upon
proof of the use of such place for the purpose of gaming on only one occasion.
Neither in the Court of Appeal nor in this Court was any argument advanced that
the accused were others than keepers if the place could be found to be a common
gaming house within the section.

Section 179(1)  of the Criminal Code  defines
“common bawdy-house” and “common gaming house” in these words:

“common bawdy-house” means a place that is

(a) kept or occupied, or

(b) resorted to by one or
more persons for the purpose of prostitution or the practice of acts of indecency;

“common betting house” means a place that
is opened, kept or used for the purpose of

(a) enabling, encouraging or
assisting persons who resort thereto to bet between themselves or with the
keeper, or

(b) enabling any person to
receive, record, register, transmit or pay bets or to announce the results of
betting;

“common gaming house” means a place that is

[Page 714]

(a) kept for gain to which
persons resort for the purpose of playing games, or

(b) kept or used for the
purpose of playing games

(i) in which a bank is kept by one or more
but not all of the players,

(ii) in which all or any portion of the
bets on or proceeds from a game is paid, directly or indirectly, to the keeper
of the place,

(iii) in which, directly or indirectly, a
fee is charged to or paid by the players for the privilege of playing or
participating in a game or using gaming equipment, or

(iv) in which the chances of winning are
not equally favourable to all persons who play the game, including the person,
if any, who conducts the game;

With respect, I am in complete agreement with
the analysis of the effect of these definitions outlined so clearly by Martin
J.A. in his reasons and I share his view that the requirement of frequent
habitual use of the place before there could be a conviction for keeping a common
bawdy-house as made by this Court in Patterson v. The Queen[10], does not apply to a prosecution
for keeping a common gaming house. As Martin J.A. points out, the
addition of the word “use” in para. (b) of the definition of
“common gaming house” must be significant and its appearance as an alternative
to “kept” may properly be interpreted as a legislative authorization of
conviction without proof of the frequent or habitual use required by the words
“kept” and “resort” in para. (a) of the definition of “common
gaming house” and “kept” in para. (b) thereof or the words
“kept” or “occupied” or “resorted to” in the definition of “common
bawdy-house”.

Martin J.A. saw the danger that the
interpretation of the word “use” as encompassing employment of the place on a
single occasion might bring within the prohibition in the section the case
of a few friends having a friendly game of say black jack and simply for
convenience or because of his skill leaving one of them to act as banker. The
learned justice on appeal took some encouragement from the words of Salmond J.
in Weathered v. Fitzgibbon[11], where,
interpreting the words

[Page 715]

“opened, kept or used” at p. 342, he repeated
his own words from an earlier decision:

A man does not keep an illegal
betting-house until and unless his betting transactions are so far generalized
as to the persons with whom he bets, and so far localized as to the place where
they are made, that he can properly be said to maintain a betting
establishment—that is to say, to carry on the business of betting on premises
which he owns, occupies, or keeps for that purpose.

I do not find it necessary to decide such an
issue in dealing with the present appeal. As long ago as 1875, Lord Russell of
Killowen when faced with such a situation said in R. v. Davies[12], at p. 202:

Those are in substance the facts of the
case, and, looking to the purpose of the Act under which this prosecution is
instituted, it is in my opinion monstrous to say that the case falls at all
within the mischief or within the provisions of the statute, which was intended
to prevent the user of a house as a gaming house.

However, as I have said, the issue does not
arise in the present appeal. The accused were not friends engaged in a quiet
game but were conducting a very business-like operation. Indeed, as Martin J.A.
infers, the accused might have been carrying out the very operation that the
legislators aimed at when they added the alternative word “used” to the word
“kept” in para. (b) of the definition of common gaming house. The
“floating crap game” is not a recent invention.

I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Soliciting—Meaning of
“solicit”—Accused smiling at police officer in unmarked car and officer
returning smile—Accused entering officer’s car—Subsequent conversation demonstrating
nothing more than that accused available for prostitution—No evidence of
pressure or persistence on part of accused—Conviction quashed—Criminal Code ,
s. 195.1 .

The Crown was successful in an appeal to the
British Columbia Court of Appeal against the acquittal on a trial de novo in
the County Court of Vancouver of the present appellant on a charge of
soliciting contrary to s. 195.1  of the Criminal Code . Leave to
appeal to this Court was granted on the question whether the Court of Appeal
erred in law in interpreting the meaning of the word “solicit” in
s. 195.1 .

The evidence indicated that a police officer,
while on duty and casually dressed, had brought his unmarked car to a stop at
an intersection. The officer saw the appellant standing on the sidewalk and
while he was looking at her she smiled at him and he smiled in return. The
appellant then got into the car voluntarily and she asked the officer if he
wanted a girl. She stated that she was “a working girl”, “a prostitute”. The
officer answered her question in the affirmative. There was some further
conversation with respect to going to a hotel and this was followed by the
arrest of the appellant when the officer’s car was parked at the hotel.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Martland, Spence, Dickson and Estey JJ.: The charge was that the
accused did solicit “in a public place, to wit, 700 block Helmcken” and
s. 195.1  makes it an offence to solicit “in a public place”. The officer’s
automobile was not a public place within the definition of that term in
s. 179  of the Criminal Code  but was, on the other hand, a private
place of which he had the sole control. This determination would

[Page 477]

have been sufficient to dispose of the appeal
in favour of the appellant.

Even if the word “solicit” were given the
widest possible definition, there was, until the time the automobile door was
closed, no demonstration that the intention of the appellant was to make
herself available for prostitution. It would be ridiculous and abhorrent to say
that every female pedestrian who requests a free ride in an automobile is
soliciting within the provisions of s. 195.1 . Since, however, the issue of
whether or not the officer’s automobile was a “public place” was not before the
Court upon this appeal, the appeal was disposed of as if it had been a “public
place”.

The word solicit is not defined in the Code
and therefore reference must be made to established dictionaries for the
purpose of defining the word. An exact definition from the Shorter Oxford
Dictionary is: “c. of women: to accost and importune (men) for immoral
purposes”. That definition requires, in turn, the definition of the words
“accost” and “importune”. Definitions of “accost” might be summarized as “to
confront”. Of various definitions of “importune” the following was selected:
“To solicit pressingly or persistently; to beset with petitions”.

The appellant did not enter the officer’s car
uninvited. The officer returned her smile and he admitted that one of his
duties was to make it appear that he wanted a girl for sex and that the reason
he immediately returned the smile was to encourage her to solicit him. The
appellant’s conversation with the officer demonstrated nothing more than that
she was available for prostitution. There was nothing pressing or persistent as
was required.

This view of the appeal was strengthened by a
consideration of the changes in the legislation. The old s. 175(1)(c)
(one of the kinds of “vagrancy”, repealed by 1972 (Can.), c. 13, s. 12)
applied only to common prostitutes or night walkers. Section 195.1 , which was
enacted at the same time, applies to “every person”. Section 175(1)(c)
made it an offence for such common prostitute to be in a public place even if
absolutely immobile and silent unless she could give a good account of herself,
while s. 195.1  requires the person to solicit. This indicated that
Parliament wished to require some acts on the part of the person which would
contribute to public inconvenience, and certainly the acts of the present
appellant were not such as would so contribute. In fact, on reading the
statement of facts, one wondered whether the appellant solicited any more than
the complaining officer.

[Page 478]

Accordingly, the appeal must be allowed and
the conviction quashed. However, had the opposite conclusion been arrived at,
then the procedure in Lowry and Lepper v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 195,
would have been adopted, that is, to dismiss the appeal on the merits but remit
the case to the Court of Appeal to pass sentence after receiving any
submissions which the appellant wished to make or have made on her behalf.

Per Ritchie,
Pigeon, Beetz and Pratte JJ.: The word “solicit” as used in s. 195.1 of
the Code carries with it an element of persistence and pressure and
there was no evidence of the existence of such an element in the description of
the appellant’s activities as contained in the evidence. On the other hand, the
police officer’s own testimony to the effect that “one of his duties was to
make it appear as if he wanted a girl for sex” was such as to make it more
appropriate to characterize the appellant’s conduct as “co-operation” rather
than “solicitation”.

on December 5, 1975. By the
latter judgment, His Honour Judge Macdonnell had allowed an appeal from the
conviction of the appellant by a Provincial Court judge on the charge that

[Page 479]

at the City of Vancouver, Province of British
Columbia, on the 8th day of May A.D., 1975 unlawfully did solicit a person, in
a public place, to wit, 700 block Helmcken for the purpose of prostitution

JUL 18 1975

That charge was laid under the provisions of
s. 195.1  of the Criminal Code  which provides:

SOLICITING.

195.1 Every person who solicits any person
in a public place for the purpose of prostitution is guilty of an offence
punishable on summary conviction.

His Honour Judge Macdonnell outlined a statement
of facts which was adopted by Robertson J.A. in the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia which I set out hereunder:

On the appeal, the Crown called one
witness, Detective Barclay of the Vancouver City Police, who gave evidence that
at approximately 9:25 p.m. on May 8th, 1975 while on duty and casually dressed,
he drove his unmarked standard passenger car along Helmcken Street and came to
a stop at the intersection of Granville Street and Helmcken Street in
Vancouver. The officer was alone in the car. The officer believed that he saw
the accused before he stopped the car but in any event, as he pulled up and
stopped, he saw the accused almost immediately standing on the sidewalk of
Helmcken Street approximately one car length from the stop line adjacent to the
stop sign. He had a good look at the appellant and from this look he was able
to describe what she was wearing. While looking at her, the accused smiled at
him and he smiled in return. The appellant then approached the passenger side
of the car, opened the door and got in. Either while she was getting in or when
she had got in the car, the officer again smiled at her. The appellant then sat
in the front seat and closed the door behind her. The conversation that then
took place between them was as follows:


 
  
  Appellant:
  
  
  Hi.
  
 
 
  
  Officer:
  
  
  Hi.
  
 
 
  
  Appellant:
  
  
  Do you want a
  girl?
  
 
 
  
  Officer:
  
  
  What do you mean?
  
 
 
  
  Appellant:
  
  
  Do you want to go
  out?
  
 
 
  
  Officer:
  
  
  Okay.
  
 
 
  
  Appellant:
  
  
  It’s $30.00.
  
 
 
  
  Officer:
  
  
  Oh, gosh, what will
  we do?
  
 
 
  
  Appellant:
  
  
  I am a working
  girl.
  
 
 
  
  Officer:
  
  
  Oh, what’s that?
  
 
 
  
  Appellant:
  
  
  Do you want a
  girl?
  
 


[Page 480]


 
  
  Officer:
  
  
  Okay, yes.
  
 
 
  
  Appellant:
  
  
  I am a working
  girl. I am a prostitute.
  
 
 
  
  Officer:
  
  
  Oh, I’ve never
  done this before.
  
 
 
  
  Appellant:
  
  
  Oh.
  
 
 
  
  Officer:
  
  
  I’m staying at
  the Dufferin.
  
 
 
  
  Appellant:
  
  
  Okay.
  
 
 
  
  Officer:
  
  
  Will you do oral
  sex?
  
 
 
  
  Appellant:
  
  
  You mean a
  french?
  
 
 
  
  Officer:
  
  
  Yeah.
  
 
 
  
  Appellant:
  
  
  Oh, yes.
  
 
 
  
  Officer:
  
  
  Okay.
  
 
 
  
  Appellant:
  
  
  Let’s go.
  
 


Some further conversation then took place
with respect to going to the Dufferin Hotel followed by the arrest of the
appellant when the officer’s car was parked at the rear of the Dufferin Hotel.
Officer Barclay testified that the word “french” meant an act of fellatio, that
the expression “working girl” was a word used by prostitutes to identify
themselves to male customers. On cross-examination, the officer agreed that one
of his duties was to make it appear as if he wanted a girl for sex and that the
reason he immediately returned the smile was to encourage her to solicit him
(for the purpose of prostitution).

The order of this Court granting leave to appeal
provided that:

IT Is ORDERED that Leave to Appeal be
granted on the following question of law:

Whether the Court of Appeal erred in law in
interpreting the meaning of the word “solicit” in Section 195.1  of the Criminal
Code .

The charge which I have recited above was that
the accused did solicit “in a public place, to wit, 700 block Helmcken” and
s. 195.1 , which I have quoted above, makes it an offence to solicit “in a
public place”. The learned County Court judge, in his reasons for judgment,
said, “The officer’s car where it was located was clearly a public place”.

In view of the limitation of the question upon
which leave to appeal was granted, the issue of whether or not the officer’s
car was a “public place” was not referred to in the factums filed on this
appeal, “Public place” is defined for the purpose of Part V of the Criminal
Code  in s. 179  as follows:

[Page 481]

“public place” includes any place to which
the public have access as of right or by invitation, express or implied.

I am most strongly of the opinion that this
officer’s automobile was not such a public place but was, on the other hand, a
private place of which he had the sole control. To interpret the words
otherwise would mean that if I were to invite anyone to enter my own home then
that home would be a public place. In my view, the determination that the
officer’s car was not a public place would have been sufficient to dispose of
the appeal and it must be allowed.

The facts which I have recited above show that
there was not one word spoken until the appellant had entered the automobile
and had closed the door. Even if one were to give to the word “solicit” the
widest possible definition, there was, until the time that automobile door was
closed, no demonstration that the intention of the appellant was to make
herself available for prostitution. I suppose that in Vancouver there are
hundreds of pedestrians every day who request free rides in automobiles, and it
would appear ridiculous and abhorrent to say that every one of them who was
female and who did so was guilty of soliciting within the provisions of this
section of the Criminal Code . Since, however, the issue of whether
or not the officer’s automobile was a “public place” was not before the Court
upon this appeal, I shall proceed to dispose of the appeal as if it had been a
“public place”.

It is evident, of course, that the sole issue
before the learned County Court judge and before the Court of Appeal for
British Columbia was whether the circumstances in this case, so accurately
outlined by the learned County Court judge, fall within the prohibition of the Code,
that is, did the appellant solicit? It must be noted, and it has been noted
below, that the word “solicit” is not defined in the Criminal Code , therefore,
the Courts below have taken what I am of opinion was a proper course and have
turned to established English dictionaries for the purpose of defining the
word. The natural choice, of course, is the Shorter Oxford Dictionary. There,
as has been said, the definition is exact and I quote it:

[Page 482]

c. of women; to accost and importune
(men) for immoral purposes.

Of course, that definition requires, in turn,
the definition of the words “accost” and “importune” and it is noted that the
definition used those two verbs conjunctively and not alternatively. “Accost”
in the same dictionary, is defined:

3. trans., to approach for any
purpose; to face; to make up to;

4. to address;

5. to solicit in the street for an improper
purpose.

I think I might summarize those definitions by
saying “to confront”.

“Importune”, again in the Shorter Oxford
Dictionary, is variously defined and I choose the following:

3. To solicit pressingly or persistently;
to beset with petitions.

It was the view of the Courts below that the
definition of “importune” as “to burden; to trouble; worry, pester, annoy” was
obsolete and I am quite ready to agree that “importune” does not import the
element of pestering or annoying but I am of the opinion that it still
maintains the meaning of “pressing or persisting”.

Robertson J.A., in giving his reasons in the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia, found that there must be “something more”
than the demonstration of intention to make herself available for prostitution
but that “something more” did not necessarily have to be conduct that is
“pressing, persistent, troublesome, worrying, pestering or annoying”. In using
those various adjectives, Robertson J.A. was combining two alternative definitions
of “importune” in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary. As I have said, I agree
that as to the adjectives “troublesome, worrying, pestering or annoying” modern
usage does not require the conduct to amount to compliance therewith but I am
of the opinion that the “something else” is to be “pressing or persistent”
within the definition which I have quoted above.

After having discussed various cases, and set
out the statement of facts which I have cited above, Robertson J.A. said:

[Page 483]

It appears to me that these facts provide
in abundance the something-in-addition that is necessary to constitute the
offence. I refer particularly to the accused getting into the man’s car
uninvited, and to her asking him “Do you want a girl?”, followed by the
statement “I am a working girl, I am a prostitute”.

In the first place, the appellant did not enter
the officer’s car uninvited. The officer returned her smile and, in the last
paragraph of the statement of facts, there is recited the admission of the
officer that one of his duties was to make it appear that he wanted a girl for
sex and that the reason he immediately returned the smile was to encourage her
to solicit him. We are not, however, in this case concerned with any defence of
entrapment. To continue reference to the facts and Robertson J.A.’s
characterization of them, I can find nothing more than the demonstration that
the appellant was available for prostitution in either her question “Do you
want a girl?” or her further statement “I am a working girl. I am a prostitute”
which followed the officer’s reply to her question which was “Okay, yes”.
Therefore, I can find nothing in that conversation which would comply with even
the indefinite “something else” which Robertson J.A. required and certainly I
can find nothing pressing or persistent as I am of the opinion is required.

I am strengthened in this view of the appeal by
considering the changes in the legislation. From 1869 until 1972, there
appeared in penal statutes in Canada as one of the kinds of “vagrancy” the offence
in the Criminal Code  as it appeared in R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34,s. 175(1)(c):

being a common prostitute or night walker
is found in a public place and does not, when required, give a good account of
herself;

That provision was repealed by the Statutes of
Canada, 1972, c. 13, s. 12. Prostitution itself was not then an
offence. The offences of keeping a common bawdy house and of being an inmate of
a common bawdy house were retained by s. 193(1) and (2). At the same time,
s. 195.1  was enacted. The comparison between the old s. 175(1)(c)
and 195.1  is informative. Firstly, 175(1)(c) applied only to common
prostitutes or night walkers. Section 195.1  applies to “every person”.
Secondly, s.

[Page 484]

175(1)(c) made it an offence for such
common prostitute to be in a public place even if absolutely immobile and
silent unless she could give a good account of herself, while s. 195.1 
requires the person to solicit. I am of the opinion that this history of the
legislation indicates that Parliament wished to require some acts on the part
of the person which would contribute to public inconvenience, and certainly the
acts of the present appellant were not such as would so contribute. In fact,
when one reads the statement of facts, one wonders whether the appellant solicited
any more than the complaining officer.

Section 195.1  is enacted in Part V which is
entitled “DISORDERLY HOUSES, GAMING AND BETTING”. Offences in reference to all
three of these subject-matters are offences which do contribute to public
inconvenience or unrest and again I am of the opinion that Parliament was
indicating that what it desired to prohibit was a contribution to public
inconvenience or unrest. The conduct of the appellant in this case cannot be so
characterized.

It would appear that the complaining police
officer, on instructions, was attempting to enforce the provisions of the Criminal
Code  as if they still contained s. 175(1) (c).

I note that my conclusion accords with that of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Rolland[2], and I adopt the judgment of Jessup
J.A.

For the above reasons, I am of the opinion that
the appeal must be allowed and the conviction quashed. However, had I arrived
at the opposite conclusion, I could not simply have dismissed the appeal. The
judgment of the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, from the acquittal and then
continued:

And this Court doth order and adjudge that
the said Debra Hutt be fined the sum of $1.00.

Counsel for the Crown appearing on this appeal
admitted that the accused was not present in Court and made no representations
in reference to the

[Page 485]

sentence. Section 577.1  of the Criminal Code  provides:

Subject to subsection (2), the
accused, other than a corporation, shall be present in court during the whole
of his trial.

Subsection (2) is inapplicable.

This Court in Lowry and Lepper v. The Queen[3] held that when an accused person was
a respondent upon a Crown appeal from an acquittal, then that accused person
was entitled to make representations as to sentence after the Court of Appeal
had allowed an appeal and directed a conviction upon the charge. Despite the
fact that the fine was altogether nominal, I am of the opinion that this
decision applies so that the appellant in this Court, respondent in the Court
of Appeal, Debra Hutt, was entitled to make representations prior to any
imposition of a penalty by the Court of Appeal. Therefore, had I been of the
opinion that the appeal should have been dismissed, I would have had to adopt
the procedure in Lowry and Lepper v. The Queen, supra, that is, to
dismiss the appeal on the merits but remit the case to the Court of Appeal to
pass sentence after receiving any submissions which the appellant wished to
make or have made on her behalf.

In the result, I would allow the appeal and
quash the conviction.

The judgment of Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and
Pratte JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—I have had the advantage of reading
the reasons for judgment prepared for delivery by my brother Spence in which he
has reviewed the facts giving rise to this appeal and has also made reference
to the question of law upon which leave to appeal was granted which is:

Whether the Court of Appeal erred in law in
interpreting the meaning of the word “solicit” in s. 195.1  of the Criminal
Code .

I have concluded that the Court of Appeal did
err in law in interpreting the word “solicit” as used in s. 195.1  in such
manner as to be descriptive of the behaviour of the appellant as disclosed by
the evidence in this case. In this regard I am in accord

[Page 486]

with my brother Spence, but as the appeal, in my
opinion, falls to be determined within the limits of the question upon which
leave to appeal was granted I prefer to base my conclusion on somewhat narrower
grounds than those which he has adopted.

I subscribe to the opinion that the word
“solicit” as used in the section in question carries with it an element of
persistence and pressure and I find no evidence of the existence of such an
element in the description of the appellant’s activities as contained in the
evidence. I am, on the other hand, of the opinion that the police officer’s own
testimony to the effect that “one of his duties was to make it appear as if he
wanted a girl for sex” is such as to make it more appropriate to characterize
the appellant’s conduct as “co-operation” rather than “solicitation”.

For these reasons, I would allow this appeal,
but I do not find it necessary to express any view on the other points referred
to by Mr. Justice Spence.

Appeal allowed and conviction quashed.

first time in the Court of Appeal and by an amendment to the notice of appeal.
The trial was conducted and completed upon an information valid on its face to

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Incomplete evidence—Reopening
of inquiry—Absence of prejudice—Criminal Code , ss. 302  and 643 .

Appellant was convicted by a jury of armed
robbery. An accomplice, Sévigny, who had identified him at the preliminary
inquiry as one of the robbers, refused to testify at the trial. The evidence
given by Sévigny at the inquiry was then read to the jury and the Crown closed
its case. After counsel for the Crown had addressed the jury, counsel for the
appellant argued that appellant had not been identified at the trial as the
Robillard referred to in Sevigny’s testimony. The judge granted the Crown leave
to reopen the inquiry in order to produce this evidence. In the Court of
Appeal, the dissenting judge regarded this as a fatal error, while the two
majority judges held that the trial judge had exercised his discretionary power
judiciously and refused to interfere.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

A trial judge may allow the Crown to submit
additional evidence after the Crown has closed its case, and this power is
discretionary and not subject to the strict limitation accepted by the
dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal, namely that reopening may be allowed
only if “some matter arises ex improviso which no human ingenuity could
have foreseen”. According to the weight of authority, the trial judge may allow
the inquiry to be reopened in order to rectify an inadvertent omission, for
example, and the Court of Appeal may interfere only if it is shown that an
injustice has resulted or that there was some prejudice to the accused.

In the case at bar there could be no doubt
about the identity of the accused. It had been positively established in the
absence of the jury at the voir dire, and all that was required was to
have this evidence repeated before the jury. There was no prejudice to
appellant in the fact that this purely formal evidence was made at that later
stage rather than earlier.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal
of Quebec[1] affirming a verdict
of guilty delivered by a jury. Appeal dismissed.

Roland Blais, Q.C., for the appellant.

Rémi Bouchard, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

PIGEON J.—This appeal, brought as of right on
the basis of the dissent of Casey J.A., is from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal of the province of Quebec, [1975] C.A. 63, affirming the conviction for
armed robbery entered against appellant. Since the judgment does not specify as
required by s. 606  of the Criminal Code  the grounds in law upon
which the dissent is based, I find it useful to quote the major part of Casey
J.A.’s reasons. They include a fair summary of the relevant facts:

The robbery occurred on January 17th, 1971,
and several people were involved, one being Ferland. In due course the Crown
proceeded with his preliminary inquiry and present thereat was one Robillard.
At this inquiry another member of the group—Sevigny—testified and it was he who
identified the robbers, one being the Robillard then present in Court. The next
day Sevigny’s evidence was deposited to serve as proof in Appellant’s
preliminary inquiry.

Called by the Crown at Appellant’s trial
Sevigny refused to testify. He was then found guilty of contempt (p. 200)
following which the Crown (C.C. 643) asked that the evidence given by him at
Ferland’s preliminary inquiry be read to the jury. This was done (p. 312) and
after the Crown had closed its case (p. 35) Appellant declared (p. 36) that he
had no witnesses to offer. After the Crown had addressed the jury, Appellant
(p. 1046) argued that he had not been identified as having been one of the
bandits. His argument was that Sevigny’s deposition, if it identified anyone,
identified the Robil-

[Page 730]

lard who was present in Court during the
Ferland inquiry but that since there was no evidence that he and that Robillard
were the same person there was no case for him to answer.

The Crown then moved that the enquete be
re-opened to permit evidence on the identification issue and this motion was
granted, the trial judge saying, amongst other things:

[TRANSLATION] I am sure that this was an
oversight—that this important factor, this important evidence, was
inadvertently omitted by the Crown in the confusion caused by the fact that
Sevigny did not testify.

In my opinion this was a fatal error.
Having declared his case closed Appellant was entitled to ask the trial judge
to instruct the jury that there was a complete absence of proof on an essential
element and that he, having no case to answer, should be acquitted. Instead of
granting this demand the trial judge re-opened the enquete and allowed the
Crown to produce additional evidence.

We are dealing with evidence introduced
after Appellant had stated that he had no witnesses to offer. In these
circumstances the trial judge’s power to reopen existed only if, in the words
of Sloan, J.A. (Kishen Singh, 76 C.C.C. 248, Day, (1940), 27 Cr.
App. R. 168) “…some matter arises ex improviso which no human ingenuity
could have foreseen”. In the present case the additional evidence does not
satisfy this test; …

On the contrary, Montgomery J.A. stated, with
the concurrence of Bernier J.A.:

The rule followed in England was stated by
Mr. Justice Byrne, giving the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeal in McKenna,
(1956), 40 Cr. App. R. 65. The accused was charged with the illegal export
of goods made of iron or steel. At the close of the prosecution’s case, the
defence submitted that there was no case to answer because the prosecution had
not made evidence that the goods exported were in fact made of such a
substance. The commissioner hearing the case accordingly recalled one of the
prosecution witnesses to make such evidence. The accused was convicted, and his
appeal was dismissed, Byrne J. saying (at pp. 66-67):

It is, in the opinion of this court,
sufficient to say that the course taken by the learned Commissioner is one
which has been recognized as being a perfectly proper course for many years. It
is only necessary to refer to

[Page 731]

Sullivan, (1922),
16 Cr. App. R. 121; [1923] 1 K.B. 47, where it is at once be seen that a judge,
in the circumstances in which the learned Commissioner acted in this case, has
complete discretion whether a witness shall be recalled, and this court will
not interfere with the exercise of his discretion unless it appears that
thereby an injustice has resulted. It is quite obvious that there was no
injustice in this case, and indeed this court is of opinion that without the
evidence of the recalled witness there would have been sufficient evidence for
the case to go to the jury.

In the Sullivan case, cited above,
the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld a murder conviction, although the trial
judge had recalled certain of the Crown’s witnesses to rebut an argument made
by the defence counsel in addressing the jury.

Our own courts have gone even farther,
permitting the Crown to make before a court of appeal formal evidence omitted
at the trial; see Kissick v. R., [1952] 1 S.C.R. 343, where the accused
were charged with conspiracy to sell narcotic drugs. On appeal, it was argued
that there was a defect in the proof that the substance in question was in fact
a narcotic drug. The Manitoba Court of Appeal then permitted the Crown to make
formal proof to this effect. The Supreme Court held that the Court of Appeal
had acted properly in so doing, though Kerwin, J., dissenting, would have
ordered a new trial.

The above case was followed by the Ontario
Court of Appeal in one where the facts bear some resemblance to those now
before us, R. v. Huluszkiw, (1962), 37 C.R. 386. In that case, a witness
who had testified at the preliminary inquiry died before the trial. Her
testimony was placed before the trial judge, who held that he could not
consider it because certain formal proof as to the circumstances under which it
had been given had not been made. On an appeal by the Crown, the Court of
Appeal permitted this proof to be made before it and convicted the accused.
Speaking for the court, McLennan, J.A. said (at p. 390):

It would be unfortunate if the ends of
justice were defeated by the inadvertence of counsel in failing to prove what
is essentially a matter of form in relation to procedure and provided always
that the calling of further evidence, whatever its character, is for an honest
purpose and that there are no unfair consequences to the opposite party so far
as the presentation of that case is concerned. Such was the case in Rex v.
Perreault, (1941), 78 C.C.C. 236, 3 Abr. Con. (2nd) 843, where in a trial
of an accused for man-

[Page 732]

slaughter the Crown through inadvertence
failed to prove that the accused was the driver of the car which killed a
person and permission was given to the Crown to prove this fact after the Crown
had closed its case. No doubt the burden on the Crown to satisfy the Court that
there are no unfair consequences is greater after the defence has closed its case.

In my opinion, the majority decision is correct.
A trial judge may allow the Crown to submit additional evidence after the Crown
has closed its case, and this discretionary power is not subject to the strict
limitation mentioned by Sloan J.A. in Kishen Singh[2]. Moreover, it should be noted that
this strict rule was not applied in that case: on the contrary, the majority,
including Sloan J.A., relied on the unanimous decision of the Ontario Court of
Appeal in R. v. Grégoire[3], to the
effect that it was proper to permit an omission due to inadvertence to be
corrected. In that case, some witnesses had been summoned by the Crown whom the
prosecutor had forgotten to call before closing his case. The defence moved for
a non-suit but the judge permitted the forgotten witnesses to testify. In Kishen
Singh, counsel had omitted to put in evidence the proclamation bringing
into force the statute on which the prosecution was based. (Nowadays such
evidence would clearly not be necessary, in view of s. 23 of the Statutory
Instruments Act, 1970-71-72, c. 38, as interpreted by the majority in The
Queen v. “Evgenia Chandris”[4], according
to the English version, under which a “statutory instrument” shall be
judicially noticed by judges; although the French version would rather suggest
that the document must be put in evidence, since it provides that such an
instrument “sera admis d’office en justice”.)

In Day[5],
the indictment was for forgery. In addition to the document alleged to be
forged, two authentic documents were filed for comparison purposes, but no
handwriting expert was called to testify. The accused testified in his defence
and

[Page 733]

denied having committed the forgery. It was only
after this testimony that, at the suggestion of the judge, the Crown asked that
an expert be permitted to testify. It was not necessary to go as far as the
statement quoted by Casey J.A. to hold that the accused has thus suffered
prejudice. Be that as it may, subsequent as well as earlier cases in the Court
of Criminal Appeal hold that this is a discretionary power which should not be
interfered with unless an injustice has resulted. As pointed out by Montgomery
J.A., the decision so holding in McKenna[6]
in 1956 was based on Sullivan[7],
decided in 1922. A decision to this same effect was also rendered a few years
later in 1962 by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Huluszkiw[8], also cited by Montgomery J.A.

At the hearing, counsel for the appellant relied
on what was said by the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Marsh[9], where the statement made as in Day was
repeated. There too it was unnecessary to go so far. The prejudice was clear.
The trial judge had allowed the jury to view the locus in quo during
their deliberations and, during this visit, the complainant had indicated a
different spot from that mentioned in her evidence.

Although not cited by either side, I think a few
words should be said about the judgment rendered in 1974 by the Court of
Criminal Appeal in Norman Clement Pilcher et al.[10] After the defence had opened its case, the
judge had admitted the evidence of a witness for the Crown who had been
forgotten. The Court of Appeal stated (at p. 5):

…We do not say that in cases like the
present where the matter has not arisen ex improviso the judge had no
kind of discretion at all, but we are firmly of opinion that in cases where the
matter does not arise ex improviso the judge’s discretion should not be
exercised to allow the late introduction of an additional witness called for
the prosecution whose evidence was available before the case for the
prosecution closed. …

[Page 734]

In the end, however, the evidence for the Crown
was found sufficient without the forgotten witness, and the conviction was
affirmed on the ground that the accused had suffered no prejudice. The case is
therefore of no great weight, and it appears to me that the rule established by
the line of cases mentioned by Montgomery J.A. should be adhered to.

Counsel for the appellant contended that, after
deciding to admit further evidence to positively identify the accused as the
Michel Robillard mentioned in the deposition read to the jury, the trial judge
improperly told counsel for the defence:

[TRANSLATION] I am ready to allow you to
present rebuttal evidence …

It was claimed that by these words, the judge
intended to allow the defence to present evidence only to contradict the
additional evidence on identification. I fail to see how such an intention
could be imputed to the trial judge, since there could be no doubt about the
identity of the accused—it had moreover been positively established in the
absence of the jury at the voir dire—and all that was required was to
have this evidence repeated before it. As stated by Montgomery J.A.:

In the course of this trial it was never at
any time questioned that, throughout the proceedings, all references to Michel
Robillard were to the same person. The Crown had in fact made evidence (by the
detective Desjardins, at p. 301) that the Michel Robillard on trial was
the one present at the preliminary inquiry, but this evidence was made in the
absence of the jury, and specific evidence of identity was not made before them
until the Crown was permitted to reopen its case. In my opinion, the jury would
have been entitled to presume from the evidence already before them that there
was only one Michel Robillard, and I question whether the reopening of the case
was really necessary, but I can see no prejudice to Appellant in the fact that
this purely formal evidence was made at that late stage rather than earlier …

Furthermore, counsel for the defence, far from
asking to be allowed to submit evidence, said to the judge:

[TRANSLATION] I request that you allow me
the privilege or right to address the jury after the witness is heard…

[Page 735]

This request was immediately granted by the
judge.

In my opinion, the Court of Appeal did not err
in holding that there was no reason to reconsider the trial judge’s exercise of
his discretion in allowing the case to be reopened.

I therefore conclude that the appeal should be
dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Nudity in a public
place—Meaning of the expression “a person is nude who is so clad”—Deeming
provision—Statutory fiction—“Is” meaning “shall be deemed to be”—Proof of
offending against public decency or order not necessary—Costs of the
appeal—Criminal Code , ss. 138 , 163 , 170 , 771 .

Respondent was charged with an offence under
s. 170(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  in that, without lawful
excuse, he was nude in a public place. He was found guilty by a provincial
magistrate. It is admitted that respondent danced while totally exposed on the
stage in the hotel where he was performing before some 60 persons of both
sexes. The appeal by trial de novo was dismissed by the Superior Court,
but the majority in the Court of Appeal, being of the view that the prosecution
had to establish that the act in question offended against public decency or
order and that the Superior Court ought to have considered and decided whether
the defence urged by respondent amounted to a lawful excuse, quashed the
conviction and remitted the case to the Superior Court. Hence the appeal by the
Crown to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

Since lawful excuse was not urged as a
defence by the respondent, the Court refrains from expressing any view on
whether a legitimate theatrical performance may constitute a lawful excuse for
nudity. The only question for determination by this Court is whether “nude” in
s. 170(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  refers to the sole fact of
complete nudity or whether it should be read in the light of s. 170(2)  so
that it is incumbent upon the prosecution to establish that the nudity offended
against public decency or order.

In the old s. 205A  of the Criminal
Code  the expression used was “shall be deemed to be nude…”. This was
clearly a deeming provision which assimilated scantiness of dress to complete
nudity provided that scantiness of dress was such as to offend against public
decency or order. A deeming provision is a statutory fiction which plays a
function of enlargement. Thus in the old s. 205A ,

[Page 839]

far from restricting the ordinary meaning of
“nude”, the provision enlarged the meaning by bringing scantiness of dress
within its scope. The new version of the Criminal Code  simplified and
shortened the section and “anyone shall be deemed to be nude” was replaced
by “a person is nude”. This change is one of style which does not alter the
deeming nature of the provision. Even though Parliament uses “is”, this is
still a statutory fiction and “nude” in s. 170(1) (a) retains its
normal meaning of total bareness, which however is notionally extended to
certain ways of being clothed by s. 170(2) . The word “nude” simply means
“completely bare”, without reference to public decency or order. It follows
that where there is complete nudity without lawful excuse in a public place,
proof by the accused that the nudity was compatible with public decency or
order is not a defence just as proof that the nudity offended against public
decency or order is not required from the prosecution.

The conviction having been restored,
respondent must pay the fine of $150 which he was condemned to pay. He should
not, however, have to bear the costs of the appeal because the Crown wished a
point of law to be clarified.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal
of Quebec,[1]
allowing the appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court, criminal side,
upholding a conviction by a magistrate. Appeal allowed and conviction restored.

Denis Robert, for the appellant.

Pierre Labrie, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

BEETZ J.—With the consent of the Attorney
General, respondent was charged with an offence under s. 170(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code  in that on May 31, 1975, without lawful excuse, he
was nude in a public place, the Hotel St-Paul in St-Paul of Abbotsford,
District of St-Hyacinthe.

[Page 840]

Respondent was tried by a provincial magistrate,
Dumaine J., who found him guilty and condemned him to pay a fine of $150 or to
one month in gaol for default of payment. Respondent appealed to the Superior
Court but the trial de novo was on the record of the evidence which had
been heard by the provincial magistrate. His appeal was dismissed by Beauregard
J. He further appealed to the Quebec Court of Appeal with leave of that Court.
On January 20, 1977, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, quashed the
conviction and remitted the case to the Superior Court; Bélanger J.A.,
dissenting, would have dismissed the appeal: [1977] C.A. 96. The Crown now
appeals from the judgment of the Court of Appeal, with leave of this Court.

Section 170  of the Criminal Code  provides:

170. (1)
Every one who, without lawful excuse,

(a) is nude in a public place, or

(b) is nude and exposed to public
view while on private property, whether or not the property is his own,

is guilty of an offence punishable on
summary conviction.

(2) For the purpose of this section a
person is nude who is so clad as to offend against public decency or order.

(3) No proceedings shall be commenced under
this section without the consent of the Attorney General.

The facts are not in dispute. Kaufman J.A.,
speaking for himself and for Turgeon J.A. described them as follows (at
p. 97):

The uncontradicted evidence shows that the
Appellant was a “gogo boy”, that is to say a male dancer, who performed on a
stage in the hotel. At one point he was dressed in small “panties”, but as the
performance progressed he took these off and continued to dance while totally
exposed. It was dark in the hall, but a spotlight illuminated the stage. The
music, described as typically “gogo”, was rather fast, and the Appellant’s
testicles and penis “swung back and forth”. A mixed crowd of about 60 persons
watched the performance. Some found it amusing, while others appeared to be
embarrassed.

[Page 841]

The main defence urged by counsel for respondent
before Dumaine J. was to the effect that the sixty persons of both sexes who
watched respondent’s performance had not been shocked having gone to the hotel
to see precisely this sort of spectacle and knowing what to expect; in those
circumstances, respondent had neither offended against public decency nor
breached public order. In the course of argument, Dumaine J. said this was not
a defence; he also expressed the view that while respondent’s performance had
not breached public order, there was no doubt it had offended against public
decency.

In the Superior Court, Beauregard J. made no
finding on those points. The record does not disclose what was argued before
him but, in his short reasons for judgment, he held that the Hotel St-Paul was
a public place within the meaning of s. 138  of the Criminal Code , that
s. 163 , which deals with immoral, indecent or obscene theatrical
performances, did not prevent the application of s. 170  and that, to be
nude within the purview of s. 170  means either to be totally unclothed or
to be so clad as to offend against public decency or order. The main thrust of
this judgment as I understand it is that respondent had infringed s. 170(1) (a)
by the sole fact that he had been completely nude in a public place, whether or
not his nudity had offended against public decency or order.

On the latter point, the majority in the Court
of Appeal reached a different conclusion:

Assuming, then, that Section 170  was not intended
to cover immoral, indecent or obscene theatrical performances, is the
wording sufficiently wide to include nude performers?

The conclusion I have reached—not without
difficulty and indeed some doubt—is that theatrical performances are included,
provided, however, that there is proof that they “offend against public decency
or order”.

This conclusion is based on the wording of
sub-section (2), which states that, “For the purposes of this
section a person is nude who is so clad as to offend against public
decency or order”. It does not say, for instance, that nudity “includes”
persons clad offensively, which would have been a different matter altogether.
But, as it stands, I am satisfied that sub-section (2) is more than just a
definition, and that sub-section (1), even in cases

[Page 842]

of total exposure, must be read with this
in mind. Therefore, in order to convict, proof that the act offended against
public decency or order is an essential element. (Per Kaufman J.A. at
p. 99).

The Court of Appeal also took the view that the
Superior Court ought to have considered and decided whether the defence urged
by respondent amounted to a lawful excuse: nudity might offend against public
decency or order in a cabaret but not in a legitimate theatre and there might
be some overlapping between public decency or order on the one hand and lawful
excuse on the other. Since however, by the terms of s. 771  of the Criminal
Code , appeals to the Court of Appeal in summary conviction matters are
confined to questions of law, the Court of Appeal held that it was precluded
from weighing the evidence and remitted the case to the Superior Court to be
dealt with according to the evidence and the law.

In this Court, neither party challenged the
conclusion of the Court of Appeal that the wording of s. 170  is
sufficiently wide to embrace a performance such as that given by respondent.
Whether respondent had a lawful excuse was not discussed either in the factums
or in oral argument. As I read the record which was before the provincial
magistrate and the Superior Court, it was not argued that respondent had a
lawful excuse in that his dance was part of an overall legitimate theatrical
performance but rather that, in the circumstances of this case, the spectators
could not have been shocked by his dancing in the nude. I cannot distinguish
the latter proposition from the submission that respondent’s nudity had not
offended against public decency or order. Lawful excuse is a defence which must
be urged by the accused. I take it that respondent is no longer urging such a
defence if indeed he ever did. I accordingly refrain from expressing any view
on whether a legitimate theatrical performance may constitute a lawful excuse
for nudity as well as upon other possible examples of lawful excuse which were
discussed below in this and other cases such as escaping from a house on fire,
running away from a rapist, modeling in a lecture hall for art students (on the
assumption that a lecture hall is a public place).

[Page 843]

The only question argued before this Court and
the only one for determination therefore is whether “nude” in s. 170(1) a)
of the Criminal Code  refers to the sole fact of complete nudity or
whether it should be read in the light of s. 170(2)  so that it is
incumbent upon the prosecution to establish that the nudity offended against
public decency or order. In other words, should s. 170(2)  be construed as
restricting the ordinary meaning of nudity for the purposes of the
section or as extending the scope of s. 170(1)  so as to include
within nudity certain ways of being clothed?

This question has recently given rise to
conflicting judicial opinions apart from those expressed below in the instant
case. Thus, in Barbeau v. The Queen, a judgment of the Superior Court[2], dated February 24, 1976, and now inscribed
in appeal, the facts were similar except that the accused was a female dancer;
she was convicted and her appeal by way of trial de novo was dismissed
by Deslandes J. who construed s. 170(2) as extending the scope of
s. 170(1) ; Deslandes J. expressly agreed with the reasons of Beauregard J.
in the present case and declined to follow those of Phelan J. in McCutcheon
v. The Queen, an unreported judgment of the Superior Court, dated
May 7, 1975. The facts were slightly different in the McCutcheon case
where the accused, a female strip-tease artist, had removed all her clothes
save a light, transparent veil fastened at her throat. Phelan J. acquitted the
accused having found that her strip-tease had neither offended the spectators’
sense of decency nor breached public order. But in a somewhat elaborate dictum,
Phelan J. expressed the opinion that s. 170(2) restricted the scope of
s. 170(1) . The Quebec Court of Appeal dismissed the Crown’s appeal in McCutcheon.
Its judgment, also dated January 20, 1977, is reported at (1978), 1 C.R.
(3d) 39[3]. Owen
J.A. agreed with Phelan J. on the law; Lajoie J.A. pointed out that this was
not a case of total nudity and held that the finding of Phelan J. that the
accused’s performance had not offended against public decency or order was one
of fact which could not be reviewed by the

[Page 844]

Court of Appeal; Bélanger J.A. agreed with
Lajoie J.A. but disagreed with Owen J.A. on the law, referring to his dissent
in the case at bar.

In the case at bar, the Court of Appeal said
that s. 170(2) is “more than just a definition” and indicated that the
situation would be different should the subsection provide that nude
persons “include” persons clad offensively. In definition provisions, the word
“includes” is generally used extensively in contradistinction to the
restrictive word “means”. To underline that the word “includes” has not been
used is to suggest, a contrario, that the word “means” might have come
closer to expressing the real intent. The Court of Appeal stopped short at that
point; if that suggestion were accepted, the subsection would be construed
as if it read:

For the purposes of this section, “nude”
means to be so clad as to offend against public decency or order.

An anomalous consequence would follow: to be
clad in a certain way would be an offence under s. 170 ; to be completely
naked would not.

Neither “includes” nor “means” were used and I
think little is to be gained by the consideration of words which are not in the
section.

The key word of s. 170(2) is the verb “is”
in the proposition “a person is nude”. In my opinion “is” here means “shall be
deemed to be”, the very expression used in the predecessor of s. 170  which
was added to the Criminal Code  as s. 205A  by the Statutes of
Canada, 1931, c. 28, s. 2 :

205A. (1)
Every one is guilty of an offence and liable upon summary conviction to three
years’ imprisonment who, while nude,

(a) is found in any public place
whether alone or in company with one or more other persons who are parading or
have assembled with intent to parade or have paraded in such public place while
nude, or

(b) is found in any public place
whether alone or in company with one or more persons, or

[Page 845]

(c) is found without lawful
excuse for being nude upon any private property not his own, so as to be
exposed to the public view, whether alone or in company with other persons, or

(d) appears upon his own property so
as to be exposed to the public view, whether alone or in company with other
persons.

For the purposes of this
subsection any one shall be deemed to be nude who is so scantily clad as
to offend against public decency or order.

(2) No action or prosecution for a
violation of this section shall be commenced without the leave of the
Attorney General for the province in which the offence is alleged to have been
committed.

It was said that s. 205A  was aimed at the
conduct of members of a religious sect who by way of protest sometimes paraded
in the nude. This appears to be substantiated by the text of subs. (1)a)
of s. 205A  although the letter of s. 205A , as that of the present
s. 170 , is broader in scope than would be required to achieve this alleged
purpose and whatever acts or behaviour come within the four corners of the
prohibition are caught by its terms. The problem we have to solve did not arise
under the old section: it forbade nudity, in the normal dictionary sense of
complete nudity, whenever it occurred in a public place, or on a private
property if there was exposure to public view. It would have been easy however
to circumvent the law by the wearing of some microscopic garment. The last
paragraph of s. 205A(1), a deeming provision, accordingly assimilated
scantiness of dress to complete nudity provided that scantiness of dress was
such as to offend against public decency or order. A deeming provision is a
statutory fiction; as a rule it implicitly admits that a thing is not what it
is deemed to be but decrees that for some particular purpose it shall be taken
as if it were that thing although it is not or there is doubt as to whether it
is. A deeming provision artificially imports into a word or an expression an
additional meaning which they would not otherwise convey beside the normal
meaning which they retain where they are used; it plays a function of enlargement
analogous to the word “includes” in certain definitions; however, “includes”
would be logically inappropriate and would sound unreal because of the
fictional aspect of the provision. Thus, a scanti-

[Page 846]

ly dressed person is not really nude; but if
under certain conditions that person be deemed to be nude in a provision
prohibiting nudity, the word “nude” keeps its ordinary meaning which at the
same time is extended to something which is not nudity. That is why, under the
old s. 205A , in cases of complete nudity, it was clearly unnecessary for
the prosecution to prove that the nudity offended against public decency or
order: far from restricting the ordinary meaning of “nude”, the deeming
provision preserved that meaning and at the same time enlarged it by bringing
scantiness of dress within its scope.

Explicit deeming provisions having the same
effect are still to be found in the present Criminal Code . For instance,
s. 308 (b)(ii) extends the meaning of breaking and entering to entry
without lawful justification.

Old s. 205A was given its present form as
s. 159 in the 1953-54 revision of the Code, c. 51. The maximum
sentence was shortened; the defence of lawful excuse was generalized; it must
also have been thought that the expression “so scantily clad” was inadequate
since one can imagine ways of being heavily clothed which are capable of
offending against public decency or order; the provision was refined
accordingly; finally, the whole section was shortened and simplified
although there is nothing to indicate that its general intent was otherwise
modified.

In that process of simplification, the words
“anyone shall be deemed to be nude” were replaced by the words “a person is
nude”. In my view, this change did not alter the deeming nature of the
provision; it merely expressed it in a simpler and more figurative way, a
matter of style, not of substance. To say in a statute that a person is nude
when he is clothed is to create a legal fiction whether the verb “is” or the
expression “shall be deemed to be” are used: even Parliament cannot turn
fiction into reality whatever words it uses. Because of that fiction, “nude” in
s. 170(1) a) retains its normal dictionary meaning of total bareness
which however is notionally extended to certain ways of being clothed by
s. 170(2). To hold otherwise involves an unwarranted departure from the
ordinary sense of the word “nude”; “nude”

[Page 847]

does not mean “shockingly bare”, or “offensively
bare”; it simply means “completely bare”, without reference to public decency
or order. If the Court of Appeal is right, s. 170(1) a) should
be construed as if it read:

is nude in a public place so as to offend
against public decency or order.

Parliament could easily have said so if that is
what it intended but it did not.

Section 170(2) is not the only one in the Criminal
Code  where the verb “is” must be taken in the sense of “shall be deemed to
be”. Section 649(5)  provides:

An application for leave to appeal is an
appeal for the purposes of this section.

An application for leave to appeal is clearly
not an appeal. Here again the verb “is” constitutes a short-hand way of saying
“shall be deemed to be”.

Counsel for respondent drew our attention to
s. 16(2)  of the Criminal Code  which defines insanity:

For the purposes of this section a
person is insane when he is in a state of natural imbecility or has a disease
of the mind to an extent that renders him incapable of appreciating the nature
and quality of an act or omission or of knowing that an act or omission is
wrong.

The submission was that as s. 16(2) 
provides an exhaustive definition of insanity, s. 170(2), which is
structurally drafted in the same manner, should similarly be construed as an
exhaustive definition of nudity. I disagree. The proposition “a person is insane”
in s. 16(2)  is not a deeming provision because natural imbecility or a
disease of the mind do qualify as insanity. No legal fiction is involved there
as in saying that a person is nude who is clad in a certain way. Also and as
was noted above, such an exhaustive definition of nudity would entail an
incongruous result in excluding complete nudity from the reach of the section.

Counsel for respondent argued in his factum that
the matter had been resolved by the decision

[Page 848]

of this Court in Johnson v. The Queen[4]. I do not think so. Appellant in
that case had been charged with an offence under what is now s. 163(2)  of
the Criminal Code  in that she had unlawfully appeared as a performer in
an immoral performance, having danced in the nude in a theatre before a paying
audience. This Court held that the trial judge and the Appellate Division had
erred in holding that s. 170  is to be construed as meaning that nudity in
a public place constitutes an immoral performance within the meaning of
s. 163(2) ; accordingly the prosecution could not obtain a conviction for
an immoral performance under s. 163(2)  simply by proving total nakedness
and referring to s. 170 . It is true that my brother Ritchie who spoke for
the majority said (at p. 172) that s. 170  is confined to the case of
a person “who is so clad as to offend against public decency or order”. But the
question whether nudity per se is an offence under s. 170(1)  did
not arise in the Johnson case. All that was decided was that nudity per
se is not immoral for the purpose of s. 163(2) . Furthermore, my
brother Ritchie explicitly refrained from expressing any opinion (and I do not
express any either) as to what the result would have been had the appellant in
the Johnson case been charged with participating in an indecent
performance (at p. 174). In my view, Bélanger J.A. correctly interpreted
the Johnson case and I agree with the following reasons of his
dissenting opinion (at p. 102):

[TRANSLATION] In my view this decision is
authority only for the following proposition: the Crown cannot obtain a
conviction for taking part in an immoral performance (s. 163(2)  C.C.) by
restricting its evidence to the total nudity of the performer and referring
only to s. 170  C.C. as establishing its immoral character. It
cannot be concluded from the same decision that a person who is completely
nude, without lawful excuse, in a public place may be found guilty of the
offence in s. 170  C.C. only on evidence that this nudity offended
against public decency or order. In my view this latter evidence is required
only in cases where the accused was not completely nude and the Crown wished
him to be considered as having been nude. The offence we are

[Page 849]

concerned with is that of being nude in a
public place without lawful excuse, nothing more. In reality one cannot be nude
in different ways; however, one can be dressed in many different ways that
amount to nudity if, for the purposes of the Act, these ways offend against
public decency and order. I would add that nude or clothed, one can behave
immorally: it is not such behaviour which concerns us at present.

Counsel for respondent referred us to the case
of Regina v. Benolkin et al.[5]
where three young men who had been swimming in the nude in the South
Saskatchewan River were charged and convicted under s. 170(1) a).
McPhefson J. of the Saskatchewan Queen’s Bench quashed their conviction holding
that their conduct was neither disorderly, indecent or immoral, which was their
lawful excuse. Earlier in the course of his judgment he had said (at p. 207):

Whatever the technicalities of procedure
may be, I am of the view that the acts of the accused in the circumstances did
not constitute an offence and that the convictions should be quashed. It cannot
be an offence to swim in the nude at a lonely place in Canada in summer. That
is part of the pleasure of summer in Canada, particularly to young males. If
somebody comes along unexpectedly or if the swimmer misjudged the loneliness of
the place the act cannot suddenly become criminal.

Section 170  was “aimed at such conduct as
was exhibited not infrequently by members of a certain radical religious sect”,
per Spence J., in Johnson v. The Queen (1973), 13 C.C.C.
(2d) 402 at p. 417, 40 D.L.R. (3d) 215, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 160. It certainly
was not aimed at nude swimming, or nudity on a shore in a lonely place, public
or not.

I am not called upon to say whether there was
lawful excuse in that case. But where there is complete nudity without lawful
excuse in a public place, proof by the accused that the nudity was compatible
with public decency or order is not a defence in my opinion just as proof that
the nudity offended against public decency or order is not required from the
prosecution. On the other hand, lawful excuse is a full defence even if it is
proved that the nudity did offend against public decency or order.

[Page 850]

It was finally submitted in respondent’s factum
that while charges for much more serious offences do not require the consent of
the Attorney General, still this consent is necessary for proceedings to
commence under s. 170  as under ss. 124 (contradictory evidence),
162 (restriction of publication of reports of judicial proceedings), 281.1
(advocating genocide), 281.2 (public incitement of hatred), 281.3 (seizure of
hate propaganda), 343 (fraudulent concealment of title documents) and 380
(criminal breach of contract). The provisions creating those offences, it was
contended, have one common feature: they restrict fundamental civil liberties
and should be construed accordingly. I fail to see how the requirement of the
Attorney General’s consent can be of help in construing such a variety of
provisions and, while I have had occasion to read many bills of rights, I have
yet to find one where public nudity was declared to be a matter of fundamental
freedom.

The laying of charges under s. 170  instead
of s. 163  in theatrical performance cases was disapproved of by some
members of the Bench as an attempt to sidestep the obligation to prove
immorality, indecency or obscenity. That was the view expressed in the McCutcheon
case by Owen J.A. who added (at p. 50):

If the proper interpretation of s. 170 
Cr. C. is that in all prosecutions under that section the Crown
must show that the nudity involved offended against public decency or order
there would not be the same temptation to invoke s. 170  Cr. C. for
purposes other than that for which it was intended. Otherwise this abuse could
be avoided if the Attorney General would refuse to give his consent to the
commencement of the proceedings under s. 170  Cr. C with respect to
theatrical performances which are adequately covered by s. 163  Cr. C.

With deference, I do not think that we should
endeavour to construe the Criminal Code  so as to make the task of the
prosecution easier or more difficult. The selection of the charges is entirely
a matter for the Crown. The consent of the Attorney General in a case such as
this one is also discretionary. And if it be thought that a provision of the

[Page 851]

Code is imperfect or has become antiquated, it
is for Parliament to change it.

I have come to the conclusion that the appeal
must be allowed. In his factum, respondent prays that if such be the case he be
not condemned to pay the costs. I agree. We have occasionally granted leave to
the Crown in summary conviction cases provided it undertook to pay respondent’s
costs on a solicitor-client basis. (See The Queen v. Moreau, a case
which has been heard on March 15, 1978, and which has been reserved[6]; see also The Queen v. Chapin, where
leave to appeal was granted on January 24, 1978.) Respondent was condemned to
pay a fine of $150. He should not have to bear all the costs of being brought
to this Court in a case of this kind because the Crown wishes a point of law to
be clarified.

I would allow the appeal without costs in this Court,
set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of the
Superior Court.

Appeal allowed without costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Public welfare offences—Mens
rea—Reasonable mistake as a defence—Scope of defence of due diligence—Offences
not requiring proof of mens rea but not strict liability offences.

Criminal law—Duplicity—Water
pollution—Provision prohibiting discharging or depositing or causing or
permitting discharge that may impair water quality—Test for duplicity—The
Ontario Water Resources Commission Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 332, s. 32(1)—Criminal
Code , ss. 724 , 731 .

The respondent City entered into an agreement
with a company for the disposal of all refuse originating in the City. The
company was to furnish a site and adequate labour, material and equipment. The
site selected bordered Cannon Creek which runs into Root River. The method of disposal adopted was the “area” or “continuous
slope” method of sanitary land fill, whereby garbage is compacted in layers
which are covered each day by natural sand or gravel. The side had previously
been covered with a number of fresh water springs that flowed into the creek.
Material was dumped to submerge these springs and the garbage and wastes dumped
over this material, ultimately to within twenty feet of the creek. Pollution
resulted and the company was convicted of a breach of s. 32(1) of The Ontario Water Resources Commission
Act. The City also charged under that section,
which provides that every municipality or person that discharges, or deposits,
or causes, or permits the discharge or deposit of any material of any kind into
any water course, or on any shore or bank thereof is guilty of an offence. In
dismissing the charge against the City the trial judge found that the City had
nothing to do with the actual operations, that the company was an independent
contractor and that its employees were not employees of the City. On appeal by
trial de novo the judge found that the offence was one of

[Page 1300]

strict liability and he convicted. The Divisional Court set aside the charge as
duplicitous and also held that it required mens rea with respect to
causing or permitting the discharge. The Court of Appeal, while rejecting the
ground of duplicity as a basis to quash, as there had been no challenge to the
information at trial, agreed that mens rea was required and ordered a
new trial.

Held: The
appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed.

The primary test for duplicity should be the
practical one based on the only valid justification for the rule against
duplicity, the requirement that the accused know the case he has to meet and be
not prejudiced in the preparation of his defence by ambiguity in the charge. In
this case there was nothing ambiguous or uncertain in the charge.
Section 32(1) is concerned with only one matter, pollution, and only one
generic offence was charged, the essence of which was “polluting”. As the
charge was not duplicitous it was not necessary to consider whether a duplicity
objection can be raised for the first time on appeal.

Regarding mens rea the distinction
between the true criminal offence and the public welfare offence is of prime
importance. Where the offence is criminal mens rea must be established
and mere negligence is excluded from the concept of the mental element required
for conviction. In sharp contrast “absolute liability” entails conviction on
mere proof of the prohibited act without any relevant mental element. The
correct approach in public welfare offences is to relieve the Crown of the
burden of proving mens rea, having regard to Pierce Fisheries, [1971]
S.C.R. 5, and to the virtual impossibility in most regulatory cases of proving
wrongful intention, and also, in rejecting absolute liability, admitting the
defence of reasonable care. This leaves it open to the defendant to prove that
all due care has been taken. Thus while the prosecution must prove beyond
reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the prohibited act, the defendant
need only establish on the balance of probabilities his defence of reasonable
care. Three categories of offences are therefore now recognised (first)
offences in which mens rea must be established, (second) offences of
“strict liability” in which mens rea

[Page 1301]

need not be established but where the defence
of reasonable belief in a mistaken set of facts or the defence of reasonable
care is available, and (third) offences of “absolute liability” where it is not
open to the accused to exculpate himself by showing that he was free of fault.
Offences which are criminal are in the first category. Public welfare offences
are prima facie in the second category. Absolute liability offences
would arise where the legislature has made it clear that guilt would follow on
mere proof of the proscribed act.

Section 32(1) being a provincial
enactment does not create an offence which is criminal in the true sense; and
further the words “cause” and “permit” which are frequently found in public
welfare statutes do not denote clearly either full mens rea or absolute liability
and therefore fit much better into an offence of the strict liability class. As
the City did not lead evidence directed to a defence of due diligence and the
trial judge did not address himself to the availability of such a defence there
should be a new trial to determine whether the City was without fault.

APPEAL and CROSS APPEAL from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] allowing
an appeal by the Crown and ordering a new trial after a judgment of the
Divisional Court[2]
allowing an appeal by the accused and quashing, after trial de novo, a
conviction on a charge under s. 32(1) of The Ontario Water Resources
Commission Act.

R.M. McLeod and J.N. Mulvaney, Q.C., for
the appellant.

R.J. Rolls, Q.C., and R.S. Harrison, for
the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON J.—In the present appeal the Court is
concerned with offences variously referred to as “statutory,” “public welfare,”
“regulatory,” “absolute liability,” or “strict responsibility,” which are not
criminal in any real sense, but are prohibited in the public interest. (Sherras
v. De Rutzen[3]) Although
enforced as penal laws through the utilization of the machinery of the criminal
law, the offences are in substance of a civil nature

[Page 1303]

and might well be regarded as a branch of
administrative law to which traditional principles of criminal law have but
limited application. They relate to such everyday matters as traffic
infractions, sales of impure food, violations of liquor laws, and the like. In
this appeal we are concerned with pollution.

The doctrine of the guilty mind expressed in
terms of intention or recklessness, but not negligence, is at the foundation of
the law of crimes. In the case of true crimes there is a presumption that a
person should not be held liable for the wrongfulness of his act if that act is
without mens rea: (R. v. Prince[4]; R. v. Tolson[5]; R. v. Rees[6]; Beaver v. The Queen[7]; R. v. King[8]). Blackstone made the point over two
hundred years ago in words still apt: “…to constitute a crime against human
law, there must be first a vicious will, and secondly, an unlawful act
consequent upon such vicious will…,” 4 Comm. 21. I would emphasise at the
outset that nothing in the discussion which follows is intended to dilute or
erode that basic principle.

The appeal raises a preliminary issue as to
whether the charge, as laid, is duplicitous, and if so, whether ss. 732(1)  and
755(4)  of the Criminal Code  preclude the accused City of Sault Ste.
Marie from raising the duplicity claim for the first time on appeal. It will be
convenient to deal first with this preliminary point and then consider the
concept of liability in relation to public welfare offences.

The City of Sault Ste. Marie was charged that it
did discharge, or cause to be discharged, or permitted to be discharged, or
deposited materials into Cannon Creek and Root River, or on the shore or bank
thereof, or in such place along the

[Page 1304]

side that might impair the quality of the water
in Cannon Creek and Root River, between March 13, 1972 and September 11, 1972. The charge was laid
under s. 32(1)[9] of The
Ontario Water Resources Commission Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 332, which provides
so far as relevant, that every municipality or person that discharges, or
deposits, or causes, or permits the discharge or deposit of any material of any
kind into any water course, or on any shore or bank thereof, or in any place
that may impair the quality of water, is guilty of an offence and, on summary
conviction, is liable on first conviction to a fine of not more than $5,000 and
on each subsequent conviction to a fine of not more than $10,000, or to
imprisonment for a term of not more than one year, or to both fine and
imprisonment.

Although the facts do not rise above the
routine, the proceedings have to date had the anxious consideration of five
courts. The City was acquitted in Provincial Court (Criminal Division), but convicted following a trial de novo on
a Crown appeal. A further appeal, by the City, to the Divisional
 Court was allowed and the conviction quashed. The
Court of Appeal for Ontario on
yet another appeal directed a new trial. Because of the importance of the legal
issues, this Court granted leave to the Crown to appeal and leave to the City
to cross-appeal.

To relate briefly the facts, the City on
November 18, 1970 entered into an agreement with Cherokee Disposal and
Construction Co. Ltd., for the disposal of all refuse originating in the City.
Under the terms of the agreement, Cherokee became obligated to furnish a site
and adequate labour, material and equipment. The site selected bordered Cannon
Creek which, it would appear, runs

[Page 1305]

into the Root River. The method of disposal adopted is
known as the “area”, or “continuous slope” method of sanitary land fill,
whereby garbage is compacted in layers which are covered each day by natural
sand or gravel.

Prior to 1970, the site had been covered with a
number of fresh-water springs that flowed into Cannon Creek. Cherokee dumped
material to cover and submerge these springs and then placed garbage and wastes
over such material. The garbage and wastes in due course formed a high mound
sloping steeply toward, and within twenty feet of, the creek. Pollution
resulted. Cherokee was convicted of a breach of s. 32(1) of The Ontario
Water Resources Commission Act, the section under which the City has
been charged. The question now before the Court is whether the City is also
guilty of an offence under that section.

In dismissing the charge at first instance, the
judge found that the City had had nothing to do with the actual disposal
operations, that Cherokee was an independent contractor and its employees were
not employees of the City. On the appeal de novo Judge Vannini found the
offence to be one of strict liability and he convicted. The Divisional Court in setting aside the
judgment found that the charge was duplicitous. As a secondary point, the Divisional Court also held that the charge
required mens rea with respect to causing or permitting a discharge.
When the case reached the Court of Appeal that Court held that the conviction
could not be quashed on the ground of duplicity, because there had been no
challenge to the information at trial. The Court of Appeal agreed, however,
that the charge was one requiring proof of mens rea. A majority of the
Court (Brooke and Howland JJ.A.) held there was not sufficient evidence to
establish mens rea and ordered a new trial. In the view of
Mr. Justice Lacourcière, dissenting, the inescapable inference to be drawn
from the findings of fact of Judge Vannini was that the City had known of the
potential impairment of waters of Cannon Creek and Root River and had failed to exercise its clear powers of control.

[Page 1306]

The divers, and diverse, judicial opinions to
date on the points under consideration reflect the dubiety in these branches of
the law.

The Duplicity Point

Turning then to the question of duplicity, and
whether the information charged the City with several offences, or merely one
offence which might be committed in different modes. The argument is that s.
32(1) of The Ontario Water Resources Commission Act charges three
offences: (i) discharging; (ii) causing to be discharged; (iii) permitting to
be discharged, deleterious materials. The applicable principle is
well-established: if the information in one count charges more than one
offence, it is bad for duplicity: Kipp v. Attorney-General for Ontario[10].

The rule against multiplicity of charges in an
information is contained in s. 724(1) of the Code which reads as
follows:

724. (1) In
proceedings to which this Part applies, the information…

(b) may charge more than one
offence or relate to more than one matter of complaint, but where more than one
offence is charged or the information relates to more than one matter of
complaint, each offence or matter of complaint, as the case may be, shall be
set out in a separate count.

Section 731 (a) provides, however,
that no information shall be deemed to charge two offences by reason only that
it states that the alleged offence was committed in different modes.

Several tests have been suggested for
determining whether an indictment or information is multiplicitous. Probably
the best known test is that enunciated by Avory J. in R. v. Surrey Justices, ex parte Witherick[11], at p. 452. The charge was that of
driving without due care and attention and without reasonable consideration for
other persons. Avory J. said that, if a person may do one without the other, it
followed as a matter of law that an information which charged him in the
alternative would be bad. In R. v. Madill[12] (No. 1), at p. 210, Ford J.A.
applied the test of “…whether evidence

[Page 1307]

can be given of distinct acts, committed by the
person charged, constituting two or more offences,” and in R. v. International
Nickel Co. of Canada[13], at
p. 48, Arnup J.A. expressed the view that if a section containing two or
more elements is to be construed as containing only one offence, one must be
able to state with precision the essence of the single offence.

Each of these tests is helpful as far as it
goes, but each is too general to provide a clear demarcation in concrete instances.
This is shown by the variety of cases and the diversity of opinion in this case
itself. To resolve the matter one must recall, I think, the policy basis of the
rule against multiplicity and duplicity. The rule developed during a period of
extreme formality and technicality in the preferring of indictments and laying
of informations. It grew from the humane desire of judges to alleviate the
severity of the law in an age when many crimes were still classified as
felonies, for which the punishment was death by the gallows. The slightest
defect made an indictment a nullity. That age has passed. Parliament has made
it abundantly clear in those sections of the Criminal Code  having
to do with the form of indictments and informations that the punctilio of an
earlier age is no longer to bind us. We must look for substance and not petty
formalities.

The duplicity rule has been justified on two
grounds: to be fair to the accused in the preparation of his defence, and to
enable him to plead autrefois convict in the future. As Avory J. said in
R. v. Surrey Justices, ex parte Witherick, supra, at p. 452:

It is an elementary principle that an
information must not charge offences in the alternative, since the defendant
cannot then know with precision with what he is charged and of what he is
convicted and may be prevented on a future occasion from pleading autrefois
convict.

[Page 1308]

The problem of raising a defence of autrefois
convict is illusory even when there is duplicity. It is difficult to see as
a practical matter why the Crown would begin new proceedings after having just
concluded a successful prosecution. Even if there were a prosecution, it could
not succeed. Assume conviction of the City on a charge of (i) discharging; (ii)
causing discharge of; (iii) permitting discharge of pollutant at a stated time
and place. If another charge were laid at a later date in respect of (i) or
(ii) or (iii), as related to the same pollutant and the same time and place,
the new charge would be based on the same cause or matter which had already
formed the basis of a conviction, and a further conviction would be barred: Kienapple
v. The Queen[14]. It
is equally clear that no problem of autrefois acquit arises, even where
there is duplicity, because an acquittal means acquittal on all the offences
charged, and thus there is no difficulty in raising the defence of autrefois
acquit to a later charge of one of the same offences alone.

In my opinion, the primary test should be a
practical one, based on the only valid justification for the rule against
duplicity: does the accused know the case he has to meet, or is he prejudiced
in the preparation of his defence by ambiguity in the charge? Viewed in that
light, as well as by the other tests mentioned above, I think we must conclude
that the charge in the present case was not duplicitous. There is nothing
ambiguous or uncertain in the charge. The City knew the case it had to meet.
Section 32(1) of The Ontario Water Resources Commission Act is
concerned with only one matter, pollution. That is the gist of the charge and
the evil against which the offence is aimed. One cognate act is the subject of
the prohibition. Only one generic offence was charged, the essence of which was
“polluting,” and that offence could be committed in one or more of several
modes. There is nothing wrong in specifying alternative methods of committing
an offence, or in embellishing the periphery, provided only one offence is to
be found at the focal point of the charge. Further-

[Page 1309]

more, although not determinative, it is not
irrelevant that the information has been laid in the precise words of the
section.

I am satisfied that the Legislature did not
intend to create different offences for polluting, dependent upon whether one
deposited, or caused to be deposited, or permitted to be deposited. The
legislation is aimed at one class of offender only, those who pollute.

In R. v. Matspeck Construction Co.
Ltd.[15], Hughes
J. considered the very section now under study and, adopting the approach
I favour, concluded that the charge was not duplicitous. The judge said, at p.
732:

There can be no doubt in the mind of
accused that he is charged with having in one mode or another, discharged or
deposited material into water and that this material may have impaired its
quality.

On the other hand, in the English case of Ross
Hillman Limited v. Bond[16], where
very similar language was used, May J. said, p. 291, that the Act (in
that case s. 40 (5)(b) of the Road Traffic Act, 1972)
created three distinct types of offence. I think that the authority of the
English cases in this area of the law must be carefully considered and their
aid discounted to the extent that the statutory provisions applicable differ
from those contained in our Code.

I conclude that the charge in this case is not
duplicitous. It is unnecessary, therefore, to consider whether a defendant can
raise a duplicity objection for the first time on appeal.

The Mens Rea Point

The distinction between the true criminal
offence and the public welfare offence is one of prime importance. Where the
offence is criminal, the Crown must establish a mental element, namely, that
the accused who committed the prohibited act did so intentionally or
recklessly, with knowledge of the facts constituting the offence, or with
wilful blindness toward them. Mere negligence is excluded from the concept of
the mental

[Page 1310]

element required for conviction. Within the
context of a criminal prosecution a person who fails to make such enquiries as
a reasonable and prudent person would make, or who fails to know facts he
should have known, is innocent in the eyes of the law.

In sharp contrast, “absolute liability” entails
conviction on proof merely that the defendant committed the prohibited act
constituting the actus reus of the offence. There is no relevant
mental element. It is no defence that the accused was entirely without fault.
He may be morally innocent in every sense, yet be branded as a malefactor and
punished as such.

Public welfare offences obviously lie in a field
of conflicting values. It is essential for society to maintain, through
effective enforcement, high standards of public health and safety. Potential
victims of those who carry on latently pernicious activities have a strong
claim to consideration. On the other hand, there is a generally held revulsion
against punishment of the morally innocent.

Public welfare offences evolved in midnineteenth
century Britain: (R. v. Woodrow[17] and R. v. Stephens[18]) as a means of doing away with the
requirement of mens rea for petty police offences. The concept was a
judicial creation, founded on expediency. That concept is now firmly imbedded
in the concrete of Anglo-American and Canadian jurisprudence, its importance
heightened by the every‑increasing complexities of modern society.

Various arguments are advanced in justification
of absolute liability in public welfare offences. Two predominate. Firstly, it
is argued that the protection of social interests requires a high standard of
care and attention on the part of those who follow certain pursuits and such
persons are more likely to be stimulated to maintain those standards if they
know that ignorance or mistake will not excuse them. The removal of any
possible loophole acts, it is said, as an incentive to take precaution-

[Page 1311]

ary measures beyond what would otherwise be
taken, in order that mistakes and mishaps be avoided. The second main argument
is one based on administrative efficiency. Having regard to both the difficulty
of proving mental culpability and the number of petty cases which daily come
before the Courts, proof of fault is just too great a burden in time and money
to place upon the prosecution. To require proof of each person’s individual
intent would allow almost every violator to escape. This, together with the
glut of work entailed in proving mens rea in every case would clutter
the docket and impede adequate enforcement as virtually to nullify the
regulatory statutes. In short, absolute liability, it is contended, is the most
efficient and effective way of ensuring compliance with minor regulatory
legislation and the social ends to be achieved are of such importance as to
override the unfortunate by‑product of punishing those who may be free of
moral turpitude. In further justification, it is urged that slight penalties
are usually imposed and that conviction for breach of a public welfare offence
does not carry the stigma associated with conviction for a criminal offence.

Arguments of greater force are advanced against
absolute liability. The most telling is that it violates fundamental principles
of penal liability. It also rests upon assumptions which have not been, and
cannot be, empirically established. There is no evidence that a higher standard
of care results from absolute liability. If a person is already taking every
reasonable precautionary measure, is he likely to take additional measures,
knowing that however much care he takes, it will not serve as a defence in the
event of breach? If he has exercised care and skill, will conviction have a
deterrent effect upon him or others? Will the injustice of conviction lead to
cynicism and disrespect for the law, on his part and on the part of others?
These are among the questions asked. The argument that no stigma attaches does
not withstand analysis, for the accused will have suffered loss of time, legal
costs, exposure to the processes of the criminal law at trial and, however one
may

[Page 1312]

downplay it, the opprobrium of conviction. It is
not sufficient to say that the public interest is engaged and, therefore, liability
may be imposed without fault. In serious crimes, the public interest is
involved and mens rea must be proven. The administrative argument has
little force. In sentencing, evidence of due diligence is admissible and
therefore the evidence might just as well be heard when considering guilt.
Additionally, it may be noted that s. 198 of The Highway Traffic Act of
Alberta, R.S.A. 1970, c. 169, provides that upon a person being charged with an
offence under this Act, if the judge trying the case is of the opinion that the
offence (a) was committed wholly by accident or misadventure and without
negligence, and (b) could not by the exercise of reasonable care or precaution
have been avoided, the judge may dismiss the case. See also s. 230(2) of the Manitoba Highway Traffic Act, R.S.M. 1970, c. H60, which has a similar effect. In these instances
at least, the Legislature has indicated that administrative efficiency does not
foreclose inquiry as to fault. It is also worthy of note that historically the
penalty for breach of statutes enacted for the regulation of individual conduct
in the interests of health and safety was minor, $20 or $25; today, it may
amount to thousands of dollars and entail the possibility of imprisonment for a
second conviction. The present case is an example.

Public welfare offences involve a shift of
emphasis from the protection of individual interests to the protection of
public and social interests. See Sayre, Public Welfare Offences (1933),
33 Colum. L. Rev. 55; Hall, Principles of Criminal Law, (1947), ch. 13;
Perkins, The Civil Offence (1952), 100 U. of Pa. L. Rev. 832; Jobson, Far
From Clear, 18 Crim. L. Q. 294. The unfortunate tendency in many past cases
has been to see the choice as between two stark alternatives; (i) full mens
rea; or (ii) absolute liability. In respect of public welfare
offences (within which category pollution offences fall) where full mens rea
is not required, absolute liability has often been imposed. English
jurisprudence has consistently maintained this dichotomy: see Hals. (4th ed.),
Vol. II, Crimi-

[Page 1313]

nal Law, Evidence and Procedure, para. 18. There has, however, been an attempt in Australia, in many Canadian courts, and
indeed in England, to seek a
middle position, fulfilling the goals of public welfare offences while still
not punishing the entirely blameless. There is an increasing and impressive
stream of authority which holds that where an offence does not require full mens
rea, it is nevertheless a good defence for the defendant to prove that he
was not negligent.

Dr. Glanville Williams has written: “There is a
half-way house between mens rea and strict responsibility which has not
yet been properly utilized, and that is responsibility for negligence,” (Criminal
Law (2d ed.): The General Part, p. 262). Morris and Howard, in Studies
in Criminal Law, (1964), p. 200, suggest that strict responsibility might
with advantage be replaced by a doctrine of responsibility for negligence
strengthened by a shift in the burden of proof. The defendant would be allowed
to exculpate himself by proving affirmatively that he was not negligent.
Professor Howard (Strict Responsibility in the High Court of Australia, 76
L.Q.R. 547) offers the comment that English law of strict responsibility in
minor statutory offences is distinguished only by its irrationality, and then
has this to say in support of the position taken by the Australian High Court,
at p. 548:

Over a period of nearly sixty years since
its inception the High Court has adhered with consistency to the principle that
there should be no criminal responsibility without fault, however minor the
offence. It has done so by utilizing the very half-way house to which Dr.
Williams refers, responsibility for negligence.

In his work, Public Welfare Offences, at
p. 78, Professor Sayre suggests that if the penalty is really slight involving,
for instance, a maximum fine of twenty-five dollars, particularly if adequate
enforcement depends upon wholesale prosecution, or if the social danger arising
from violation is serious, the doctrine of basing liability upon mere activity
rather than fault, is sound. He continues, however, at p. 79:

[Page 1314]

On the other hand, some public welfare
offences involve a possible penalty of imprisonment or heavy fine. In such
cases it would seem sounder policy to maintain the orthodox requirement of a
guilty mind but to shift the burden of proof to the shoulders of the defendant
to establish his lack of a guilty intent if he can. For public welfare
offences defendants may be convicted by proof of the mere act of violation;
but, if the offence involves a possible prison penalty, the defendant should
not be denied the right of bringing forward affirmative evidence to prove that
the violation was the result of no fault on his part.

and at p. 82:

It is fundamentally unsound to convict a
defendant for a crime involving a substantial term of imprisonment without
giving him the opportunity to prove that his action was due to an honest and
reasonable mistake of fact or that he acted without guilty intent. If the
public danger is widespread and serious, the practical situation can be met by
shifting to the shoulders of the defendant the burden of proving a lack of
guilty intent.

The doctrine proceeds on the assumption that the
defendant could have avoided the prima facie offence through the
exercise of reasonable care and he is given the opportunity of establishing, if
he can, that he did in fact exercise such care.

The case which gave the lead in this branch of
the law is the Australian case of Proudman v. Dayman1[19] where Dixon J. said, at pp. 540-41:

It is one thing to deny that a necessary
ingredient of the offence is positive knowledge of the fact that the driver
holds no subsisting licence. It is another to say that an honest belief founded
on reasonable grounds that he is licensed cannot exculpate a person who permits
him to drive. As a general rule an honest and reasonable belief in a state of
facts which, if they existed, would make the defendant’s act innocent affords
an excuse for doing what would otherwise be an offence…

This case, and several others like it, speak of
the defence as being that of reasonable mistake of fact. The reason is that the
offences in question have generally turned on the possession by a person or
place of an unlawful status, and the accused’s defence was that he reasonably
did not

[Page 1315]

know of this status: e.g. permitting an
unlicensed person to drive, or lacking a valid licence oneself, or being the
owner of property in a dangerous condition. In such cases, negligence consists
of an unreasonable failure to know the facts which constitute the offence. It
is clear, however, that in principle the defence is that all reasonable care
was taken. In other circumstances, the issue will be whether the accused’s
behaviour was negligent in bringing about the forbidden event when he knew the
relevant facts. Once the defence of reasonable mistake of fact is accepted,
there is no barrier to. acceptance of the other constituent part of a defence
of due diligence.

The principle which has found acceptance in Australia since Proudman v. Dayman
has a place also in the jurisprudence of New
 Zealand: see The Queen v. Strawbridge[20]; The King v. Ewart[21].

In the House of Lords case of Sweet v. Parsley[22], Lord Reid noted the difficulty presented
by the simplistic choice between mens rea in the full sense and an
absolute offence. He looked approvingly at attempts to find a middle ground.
Lord Pearce, in the same case, referred to the “sensible half-way house” which
he thought the Courts should take in some so-called absolute offences. The
difficulty, as Lord Pearce saw it, lay in the opinion of Viscount Sankey L.C.
in Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions[23] if the full width of that opinion
were maintained. Lord Diplock, however, took a different and, in my opinion, a
preferable view, at p. 164:

…Woolmington’s case did not decide anything
so irrational as that the prosecution must call evidence to prove the absence
of any mistaken belief by the accused in the existence of facts which, if true,
would make the act innocent, any more than it decided that the prosecution must
call evidence to prove the absence of any claim of right in a charge of
larceny. The jury is entitled to presume that the accused acted with knowledge
of the

[Page 1316]

facts, unless there is some evidence to the
contrary originating from the accused who alone can know on what belief he
acted and on what ground the belief, if mistaken, was held.

In Woolmington’s case the question was
whether the trial judge was correct in directing the jury that the accused was
required to prove his innocence. Viscount Sankey L.C. referred to the strength
of the presumption of innocence in a criminal case and then made the statement,
universally accepted in this country, that there is no burden on the prisoner
to prove his innocence; it is sufficient for him to raise a doubt as to his
guilt. I do not understand the case as standing for anything more than that. It
is to be noted that the case is concerned with criminal offences in the true sense;
it is not concerned with public welfare offences. It is somewhat ironic that Woolmington’s
case, which embodies a principle for the benefit of the accused, should be
used to justify the rejection of a defence of reasonable care for public
welfare offences and the retention of absolute liability, which affords the
accused no defence at all. There is nothing in Woolmington’s case, as I
comprehend it, which stands in the way of adoption, in respect of regulatory
offences, of a defence of due care, with burden of proof resting on the accused
to establish the defence on the balance of probabilities.

There have been several cases in Ontario which open the way to acceptance of
a defence of due diligence. In R. v. McIver[24], the Court of Appeal held that the
offence charged, namely, careless driving, was one of strict liability, but
that it was open to an accused to show that he had a reasonable belief in facts
which, if true, would have rendered the act innocent. MacKay J.A., who wrote
for the Court, relied upon Sherras v. De Rutzen, Proudman v. Dayman,
Maker v. Musson[25] and
R. v. Patterson[26], in
availing an accused the opportunity of explanation in the case of statutory
offences that do not by their terms require proof of intent. The following two
short passages from the judgment might be quoted (at p.

[Page 1317]

481):

On a charge laid under s. 60 of the Highway
Traffic Act, it is open to the accused as a defence, to show an absence of
negligence on his part. For example, that his conduct was caused by the
negligence of some other person, or by showing that the cause was a mechanical
failure, or other circumstance, that he could not reasonably have foreseen.

…

In the present case it was open to the
accused to show, if he could, that the collision of his car with the car parked
on the shoulder of the road, occurred without fault or negligence on his part.
He having failed to do so was properly convicted.

An appeal to this Court was dismissed [1966]
S.C.R. 254 on other grounds.

Later, in R. v. Custeau[27], MacKay J.A., again speaking for
the Court, returned to the same point, at p. 251:

In the case of an offence of strict
liability (sometimes referred to as absolute liability) it has been held to be
a defence if it is found that the defendant honestly believed on reasonable grounds
in a state of facts which, if true, would render his act an innocent one.

In the British Columbia Court of Appeal the
concept of reasonable care was discussed in R. v. Larocque[28] (selling liquor to an interdicted
person contrary to a provincial statute) by Mr. Justice Sheppard, speaking
for the Court, at p. 247:

…That test has been defined in Bank of
New South Wales v. Piper, [1897] A.C. 383 at pp. 289‑90 as
follows: ‘On the other hand, the absence of mens rea really consists in
an honest and reasonable belief entertained by the accused of the existence of
facts which, if true, would make the act charged against him innocent.’

The onus would therefore be upon the
accused to show not merely that he did not know that Pierre was an interdicted
person but also that he, the accused, had used honest and reasonable efforts to
become acquainted with the information supplied by the Department and to comply
therewith and that notwithstanding such efforts he had an honest and reasonable
belief that Pierre was not an interdicted person.

[Page 1318]

In an early Saskatchewan Court of Appeal
decision in R. v. Regina Cold Storage & Forwarding Co.[29] (unlawful possession of liquor) it
was held that mens rea was an essential element for conviction and that
element was absent. Chief Justice Haultain appears to have conceptualized
absence of mens rea, not as lack of kowledge or intent but rather in
terms of reasonable care in an offence of strict liability. He said, at p. 23:
“Absence of mens rea means an honest and reasonable belief by the
accused in the existence of facts which, if true, would make the charge against
him innocent.”

In the New Brunswick case of R. v. A.O. Pope,
Ltd.[30] (failing
to provide properly fitted goggles contrary to the Industrial Safety Act, 1964
(N.B.), c. 5) Keirstead Co. Ct. J. held that the offence was one of strict but
not absolute liability, and a defence of reasonable care was open to the
accused to prove that the act was done without negligence or fault on his part.
An appeal to the New Brunswick Supreme Court, Appeal Division, was dismissed
without, however, any discussion of this issue.

Two more recent cases, one being from the Province of Ontario
and the other from the Province
of Alberta, deserve attention. In R. v. Hickey[31] (speeding) the Divisional Court held that the offence was
one of strict liability, but that the accused would have a valid defence if he
proved on the balance of probabilities that he honestly believed on reasonable
grounds in a mistaken set of facts which, if true, would have made his conduct
innocent. The accused had testified that he honestly believed because of the
speedometer reading that he was not exceeding the speed limit. A test conducted
by a police officer at the scene showed that the speedometer was, in fact, not
working properly. The majority of the Court,

[Page 1319]

therefore, set aside the conviction.
Mr. Justice Galligan made the following comment, at p. 36:

Submissions were made to this Court about
the difficulties involved in the prosecution of speeding cases and other strict
liability offences if this defence is a valid one in law. In my opinion, the
availability of the defence as a matter of law should make no unreasonable
burden upon the prosecution or the Courts. It is clear from the Australian
authorities that not only is the burden of proving such a defence upon the
accused, he must prove it upon a balance of probabilities. It is not sufficient
merely to raise a reasonable doubt. In this respect, the defence of mistake
when raised as a defence to an offence of strict liability is very different
than is the defence of mistake of fact when it is raised in a case involving mens
rea as an essential ingredient of the offence. In the former case, the
mistake of fact must not only be an honest one, but it must be based on
reasonable grounds and it must be proved by the accused on the balance of
probabilities. In the latter case the defence need only be an honest one and
need not necessarily be based upon reasonable grounds and it need only cause
the Court to have a reasonable doubt: see R. v. Morgan et al., [1975]
2 W.L.R. 913 (H.L.) and Beaver v. The Queen (1957), 118 C.C.C.
129, [1957] S.C.R. 531, 26 C.R. 193.

The decision in Hickey was
subsequently appealed to the Court of Appeal (1976), 30 C.C.C. (2d) 416.
The Court allowed the appeal and restored the conviction. Mr. Justice
Jessup, in giving judgment for the Court, said:

Assuming, without deciding, that statutory
offences can be classified into one of three groups mentioned by Estey,
C.J.H.C., in his judgment given in the Divisional Court, we are of the opinion
that the offence here in question, of speeding, under the Highway Traffic
Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 202, is a statutory offence within the third group
mentioned by Estey, C.J.H.C.; that is one of absolute liability in the sense
that reasonable mistake of fact is not a defence.

No reasons were given for the identification of
the offence as one of absolute liability once the three groups of statutory
offences were assumed to exist.

In the Appellate Division of the Alberta Supreme
Court, the defence of reasonable care for an offence of strict liability was
accepted after full consideration of the issues involved, in the recent

[Page 1320]

case of R. v. Service Limited[32]. The offence in question was that
an employer “shall not permit a person under the full age of eighteen years to
work during the period of time prohibited by this section.” Mr. Justice
Morrow, writing for the majority of the Court, said (at pp. 397-8):

While the language of the particular
regulation under review does in my view come within the category of absolute or
strict liability offences, I am also of the opinion that the general language
used—particularly with the inclusion of the word “permit,” which has a
connotation suggesting some intent is to be considered—brings this
section into what probably can be described as the exception to the rule
of absoluteness as suggested by Estey C.J.H.C., in his dissenting judgment in Regina
v. Hickey (1976), 12 O.R. (2d) 578, 29 C.C.C. (2d) 63, 68 D.L.R. (3d)
88, reversed 13 O.R. (2d) 228, 30 C.C.C. (2d) 416, 70 D.L.R. (3d) 689 (C.A.),
where at p. 580 he describes statutes which prohibit a specified act or
omission but which are interpreted to permit the defence of an honest belief
held on reasonable grounds in a mistaken set of facts which if true would
render the act or omission innocent.

The above exception or type of defence has
long been recognized in Australia,…

It is interesting to note the recommendations
made by the Law Reform Commission to the Minister of Justice (Our Criminal
Law) in March, 1976. The Commission advises (p. 32) that (i) every
offence outside the Criminal Code  be recognized as admitting of a
defence of due diligence; (ii) in the case of any such offence for which intent
or recklessness is not specifically required the onus of proof should lie on
the defendant to establish such defence; (iii) the defendant would have to
prove this on the preponderance or balance of probabilities. The recommendation
endorsed a working paper (The Meaning of Guilt—Strict Liability)
in which it was stated that negligence should be the minimum standard of
liability in regulatory offences, that such offences were (p. 32), “to promote
higher standards of care in business, trade and industry, higher standards of honesty
in commerce and advertising, higher standards of respect for the…environment
and [therefore] the…offence is basically and typically an offence of
negligence”; that an accused should never be con-

[Page 1321]

victed of a regulatory offence if he establishes
that he acted with due diligence, that is, that he was not negligent. In the
working paper, the Commission further stated (p. 33), “let us recognize the
regulatory offence for what it is—an offence of negligence—and frame the law to
ensure that guilt depends upon lack of reasonable care.” The view is expressed
that in regulatory law, to make the defendant disprove negligence—prove due
diligence—would be both justifiable and desirable.

In an interesting article on the matter now
under discussion, Far From Clear, supra, Professor Jobson refers to a
series of recent cases, arising principally under s. 32(1) of The Ontario
Water Resources Commission Act, the section at issue in the present
proceedings, which “openly acknowledged a defence based on lack of fault or
neglect; these cases require proof of the actus reus but then permit the
accused to show that he was without fault or had no opportunity to prevent the
harm.” The paramount case in the series is R. v. Industrial Tankers
Ltd.[33] in
which Judge Sprague, relying upon R. v. Hawinda Taverns Ltd.[34] and R. v. Bruin Hotel Co.
Ltd[35], held
that the Crown did not need to prove that the accused had mens rea, but
it did have to show that the accused had the power and authority to prevent the
pollution, and could have prevented it, but did not do so. Liability rests upon
control and the opportunity to prevent, i.e. that the accused could have and
should have prevented the pollution. In Industrial Tankers, the burden
was placed on the Crown to prove lack of reasonable care. To that extent Industrial
Tankers and s. 32(1) cases which followed it, such as R. v. Sheridan[36], differ from other authorities on
s. 32(1) which would place upon the accused the burden of showing as a defence
that: he did not have control or otherwise could not have prevented the
impairment: see R. v. Cherokee Disposals &

[Page 1322]

Construction Limited[37];
R. v. Liquid Cargo Lines Ltd.[38] and R.
v. North Canadian Enterprises Ltd[39]

The element of control, particularly by those in
charge of business activities which may endanger the public, is vital to
promote the observance of regulations designed to avoid that danger. This
control may be exercised by “supervision or inspection, by improvement of his
business methods or by exhorting those whom he may be expected to influence or
control” (Lord Evershed in Lim Chin Aik v. The Queen,[40] at p. 174). The purpose, Dean
Roscoe Pound has said (The Spirit of the Common Law (1906)), is to “put
pressure upon the thoughtless and inefficient to do their whole duty in the
interest of public health or safety or morale.” As Devlin J. noted in Reynolds
v. Austin & Sons Limited[41],
at p. 139: “. a man may be responsible for the acts of his servants, or
even for defects in his business arrangements, because it can fairly be said
that by such sanctions citizens are induced to keep themselves and their
organizations up to the mark.” Devlin J. added, however: “If a man is punished
because of an act done by another, whom he cannot reasonably be expected to
influence or control, the law is engaged, not in punishing thoughtlessness or
inefficiency, and thereby promoting the welfare of the community, but in
pouncing on the most convenient victim.”

The decision of this Court in The Queen v.
Pierce Fisheries Ltd[42] is
not inconsistent with the concept of a “half-way house” between mens rea and
absolute liability. In Pierce Fisheries the

[Page 1323]

charge was that of having possession of
undersized lobsters contrary to the regulations under the Fisheries Act, R.S.C.
1952, c. 119. Two points arise in connection with the judgment of Ritchie J.,
who wrote for the majority of the Court. First, the adoption of what had been
said by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Pee-Kay Smallwares, Ltd[43]:

If on a prosecution for the offences
created by the Act, the Crown had to prove the evil intent of the
accused, or if the accused could escape by denying such evil intent, the
statute, by which it was obviously intended that there should be complete
control without the possibility of any leaks, would have so many holes in it
that in truth it would be nothing more than a legislative sieve.

Ritchie J. held that the offence was one in
which the Crown, for the reason indicated in the Pee-Kay Smallwares case,
did not have to prove mens rea in order to obtain a conviction. This, in
my opinion, is the ratio decidendi of the case. Second, Ritchie J. did
not, however, foreclose the possibility of a defence. The following passage
from the judgment (at p. 21) suggests that a defence of reasonable care might
have been open to the accused, but that in that case care had not been taken to
acquire the knowledge of the facts constituting the offence:

As employees of the company working on the
premises in the shed “where fish is weighed and packed” were taking lobsters
from boxes “preparatory for packing” in crates, and as some of the undersized
lobsters were found “in crates ready for shipment,” it would not appear to have
been a difficult matter for some “officer or responsible employee” to acquire
knowledge of their presence on the premises.

In a later passage Ritchie J. added (at p.22):

In this case the respondent knew that it
had upwards of 60,000 pounds of lobsters on its premises; it only lacked
knowledge as to the small size of some of them, and I do not think that the failure
of any of its responsible employees to acquire this knowledge affords any
defence to a charge of violating the provisions of s.3(1)(b) of the Lobster
Fishery Regulations.

[Page 1324]

I do not read Pierce Fisheries as denying
the accused all defences, in particular the defence that the company had done
everything possible to acquire knowledge of the undersized lobsters. Ritchie J.
concluded merely that the Crown did not have to prove knowledge.

The judgment of this Court in Hill v. The
Queen[44], has
been interpreted (R. v. Gillis[45])
as imposing absolute liability and denying the driver of a motor vehicle
the right to plead in defence an honest and reasonable belief in a state of
facts which, if true, would have made the act non-culpable. In Hill, the
appellant was charged under the Highway Traffic Act with failing to
remain at the scene of an accident. Her car had “touched” the rear of another
vehicle. She did not stop, but drove off, believing no damage had been done.
This Court affirmed the conviction, holding that the offence was not one
requiring mens rea. In that case the essential fact was that an accident
had occurred, to the knowledge of Mrs. Hill. Any belief that she might
have held as to the extent of the damage could not obliterate that fact, or make
it appear that she had reasonable grounds for believing in a state of facts
which, if true, would have constituted a defence to the charge. The case does
not stand in the way of a defence of reasonable care in a proper case.

We have the situation therefore in which many
Courts of this country, at all levels, dealing with public welfare offences
favour (i) not requiring the Crown to prove mens rea, (ii)
rejecting the notion that liability inexorably follows upon mere proof of the actus
reus, excluding any possible defence. The Courts are following the lead
set in Australia many years ago
and tentatively broached by several English courts in recent years.

It may be suggested that the introduction of a
defence based on due diligence and the shifting of the burden of proof might
better be implemented

[Page 1325]

by legislative act. In answer, it should be
recalled that the concept of absolute liability and the creation of a jural
category of public welfare offences are both the product of the judiciary and
not of the Legislature. The development to date of this defence, in the
numerous decisions I have referred to, of courts in this country as well as in Australia and New
 Zealand, has also been the work of judges. The present
case offers the opportunity of consolidating and clarifying the doctrine.

The correct approach, in my opinion, is to
relieve the Crown of the burden of proving mens rea, having regard to Pierce
Fisheries and to the virtual impossibility in most regulatory cases of
proving wrongful intention. In a normal case, the accused alone will have
knowledge of what he has done to avoid the breach and it is not improper to
expect him to come forward with the evidence of due diligence. This is
particularly so when it is alleged, for example, that pollution was caused by
the activities of a large and complex corporation. Equally, there is nothing
wrong with rejecting absolute liability and admitting the defence of reasonable
care.

In this doctrine it is not up to the prosecution
to prove negligence. Instead, it is open to the defendant to prove that all due
care has been taken. This burden falls upon the defendant as he is the only one
who will generally have the means of proof. This would not seem unfair as the
alternative is absolute liability which denies an accused any defence
whatsoever. While the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
defendant committed the prohibited act, the defendant must only establish on
the balance of probabilities that he has a defence of reasonable care.

I conclude, for the reasons which I have sought
to express, that there are compelling grounds for the recognition of three
categories of offences rather than the traditional two:

1. Offences in which mens rea, consisting
of some positive state of mind such as intent, knowledge, or recklessness, must
be proved by the prosecution either as an inference from the nature of the act
committed, or by additional evidence.

[Page 1326]

2. Offences in which there is no necessity
for the prosecution to prove the existence of mens rea; the doing
of the prohibited act prima facie imports the offence, leaving it open
to the accused to avoid liability by proving that he took all reasonable care.
This involves consideration of what a reasonable man would have done in the
circumstances. The defence will be available if the accused reasonably believed
in a mistaken set of facts which, if true, would render the act or omission
innocent, or if he took all reasonable steps to avoid the particular event.
These offences may properly be called offences of strict liability.
Mr. Justice Estey so referred to them in Hickey’s case.

3. Offences of absolute liability where it
is not open to the accused to exculpate himself by showing that he was free of
fault.

Offences which are criminal in the true sense
fall in the first category. Public welfare offences would prima facie be
in the second category. They are not subject to the presumption of full mens
rea. An offence of this type would fall in the first category only if such
words as “wilfully,” “with intent,” “knowingly,” or “intentionally” are
contained in the statutory provision creating the offence. On the other hand,
the principle that punishment should in general not be inflicted on those
without fault applies. Offences of absolute liability would be those in respect
of which the Legislature had made it clear that guilt would follow proof merely
of the proscribed act. The overall regulatory pattern adopted by the
Legislature, the subject matter of the legislation, the importance of the penalty,
and the precision of the language used will be primary considerations in
determining whether the offence falls into the third category.

The Ontario Water Resources Commission Act, s. 32(1)

Turning to the subject matter of s. 32(1)—the
prevention of pollution of lakes, rivers and streams—it is patent that this is
of great public concern. Pollution has always been unlawful and, in itself, a
nuisance: Groat v. City of Edmonton[46]. A riparian owner has an inherent right
to have a

[Page 1327]

stream of water “come to him in its natural
state, in flow, quantity and quality”: Chasemore v. Richards[47], at p. 382. Natural streams which
formerly afforded “pure and healthy” water for drinking or swimming purposes
become little more than cesspools when riparian factory owners and municipal
corporations discharge into them filth of all descriptions. Pollution offences
are undoubtedly public welfare offences enacted in the interests of public
health. There is thus no presumption of a full mens rea.

There is another reason, however, why this
offence is not subject to a presumption of mens rea. The presumption
applies only to offences which are “criminal in the true sense,” as Ritchie J.
said in The Queen v. Pierce Fisheries (supra), at
p. 13. The Ontario Water Resources Commission Act is a provincial
statute. If it is valid provincial legislation (and no suggestion was made to
the contrary), then it cannot possibly create an offence which is criminal in
the true sense.

The present case concerns the interpretation of
two troublesome words frequently found in public welfare statutes: “cause” and
“permit.” These two words are troublesome because neither denotes clearly
either full mens rea nor absolute liability. It is said that a person
could not be said to be permitting something unless he knew what he was
permitting. This is an over-simplification. There is authority both ways,
indicating that the courts are uneasy with the traditional dichotomy. Some
authorities favour the position that “permit”, does not import mens rea: see
Millar v. The Queen[48]; R.
v. Royal Canadian Legion[49]; R.
v. Teperman and Sons[50]; R.
v. Jack Crewe Ltd.[51];
Browning v. J.H. Watson Ltd.[52];
Lyons v. May[53];
Korten v. West Sussex C.C.[54]. For
a mens rea construction see James & Son Ltd. v. Smee[55]; Somerset v.

[Page 1328]

Hart[56];Grays Haulage
Co. Ltd. v. Arnold[57];Smith & Hogan,
Criminal Law (3rd ed.) at p. 87; Edwards, Mens Rea and Statutory
Offences (1955), at pp. 98-119. The same is true of “cause.” For a non-mens
rea construction, see R. v. Peconi[58]; Alphacell Limited v. Woodward[59]; Sopp v. Long[60];Laird v. Dobell[61]; Korten v. West Sussex C.C., (supra);
Shave v. Rosner[62].
Others say that “cause” imports a requirement for a mens rea: see Lovelace
v. D.P.P.[63]; Ross
Hillman Ltd. v. Bond, supra; Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law (3rd ed.) at pp.
89-90.

The Divisional Court of Ontario relied on these
latter authorities in concluding that s. 32(1) created a mens rea offence.

The conflict in the above authorities, however,
shows that in themselves the words “cause” and “permit”, fit much better into
an offence of strict liability than either full mens rea or absolute
liability. Since s. 32(1) creates a public welfare offence, without a clear
indication that liability is absolute, and without any words such as
“knowingly” or “wilfully” expressly to import mens rea, application of
the criteria which I have outlined above undoubtedly places the offence in the
category of strict liability.

Proof of the prohibited act prima facie imports
the offence, but the accused may avoid liability by proving that he took
reasonable care. I am strengthened in this view by the recent case of R. v.
Servico Limited, supra, in which the Appellate Division of the Alberta
Supreme Court held that an offence of “permitting” a person under eighteen

[Page 1329]

years to work during prohibited hours was an
offence of strict liability in the sense which I have described. It also will
be recalled that the decisions of many lower courts which have considered s.
32(1) have rejected absolute liability as the basis for the offence of causing
or permitting pollution, and have equally rejected full mens rea as an
ingredient of the offence.

The Present Case

As I am of the view that a new trial is
necessary, it would be inappropriate to discuss at this time the facts of the
present case. It may be helpful, however, to consider in a general way the
principles to be applied in determining whether a person or municipality has
committed the actus reus of discharging, causing, or permitting
pollution within the terms of s. 32(1), in particular in connection with
pollution from garbage disposal. The prohibited act would, in my opinion, be
committed by those who undertake the collection and disposal of garbage, who
are in a position to excercise continued control of this activity and prevent
the pollution from occurring, but fail to do so. The “discharging” aspect of
the offence centres on direct acts of pollution. The “causing” aspect centres
on the defendant’s active undertaking of something which it is in a position to
control and which results in pollution. The “permitting” aspect of the offence
centres on the defendant’s passive lack of interference or, in other words, its
failure to prevent an occurrence which it ought to have foreseen. The close
interweaving of the meanings of these terms emphasizes again that s. 32(1)
deals with only one generic offence.

When the defendant is a municipality, it is of
no avail to it in law that it had no duty to pick up the garbage, s. 354(1)(76)
of The Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 284, merely providing that it
“may” do so. The law is replete with instances where a person has no duty to
act, but where he is subject to certain duties if he does act. The duty here is
imposed by s. 32(1) of The Ontario Water Resources Commission Act. The
position in this respect is no different from that of private persons,
corporate or individual, who have no duty to dis-

[Page 1330]

pose of garbage, but who will incur liability
under s. 32(1) if they do so and thereby discharge, cause, or permit pollution.

Nor does liability rest solely on the terms of
any agreement by which a defendant arranges for eventual disposal. The test is
a factual one, based on an assessment of the defendant’s position with respect
to the activity which it undertakes and which causes pollution. If it can and
should control the activity at the point where pollution occurs, then it is
responsible for the pollution. Whether it “discharges,” “causes,” or “permits”
the pollution will be a question of degree, depending on whether it is actively
involved at the point where pollution occurs, or whether it merely passively
fails to prevent the pollution. In some cases the contract may expressly
provide the defendant with the power and authority to control the activity. In
such a case the factual assessment will be straightforward. Prima facie, liability
will be incurred where the defendant could have prevented the impairment by
intervening pursuant to its right to do so under the contract, but failed to do
so. Where there is no such express provision in the contract, other factors
will come into greater prominence. In every instance the question will depend
on an assessment of all the circumstances of the case. Whether an “independent
contractor” rather than an “employee” is hired will not be decisive. A homeowner
who pays a fee for the collection of his garbage by a business which services
the area could probably not be said to have caused or permitted the pollution
if the collector dumps the garbage in the river. His position would be
analogous to a householder in Sault Ste. Marie, who could not be said to have
caused or permitted the pollution here. A large corporation which arranges for
the nearby disposal of industrial pollutants by a small local independent
contractor with no experience in this matter would probably be in an entirely
different position.

It must be recognized, however, that a
municipality is in a somewhat different position by virtue

[Page 1331]

of the legislative power which it possesses and
which others lack. This is important in the assessment of whether the defendant
was in a position to control the activity which it undertook and which caused
the pollution. A municipality cannot slough off responsibility by contracting
out the work. It is in a position to control those whom it hires to carry out
garbage disposal operations, and to supervise the activity, either through the
provisions of the contract or by municipal by-laws. It fails to do so at its
peril.

One comment on the defence of reasonable care in
this context should be added. Since the issue is whether the defendant is
guilty of an offence, the doctrine of respondeat superior has no
application. The due diligence which must be established is that of the accused
alone. Where an employer is charged in respect of an act committed by an
employee acting in the course of employment, the question will be whether the
act took place without the accused’s direction or approval, thus negating
wilful involvement of the accused, and whether the accused exercised all
reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent commission of the
offence and by taking reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the
system., The availability of the defence to a corporation will depend on
whether such due diligence was taken by those who are the directing mind and
will of the corporation, whose acts are therefore in law the acts of the
corporation itself. For a useful discussion of this matter in the context of a
statutory defence of due diligence see Tesco Supermarkets v. Nattras[64].

The majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal
directed a new trial as, in the opinion of that court, the findings of the
trial judge were not sufficient to establish actual knowledge on the part of
the City. I share the view that there should be a new trial, but for a
different reason. The City did not lead evidence directed to a defence of due
diligence, nor did the trial judge address himself to the availability of such
a defence. In these circumstances, it would not be fair for this Court to
determine, upon

[Page 1332]

findings of fact directed toward other ends,
whether the City was without fault.

I would dismiss the appeal and direct a new
trial. I would dismiss the cross-appeal. There should be no costs.

Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed, new
trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL OF ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Mandatory
supervision—Suspension of mandatory supervision for subsequent
offence—Concurrent sentence of 21 months imposed while serving eight
years—Applicability of mandatory supervision—Effective date of sentence in
relation date of operation of act—Parole Act, as amended by 1968-69 (Can.), c.
38, s.101(1),(2).

Appellant while serving an eight-year
sentence for manslaughter imposed on February 6, 1969, was on November 29, 1971, sentenced to a term of
twenty-one months, for assault causing grievous bodily harm, to run
concurrently with the sentence already being served. He was on August 5, 1974,
released subject to mandatory supervision. Following charges on a further
offence for which he was arrested on October 9, 1974 his release was revoked and
he was thereby deprived of 888 days of statutory and earned remission standing
to his credit in respect of the 1969 sentence under provisions of the Parole
Act. Appellant brought an application for habeas corpus with certiorari
in aid contending that he could not be deprived lawfully of his credited
remission under the Parole Act as, at the time of his release, he was
not legally subject to mandatory supervision. The application succeeded at
trial but was reversed by the Court of Appeal.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Dickson J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: Section 15(1) of the Parole
Act was in existence at the time of appellant’s release prior to the
expiration of his sentence. In the absence of some statutory provision to
preclude its operation he was therefore subject to mandatory supervision. The
combined effect of s. 101(2) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act,

[Page 294]

1968-69 (Can.), c. 38, and the proclamation
made pursuant thereto was to make the provision of s. 11B (now s. 15) of the Parole
Act applicable to the appellant, as a person sentenced to imprisonment
after August 1, 1970, by virtue of the later sentence imposed on him. The
effect of 14(1) of the Parole Act is that for the purposes of s. 15(1)
both the first and second sentences constituted one sentence to which at the
time of appellant’s releases. 15(1) applied.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Dickson J. dissenting: The effect of s. 101(2) of the Criminal
Law Amendment Act, 1968-69 (Can.), c. 38 and the proclamation (SOR/70-339)
was to make a distinction between persons sentenced to imprisonment on or after
August 1, 1970, and persons sentenced before that date. The former were legally
subject to mandatory supervision and further incarceration were the supervision
revoked, upon release; the latter were not. Prima facie appellant was
within the former class of persons made subject to mandatory supervision by s.
15(1) of the Parole Act. However s. 15 is silent as to persons in
penitentiary prior to the effective date, August 1, 1970. Section 14
specifically contemplates such persons and provides that where an inmate is
sentenced to an additional term, the terms of imprisonment, including that
which resulted in his being in confinement, shall be deemed to constitute one
sentence. Since one sentence can have but one date of origin, in appellant’s
case February 9, 1969, and as this date was prior to August 1, 1970, appellant
was outside the operation of s. 15. In any event, the language of ss. 14 and
15, which affects pre-August, 1970 remission entitlement, is not so free from
doubt as to justify depriving appellant of statutory and earned remission
standing to his credit on the introduction of s. 15(1).

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] reversing a
decision of Cory J.[2] on an
application for habeas corpus with certiorari in aid. Appeal
dismissed, Laskin C.J. and Dickson J. dissenting.

[Page 295]

Ronald R. Price, for the appellant.

A.M. Garneau and Leslie S. Holland, for
the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Dickson J. was
delivered by

DICKSON J. (dissenting)—On February 6, 1969 the appellant was sentenced to a
term of eight years’ imprisonment following conviction on a charge of
manslaughter. He was credited with statutory remission amounting to one-quarter
of the period to which he had been sentenced. Statutory remission is time off,
subject to good conduct, pursuant to s. 22(1) of the Penitentiary Act, 1960-61
(Can.), c. 53.

On November 29, 1971, while still in custody,
the appellant was sentenced for assault causing bodily harm to serve a further
term of twenty-one months’ imprisonment concurrent with the sentence he was
then serving. On August 5, 1974
he was released from custody subject to mandatory supervision until February 5,
1977. In placing appellant under mandatory supervision, the parole authorities
seem to have relied upon amendments to the Parole Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
P-2 made some time after the appellant was received into the penitentiary.
While under mandatory supervision, the appellant in October, 1974 was arrested
and charged with assault causing bodily harm and common assault, and released
on his own recognizance. In January, 1975 he was taken into custody. The
National Parole Board on February 26, 1975 issued an order purporting to revoke appellant’s release on
mandatory supervision. Appellant was committed to gaol. On March 12, 1975 he
brought an application for a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in
aid, contending that he could not lawfully be deprived under the provisions of
the Parole Act of the statutory and earned remission which stood to his
credit in respect of the sentence imposed on him on February 6, 1969. The application was
granted by Mr. Justice Cory but this decision was reversed on appeal by
the Ontario Court of Appeal.

Section 15(1) of the Parole Act provides:

[Page 296]

15. (1) Where an inmate to whom parole was
not granted is released from imprisonment, prior to the expiration of his
sentence according to law, as a result of remission, including earned
remission, and the term of such remission exceeds sixty days, he shall,
notwithstanding any other Act, be subject to mandatory supervision
commencing upon his release and continuing for the duration of such remission.

Section 15(2) of the Act provides:

15. (2) Paragraph 10(1)(e),
section 11, section 13 and sections 16 to 21 apply to an inmate
who is subject to mandatory supervision as though he were a paroled inmate and
as though the terms and conditions of his mandatory supervision were terms and
conditions of his parole.

By s. 101(2) of the Criminal Law Amendment
Act, 1968-69 (Can.), c. 38 it was provided that s. 15(1), then s. 11B(1):

…shall apply only in respect of persons who
are sentenced to imprisonment in or transferred to a class or classes of
penitentiaries or other places of imprisonment described in a proclamation on
and after a day or days fixed by the proclamation.

By proclamation SOR/70-339, dated July 30, 1970,
s. 11B was brought into force, to “have effect in respect of persons who are
sentenced to imprisonment in or transferred to any class of penitentiary on and
after the first day of August, 1970”.

It will be readily discerned that the effect of
s. 101(2) of the 1968-69 Amendment Act and SOR/70-339 is to make a
distinction between persons sentenced to imprisonment on or after August 1, 1970, and persons sentenced before that
date. Persons sentenced on or after August 1, 1970 would be subject to
mandatory supervision upon release and face the prospect of being returned to
the institution, if mandatory supervision were revoked; persons sentenced
before August 1, 1970 were
exempt from mandatory supervision and free from the possibility, after release,
of being returned to the institution to serve further time. The crucial issue
in this appeal, therefore, is whether at the time of his release in 1974,
appellant was subject to mandatory supervision. If he was, the Parole Board was
entitled to revoke the conditional

[Page 297]

release; if he was not so subject, there was
nothing for the Parole Board to revoke.

Prima facie the
appellant was within the class of persons subject to mandatory supervision by
the operation of s. 15(1), as a person sentenced to imprisonment in a
penitentiary after August 1, 1970. Section 15 is silent, however, as to
the position of persons in penitentiary on the date set for the operation of s.
15(1), i.e. August 1, 1970 and silent as to the effect of s. 15(1)
upon remission, statutory and earned, to which such persons were entitled in
respect of sentences imposed prior to August 1, 1970. Section 14 appears
to contemplate such persons. The section provides:

14. (1) Where, either before, on or after
the 25th day of March 1970,

(a) a person is sentenced to
two or more terms of imprisonment, or

(b) an inmate who is in
confinement is sentenced to an additional term or terms of imprisonment,

the terms of imprisonment to which he has
been sentenced, including in a case described in paragraph (b) any
term or terms that resulted in his being in confinement, shall, for all
purposes of this Act, the Penitentiary Act and the Prisons and
Reformatories Act , be deemed to constitute one sentence consisting of a
term of imprisonment commencing on the earliest day on which any of those
sentences of imprisonment commences and ending on the expiration of the last to
expire of such terms of imprisonment.

(2) This section does not affect the
time at which any sentences that are deemed by subsection (1) to
constitute one sentence commence pursuant to sub-section 649(1)  of the Criminal
Code .

The section provides that where an inmate
who is in confinement is sentenced to an additional term of imprisonment, the
terms of imprisonment to which he has been sentenced, including the term that
resulted in his being in confinement, shall be deemed to constitute one
sentence. One sentence, of course, can have but one date of origin. The
question decisive in this appeal is what is that date of origin for, if the
date antedated the date set for the operation of s. 15, the appellant could not
have

[Page 298]

been subject to mandatory supervision.
Section 14 gives a precise answer. The one sentence to which the section refers
is deemed to consist of a term of imprisonment commencing on the earliest day
on which any of the sentences commences. In the appellant’s case that date was February 6, 1969, being prior to the effective
date of s. 15(1). Therefore, in my view, the appellant was outside the
operation of s. 15. In any event, it would appear to me that the language of
ss. 14 and 15 of the Parole Act, as affecting pre-August, 1970 remission
entitlement, is not so free from doubt as to justify depriving appellant, and others
similarly situated, of the statutory and earned remission standing to their
credit at the introduction of s. 15(1) of the Act. In the case of
the appellant, such credits totalled eight hundred and eighty‑eight days.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of
the Ontario Court of Appeal, and restore the order of Mr. Justice Cory.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by 

MARTLAND J.—The essential facts are that the
appellant, while serving in a penitentiary an eight-year sentence for
manslaughter imposed on February 6, 1969, was sentenced, on November 29, 1971, to a term of twenty-one months
for assault occasioning grevious bodily harm, to run concurrently with the
sentence already being served. By virtue of s. 659(2)  of the Criminal Code  this
sentence was to be served in the penitentiary.

The appellant was released on August 5, 1974,
not on parole, but subject to mandatory supervision. Following the commission
of a further offence for which he was arrested on October 9, 1974, the Parole
Board on February 26, 1975, revoked his release under mandatory supervision for
violation of the terms of the mandatory supervision, and he was thereby made
subject to the

[Page 299]

consequences of the application of s. 15(2)
of the Parole Act.

The issue to be determined is as to whether or
not the appellant, at the time he was released from imprisonment, became
legally subject to mandatory supervision.

Section 15 of the Parole Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. P-2, reads as follows:

15. (1) Where an inmate to whom parole was
not granted is released from imprisonment, prior to the expiration of his
sentence according to law, as a result of remission, including earned
remission, and the term of such remission exceeds sixty days, he shall,
notwithstanding any other Act, be subject to mandatory supervision commencing
upon his release and continuing for the duration of such remission.

(2) Paragraph 10(1)(e),
section 11, section 13 and sections 16 to 21 apply to an inmate
who is subject to mandatory supervision as though he were a paroled inmate and
as though the terms and conditions of his mandatory supervision were terms and
conditions of his parole.

Subsection (2) of s. 15 refers to
sections of the Parole Act which provide for suspension and
revocation of parole, and for re-committal in that event to serve the portion
of the term of imprisonment remaining unexpired at the time parole was granted,
including any remission, whether statutory or earned.

As s. 15(1) was in existence when the appellant
was released from imprisonment prior to the expiration of his sentence he
would, by virtue of its operation, be subject to mandatory supervision in the
absence of some statutory provision to preclude its operation. The appellant
contends that such a provision is to be found in s. 101(2) of the Criminal
Law Amendment Act, 1968-69 (Can.), c. 38, under the provisions of which
statute, what is now s. 15 of the Parole Act was enacted so as to
become s. 11B of the Parole Act. Section 101(2) provided as
follows:

101. (2) Section 11B of the said Act
as enacted by subsection (1) shall apply only in respect of persons who

[Page 300]

are sentenced to imprisonment in or
transferred to a class or classes of penitentiaries or other places of
imprisonment described in a proclamation on and after a day or days fixed by
the proclamation.

A proclamation was made, pursuant to the
provision, on July 30, 1970,
the operative portion of which read as follows:

Now Know Ye that We, by and with the advice
of our Privy Council for Canada, do by this our Proclamation declare and direct
that section 11B of the Parole Act shall come into force and have effect
in respect of persons who are sentenced to imprisonment in or transferred to
any class of penitentiary on and after the first day of August, 1970.

The combined effect of s. 101(2) and the
proclamation was to make the provisions of s. 11B (now s. 15) applicable to any
person within the class described in the proclamation. That class included any
person sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary on and after August 1, 1970.

The appellant was within that class. He was a
person who had been sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary on November 29, 1971. In my opinion, the fact that
the sentence which he was already serving at the time of his sentence on
November 29, 1971, had been imposed on February 6, 1969, does not affect his legal
position. In the absence of the later sentence, had he completed his sentence,
less remissions, s. 15 of the Parole Act would not have been applicable,
but because by his own criminal act, he incurred a further sentence after
August 1, 1970, s. 15 thereupon became applicable to him.

The appellant contends that s. 15(1) could only
be applicable in respect of the sentence which was imposed after August 1,
1970, which had already been served before his release, and did not apply to
the earlier sentence which had been imposed on February 6, 1969. This submission is not
supported by the wording of that subsection. It applies generally to an inmate
to whom parole was not granted who is released from imprisonment prior to the
expiration of his sentence as a result of remission. As previously pointed out,
the proclamation made

[Page 301]

s. 15 applicable to any person sentenced to
imprisonment in a penitentiary after August 1, 1970, and the appellant was so
sentenced. It defines a class of persons to whom s. 15 is applicable and the
appellant was within that class.

Section 14(1) of the Parole Act is
of assistance in dealing with this submission. It provides as follows:

14. (1) Where, either before, on or after
the 25th day of March 1970,

(a) a person is sentenced to
two or more terms of imprisonment, or

(b) an inmate who is in
confinement is sentenced to an additional term or terms of imprisonment,

the terms of imprisonment to which he has
been sentenced, including in a case described in paragraph (b) any
term or terms that resulted in his being in confinement, shall, for all
purposes of this Act, the Penitentiary Act and the Prisons and
Reformatories Act , be deemed to constitute one sentence consisting of a
term of imprisonment commencing on the earliest day on which any of those
sentences of imprisonment commences and ending on the expiration of the last to
expire of such terms of imprisonment.

The effect of this provision is, that for the
purposes of s. 15(1) of the Parole Act, both the first and second
sentences constituted one sentence. When the appellant was released there
existed one sentence and it was to that sentence that s. 15(1), by its terms,
was applicable.

With respect to the other points raised by the
appellant, as also with respect to the issue which I have discussed, I agree
with the reasons of Kelly J.A. in the Court of Appeal.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Respondent was charged with a contravention
of s. 5(b) of the Oil Pollution Prevention Regulations. The
Regulations were not produced at trial and Crown counsel neither asked that
judicial notice be taken of them nor implied that they had been published. The
trial judge concluded that he could not take judicial notice of them and
dismissed the case. On appeal by way of stated case the Appeal Division
unanimously held that the trial judge was correct in law.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: The Regulations P.C.
1971-2005, SOR/71-495 were published in the Canada Gazette, vol. 105 at
p. 1723. Section 23(1) of the Statutory Instruments Act can be
interpreted in two

[Page 98]

ways either that the words identify
the class of instruments that must be judicially noticed without any evidence
of any type being offered or that the words impose a condition
precedent, of proving the publication, before judicial notice can be taken. Not
all statutory instruments are published in the Canada Gazette and if the
latter interpretation were accepted subs. (1) would be made completely useless,
subs. (2) being sufficient for very easily proving the existence, publication
and contents of the instrument. No enactment should be thus deleted from a
statute unless no other conclusion is possible.

A comparison of s. 23 of the Statutory
Instruments Act with ss. 18  and 19  of the Canada Evidence Act  shows
that both impose judicial notice as an obligation but also provide, as a
material support for that obligation, that a document not otherwise admissible
may be used. Thus the purpose of s. 23(2)  becomes apparent, the
subsection is not useless any more than s. 19  of the Canada Evidence Act . Section 23(3)  has no role in the problem but completes s. 23(2) 
with respect to a consolidation. All three subs. of s. 23 have a meaning
which would not be so if the judgment appealed from was well founded. This
meaning results from Parliament’s decision to place on the same footing the
statutory instruments published in the Canada Gazette and all Acts of
Canada, public or private.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence J. dissenting: Crown counsel at the trial made no
request for judicial notice and took no step to place the relevant Regulations
before the Court. Section 23 of the Statutory Instruments Act is a
departure from strict common law methods of proof of documents. If there was to
be a wholesale dispensation of proof to enable judicial notice to be taken
clearer language should have been used than that of s. 23 considered as a
whole. To read s. 23(1) otherwise than as requiring antecedent proof of
publication in the Canada Gazette would make s. 23(3) redundant.
There was nothing inconsistent in making judicial notice of a regulation
dependent on proof of publication which would not in itself necessarily prove
the contents of the regulation.

Section 715  of the Criminal Code , which
is in Part XXIII of the Code, of which the heading is “Extraordinary
Remedies” applies to proceedings in criminal mat-

[Page 99]

ters by way of certiorari, habeas corpus,
mandamus and prohibition. These prerogative remedies are distinguishable
from an appeal and should not be stretched into a provision of general
application to apply to appeal in the broad sense or, as here, appeal by stated
case.

As the omission of the Crown was not inadvertent
and in view of the lapse of time the case should not be remitted back to the
Provincial Court judge.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of New Brunswick, Appeal Division[1],
affirming on appeal by way of stated case a judgment at trial dismissing a
charge of discharging a pollutant in contravention of s. 5(b) of
the Oil Pollution Prevention Regulations. Appeal allowed, Laskin C.J.
and Spence J. dissenting; matter remitted to trial judge for determination of
the case on its merits.

Graham Pinos, for the appellant.

Hugh H. McLellan and Anthony Allman, for
the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence J. was
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—This
appeal by the Crown, which comes here by leave of this Court from adverse
judgments of Provincial Court Judge George and the New Brunswick Court of
Appeal, concerns a question of judicial notice of the federal Oil Pollution
Prevention Regulations under which a charge was laid against the respondent
ship.

The factual circumstances underlying this
question are beyond belief. Crown counsel at the hearing of the charge
apparently did not have the Regulations upon which the charge was founded with
him or, if he did, he kept them concealed. They were not produced to the Court
in any way, nor were they referred to by counsel or by any

[Page 100]

witness. At the conclusion of the evidence and
when argument was commenced by Crown counsel, the Provincial Judge drew
attention to the fact that the Regulations had not been brought before him in
any way. Crown counsel did not ask the Court to take judicial notice of the
Regulations and did not state or even imply that the Regulations had ever been
published. In this state of affairs (as recounted by the trial judge in a
stated case that was sought by counsel for the Attorney General of Canada), and
defence counsel not replying or signifying assent to the Court’s inquiry
whether he would agree to having the Regulations placed before the Court, the
trial judge dismissed the charge. The New Brunswick Court of Appeal was
unanimous in dismissing the Crown’s appeal.

When a court takes judicial notice of a fact or
of a law it dispenses with the production of evidence to prove it. At common
law, judicial notice was taken of public or general statutes but not of private
enactments nor of subordinate legislation such as orders-in-council or
regulations. By legislation of a common variety, such as is found in s. 18
of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10 and s. 70(1)
of the New Brunswick Evidence Act, R.S.N.B. 1973, c. E-11, judicial
notice is obligatory of all statutes, public or private. Hence, it is
unecessary under such a dispensation to produce to the Court the text of a
piece of legislation, although this would invariably be done when its
interpretation is in issue.

Where subordinate or delegated legislation, such
as orders of regulations, is in issue, there is no such mandatory and
unqualified general provision respecting judicial notice thereof as is found in
legislation respecting judicial notice of statutes. It was not suggested by the
appellant in the present case that there is any common law rule of judicial notice
of orders or regulations. There are instances in American case law where
judicial notice has been taken of orders and regulations (see Wigmore on
Evidence, 3rd ed., vol. 9, No. 2572, at p. 553), and the Model Code
of Evidence of the American Law Institute in Rules 802 and 803 supports the

[Page 101]

obligatory taking of judicial notice of orders
or regulations, but only if a request is made to that end, proper notice is
given to the other side and sufficient information is given to the Court to
enable it to comply with the request. These requirements are easily met in the
case of orders and regulations and, while I do not, and need not for the
purposes of the present case, suggest that this should be the law in this
country, I must reiterate that Crown counsel at the trial made no request for
judicial notice and took no step to place the relevant Regulations before the
Court.

Two submissions were made by the appellant Crown
to support its contention that judicial notice had to be taken of the Oil
Pollution Prevention Regulations, despite the absence of any reference to them
or any exhibition or production of their text or of any document containing
them. The submissions rest, respectively, on s. 23(1) of the Statutory
Instruments Act, 1970‑71-72 (Can.), c. 38 and on s. 715 of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34. I shall deal with these
submissions in reverse order.

Section 715  reads as follows:

715. (1) No
order, conviction or other proceeding shall be quashed or set aside, and no
defendant shall be discharged, by reason only that evidence has not been given

(a) of a proclamation or
order of the Governor in Council or the lieutenant governor in council;

(b) of rules, regulations or
by-laws, made by the Governor in Council under an Act of the Parliament of
Canada or by the lieutenant governor in council under an Act of the legislature
of the province; or

(c) of the publication of a
proclamation, order, rule, regulation or by-law in the Canada Gazette or
in the official gazette for the province.

(2) Proclamations, orders, rules,
regulations and by-laws mentioned in subsection (1) and the publication
thereof shall be judicially noticed.

The Crown relies on s. 715(2) to support
its submission on judicial notice. The contention is untenable here because
s. 715  is in Part XXIII of the Criminal Code , of which the heading
is “Extraordinary Remedies”. The opening section in this Part

[Page 102]

is s. 708 which provides that “This Part
applies to proceedings in criminal matters by way of certiorari, habeas
corpus, mandamus and prohibition.” These so-called prerogative remedies are
distinguishable from an appeal, whether an appeal in the broad sense or an
appeal, as here, by stated case. It seems to me difficult to torture
s. 715(2) into a provision of general application when it is related
clearly to the prerogative remedies which give a special and limited range of
review. The Crown sought to draw nourishment for its submission as to
s. 715(2) from the dissenting reasons of Bull J.A. in R. v. Markin[2], at p. 27, but those reasons
simply ignore the context in which s. 715(2) appears, not to mention its
limitation to prerogative remedies by virtue of s. 708.

There is, in my opinion, nothing anomalous in
extending the doctrine of judicial notice to orders and regulations where they
are involved in proceedings that are attacked by the prerogative writs and in
otherwise letting the ordinary laws of evidence apply to their proof or having
proof made under facilitating legislation, such as is found in s. 21  of
the Canada Evidence Act , or by reliance on s. 23(1) of the Statutory
Instruments Act. When a number of procedures, each one different, are
provided for questioning an order or a conviction or an acquittal, it may well
be the case that a fuller range of grounds of reversal may be attached to one
or more and not to another or others. The Criminal Code  provides
generous scope for a first appeal, especially in summary conviction matters. In
respect of these, there may be a straight appeal which is by trial de novo under
s. 755 , or an appeal by way of stated case restricted to errors of law or
of jurisdiction under s. 762 . In neither of these procedures is there any
special curative provision respecting judicial notice of orders or regulations,
as there is under s. 715(2) . No doubt, the alleged defect which is in
issue here could be cured upon an appeal by trial de novo, but there is
no curative provision where the appeal, as in the present case, is by stated
case. Parliament has chosen to eliminate an evidentiary issue of want of proof
of orders

[Page 103]

or regulations where the procedure to quash is
invoked under s. 715 ; and by providing for judicial notice thereof it has
simply narrowed the range of permissible objections under that special
procedure which might be taken by an accused person. The advantage so given to
the Crown under s. 715  was not extended to appeals.

The Crown’s principal submission invoked
s. 23(1) of the Statutory Instruments Act, and for proper
consideration of that submission I set out the whole of s. 23 which is as
follows:

23. (1) A
statutory instrument that has been published in the Canada Gazette shall
be judicially noticed.

(2) In addition to any other manner of
proving the existence or contents of a statutory instrument, evidence of the
existence or contents of a statutory instrument may be given by the production
of a copy of the Canada Gazette purporting to contain the text of the
statutory instrument.

(3) For the purposes of this section, where
a regulation is included in a copy of a consolidation of regulations purporting
to be printed by the Queen’s Printer, that regulation shall be deemed to have
been published in the Canada Gazette.

The Crown would have this Court read
s. 23(1) as if the words “that has been published in the Canada
Gazette” were not there, and would thus equate s. 23(1) with
s. 18  of the Canada Evidence Act , providing unqualifiedly for
judicial notice of Acts of Parliament. The Crown supports its contention by
alleging that to read s. 23(1) as requiring antecedent proof of publication
in the Canada Gazette would make it redundant in the light of
s. 23(2) . I do not agree that this is so. Rather do I think that if the
appellant Crown is correct, it would be s. 23(2)  that would be redundant.
Moreover, agreeing as I do with the submission that meaning should be
attributed to all parts of a connected enactment, the appellant Crown’s
submission on s. 23(1) would also make s. 23(3)  redundant. This
provision shows another way in which proof of publication in the Canada
Gazette may be shown, a way which does not require production of a copy of
the Canada Gazette.

[Page 104]

I think it relevant as well to point out that
what we have in s. 23 of the Statutory Instruments Act is a
departure from strict common law methods of proof of documents, and if there is
to be a wholesale dispensation of proof to enable judicial notice to be taken,
clearer language should be expected than what appears in s. 23 when it is
considered as a whole. I add too that there is nothing inconsistent in making judicial
notice of a regulation dependent on proof of a supporting fact, e.g.
publication, which would not in itself necessarily prove the contents of the
regulation. That, in my opinion, is what is stipulated in s. 23(1). The
mere fact that there may be overlapping provisions, as there undoubtedly are
under s. 23 of the Statutory Instruments Act and s. 21  of the Canada
Evidence Act , does not warrant the reading out of inconvenient words in
order to arrive at a clean result which would not only eliminate the overlapping
but would eliminate these associated provisions even in those respects in which
they do not overlap.

The Oil Pollution Prevention Regulations were
also involved in an issue of judicial notice in R. v. The Vessel
“Besseggen”[3] which
came to the British Columbia Court of Appeal also by way of stated case. The
majority of the Court, in sustaining the trial judge’s decision that he could
take judicial notice of the Regulations, did so on the ground that a copy of
the Canada Gazette containing the Regulations was produced to him, and
hence what is now s. 23(1) of the Statutory Instruments Act was
satisfied. The contrary view urged by counsel for the vessel and supported by
the dissenting reasons of Branca J.A. was that it was necessary formally to
prove the Regulations or to prove publication in the Canada Gazette as a
fact before judicial notice could be taken. Branca J.A. founded his reasons on
the basis that a copy of the Canada Gazette had not been produced to the
trial judge. The factual difference between the members of the Court in the Besseggen
case does not arise here, and my only observation on that case is that it
would be a sufficient support for judicial notice to produce or hand up to the
trial

[Page 105]

judge a copy of the Canada Gazette containing
the particular regulations.

I have given thought to the question whether
this Court, at this stage, should send the case back to the Provincial Court
Judge with a direction that it be re-opened to permit Crown counsel to tender
or produce a copy of the Canada Gazette or to show publication under
s. 23(3). This relief was not asked by the Crown either here or, so far as
appears, in the New Brunswick Court of Appeal. Although the Crown was allowed
to re-open its case in R. v. Kishen Singh[4]
to repair inadvertent failure to prove a proclamation, bringing into force
the statute under which the charge was laid, this was done by the trial judge
and there was no prejudice to the accused. Here the Crown’s omission was not
inadvertent, and at a distance of nearly four years since the charge was laid
and nearly two years since the trial was held I am unwilling to guess that
there would be no prejudice, nor do I think that the Crown deserves any
indulgence.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. Was delivered by

DE GRANDPRE J.—This appeal raises the question
of judicial notice of statutory instruments. The judgment of the Appeal
Division of the New Brunswick Supreme Court being now reported[5] it will be sufficient for me to mention
only the highlights of the factual situation:

1) on the 1st of February 1972, an information
was laid stating that the respondent has discharged a pollutant in the Harbour
of Saint John in contravention of s. 5(b) of the Oil
Pollution Prevention Regulations, thereby committing an offence contrary to
s. 761 of the

[Page 106]

Canada Shipping Act  as amended by c. 27 of the Statutes of Canada, 1970-71;

2) the trial was held in Saint John before a
judge of the Provincial Court and both parties presented their cases;

3) during the argument, the judge pointed out to
counsel for the Crown that the regulations referred to in the information had
not been introduced formally in evidence, nor had a copy thereof even been
submitted to the Court;

4) counsel for the defence did not reply to the
judge’s question if he would agree to have the regulations placed before the
Court;

5) no copy of the Canada Gazette containing
the text of the regulations was produced at any time to the Court.

The trial judge concluded that he could not take
judicial notice of the regulations and dismissed the information. By stated
case, pursuant to s. 762  of the Criminal Code , the Court of Appeal
was asked whether or not this holding was correct in law and gave a unanimous
answer in the affirmative. With leave, the question is now before us.

In the courts below, the defence had also raised
a question of jurisdiction in the trial judge. This point has been abandoned by
respondent in her factum.

The Court of Appeal has examined the question of
judicial notice on the basis that the regulation, P.C. 1971-2005, SOR/71-495,
which purport to have been made by the Governor General in Council pursuant to
ss. 736  and 739  of the Canada Shipping Act , were published in vol. 105
of the Canada Gazette, at p. 1723 and following. I agree with this
approach.

While four grounds had been raised by the Crown
before the Court of Appeal in support of its submission, only two were pressed
before us. Judicial notice of the regulations should have been taken

[Page 107]

a) by virtue of s. 715  of the Criminal
Code ;

b) by virtue of s. 23 of the Statutory
Instruments Act, 1970-71 (Can.), c. 38.

Finding myself in agreement with the Crown on
the second point, I will express no opinion on the first.

Section 23 reads:

(1) A statutory instrument that has been
published in the Canada Gazette shall be judicially noticed.

(2) In addition to any other manner of
proving the existence or contents of a statutory instrument, evidence of the
existence or contents of a statutory instrument may be given by the production
of a copy of the Canada Gazette purporting to contain the text of the
statutory instrument.

(3) For the purposes of this section, where
a regulation is included in a copy of a consolidation of regulations purporting
to be printed by the Queen’s Printer, that regulation shall be deemed to have
been published in the Canada Gazette.

It is common ground that regulations are
statutory instruments.

What is the meaning of subs. (1)? There is no
doubt that if it read “a statutory instrument shall be judicially noticed”,
there would be no problem and the courts below would have taken judicial notice
of the regulations. The difficulty arises because of the presence of the words
“that has been published in the Canada Gazette”. So that the real
question is to determine the meaning of the words just quoted in the context of
the subsection:

a) one reading is that the words identify the
class of instruments that must be judicially noticed without any evidence of
any type being offered;

b) another reading is that the words impose a
condition precedent thus creating the obligation to prove the publication
before judicial notice can be taken of the instrument.

The Court of Appeal has opted for the second
meaning after a full review of the cases pro and con. I prefer the first
interpretation.

[Page 108]

All instruments are not printed in the Canada
Gazette; ss. 6, 11 and 27 of the Statutory Instruments Act make this
point very clear. Parliament when it decided to enact the rule that statutory
instruments should be judicially noticed, had to decide whether that rule would
apply to all instruments or only to those published in the Canada Gazette. By
subs. (1), it decided upon this last course. Thus by the words of the statute,
the rule of judicial notice is limited to those instruments which in fact had
been published in the Gazette. But this fact of publication needs no
proof. To impose that condition as a preliminary step before judicial notice
can be taken of an instrument is to make subs. 1 completely useless, subs. (2)
being then entirely sufficient for the purpose of rendering very easy the proof
of the existence, publication and contents of the instrument. No enactment
should be thus deleted from a statute unless no other conclusion is possible.

It is interesting to compare the treatment of
the subject matter in the Act under consideration with that of the Acts of
Parliament in the Canada Evidence Act . To facilitate this comparison, I
give below, side by side, the relevant texts:


 
  
  Judicial
  Notice of Statutory
  
  
  Judicial
  Notice
  
 
 
  
  Instruments
  
  
  17…
  
 
 
  
  23. (1) A statutory instrument that has been published in the Canada
  Gazette shall be judicially noticed.
  
  
  18. Judicial notice shall be taken of all Acts of the Parliament of
  Canada, public or private, without being specially pleaded. 1967-68,
  c. 7, s. 40.
  
 
 
  
  (2) In addition to any other manner of
  proving the existence or contents of a statutory instrument, evidence of the
  existence or contents of a statutory instrument may be given by the
  production of a copy of the Canada Gazette purporting to contain the
  text of the statutory instrument.
  
  
  Documentary Evidence
  19. Every
  copy of any Act of the Parliament of Canada, public or private, printed by
  the Queen’s Printer, is evidence of such Act and of its contents; and every
  copy purporting to be printed by the Queen’s Printer shall be deemed to be so
  printed, unless the contrary is shown. R.S., c. 307, s. 19.
  
 


Under both statutes,

a) judicial notice is an obligation;

b) as a material support for that obligation, a
document which otherwise would not be admissible in the Court record may be
used.

[Page 109]

Thus, the purpose of subs. (2) of s. 23
becomes apparent. Parliament has stated that judges and courts in the discharge
of their obligation to take judicial notice of statutory instruments printed in
the Canada Gazette and of all Acts of Parliament need not feel obliged
to ascertain the original text but can well be satisfied with using the
contents as printed by the Queen’s Printer. Thus, subs. (2) is not useless any
more than s. 19  of the Canada Evidence Act .

Subsection (3) of s. 23 has no role in
the problem under study. It deals with a narrower situation, namely
consolidation of regulations, and completes subs. (2) by enacting that after such
a consolidation, there is no need to go back to the number of the Canada
Gazette where the regulation was originally published.

Thus, all three subsections of s. 23
have a meaning, which is not the case if the judgment appealed from is well
founded. This meaning is the result of Parliament’s decision to place on the
same footing the statutory instruments published in the Canada Gazette and
all Acts of Canada, public or private. This is a normal evolution in the light
of the modern scientific possibilities to publish and to retrieve legal
material. Till 1950, statutory instruments had to be proven under s. 21  of
the Canada Evidence Act . If s. 23 of the Statutory Instruments
Act does not add anything to that s. 21 , it is a remarkable piece of
useless legislation.

That evolution is not limited to Canada. In
England where there is still, if I am well informed, no equivalent to
s. 23, subs. (1) of our Statutory Instruments Act, Darling J., in Duffin
v. Markham[6], where
an information had been dismissed because an Order under the Defence of the
Realm Regulations had not been put in evidence, stated that the Justices
“should have treated the objection of the respondents’ solicitor as a mere
technical triviality”. In Smell v. Unity Finance Co.

[Page 110]

Ltd.[7] decided in 1963, Willmer, L.J., with respect to a Control Order
dealing with a hire‑purchase agreement which had not been put in
evidence, stated at p. 216:

It seems to me it is quite wrong to treat
the order as being a matter of evidence. It is a statutory order having the
force of a statute. It appears to me that it is the duty of a court, when such
a statutory instrument is brought to its attention, to apply it.

It is true that the context of this
particular statement was somewhat different from the one with which we are here
concerned but I do believe it shows the evolution that is taking place in
England in this area of the law.

Although I have come to the conclusion that
appellant’s submission is correct in law, I fail to understand why, as a matter
of courtesy to the Court, counsel for the Crown at trial did not offer to the
judge and to the defence a copy of the Regulations. He should have kept in mind
the admonition of Baron Parke as reported in Wig-more on Evidence, 3rd
ed., vol. 9, p. 538, footnote 3:

For the future, it would save time if, when
you founded an objection upon an Act of Parliament, you had the Act here; for,
though we are supposed to keep the statutes in our heads, we do not.

The lament of Scrutton L.J., in Tolley v.
Fry[8] at
p. 475, is also pertinent:

It is difficult to know what judges are
allowed to know, though they are ridiculed if they pretend not to know.

On the other hand, the trial judge, assuming
that he rightfully came to the conclusion that he could not take judicial
notice of the regulations (an assumption that, obviously, I am not ready to
make), should have used his authority to take the step ordered by the Court of
Appeal in the Duffin case (supra) and told the prosecution
to prove the

[Page 111]

regulations, even granting an adjournment for
that purpose if need be.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the Order of
the Appeal Division of the New Brunswick Supreme Court and remit the matter to
the trial judge for determination of the case on its merits.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Breaking and entering—Actual
and constructive—Meaning and scope of s. 308 (b)(ii) of the Criminal
Code —Distinctions between ss. 306  and 307 .

The accused was convicted of breaking and
entering a place and committing theft therein. The place was a dwelling house
under construction and the accused entered through a doorway from a carport
where no door had been installed and no barrier was in place. This conviction
was affirmed on appeal.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

At common law constructive breaking took
place when entry was effected through an aperture, such as a chimney, that was
permanently open. This notional breaking was introduced into the Criminal
Code  of Canada in 1892, but
the notion was substantially altered and extended by 1953-54, c. 51,
s. 294 (b) (now s. 308 (b)) to include any entry without
lawful justification through a permanent or temporary opening. The plain words
of s. 308  must be given effect according to their ordinary meaning.
Parliament has, for the purpose of the Criminal Code  given the word
“break” an artificial construction that would not otherwise prevail and it is
within Parliamentary competence to do so. The argument that the distinction between
ss. 306 and 307 of the Code would be extinguished if entry through an
open door constituted breaking does not take into account the differences
between those two sections. It is up to the prosecutor to decide in the
circumstances of any particular case which charge is appropriate.

R. v. Sutherland (1967), 58 W.W.R. 441, applied; R. v. Bargimis, [1970] 4
C.C.C. 358, referred to; R. v. Jewell (1974), 28 C.R.N.S. 331,
overruled.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia[1] affirming a judg-

[Page 647]

ment of McDonald C.C.J. Appeal dismissed.

S. Goldberg, for the appellant.

A. Stewart, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The question raised in this appeal is
not novel. It was current in the time of Lord Hale, in the eighteenth century.
The question is whether an intruder can be convicted of breaking and entering
premises without actual breaking. Hale (1 P.C. 551), writing in 1778,
delineates two forms of breaking:

(1) In law, and thus every one that enters
into another’s house against his will, or to commit a felony, tho the doors be
open, does in law break the house; (2) There is a breaking in fact, an actual
force upon the house, as by opening a door, breaking a window, etc.

Today, (1) would be regarded as a constructive
breaking and (2) as an actual breaking. Hale recounts how an earlier jurist had
held breaking in law sufficient to constitute burglary if a man entered the
house by the doors open in the night and stole goods, but, Hale adds: “yet the
law is, that a bare breaking in law, viz. an entry by the doors and
windows open is not sufficient to make burglary without an actual breaking”.
There was an exception: if a thief went down a chimney to steal, that was a
breaking and entering. The distinction between actual and constructive breaking
endures to this day.

At common law an actual breaking occurred
whenever any part of the building or of its closed fastenings was displaced as,
for example, by drawing a bolt, turning a key or lifting a latch: Kenny’s Outlines
of Criminal Law, 17th ed., para. 311. The opening of a closed but
unlocked bedroom window was a breaking while the further opening of a window
already partly opened was not. The reason suggested for this precious
distinction was that when a householder left a window or a door partly open he
offered a visible invitation to enter.

[Page 648]

Constructive breaking, in the absence of actual
breaking, extended at common law to cases in which the intruder entered the
premises by some aperture which, by necessity, was left permanently open, such
as a chimney. In 1892, that concept found its way into the Canadian Criminal
Code (c. 29, s. 407(b)(ii)). It was repeated in the Codes
of 1906 (R.S.C. 1906, c. 146, s. 340) and 1927 (R.S.C. 1927,
c. 36, s. 340(2)) in these words:

Every one who obtains entrance into any
building by any threat or artifice used for that purpose, or by collusion with
any person in the building, or who enters any chimney or other aperture of the
building permanently left open for any necessary purpose, shall be deemed to
have broken and entered that building.

The wording was substantially altered and
extended by 1953-54, c. 51, s. 294(b) and now appears as
s. 308 (b) reading:

308. For the
purpose of sections 306 and 307…

(b) a person shall be deemed
to have broken and entered if

(i) he obtained entrance by a threat or
artifice or by collusion with a person within, or

(ii) he entered without lawful
justification or excuse, the proof of which lies upon him, by a permanent or
temporary opening.

Central to this appeal is the scope to be given
to s. 308 (b)(ii).

The definition of “break” is found in
s. 282 of the Code reading:

282. In this
Part “break” means

(a) to break any part,
internal or external, or

(b) to open any thing that is
used or intended to be used to close or to cover an internal or external
opening;

The facts in the present case are unexceptional.
The accused entered a partly constructed unoccupied dwelling-house at 3.30 a.m.
through an open doorway leading into the house from a carport. The door had not
yet been installed. The owner, as a temporary measure, had nailed a sheet of
plywood over the opening, but it would appear

[Page 649]

that some one had removed it as it was lying on
the ground at the time of entry by the accused and a companion. The accused was
convicted on a charge that he did unlawfully break and enter a place, to wit, a
dwelling-house under construction, and did commit the indictable offence of
theft therein. It was common ground that the building was, by definition, a
“place” but that it was not a dwelling-house. There was no suggestion that the
accused had any lawful justification or excuse for entering the building. In
dismissing an appeal by the accused the British Columbia Court of Appeal,
speaking through Mr. Justice McFarlane, held that the language of
s. 308 (b)(ii) was clear and unambiguous, and sufficient to support
the conviction. The reasoning of the same Court in the earlier case of R. v.
Sutherland[2], was
applied rather than that of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Jewell[3].

In Sutherland’s case the accused was
charged with unlawfully breaking and entering a garage and committing an
indictable offence therein. The garage was enclosed on three sides and open at
one end for the entrance of a car. It was through this entrance that the
accused entered to steal gasoline. Mr. Justice McFarlane delivered the
judgment of the Court. R. v. Sutherland was decided on the narrow ground
that the open end of a garage would be described as an entrance and not an
opening.

In the reasons for judgment delivered in the
case at bar, Mr. Justice McFarlane had this to say respecting Sutherland’s
case:

In my opinion the basis of the decision in Regina
v. Sutherland was the interpretation of the words “permanent or temporary
opening” in section 308 (b)(ii). I think it is clearly implicit in
the judgment that if the entrance to the garage had been held to be a permanent
or temporary opening within the meaning of the statute Sutherland’s conviction
would have been upheld although the breaking was constructive only and not
actual. It was decided that subsection 308 (b)(ii) did not apply
because the entry was not by a permanent or temporary opening.

[Page 650]

In Regina v. Bargimis[4], the accused induced the assistant
night manager to leave open the doors of a restaurant. It was understood that
the accused would enter the restaurant and through it reach an adjacent drug
store for the purpose of stealing a safe. The store manager advised his
employer and the police were notified. The accused on a Sunday evening entered
and went downstairs and through another door into the restaurant, where he was
arrested. Chief Justice Gale, delivering the judgment of the Ontario Court of
Appeal, dismissing an appeal had this to say, p. 361:

In our view, the accused entered
Zumburger’s “without lawful justification or excuse… by a permanent or
temporary opening.” As the subparagraph qualifies the term “opening” by using
both “permanent” and “temporary,” it matters not, as it seems to us, whether
one considers the opening of the door that was ajar in the laneway or the
opening of the door into Zumburger’s as the opening through which the accused
entered without lawful justification or excuse. Mr. Levy relied upon the
case of R. v. Sutherland, [1967] 2 C.C.C. 84, 50 C.R. 197, 58 W.W.R.
441, a decision of the Court of Appeal of British
 Columbia. If the facts were the same we would, of
course, be very much inclined to follow the Sutherland judgment.
However, in our view, that case does not in any sense inhibit us in upholding
the conviction here. In the Sutherland case the accused entered a
three-sided garage at the point where there was no wall and the Court of Appeal
of British Columbia held that
where there was no wall or other structure surrounding an open space, the
“opening” was not regarded as coming within the subparagraph. In our view that
is quite correct. In other words, there has to be something in which an opening
exists and in the Sutherland case there was nothing to sustain the
opening. Here, of course, both doorways constitute openings, the one at the
lane in the outside wall of the building and the one into Zumburger’s basement
in an inside wall of the building. Accordingly, the provisions of para. (b)(ii)
cover the situation precisely. In this connection, reference should also be had
to the case of R. v. Corkum (1969), 7 C.R.N.S. 61, where McLellan, Co.
Ct. J. of the Nova Scotia County Court also distinguished the situation before
him from that which prevailed in the Sutherland case.

[Page 651]

In Regina v. Bargimis doorways were held
to constitute openings. The Court relied upon sub‑para. (b)(ii) of
s. 308  because of the argument advanced by counsel for the accused that
subpara. (b)(i) did not apply. The argument was based on the
submission that there was no collusion because the employee was merely
pretending to agree to a collusive agreement and was not in fact doing so.

I come now to R. v. Jewell, supra. The
accused in that case entered an unoccupied dilapidated dwelling-house through a
screen door and an inner door, both of which were open wide enough to permit
the accused to enter without further opening the doors. The Court held that
entry through the open door in the circumstances of the case did not constitute
a breaking of the premises. The judgment notes that at common law and under
s. 340 (2) (the section referring to chimneys or other apertures
permanently left open) entry through a temporary opening such as a hole in the
roof or a wall in the building did not constitute a breaking of the building;
nor did further opening a door or window which was already open. With respect,
I agree. It is then stated that s. 294 (now s. 308 ) of the Code had
effected a change in the Canadian law, and the following note to s. 294
from Martin’s Criminal Code (1955), p. 517, was quoted and relied
upon:

This comes from the former s. 340,
altered by addition of the words “or temporary” in clause (b). The
purpose of the addition is to meet decisions that the raising a window that was
partly open did not constitute a breaking: R. v. Burns (1903), 7 C.C.C.
95; R. v. Miller (1948), 91 C.C.C. 270; R. v. Dolbec (1950), 98
C.C.C. 52.

The change may well have been prompted by
decisions which had held that raising a partly opened window did not constitute
a breaking, as the learned author of Martins Criminal Code suggests, but
it is clear that the language which Parliament used in changing the law
embraced far more than partly opened windows. It broadened the reference to
permanent apertures by removing the requirement that they be “left open for any
necessary purpose.” It extended constructive breaking to include entry by any
temporary open-

[Page 652]

ing. In addition, the burden of proof that he
had lawful justification or excuse for entry was placed upon the person who
enters.

If I understand the judgment in R. v. Jewell correctly,
it would have the effect of limiting s. 308 (b)(ii) to those
situations in which a would-be intruder found a door or window partly ajar and
opened it further in order to gain entry. A partly opened door would be an
opening but a fully open door would not be so regarded. There is nothing in the
language of the section to connote such a result. A distinction of the
kind suggested would differentiate between doors open wide enough to permit an
intruder to slip around them and those so narrowly ajar as to require a push in
order to enter; it would also distinguish, as one of my colleagues was moved to
observe during argument, between fat burglars and thin ones. Such an
interpretation of the section would also do away with constructive entry
through chimneys, perhaps not a daily occurrence but conceptually imbedded in
common law and statute for centuries.

Parliament has extended the limits of
constructive breaking. Parliament, for the purpose of the Criminal Code , has
given the word “break” an artificial construction that would not otherwise
prevail. The notion that a person has broken and entered if he obtains entrance
by threat or artifice or collusion is equally a fiction, long recognized at
common law and now codified in s. 308 (b)(i). It is within
Parliamentary competence to extend constructive entry from “any chimney or
other aperture permanently left open for any necessary purpose,” as stated in
s. 304(2)  and in the common law, to “a permanent or temporary opening.”
These are plain words which must be given effect according to their ordinary
meaning. There are many other “deeming” sections in the Criminal Code . Some
of them were noted in the judgment of Mr. Justice Ritchie in Brodie v.
The Queen[5]. This
Court had occasion to say in R. v. Maroney[6], at p. 310:

[Page 653]

We are not concerned with larceny here but
with theft by conversion as defined by the Criminal Code  of Canada.
Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law, 3rd ed., p. 396, point out that the
1916 Larceny Act was often construed on the tacit assumption that there
was no intention to alter the previous law and the earlier case law had lost
little or no authority. We are concerned here with a Code. We start with the
Code and not with the previous state of the law for the purpose of enquiring
whether the Code has made any change. On the plain meaning of our Code the
facts of this case show the commission of an indictable offence—theft.

The argument was advanced that the distinction
between ss. 306 and 307 of the Code would be extinguished if entry
through an open door constituted breaking. There can be no doubt that the
effect of the amendment was to narrow the gap between the two sections. They
overlap but some differences remain. Section 307 is concerned only with
dwelling-houses, s. 306 with “places” which, in addition to dwellings,
includes other buildings or structures, railway vehicles, vessels, aircraft and
trailers. Section 307 speaks also of a person who is “in” a dwelling-house with
intent. Section 306 does not, though it provides for the situation in which a
person “breaks out” of a place after committing an indictable offence therein.
Thus, certain factual situations will call for a charge under s. 306,
others under s. 307. In some cases of dwelling-house entry the prosecutor
may have the alternative of charging under one section or the other, but
this is not uncommon. A stabbing, for example, may give rise to a nice question
of whether to charge attempted murder, or causing bodily harm with intent to
maim, or some lesser charge. It remains for the prosecutor in the circumstances
of the particular case to decide which charge is appropriate.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of the Court was delivered orally

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—We do not need to hear you,
Mr. McLeod. We agree with the Court of Appeal that the way in which and
the grounds on which the trial judge exercised his discretion in respect of the
attempt of counsel for the accused to challenge for cause is not open to
objection. Further, we do not agree that there was any error in the disposition
made by the Court of Appeal on the other grounds of appeal raised in that
Court, nor do we think that in the circumstances of the present case there was
any error in the failure to direct the jury on the issue of drunkenness.

We would add that in our opinion the procedure
outlined by the Court of Appeal for dealing with challenges for cause provides
a useful guide for trial judges called on to deal with such challenges.

Appellant was found not guilty of the murder
of his infant child. He confessed to the police to injuring the child to prevent
it from crying but later at his trial testified that he had not injured the
child and that he had only confessed in order to protect his wife. Both he and
his wife denied knowing how the injuries were caused. At trial the defence was
permitted to adduce psychiatric evidence as to the mental state of the wife
tending to show that she was more probably the one who had injured the child.
The trial judge did not however permit the Crown the right to full
cross-examination of the psychiatrist or to call rebuttal evidence. The Court
of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal and ordered a new trial.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

While, in general, character evidence adduced
by the defence must only be evidence of general reputation and evidence brought
by the Crown in reply must be confined to similar evidence of general
reputation, in the particular circumstances, appellant having given evidence
and adduced evidence as to his mental and emotional condition, such evidence
should have been subject to cross-examination. Further, by leading evidence as
to his wife’s mental condition he opened up his own mental and emotional
condition for cross-examination and made admissible Crown expert psychiatric
evidence in reply.

While the Crown argued that the trial judge
should not have allowed the defence to adduce the psychiatric

[Page 825]

evidence as to the wife’s mental state to
indicate the probability that she had assaulted the child, for the reason given
by the Court of Appeal, that Court was correct in affirming that the evidence
was relevant and admissible, within the proper sphere of expert evidence and
not excluded by a policy rule.

The question as to how far a defence may go
in adducing evidence that some third party was by virtue of that party’s mental
or emotional state a more probable perpetrator than the accused is simply a
question as to the relevance of the evidence. In the present case there can be
no question as to relevance; the accused and his wife were alone in an
apartment with the child at all relevant times; during a very large part of the
lime they were together with the child, and on occasions each of them was alone
with the child.

Lowery v. The Queen, [1974] A.C. 85 referred to.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] allowing an appeal
from an acquittal verdict by a jury and directing a new trial on an indictment
charging non-capital murder. Appeal dismissed.

Bernard Cugelman, for the appellant.

E.G.Hachborn, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

SPENCE J.—This is an appeal by the accused
William George McMillan from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on February 14, 1975. By
that judgment, the said Court of Appeal allowed an appeal by the Crown from
McMillan’s acquittal verdict by a jury upon an indictment charging non-capital
murder.

The reasons for the Court of Appeal for Ontario were given by Mr. Justice
Martin in a long and carefully detailed judgment which included a meticulous
recital of the facts. That judgment has been reported in (1975), 7 O.R. (2d)
750, and I therefore am of the opinion that I need not repeat that detailed
statement of facts.

The appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario by the Crown was under the
provisions of s. 605(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  and
that section limits the appeal to “on any ground of appeal that

[Page 826]

involves a question of law alone”. The notice of
appeal sets out in its first three grounds those with which the appeal to that
Court and to this Court are concerned and they are as follows:

1. The learned trial judge erred in
admitting evidence concerning the mental state of the wife of the accused.

2. The learned trial judge erred in denying
counsel for the Crown the right to full cross‑examination.

3. The learned trial judge erred in rejecting
reply evidence tendered by the Crown.

As will be seen from a perusal of
Mr. Justice Martin’s reasons, the Court of Appeal upheld the decision of
the learned trial judge that the defence was permitted to adduce psychiatric
evidence tending to show that Roberta Gayle McMillan, the wife of the accused,
here appellant, was of such a psychiatric disposition as would make it more
probable that she so assaulted her child as to cause the latter’s death. Martin
J.A. further held, here accepting the argument of the Crown, that the learned
trial judge erred in not also permitting the Crown to cross-examine the same
psychiatrist upon the psychiatric condition of the accused and that he further
erred in refusing to permit the Crown to adduce in reply psychiatric evidence
as to the mental condition of the said accused. The learned trial judge had
based his ruling that the Crown could not proceed with the cross-examination or
adduce such expert evidence upon the

very well established [principle that]
where character evidence has been introduced by the accused or on behalf of the
accused that should be general character evidence and on cross-examination and
in reply the parameter must be confined to general reputation.

Martin J.A. was in agreement with the statement that
in general character evidence adduced by the defence it must be only evidence
of general reputation and that evidence adduced by the Crown in reply thereto
must be confined to like evidence of general reputation. However, he was of the
opinion, which I share, that in the particular circumstances of the present
case the accused having given evidence and adduced evidence as to

[Page 827]

his mental and emotional condition such evidence
should have been subject to cross‑examination and, in addition, having
adduced expert evidence as to his wife’s mental condition, he opened up his own
mental and emotional condition for cross-examination by the Crown and made
admissible Crown expert psychiatric evidence in reply upon that subject.

Counsel for the Crown in this Court took the
position that the learned trial judge had erred in allowing the defence to
adduce as part of its defence psychiatric evidence that the wife of the accused
was from her character and mental state a probable person to have committed the
assault upon her child which caused the latter’s death. As I have said, that
was the position of the Crown in its appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario
and Martin J.A., giving the reasons for that Court, concluded that such
evidence was relevant and admissible holding that the psychiatric evidence was
(a) relevant, (b) not excluded by a policy rule, and (c) that it fell within
the proper sphere of expert evidence. I have perused with care the extensive
reasons given by Martin J.A. and, despite the very able argument by counsel for
the Crown made in this Court, feel that I may accept those reasons and I need
not add thereto.

There is, of course, a question as to how far
the defence may go in adducing evidence that some third party was, by virtue of
that party’s mental or emotional state, a more probable perpetrator than the
accused. In my view, that is simply a question as to the relevance of the
evidence. There would be no probative value in the evidence that some other
person quite unconnected with the circumstances surrounding the charge might
because of his or her mental or emotional state be a more probable person to
have committed the crime. That situation is not reflected in the present
circumstances. Here, the accused and his wife were alone in their apartment
with this child at all relevant times. During a very large part of the time,
they were together with the child but there were occasions when the accused was
alone with the child and there was at least one occasion when the mother, the
wife of the accused, was alone with the child. The evidence which under other
circumstances

[Page 828]

might be quite irrelevant and have no probative
value under such circumstances becomes very relevant and of high probative
value. An illustration in which it was so considered by the Privy Council is
that discussed by Martin J.A., i.e., Lowery v. The Queen[2]. Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest at p.
102 adopted what had been said by the Court of Criminal Appeals of Victoria as
follows:

It is, we think, one thing to say that such
evidence is excluded when tendered by the Crown in proof of guilt, but quite
another to say that it is excluded when tendered by the accused in disproof of
his own guilt. We see no reason of policy or fairness which justifies or
requires the exclusion of evidence relevant to prove the innocence of an
accused person.

I further agree with Martin J.A. that when such
evidence is adduced by the defence there is no policy preventing its admission
such as the requirement of fairness to the accused which applies to prevent its
being adduced by the Crown. Certainly the psychiatric evidence given in this
case by Dr. Cooper was expert evidence upon a subject which was not within
the knowledge of the ordinary citizen. I am, therefore, not ready to accede to the
first proposition advanced by counsel for the Crown and I am of the view that
the Court of Appeal for Ontario were correct in refusing to hold that the
learned trial judge had erred in permitting the adducing by the defence of the
evidence of Dr. Cooper as to the mental and emotional state of the wife of
the accused. The fact that the counsel for the accused had called the said wife
as a witness for the defence did not bar the production of such evidence.

The appellant here contends, however, that the
Court of Appeal for Ontario
erred when it held that the learned trial judge should have permitted the
cross-examination by the Crown of the same defence witness, Dr. Cooper, as
to the mental and emotional state of the accused. Dr. Cooper had seen the
accused on two occasions. The second occasion was during the trial, was
momentary and was not the subject of any particular discussion during the voir
dire held by the learned trial judge. On the first occasion,
Dr. Cooper had examined

[Page 829]

the accused in the jail at Toronto to “make an assessment of him”. No
defence of insanity was advanced at the trial. In giving evidence upon the voir
dire held by the learned trial judge, Dr. Cooper in his answers to
cross-examination revealed this earlier visit to the accused and expressed the
opinion that the accused, as well as his wife, was a psychopath but a
psychopath of a different type, one which he called an “inadequate psychopath,
someone who is not physically dangerous”. It was this evidence which counsel
for the Crown sought to make the basis for his cross-examination of
Dr. Cooper and which the learned trial judge excluded for the reason I
have outlined above.

In dealing with this question, Martin J.A. said:

In my view, the entire nature of the
defence involved an assertion that the respondent was a person of normal mental
make-up. In those circumstances, Crown counsel was entitled to show, if he
could, that there were two persons present in the house who were psychopaths,
not one. Any other conclusion would permit an accused to present an entirely
distorted picture to the jury. The respondent, having introduced psychiatric
evidence to show that it was more probable that his wife had caused the
injuries to the child than that he had caused them, because he lacked her dangerous
characteristics, lost his protection, in the circumstances of this case,
against having his own mental make-up revealed to the jury.

I can see no answer to that conclusion. It would
be obviously improper to permit an accused man to put in issue (a) his own calm
and normal disposition, and (b) the psychiatric condition of his wife, by
expert evidence and then prevent the cross-examination of that evidence by
reliance upon any principle that character evidence had to be only that of
general reputation. The expert evidence adduced by the defence from
Dr. Cooper as to the mental and emotional state of the wife was not
character evidence in the ordinary sense but was evidence to show a psychical
propensity for the obvious violent assault which caused the death of her child.
It was adduced by the defence. The evidence which the Crown sought from
Dr. Cooper by cross-examination was exactly the same kind of evidence as
to the mental and emotional state of the accused and was intended to meet the

[Page 830]

accused’s own evidence that he was of a normal
mental make-up. Once the accused gave that evidence and adduced the expert
evidence of Dr. Cooper as to his wife’s condition, there could be no
impropriety in permitting that witness to be cross-examined as to his rather
fortuitous knowledge of the mental and emotional state of the accused who had
just testified to his own normality.

It was the opinion of Martin J.A. that the
refusal to permit such cross-examination of Dr. Cooper did not result in
any particular miscarriage of justice as, had such cross‑examination been
allowed to proceed, it would have been unlikely to have affected the verdict.
Dr. Cooper’s opinion was that the accused man was of such a type of
psychopath as not to be one of dangerous propensity. I am of the opinion that
the Crown was entitled to do its best upon such a cross-examination and should
be entitled to cross-examine on the new trial which was directed by the Court
of Appeal.

There remains the issue as to whether the
learned trial judge was correct in not only refusing to permit
cross-examination of Dr. Cooper as to the accused man’s mental and
emotional condition but also his refusal to permit the Crown to call other
psychiatric evidence available to it upon the same subject. It was this latter
refusal which Martin J.A. found justified the direction for a new trial which,
as I have said, was the course directed by the judgment for the Court of Appeal
for Ontario.

It happened that the Provincial Court Judge had
remanded the accused for a mental assessment in connection with the charge of
manslaughter then pending against the accused and arising out of the same
circumstances upon which the accused was later tried for non‑capital
murder. This examination was carried out by a Dr. Common. The report
thereon by Dr. Common stated that the accused was mentally fit to stand
trial and made certain references to his personality traits. Since the main
purpose of the examination and report was to consider the issue of fitness to
stand trial, the report was far from conclusive as to whether personality
traits rendered it more probable that the accused had assaulted his child
causing her death rather than had the mother of the child. It was the

[Page 831]

evidence of Dr. Common and perhaps other
psychiatric evidence that the Crown sought to adduce in reply. In my view, the
admissibility of this evidence is exactly on the same basis as the right of the
Crown to cross-examine the witness Dr. Cooper. The accused had put at
issue his own mental and emotional state. The learned trial judge remarked:

After all, there is a great deal of
evidence in that this is a very gentle man who loves his child very dearly. It
was a proud father. This recurs in the evidence and I should have thought
that—that opens the door to you to have said “Well we have evidence that this
is not so”.

The accused had also been permitted to adduce
evidence that the mental and emotional condition of his wife would make it
probable that she could have committed the assault which resulted in the
child’s death. To refuse to grant the right to meet that combination of
testimony with psychiatric evidence that the accused himself exhibited like
propensities did, as Martin J.A. remarked, permit the accused to present
an entirely distorted picture to the jury. I, therefore, am of the opinion,
with respect, that Martin J.A. was correct in his view that the Crown should
have been permitted to adduce such psychiatric evidence in reply and that the
refusal to do so could well have resulted in a miscarriage of justice.

In the result, I would dismiss the appeal and
affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario directing a new trial.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Murder—Fatal shootings not
actually carried out by appellant—Responsibility as a party to the
offences—Possible inadequacy in direction to jury—Verdict of guilt
inevitable—No reduction to manslaughter—Criminal Code , ss. 21 , 307 , 613(1) (b)(iii)
and 623(1) .

Appellant and one Pentiluk were jointly indicted for the
non-capital murder of Derek Hannan and Gregory Plytas. Appellant had driven
Pentiluk, on Pentiluk’s directions, to the address at which the murders were
committed, according to appellant’s own statement, to beat up Hannan, who had
earlier been thrown by Pentiluk from an apartment balcony. According to his
statement appellant remained in the car while Pentiluk entered the house with a
shot gun in order to bring Hannan out to the street so that appellant could
fight him: While in the house Pentiluk shot and killed Hannan and Plytas. There
was however other evidence to the effect that appellant had entered the; house
with Pentiluk and that it was appellant who provided the murder weapon and
ammunition. Both the accused were convicted of non-capital murder. In his
charge the trial judge read s. 21  of the Criminal Code  and then stated
the theory of the Crown that appellant had aided and abetted Pentiluk by
supplying the gun and ammunition and by driving Pentiluk to the scene ami had
been engaged with Pentiluk in a common unlawful purpose. The judge thereafter
drew the attention of the jury to s. 307 of the Code, entering a
dwelling-house with intent and stated that the theory of the defence was, in
part, that appellant did not know that a killing might result. The Court of
Appeal affirmed the conviction of Pentiluk and, while finding defects in the
direction to the jury on the responsibility of the appellant as a party to the
offences under s. 21 , nonetheless upheld the conviction of the appellant, on
the ground that a reasonable jury properly instructed would on the evidence
have inevitably convicted, invoking the curative provision of s.

[Page 833]

613(1)(b)(iii) to dismiss the appeal. Appellant further
appealed, with leave.

Held (Laskin C.J. and Dickson J. dissenting): The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Spence, Pigeon, Beetz
and de Grandpré JJ.: While the judge’s charge was not as complete or as clear
as might be desired, the jury was made fully aware of the issues. On the issue
of aiding and abetting, under s. 21(1)(b) and (c), there was
evidence that appellant supplied the gun and ammunition, that he drove Pentiluk
to the scene of the crime, and that he was in the house with Pentiluk when and
where the offences occurred. On the issue of s. 21(2), common unlawful purpose,
the only unlawful common purpose mentioned in the direction to the jury was
that appellant and Pentiluk entered a dwelling house, with the intent to commit
an indictable offence. The trial judge could have gone further on the evidence
and pointed out that appellant and Pentiluk went to the house armed with a
shotgun, in a common unlawful purpose to inflict violence on Hannan.

Per Laskin C.J. and Dickson J. dissenting: Nowhere
in the direction did the trial judge explain to the jury what must be found
before they could decide whether appellant was a party to the murders under s.
21(1)(b) or (c). Where it is sought to inculpate a person by
association of a particular kind, as provided by s. 21(1)(b)(c),
it is necessary that the basis for such inculpation be clearly put to the jury.
With reference to s. 21(2), there was no direction to impress upon the jury
that if they found a common intention to carry out an unlawful purpose and to
assist each other therein and an offence was committed in carrying it out, it
was necessary that the Crown pursue beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant
knew or ought to have known that its commission would be a probable consequence
of carrying out the unlawful common purpose. Fatal misdirection and
non-direction, considered in relation to conflict of evidence, made it impossible
to apply the curative provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii).

On a new trial, appellant would not likely escape any
conviction, but there is evidence on which a jury proper-

[Page 834]

ly instructed, would more likely find appellant guilty of
manslaughter than of murder. The Court should substitute a verdict of
manslaughter. There is no incongruity in finding appellant guilty of
manslaughter, although the principal offender has been found guilty of murder
in the same transaction.

An appellate Court may substitute a conviction of an included
offence of manslaughter, where it is satisfied that an element of support for a
conviction of murder is missing, but, without it, there is still a basis for a
conviction of manslaughter.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] dismissing an
appeal from convictions by Keith J. with a jury on charges of non-capital
murder. Appeal dismissed, Laskin C.J. and Dickson J. dissenting.

Alan Gold, for the appellant.

David Watt, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Dickson J. was
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—The
appellant was convicted on two counts of murder of two named persons who were
shot and killed by his co-accused, one Pentiluk. Both accused appealed to the
Ontario Court of Appeal which affirmed their convictions in a unanimous
judgment delivered by Martin J.A. The appellant MacDonald obtained leave to
come to this Court. Although the relief claimed on his behalf in the factum of
counsel was a new trial, the submissions by his counsel and by counsel for the
Crown at the hearing made it evident that either the conviction should be
affirmed or this Court should substitute a verdict of manslaughter. Its power
to do so under ss. 613  and 623(1)  of the Criminal Code  was not
challenged.

[Page 835]

There is no doubt that the Crown’s case against
MacDonald was a formidable one. There is also no doubt that the trial judge
erred in very important respect in his charge to the jury to the prejudice of
the accused. This was not seriously challenged by Crown counsel who, however,
supported the view taken by Martin J.A. that the case was an appropriate one
for the application of the curative provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code .

The appellant did not do the fatal shooting.
However, he accompanied his co-accused to the place where the shooting occurred
and, indeed, took the co-accused to that place in his car, and was aware before
the shooting that the co-accused had a shotgun with him. Hence, the liability
of the appellant to conviction depends on the application of s. 21  of the Criminal
Code . This section reads as follows:

21. (1) Every one is a party to an offence
who

(a) actually commits it,

(b) does or omits to do anything for
the purpose of aiding any person to commit it,

or

(c) abets any person in committing
it.

(2) Where two or more persons form an
intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other
therein and any one of them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits an
offence, each of them who knew or ought to have known that the commission of
the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose
is a party to that offence.

Pentiluk had been involved in a fight at the
residence of one Helen Platt in Toronto. He and three others were uninvited guests at a party being held at
that residence. Pentiluk had an altercation with Mrs. Piatt’s brother,
Derek Hannan, hitting him over the head with a board and then pushing him
through the railing of a second floor balcony on to the ground below.
Mrs. Platt in retaliation struck Pentiluk twice on the back and then one
Plytas, who had come with Pentiluk, stepped between them. Pentiluk left with
the two others who had come with him, Plytas remaining behind. They drove to
the appellant’s residence and were admitted by the latter’s common law wife.
The appellant was not home at the time but arrived

[Page 836]

soon after. In a voluntary statement made after
his arrest, the appellant said that Pentiluk asked him to beat up Hannan and he
agreed to do so, and drove with Pentiluk, at the latter’s direction, to the
Platt residence.

On arrival (according to the appellant’s
statement) Pentiluk took a shotgun from the trunk of the car, saying that he
wanted it to force Hannan to come out and fight with the appellant. Pentiluk
entered the house and the appellant said he heard two shots in rapid
succession, followed by a third whereupon he ran into the house and up the
stairs and said to Pentiluk “Let’s get out of here”. They ran out and the
appellant drove away with Pentiluk. Other evidence disclosed that Hannan had
been shot and killed while speaking on the telephone, that Plytas had been shot
in the living room, receiving wounds from which he later died and that
Mrs. Platt had been badly wounded by a third shot fired by Pentiluk.

There was evidence from which a jury could find
that the gun used by Pentiluk came from the appellant’s apartment and was even
supplied by the appellant, and there was also evidence from which the jury
could find that Pentiluk was accompanied by the appellant when he entered the
Platt residence with the gun and began shooting. However, since the appellant’s
complicity in the murders depends on whether s. 21(1)(b) or (c)
or s. 21(2) applied to engage his culpability, I think an appellate Court
should be very hesitant to apply the curative provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
if there has been misdirection on those implicating provisions when the
misdirection (as I think it does here) relates directly to factual assessments
which could take on a different complexion if the jury had been properly
charged.

In charging the jury with respect to the
appellant MacDonald, the trial judge read to them the whole of s. 21  but
nowhere in the charge did he explain to them what must be found before they
could decide whether the appellant was a party to

[Page 837]

the murders under s. 21(1) (b) or (c).
It is my opinion that where it is sought to inculpate a person by association
of a particular kind, as provided by s. 21(1)(b)(c), it is
necessary that the basis for such inculpation be clearly put to the jury: see R.
v. Dick[2]. The
way in which the trial judge left aiding or abetting to the jury could have led
them to believe that the appellant, merely by driving Pentiluk to the Platt
residence where the killings were done, was a party to the offence of murder.
Counsel for the Crown conceded the deficiency of the charge in this respect.

The trial judge also erred in respect of his
instruction to the jury on s. 21(2). I regard this error as in itself fatal to
the conviction, especially when it is regarded in the light of the fact that
the trial judge failed originally to leave manslaughter as a possible verdict
against MacDonald, although leaving it in relation to Pentiluk, and then, in
recharging them that manslaughter was an alternative verdict did so in terms
that did not meet the proper requirements of proof to make the appellant guilty
of manslaughter under s. 21(2).

Indeed, except for an initial paraphrase of s.
21(2), the trial judge throughout his charge failed to make it clear that not
only must the jury find a common intention of Pentiluk and MacDonald to carry
out an unlawful purpose (here the infliction of violence) and to assist each
other therein but that the appellant knew or ought to have known that a
killing, amounting to either murder or manslaughter (which would have to be
defined in the charge) would be a probable cause of carrying out the
unlawful purpose.

The only references in the charge to the law on
s. 21(2) consist of two separated passages followed by a lengthy recital of the
evidence relating in the main to Pentiluk. The first passage is this:

[Page 838]

…there is evidence, and I will draw it to
your attention, and it has already been drawn to your attention, that these two
men together must have entered that house, where they had no right to be,
carrying a gun, which would bring them within Section 307  of the Criminal
Code . This is not their house.

(1) Every one who without lawful excuse,
the proof of which lies upon him, enters or is in a dwelling-house with intent
to commit an indictable offence therein is guilty of an indictable offence…

You see how I point out to you that
Section 307  makes Subsection 2 of Section 21  one that you must
take into consideration.

Then, after a short statement of the theory
of Pentiluk’s defence, came this passage:

As to MacDonald, the theory of his defence
is that not only did he not supply the shotgun to Pentiluk but that he was
unaware that Pentiluk had a gun until they got to 14 Seymour Avenue, and that
his only reason for being at that address at the time of the shooting, which he
admits in his statement, was to fight Derek Hannan; that he did nothing, in the
language of Section 21  of the Criminal Code , to aid or abet Pentiluk in
the fatal shooting and that he was not engaged in a common unlawful purpose,
knowing that a killing might result.

[The emphasis is mine.]

Following the recital of the evidence there was
no further reference to the law but only a direction as to possible verdicts;
as to Pentiluk, guilty of murder or not guilty of murder but guilty of
manslaughter, and as to the appellant, guilty as charged or not guilty.

When the charge ended, Crown counsel raised the
question of failure to charge on manslaughter in respect of the appellant.
That, however, was far from the only deficiency, even though at that stage the
appellant’s counsel, who was not his counsel on this appeal, did not say
otherwise. The trial judge recalled the jury and corrected his failure to
charge on manslaughter. I have already referred to the recharge, and now set
out the passage in which

[Page 839]

manslaughter was left as an alternative verdict:

The circumstance that was drawn to my
attention that might make that posssible would be for you to find that no one
had the intent of going there to shoot anybody at all and yet the gun did go
off while they were engaged in some unlawful purpose, MacDonald having provided
the gun to Pentiluk, and I suppose if that is your finding, well then that
verdict of not guilty of non-capital murder but guilty of manslaughter is open
to you and it will have to be given consideration.

Its unsatisfactory character is self-evident.

The jury itself felt uncomfortable about the
trial judge’s scant reference to the law and especially s. 21 . They directed
the following written question to the trial judge:

We would appreciate a clarification of
section 21  and, we think, section 307 .

The trial judge said to the jury that “this
relates specifically to the accused MacDonald…and it must be subsection 2
in the context that you have put your question not the aiding or abetting”. He
then read them s. 21(2) and s. 307(1) and continued as follows:

Now, I want to relate those
sections or that section to the evidence that is before you and on
which you must make up your minds whether or not Section 21  is applicable
in order to make the accused MacDonald a party to whatever offence you find was
committed in that dwelling-house.

This being said, the trial judge recited certain
evidence, including a quotation from the appellant’s statement, and ended on
this passage:

Now, I do not know what impression that is
going to make on your minds. To my mind the only possible inference, if you
believe Davis—and it is supported by the evidence of Millie Dubien and Helen
Plaitt, that there were no footsteps after the third shot, and Derek Hannan
saying “They have got a gun”—the only inference you can have is that when Pentiluk
went into that house—this is based on Davis’, an independent witness
evidence—MacDonald was right with him and that the man with him had, to his
knowledge, a gun in his hand, entering a dwelling-house which he had no right
to be in.

[Page 840]

What the trial judge said was in no way
responsive to the jury’s question about s. 21  nor, as the trial judge saw it,
on s. 21(2). In my opinion, the jury was asked to consider the culpability of
MacDonald with so inadequate a direction on the law as to amount to no
direction and, indeed, to serious misdirection on issues that required
considerable care in exposition.

Having set out or referred to everything that
the trial judge said on the law as it related to the appellant, I do not share
the extenuating appraisal of the charge by Martin J.A. in saying that in
respect of s. 21  “[it] was neither as complete nor as clear as one would have
wished”. The trial judge never indicated that there was any requirement of
intent in respect of aiding or abetting, let alone the nature of the intent; he
had not give any direction to fix the jury with the necessity of appreciating
that even if they found a common intention to carry out an unlawful purpose and
to assist each other therein (I pass over as unimportant in the total picture
that he mentioned only s. 307  in this connection) and an offence was committed
in carrying it out, it was necessary that the Crown prove beyond a reasonsable
doubt that the appellant knew or ought to have known that its commission would
be a probable consequence of carrying out the common unlawful purpose. The jury
was left simply rudderless on crucial aspects of the case. The fatal
non-direction and misdirection, when considered in relation to conflicts in the
evidence, make it impossible, in my view, to apply in this case the curative
provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii).

Quite plainly the conviction of murder cannot
stand, and if the case was sent back for a new trial there is every likelihood
that MacDonald would do what Pentiluk did and that is plead guilty to

[Page 841]

manslaughter as an included offence. The plea
was not accepted in Pentiluk’s case, but the submissions of counsel for the
Crown in the present case as well as the alternative submission for relief of
counsel for the accused persuade me that this Court should not send the case
back for retrial, either on murder or on manslaughter. Since it is clear that
there is evidence upon which a jury properly instructed would more likely find
the appellant guilty of manslaughter than of murder (certainly the appellant
would not likely escape any conviction), the desirable disposition is for this
Court to substitute a verdict of manslaughter.

There is no incongruity in finding the appellant
guilty of manslaughter although the principal offender has been found guilty of
murder in respect of the same transaction: see R. v. Reid[3]. Moreover, an appellate Court may
substitute a conviction of an included offence of manslaughter where it is
satisfied that an element of support for a conviction of murder is missing but
that without it there is still a basis for a conviction of manslaughter: see R.
v. Nantais[4]. In
this case, it may reasonably be said that the common intention was by the use
of the gun to compel Hannan to come out of the Platt residence to fight with
the appellant; and although a killing might result because of Pentiluk’s
possession of the gun the appellant did not know nor ought he to have known
that a killing would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common
intention.

I would accordingly substitute a verdict of
manslaughter and remit the case to the Ontario Court of Appeal for imposition
of a sentence.

[Page 842]

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Spence, Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—The appellant and one Pentiluk were
jointly indicted and tried upon two counts for the non-capital murder of Derek
Hannan and Gregory Plytas. Both were convicted and their appeals to the Court
of Appeal for Ontario were dismissed. The appellant only, with leave, appealed
to this Court.

The facts are recited in the reasons of Martin,
J.A., who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, as follows:

Both killings occurred in one transaction,
and both counts were tried together. The jury was entitled to find that the
following facts were established by the evidence: The deceased Derek Hannan
lived at 14 Seymour Avenue in the City of Toronto on the first floor of a three
storey house. On the evening of September 1st, 1972, his sister Mrs. Helen
Platt who lived on the second and third floors of the house gave a party, which
was attended by a number of people including her brother the deceased Derek
Hannan, and a young woman Mildred Dubien, who lived on the third floor. At
approximately 2:00 a.m. on September 2nd, the appellant Pentiluk, accompanied
by Gus Williams, the deceased Gregory Plytas and John Pearson, arrived at the
party. Some three quarters of an hour later, there was a fight between the
appellant Pentiluk and the deceased Hannan on the veranda off the living room
of the second floor apartment, apparently over Mildred Dubien. During the fight
the appellant Pentiluk struck the deceased Hannan on the side of the head with
a board from the railing on the veranda. He then pushed Hannan over the balcony
and he landed on the ground below. When Mrs. Platt started downstairs to
see how her brother was, she struck the appellant Pentiluk on the back as he
was going toward the kitchen. Gregory Plytas interceded and the appellant
Pentiluk told her: “You are going to get yours too.” Pentiluk, Williams and
Pearson then left; Plytas remained. Those three persons then went to 10
Boultbee Avenue where the appellant MacDonald lived with Janice Taylor.
MacDonald was not then at home but arrived soon afterwards. The appellants discussed
the fight with Hannan. Shortly afterwards both the appellants left with a green
gun case, that Janice Taylor got at the appellant MacDonald’s request.

[Page 843]

About an hour after the appellant Pentiluk
had left 14 Seymour Avenue, following the fight with Derek Hannan,
Mrs. Platt saw Pentiluk and another man whom she did not recognize drive
up in a car and park in front of the house. The appellant Pentiluk got out of
the driver’s door and both men went to the trunk and began to open it. Mrs. Platt
then went to the kitchen. She heard the door open and her brother Derek Hannan
say: “He’s got a gun”.

Derek Hannan was shot while talking to his
brother on the telephone in front of the kitchen doorway. She then heard
another shot coming from the living room. The appellant Pentiluk armed with a
shotgun which he held in both hands went to the kitchen, stared at
Mrs. Platt for 10-15 seconds and shot her in the thigh from a distance of
about six feet. Mrs. Platt eventually recovered from the injury she
received. Both Hannan and Plytas died from the effect of gunshot wounds in the
abdomen caused by pellets from a shotgun.

The appellant MacDonald made a statement to
the police, which the trial judge ruled was made voluntarily. In his statement
he said he had left his apartment with the appellant Pentiluk to go to the
place where Pentiluk had allegedly been assaulted. The appellant MacDonald said
he drove to an address on Seymour to which he was directed by Pentiluk. The
appellant Pentiluk removed a shotgun from the trunk and entered the house,
according to the appellant MacDonald, to bring his assaillant out onto the
street so MacDonald could fight him. After hearing first two shots and then a
third, the appellant MacDonald ran upstairs into the house and said: “Let’s get
out of here”. The latter part of MacDonald’s statement is in conflict with the
evidence of Ernest Davis who lived at 18 Seymour Avenue, and who was awakened
at 3:20 a.m. on September 2, 1972, by two shots. He shut off his air
conditioner and then heard another shot at which point he looked out the window
and saw two men running towards a car parked in front of 14 Seymour Avenue. One
of the men got in the driver’s side and the other, who appeared to be carrying
a stick, got in the passenger’s side.

The only defence advanced on behalf of the
appellant Pentiluk was that he was intoxicated as a result of the consumption
of alcohol and drugs to an extent that rendered him incapable of forming the
intent requisite for murder. The case for the appellant MacDonald was that he
was not a party to either of the offences, under the provisions of
section 21 of the Code.

[Page 844]

Dealing with the appeal of the present appellant
Martin, J.A., had this to say:

The most substantial ground of appeal urged
on behalf of the appellant MacDonald is that the trial Judge did not
sufficiently direct the jury with respect to the application of section 21 
to the facts of the case, as the jury might find them from the evidence. We are
bound to say that the charge in this respect was neither as complete, nor as
clear as one would have wished. The only unlawful common purpose referred to by
the trial Judge as the basis for the application of section 21  to the
activities of the appellant MacDonald, in relation to the killings, was unlawfully
entering a dwelling house, with intent to commit an indictable offence therein
contrary to section 307 of the Code.

On the basis of the appellant’s statement
to the police, which was admitted in evidence, it is clear that both the
appellants joined in a common purpose—to inflict unlawful violence on one or
more of the persons in the house, and in furtherance of that purpose Pentiluk
had with him, to the knowledge of the appellant MacDonald, a shotgun which was
in fact loaded. Although there is no admission by the appellant that he knew
the gun was loaded, the jury would be justified in inferring that he had such
knowledge. Indeed, if the evidence of Pearson was accepted, the appellant
MacDonald provided the shotgun.

Despite the defects in the charge, we think
that the essential issues were placed before the jury and they were
sufficiently instructed that the defence of the appellant MacDonald was that he
had merely agreed to fight Pentiluk’s assailant, and did not foresee that
somebody might be killed. Indeed, we think that the failure of the trial Judge
to more fully charge the jury with respect to the application of
section 21  to the facts, as the jury was entitled to find them on the
evidence, may have inured to the benefit of the accused, rather than to his
disadvantage. We are unanimously of the view that a reasonable jury, properly
instructed would, on the evidence, have inevitably found a verdict of guilty.

The only substantial ground of appeal raised
before us is that which is dealt with by Martin, J.A., in the passage from his
reasons quoted above.

In considering whether the defects alleged in
the charge to the jury were such that the Court of Appeal should not properly
have invoked the provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code 
it is necessary to consider the factual back-

[Page 845]

ground in respect of which the charge was
delivered.

The appellant did not give evidence at the
trial, but he had made a statement to the police which was admitted in
evidence. In it, he referred to a conversation with Pentiluk at the place where
the appellant lived, which occurred after the incident between Pentiluk and
Hannan. He said that Pentiluk told him that: “…he had been thrown over the
balcony by one of the guys at the party. He said that he wanted to get even. He
asked me if I would go with him and give the guy a beating. I said I’d go and
look after the guy for him”. He said that he had driven Pentiluk to a house
pointed out by Pentiluk, where he stopped the car, that Pentiluk got out and
went to the trunk of the car, and that he saw that Pentiluk had a shotgun or
rifle. When the appellant asked him what he wanted that for, Pentiluk said he
“…would make the guy come out of the house and I could Tight him on the
street”. He said that Pentiluk then entered the house.

The appellant therefore admitted to driving
Pentiluk to the house, for the purpose of inflicting unlawful violence upon
Hannan, and that Pentiluk was armed with a shotgun or rifle. The jury could
properly infer that the appellant knew that the shotgun was loaded. There was
other evidence led by the Crown to show that the appellant provided the weapon.

While the appellant, in his statement, said that
he did not enter the house until three shots had been fired, an independent
witness, Davis, was looking out of his bedroom window on to the street when the
third shot was fired. Following that he saw two men running out of the house
where the shooting had occurred and saw them enter a parked car. He noticed
that the one who entered on the passenger’s side was carrying something which
looked like a stick, which he put between his legs when he entered the car.
This evidence contradicts the latter part of the appellant’s statement and
places the appellant in the house when the third shot was fired.

[Page 846]

The trial judge dealt with the law applicable in
respect of the charges against the appellant in the following passages from his
charge to the jury:

As to MacDonald, conceding that MacDonald
did not do the actual shooting, the Crown alleges that he is nevertheless
guilty as charged by reason of the provisions of Section 21  of the
Criminal Code , the relevant portions of which read as follows:

(1) Every one is a party to an offence who

(a) actually commits it.

that is, in the case, on the theory of the
Crown, Pentiluk.

(b) does or omits to do anything for
the purpose of aiding any person to commit it…

that is, any other person,

or (c) abets any person in
committing it.

That would be MacDonald.

The second subsection:

(2) Where two or more persons form an
intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other
therein and any one of them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits an
offence, each of them who knew or ought to have known that the commission of
the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose
is a party to that offence.

On the evidence that I will discuss with
you it is open to you to find that MacDonald was a party under both of those
subsections.

The theory of the Crown is that MacDonald
did become a party to the offence by aiding and abetting Pentiluk who, by his
plea, has admitted the killing, in that MacDonald supplied the gun and
ammunition, drove Pentiluk to 14 Seymour Avenue and, in addition, was engaged,
in the language of Subsection 2, in “a common purpose“, assisting each
other therein, and one of them in carrying out the common purpose, common
unlawful purpose, committed an offence and that each of them knew or ought to
have known that the commission of the offence would be a probable consequence
of carrying out the common purpose.

…There is evidence, and I will draw it to
your attention, and it has already been drawn to your attention, that these two
men together must have entered that house, where they had no right to be, carrying
a gun, which would bring them within Section 307  of the Criminal Code .
This is not their house.

(1) Every one who without lawful excuse,
the proof of which lies upon him, enters or is in a dwelling house

[Page 847]

with intent to commit an indictable offence
therein is guilty of an indictable offence…

You see how I point out to you that
Section 307  makes Subsection 2 of Section 21  one that you must
take into consideration.

Having dealt with the theory of the Crown in the
passage above quoted, he discussed the theory of the defence:

As to MacDonald, the theory of his defence
is that not only did he not supply the shotgun to Pentiluk but that he was
unaware that Pentiluk had a gun until they got to 14 Seymour Avenue, and that
his only reason for being at that address at the time of the shooting, which he
admits in his statement, was to fight Derek Hannan; that he did nothing, in the
language of Section 21  of the Criminal Code , to aid or abet Pentiluk in
the fatal shooting and that he was not engaged in a common unlawful purpose,
knowing that a killing might result.

Counsel for the appellant stresses that in this
passage the trial judge uses the phrase “knowing that a killing might result”
whereas s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code  refers to “a probable consequence
of carrying out the common purpose”. However, the jury had been charged in the
terms of the subsection, and in this passage he is summarizing the position of
the defence, i.e. that the appellant did not know that a killing might
result from the common unlawful purpose. If he did not know that a killing
might result from the common unlawful purpose then clearly he did not know that
a killing was a probable consequence of the common unlawful purpose.

The trial judge thereafter reviewed in detail
the evidence of the various witnesses.

While conceding that, as Martin, J.A. points
out, the charge was not as complete or as clear as might be desired, it is my
opinion that, in relation to the facts of this case, the jury was made fully
aware of the issues to be decided.

[Page 848]

On the issue of s. 21(1)(b) and (c),
aiding and abetting, the trial judge pointed out that, on the Crown evidence,
the appellant supplied the gun and the ammunition and drove Pentiluk to the
scene of the crime. He also reviewed the evidence which showed that the
appellant was in the house with Pentiluk when the offences occurred.

On the issue of s. 21(2) , dealing with carrying
out a common unlawful purpose, he referred to s. 307(1)  of the Criminal
Code . He could have gone further and pointed out that the appellant and
Pentiluk went to the house armed with a shotgun in a common purpose to inflict
unlawful violence upon Hannan. He could have gone on to say that if the
appellant ought to have known that the killing was a probable consequence of
the common purpose the appellant would be a party to the offences. He did not
do this, but, as Martin, J.A. points out, his failure to charge the jury more
fully on the application of s. 21  to the facts may have inured to the benefit
of the appellant.

The charge, as delivered, left it to the jury to
decide whether the Crown evidence should be accepted, or whether the
appellant’s statement that he had merely agreed to fight Hannan and did not
foresee a killing should be accepted. On the Crown evidence a reasonable jury
would have to reach a verdict of guilty. If the appellant’s explanation was
accepted, the appellant would be acquitted. The jury brought in a verdict of
guilty.

I agree with Martin, J.A. that a reasonable
jury, properly instructed would, on the evidence in this case, have inevitably
found a verdict of guilty. I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Murder—Possible reduction to
manslaughter—Criminal negligence—Adequacy of charge to jury—Criminal Code , s.
212 .

Appellant was convicted of non-capital murder
in the shooting of his wife. The Ontario Court of Appeal upheld his conviction.
An appeal was brought to this Court, by leave. Appellant contended that the
trial judge had failed to instruct the jury adequately on the included offence
of manslaughter, through appellant’s criminal negligence in his discharging a
loaded rifle.

Held (Spence
J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de
Grandpré JJ.: We agree with the reasons of the Court of Appeal. We adopt
its view that there was no material evidence from which a jury could find any
support for the theory, not advanced at the trial, that the death resulted from
criminal negligence.

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: Although the whole defence at the trial was based on the
argument that the discharge of the firearm was a pure accident, it was the duty
of the trial judge to deal adequately with any other view of the facts, arising
out of the evidence, which would reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter.
There was evidence here of: (1) negligence in the, handling of a firearm
on many occasions and (2) much drinking by the appellant, on which the trial
judge left with the jury the possible verdict of manslaughter, only if the jury
concluded that the accused discharged the rifle, but, because of his
intoxication, he had been unable to form the intent required for the conviction
of murder. The same intoxication which would justify the jury in reducing the
charge from murder to manslaughter would render more probable criminal negli-

[Page 806]

gence in unintentional homicide. The appeal
should be allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissing an
appeal from a conviction by O’Leary J. with a jury on a charge of non-capital
murder. Appeal dismissed, Spence J. dissenting.

Edward L. Greenspan, for the appellant.

J. David Watt, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Martland,
Judson, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought with leave
of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which affirmed the verdict of
guilty of non-capital murder of his wife entered against the appellant at his
trial before Mr. Justice O’Leary sitting with a jury.

The argument before this Court on behalf of the
appellant was founded on the contention that the learned trial judge had erred
in law in failing to instruct the jury adequately as to the defence of
manslaughter on the theory that the death resulted from criminal negligence on
the part of the appellant in discharging the loaded rifle.

I find myself in agreement with the reasons for
judgment of the Court of Appeal and I adopt the following paragraph from that
judgment:

The contention that the trial judge was in
error in failing to adequately instruct the jury as to the included offence of
manslaughter cannot be supported by the evidence. In our view there is no
material evidence from which a jury could find any support for the theory, now
advanced for the first time in this Court by the appellant, that the death resulted
from criminal negligence. This is a theory based on speculation and the defence
is not entitled to have a speculative theory presented to the jury for their
consideration. In our view there was no evidence to support criminal negligence
as distinct from accident.

[Page 807]

I would accordingly dismiss this appeal.

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal,
upon leave granted by this Court, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on March 12, 1975. By
that judgment, the said Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the accused from
his conviction by O’Leary J. of non-capital murder after a verdict by a jury.

I have had the privilege of reading the reasons
for judgment which are being delivered by my brother Ritchie. I agree that the
sole issue which concerns this Court is whether the learned trial judge erred
in failing to leave to the jury the possible verdict of manslaughter based on
very great negligence in the handling of a firearm. The learned trial judge had
left to the jury the possible verdict of manslaughter only if the jury
concluded that the accused had discharged the firearm but due to the degree of
his intoxication had been unable to form the intent required for commission of
the crime of murder by s. 212  of the Criminal Code  as it provided at the
relevant time. However, with respect, I differ with my brother Ritchie in
concluding that the Court of Appeal for Ontario was correct in concluding that
the learned trial judge properly so confined his treatment of the alternate verdict
of manslaughter. The Court of Appeal regarded the theory that the deceased
woman’s death might have resulted from the accused’s criminal negligence as
mere speculation not supported by any evidence.

It is true that able and experienced counsel for
the accused based his whole defence on an attempt to convince the jury that the
discharge of the firearm was a pure accident and that therefore the homicide
did not result from an unlawful act so that the accused should be acquitted.
The addresses of counsel to the jury are not set out in the appeal case so I
cannot tell whether counsel for the accused urged the jury that even if they
found the accused had intentionally discharged the firearm, as contrasted with
the finding he urged that the firearm had discharged accidentally, that they
should nevertheless find that the accused through his intoxication was
incapable of forming the

[Page 808]

necessary intent and so their verdict should be
manslaughter. Certainly the learned trial judge put that possible verdict on
that very basis very plainly to the jury in his charge.

No place in the record am I able to find any
suggestion by counsel for the accused that a verdict of manslaughter based on
criminally negligent but unintentional discharge of the firearm should be
submitted to the jury. Certainly the learned trial judge not merely failed to
put such issue to the jury but he excluded it in the plainest of words, saying:

Now, as is obvious from what has been said
by the defence and crown counsel and what I have already said, the first issue
that you have to decide here is whether or not what happened was an accident.
If you conclude that what happened was an accident, then that is the end of it
and your verdict must be not guilty. If you are convinced beyond a reasonable
doubt that the shooting was no accident, that it was intentional, then you will
still have to decide whether or not your verdict should be guilty of murder or
guilty of manslaughter.

In this particular case, there is only one
circumstance that could result in a finding of manslaughter. If you decide that
the killing was—shooting was intentional, you would still have to consider
whether or not the defence of drunkenness applies. The defence of drunkenness
will only reduce murder to manslaughter.

Certainly since the pronouncement of Viscount
Simon, L.C., in Mancini v. Director of Public Prosecutions[1] at p. 72, there can be no doubt that it is
the duty of a trial judge, despite the fact that the defence advanced another
and perhaps a contradictory theory, “to deal adequately with any other view of
the facts which might reasonably arise out of the evidence given, and which
would reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter”. The Lord Chancellor’s
ruling by its terms applies to “other views of the fact which might reasonably
arise out of the evidence” so this Court has said in Kelsey v. The Queen[2], and it has oft been repeated that a
submission requiring such a charge could only be based on the existence in the
record of

[Page 809]

evidence which could support it. The Court of
Appeal here, as I have said, were of the view that such a theory was mere
speculation not based on the evidence.

I am unable to come to such a conclusion. The
evidence is that this married couple had lived together for many years and together
operated a cleaning business. Both their adult sons gave evidence and described
their parents’ domestic life as normal without any real quarrelling although
one son Jean Claude Charbonneau inferred that the accused when intoxicated
tended to quarrel with the deceased. The same son did give rather vague
evidence which might be said to infer that at about 9:00 a.m. on the morning of
her death the accused had struck the deceased with an ash tray resulting in a
slight cut at the hairline but two employees in the business gave the clearest
testimony that the deceased was normal in appearance and disposition all day
and accidentally cut her own head on an open cash drawer at 6:30 p.m. in the
immediate presence of both who observed the accident. These same two witnesses
and many others testified as to normal relationship of the accused and the
deceased. The one son Francis Charbonneau described the relationship thus:

It is not a domestic bliss, you know. It is
not a honeymoon setting, but it is not—it is not continuous fights or not a
honeymoon place; an average domestic scene.

In short, the record fails to reveal any real
evidence of motive. Of course, the Crown, if it proves the homicide and the
necessary intent, need not prove motive. The lack of motive, however, does tend
to strengthen the presumption of innocence of the accused in that it makes less
likely that he did the act with necessary intent and therefore that the
discharge of the rifle while in his hands might have occurred for some other
reason.

The accused, after the fatal shooting, walked
directly to the police station and finding it unoccupied wandered into a local
beverage room and there sat in what described as a dazed manner consuming beer
until approached by a friend Maki and then after a few moments’ casual
conversation the accused said to his friend “I shot Rose...it

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Right to obtain the assistance
of counsel—Application for adjournment—Judge’s discretion—Prejudice suffered by
accused—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.C-34, ss. 577(3), 613.

Charged with assaulting a peace officer,
appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for one year. At his trial on April 6,
1973 the accused filed an application for adjournment because his counsel was
not present. The judge denied the application on the grounds that the case
dated back to the previous November and that counsel, who was occupied
elsewhere, had not justified his absence. Appellant was therefore directed to
proceed without the assistance of counsel. The majority of the Court of Appeal
held that appellant, even though not represented by counsel, was given the
opportunity to make a full defence and received a fair trial, and refused to
order a new trial. Hence the appeal to this Court.

Held (Martland,
Ritchie and de Grandpré JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Judson, Spence, Pigeon, Dickson and Beetz JJ.: However serious the
fault of counsel, a fault which constituted prima facie contempt of
court, there was nothing which authorized the trial judge to presume the
connivance or complicity of the accused or without any evidence to lay the
blame for the fault of counsel on him. The accused has the right “to make full
…defence personally or by counsel” (s. 577(3) Cr. C). Although the
decision on an adjournment necessary for the exercise of this right is in the
judge’s discretion, he must exercise this discretion judicially. His decision
may thus be reviewed on appeal if it is based on reasons which are not well
founded in law. This right of review is especially wide when the consequence of
the exercise of discretion was that someone was deprived of his rights, whether
in criminal or in civil proceedings.

[Page 122]

As to the English judgments where the Court
refused to quash the conviction of accused persons deprived of the services of
counsel, it must not be overlooked that at that time in England the quashing of
a verdict by the Court of Appeal meant the definitive’ acquittal of the
accused. Hence the tendency to uphold a conviction, despite an error of law, if
there was no miscarriage of justice.

It cannot be said in the case at bar that the
accused suffered no prejudice by being forced to defend himself without
enjoying the assistance of counsel, and without being able to summon as a
witness a person having knowledge of the incident which led up to the
conviction. While it is true that counsel for the prosecution treated the
accused with consideration, it cannot be concluded that he had a fair trial.
The accused cannot be considered manifestly guilty when the evidence for the
defence is incomplete and imperfect as a result of the absence of counsel and
of a, witness. The principle to be followed is as stated by the Court of Appeal
of Quebec in Talbot v. R. ([1965] Que, Q.B. 159), namely, that if the
offence was serious enough to warrant a sentence of six months imprisonment, it
was serious enough to warrant that the appellant be allowed to be defended by a
lawyer if he so wished.

Per Martland,
Ritchie and de Grandpré JJ. dissenting: As it must be determined whether
a miscarriage of justice was perpetrated by the trial judge in the exercise of
his discretion, and his decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal, this Court
must interfere only if it is clear that the judgment a quo is
based on an error of principle. This rule is particularly important when the
decision a quo presupposes an intimate knowledge of the local situation.
The Court of Appeal of England, which has a much freer hand than this Court
because it is a first court of appeal, has intervened in cases of this kind
only when the fact that the accused was not represented by counsel might have
constituted a denial of justice and have modified the result of the trial. The
accused has not convinced this Court that the presence of his lawyer would have
changed the outcome, indeed to the contrary. The right to the presence of
counsel is a right which has limits, and the administration of justice requires
that society be protected as well.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal
of Quebec dismissing
appellant’s application for a new trial. Appeal allowed and a new trial
ordered, Martland, Ritchie and de Grandpré JJ. dissenting.

D. Pontbriand, for the appellant.

Claude Millette, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Judson, Spence,
Pigeon, Dickson and Beetz JJ. was delivered by

PIGEON J.—The report of the trial judge to the
Court of Appeal reads as follows:

[TRANSLATION] The accused was charged, at
Montreal, district of Montreal as follows:

On September 27, 1972, Serge BARRETTE
unlawfully assaulted Officer Gilles Lafond, No. 5694, a peace officer engaged
in the execution of his duty, thereby committing an indictable offence
specified in section 246(2) (a) of the Criminal Code .

I was in court at 10:15, and the accused
was present but his lawyer was not. He then told me that his counsel was
Mr. Shoofey. I sent a peace officer to ask Mr. Shoofey when he would
be ready to proceed. He replied that he wanted the case postponed. I refused to
do so because too many cases are postponed when lawyers, without informing
anyone, either the judge or the Crown attorney, absent themselves for whatever
reason. This is a case which dated back to September 27, 1972, and the accused
had been committed to trial on November 3, 1972.

Although the accused ordinarily has the
right to have counsel present, he may not delay cases of his own accord. At the
present time we have a delay of six months and I directed the accused Barrette
to proceed nevertheless. The case itself was simple. It was a question of an
assault by Barrette on a peace officer engaged in the execution of his duty. In
my opinion, there was ample evidence to prove Barrette’s guilt, and I therefore
found him guilty as charged. …

[Page 124]

The appeal is based on the dissenting opinion of
Casey J. who, after quoting the second paragraph of the report and the
following two sentences, said:

While the unexplained conduct of
Appellant’s lawyer is to be deplored and while appropriate sanctions should be
imposed or at least considered by the proper authorities, I see no
justification for punishing Appellant for the sins of his lawyer or because the
trial courts are running behind. These are matters over which Appellant had no
control and they must not be allowed to deprive him of the full and fair trial
to which he is entitled. By obliging him to go on without the benefit of
counsel and by permitting, perhaps forcing, him to be examined at (p. 39) the
trial judge did just that.

I agree with this view, Concerning the behaviour
of the lawyer whose services the accused said he had retained, and who was not
present when the case was called, it is certain that prima facie it
constituted contempt of court (McKeown v. Regina[1]). It would nevertheless have been
necessary to give him the opportunity to be heard before punishing him.
However, even if he was really guilty of serious misconduct, there was nothing
which authorized the trial judge to presume the connivance or complicity of the
accused, as he seems to have done when, on the accused saying “I am taken by
surprise”, he commented: “You knew from November 3 that the case would be heard
today: that is being taken by surprise? Liar”.

There is nothing in the record which could
legally support the presumption that counsel’s absence was a premeditated
scheme in complicity with the accused. It was the first time the case was being
called and there was nothing to justify such inference father than mere
suspicion. The accused has the right “to make full … defence personally
or by counsel” (s. 577(3) Cr. C). An adjournment necessary for the
exercise of this right may be refused only for a reason based on established
facts.

Here the reason given by the trial judge is
legally unavailable against the accused. He cannot be held responsible for the
fact that “too many

[Page 125]

cases are postponed when lawyers … absent
themselves”. When the learned judge adds that the accused “may not delay cases
of his own accord”, he is without any evidence laying the blame for the fault
of counsel on the accused. The situation is quite different from that dealt
with by this Court in Spataro v. Regina[2],
where after the jury was sworn in, the accused without any valid reason
claimed the right to dismiss his counsel, and thus obtain an adjournment.

It is true that a decision on an application for
adjournment is in the judge’s discretion. It is, however, a judicial discretion
so that his decision may be reviewed on appeal if it is based on reasons which
are not well founded in law. This right of review is especially wide when the
consequence of the exercise of discretion is that someone is deprived of his
rights, whether in criminal or in civil proceedings. At a glance, I have found
in the last few years no less than half a dozen judgments in civil proceedings
where a decision depriving a litigant of an important right was reversed on
account of insufficient reasons given. (Frank v. Alpert[3]; Basarsky v. Quinlan[4]; Ladouceur v. Howarth[5]; Whitco Chemical Co. v. Oakville[6]; General Foods v. Struthers[7]; Hamel v. Brunelle[8]). This being so in civil proceedings, there
is all the more reason to so regard a discretionary decision in criminal
proceedings, the effect whereof is to deprive the accused of his right to obtain
the assistance of counsel and to summon witnesses in his defence. This
principle is fully recognized in the English case law which was cited to us.
Thus, in Mary Kingston[9], where
the case proceeded in the absence of counsel retained by the accused, and the
judge had refused the suggestion of Crown prosecutor that other counsel be
invited to provide services immediately, the Court of Appeal quashed the
conviction and said (at p. 188):

[Page 126]

it seems to us that that was tantamount to
depriving the appellant of the right which she had of being defended by
counsel.

As to the English judgments where the Court
refused to quash the conviction of accused persons deprived of the services of
counsel, it must not be overlooked that until quite recently in England the
quashing of a verdict by the Court of Appeal meant the definitive acquittal of
the accused, as was noted with regret in Mary Kingston. It is
understandable that in such circumstances there was a tendency to apply as
often as possible the provision which allows a conviction to be upheld, despite
an error of law, if it is found that there has been no miscarriage of justice.
This concern is apparent in Donald Winston Sowden[10]. The Court of first instance had refused
to issue a second legal aid certificate after the first counsel appointed was
authorized to withdraw. A conviction for fraud was quashed but a conviction for
breach of the Road Traffic Act was upheld, on the grounds that this was
a very simple case where the absence of counsel could not have caused any
prejudice. As to the case of Lacey and Wright[11], of which the brief summary
published in [1966] Crim. L.R. 387 was cited to this Court, it is necessary to
read the complete text of the judgment rendered by Parker C.J. It will be seen
that the Court did not, in the circumstances, find it necessary to consider
whether it was certain that the accused had suffered no prejudice from the
denial of legal aid, because it came to the conclusion that this discretionary
denial was not reviewable.

In the case at bar, I cannot hold that the
accused suffered no prejudice by being forced to defend himself without
enjoying the assistance of counsel, and without being able to summon as a
witness a person having knowledge of the incident which led up to the conviction.
When the case against the accused is such that he cannot defend himself without
testifying, he certainly is in great need of the assistance of counsel. When he
denies in his testimony a significant part of what the witnesses for the
prosecution relate against him, in

[Page 127]

this case a blow delivered to an officer, it
appears to me impossible to find that the absence of a possible witness was
definitely not prejudicial.

It is true that counsel for the prosecution
treated the accused with consideration. He did not cross-examine him and did
not put in evidence his record of previous convictions. Even if he thus did
what was within his power to attenuate the consequences of the situation
created by the erroneous decision of the trial judge, I cannot find that the
accused, who was sentenced to a year in prison, had a fair trial. The following
words of Addy J. in R. v. Lane and Ross[12]
were cited to the Court (at p. 278):

There would also be a miscarriage of
justice when a person who is evidently guilty is found not guilty, for, in the
administration of justice, there is a duty not only to the accused but to
society for the protection of which laws have been enacted.

Without embarking on a discussion of this
statement, I cannot be satisfied that appellant here is manifestly guilty, when
the evidence for the defence is incomplete and imperfect as a result of the
absence of counsel and of a witness. It appears to me that in the case at bar,
the principle to be followed is as stated by the Court of Appeal of Quebec in Talbot
v. Regina[13]:

though our courts have not yet gone as far
as to hold that the fact that the accused was not represented by an attorney,
for reasons other than his own choice, means per se that he has not had
the opportunity to make a full answer and defence, it appears that, if the
offence was serious enough to warrant a sentence of six months imprisonment, it
was serious enough to warrant that the appellant be allowed to be defended by a
lawyer if he so wished.

For these reasons, I would reverse the decision
of the Court of Appeal, quash the conviction against appellant and order a new
trial.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie and de
Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

DE GRANDPRE J. (dissenting)—Appellant was
convicted by a judge sitting alone of having com-

[Page 128]

mitted an assault on the person of a peace
officer, and applied to the Court of Appeal for a new trial, because he was
denied an adjournment by the trial judge when his lawyer was occupied
elsewhere. This appeal was dismissed, the two judges of the majority holding
that “Barrette, even though not represented by counsel, was given the
opportunity to make a full defence and he received a fair trial”. The
dissenting judge, however, was of the opinion that Barrette had not received
“the full and fair trial to which he is entitled”.

The basic facts are related in the report
prepared by the trial judge, cited at length by Pigeon J. in his reasons. From
this report and the other facts disclosed by the record, I wish to stress in
particular:

(1) the date of the trial was fixed some five
months in advance and until 10:15 on the morning of the trial, no one had
mentioned a postponement;

(2) the defence had not summoned any witnesses;

(3) on the morning of the trial, as the record
shows, the articling student of the lawyer chosen by the accused was present
but he did not make any representation, although the By-laws of the Bar
Association permitted him not only to present reasons in support of the
application for a postponement but also, if need be, to conduct the defence;

(4) while the judge showed some impatience with
the conduct of the accused’s lawyer, in other respects he directed the trial
perfectly; thus he refused to allow the Crown to file photographs which were
not provided by a qualified witness;

(5) the accused was able to cross-examine Crown
witnesses;

(6) the accused testified and was not
cross-examined;

(7) the only witness who apparently could have
been heard in order to complete knowledge of the facts was the companion of the
accused; at best, he could only have corroborated the latter;

[Page 129]

(8) Barrette’s record of previous convictions
was not placed before the judge before the guilty verdict.

The question in this appeal, which of course can
only raise a question of law, is as to whether a miscarriage of justice was
perpetrated by the trial judge in the exercise of his discretion, when he
refused to grant the application for postponement which Barrette made in the
absence of his lawyer. That is the criterion of s. 613  of the Criminal
Code  which this Court upheld in two decisions which resemble the case at
bar because they deal with the fundamental rights of the accused: Vescio v.
The King[14], and
Spataro v. The Queen[15], to
which both parties have referred us.

The decision of the trial judge was weighed by
the Court of Appeal and found to be in accordance with the relevant rules. In
any matter where the judgment at first instance is upheld by the Court of
Appeal, this Court must interfere only if it is clear that the judgment a
quo is based on an error of principle. We must be particularly aware of
this rule when the decision a quo has been pronounced in the exercise of
a discretion which presupposes an intimate knowledge of the local situation.
That such knowledge played a major role in the case at bar is evident from
comparison of the decision a quo with Talbot v. The Queen[16], in both cases the Chief Justice and Owen
J. were on the bench; here, they held that there was no miscarriage of justice,
whereas in Talbot, they reached the opposite conclusion because the
facts as a whole showed that the accused had not been able to present a full
and complete defence.

There are no decisions of this Court exactly in
point. Reference must be made to the case law of the Court of Appeal of England
for examples which can enlighten us and enable the Court to decide whether the
courts of Quebec have committed a miscarriage of justice which would permit us
to intervene.

[Page 130]

In Mary Kingston[17], the accused’s lawyer was not
present in court on the morning of the trial because he was erroneously under
the impression that the case would not be called before the afternoon. The
Crown itself suggested that the case be adjourned and when this suggestion was
rejected, added that another lawyer present could represent the accused. This
suggestion in its turn having been ignored, the accused was not represented
during the trial, and she chose not to cross-examine and not to offer her own
testimony. From the reasons of Humphreys J., speaking for the Court, I take this
extract (at p. 187):

We have had a report in this case from the
learned Recorder of Manchester, and it is quite clear from that report that the
primary cause of this unfortunate situation was the failure of the counsel who
had been briefed to do his duty to his client and the Court in attending when
the case was in the list for trial. If he was unable for any good reason to
attend, his duty, as everybody knows, was to see that some other member of the
Bar held his brief and was in a position to represent the accused person. It
was owing to the fact that that member of the Bar agreed with counsel for the
prosecution that neither would go to the Court till 2 p.m. that all this
trouble arose. In those circumstances, we think it right to say that in our opinion
the Assistant-Recorder was perfectly justified in continuing with the trial of
a person although she was unrepresented. The jury had to be considered. It
would have been quite wrong for the Assistant-Recorder at 10.30 a.m. to waste
the jury’s time and tell them there was nothing for them to do and that they
must come back at 2 p.m. for the convenience of counsel. No application had
been made to the Court to fix the case for 2 p.m. or postpone it in any way.

If the matter rested on the facts which I
have stated so far, this Court would not have interfered, …

The only reason for the intervention of the
Court of Appeal was the decision of the trial judge not to allow another lawyer
to represent the accused.

Although Howes[18], belongs to the area of legislation
on legal aid in England, it is of relevance here. Two paragraphs of the
headnote describe the problem:

[Page 131]

The appellant, who was charged with a
serious offence, applied to quarter sessions for legal aid, but was refused. At
the trial he obtained a dock brief, but the counsel whom he had selected
returned the brief without informing the court. At the opening of the trial the
appellant, who was then unrepresented, owing to a misunderstanding, did not
apply for a dock brief, but did so in the course of the trial. The
Deputy-Chairman, who did not realise the actual position, refused the
application, and the appellant conducted his own defence. The case against him
was an extremely strong one.

Held that,
as in the opinion of the court representation of the appellant by counsel could
not have produced a different result, no miscarriage of justice had resulted
despite the fact that the appellant was unrepresented, and the conviction must
be affirmed.

Before the Court of Appeal, the accused
submitted that the assistance of a lawyer would have had the result that:

(a) the police officer could have been subjected
to cross-examination;

(b) the evidence would not have been presented
in such a way as to suggest that he had a record of past convictions;

(c) the tone of the cross-examination to which
he himself was subjected might have been different.

Lord Parker C.J. stated as follows the question
now before this Court (at p. 179):

The court has considered all those matters.
The real question at the end of the day is whether the court is completely
satisfied that, notwithstanding the unfortunate course this case took in regard
to the appellant not being represented, there has been no miscarriage of
justice. If there is the slightest doubt in the matter, then the court ought to
quash the conviction.

And the Court held (at p. 180):

…that there is no reason to interfere at
all, that really the case was overwhelming, and that no counsel could have
produced any different result.

[Page 132]

The same year, in Sowden[19], the Court of Appeal studied two
convictions which had resulted in sentences of three years and six months
respectively. It dismissed the first and upheld the second. On the first issue,
the thinking of the Court is found in the following extract from the reasons of
Lord Parker C.J., speaking for the Court (at p. 40):

That was the sort of issue, and one has
only to state that to realise that no layman could adequately deal with
questions of joint possession arising out of acting in concert and matters of
that sort. The appellant really ought to have been legally represented if his
case was to be put properly. Mr. Hazan has taken other points, that it
might be that further evidence could have been called if he had been legally
represented, and matters of that sort. It is sufficient to say that this court
is not satisfied, that if he had been represented, the result must have been
the same.

As to the second conviction, however, the Chief
Justice, after having stressed that it was a simple matter, a “hopeless case”,
concluded (at p. 41):

It does not seem to this court that any
legal representation could conceivably have made any difference…

Two years later, in Lacey[20], the Court of Appeal refused to
interfere with a conviction which had resulted in a sentence of three years. I
do not wish to encumber these reasons by referring to the facts. I need only
once again cite Lord Parker C.J., who asks the question which the Court must
answer (at p. 210):

This court finds it quite unnecessary to
consider the position that would have emerged if these appellants had had legal
aid. No doubt, the course of the trial would have been different from what it
was, but it is by no means clear that the result would not have been exactly
the same. The court finds it unnecessary to go into that matter, for the simple
reason that the first step in the argument must be to satisfy the court that
the Deputy Chairman wrongly exercised his discretion by refusing legal aid.

[Page 133]

And the Court found that there was no reason to
intervene in such a discretionary matter.

It is, therefore, with a great deal of
hesitation that the Court of Appeal of England intervenes in cases such as that
now before the Court. That Court is a first court of appeal, which has a much
freer hand than we do. Furthermore, it must be emphasized that in each of these
cases the trial took place a short time after criminal proceedings were
instituted; in none of them did such a considerable length of time elapse as
the period of five months in the case at bar.

The parties have also referred us to the
decision of the Privy Council, Galos Hired v. The King[21]. I do not see how this decision
applies. It suffices to point out that this was a matter of a sentence of death
for murder, that the absence of the lawyer before the Court of Appeal was due
to unforeseeable circumstances caused by the war, and that the accused had to
present his own case even though he was not prepared to do so.

On the whole, I am of the opinion that the
judgment a quo is not in error. The right to the presence of counsel is
a right which has limits, and the administration of justice requires that
society be protected as well. The accused has not convinced me that the
presence of his lawyer would have changed the outcome, indeed to the contrary.

I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR QUEBEC

Sale—Resolutory
clause—Contractor’s privilege—Obligation signed by the seller not constituting
a renunciation—Question of fact.

The facts of this appeal are similar to those
of Stendel v. Moidel et al. (supra, p. 256). Appellant is an
electrical contractor who lost his privilege as a result of the cancellation of
the sale obtained by the seller, represented by respondent as trustee, under
the terms of the resolutory clause. Like the general contractor in Stendel, appellant
had agreed with the new purchaser of the immovable, Hôtel Président Inc., to
perform certain work. The seller, Caplan, used his influence and credit to
hasten completion of the work as much as possible. In particular, he wrote a
letter to Meco in which he undertook jointly and severally with the debtor to
repay the sum represented by the privilege. The Court of Appeal of Quebec upheld the cancellation of the
privilege ordered by the Superior Court. Hence the appeal to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The Court cannot accept appellant’s
contention that Caplan’s letter is more favourable to appellant than the note
in question in Stendel. Neither the joint and several obligation
expressed in the letter nor the promise contained in the note is capable in
itself or removing Caplan’s priority interest in the building. Moreover, the Quebec courts unanimously held that the
record con-

[Page 265]

tained no evidence of a tacit renunciation on
Caplan’s part of the ordinary effects of cancellation of the sale, namely the
annihilation of all privileges caused to encumber the immovable by the
purchaser. There are no grounds for intervention by this Court.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal
of Quebec, affirming a judgment
of the Superior Court ordering the cancellation of a privilege. Appeal
dismissed.

Donald W. Seal, Q.C., and Léonard E.
Siedman, for the appellant.

Alexander S. Konigsberg and Julius H.
Grey, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DE GRANDPRÉ J.—In my view, there is no
substantive difference between the question raised by this appeal and the one
answered today by this Court in Stendel v. Moidel and Lawrence[1].

Appellant is an electrical contractor who
registered a privilege for the sum of $45,051.63 on January 25, 1967. As the
general contractor, he contracted with the new purchaser of the immovable,
Hôtel Président Inc., to perform various types of work, which he did under the
very eyes of the seller Caplan (respondent Lawrence was trustee of the Caplan
interests), who used his influence and credit to hasten completion of the work
as much as possible. By his action, he is seeking inter alia recognition
of his privilege, notwithstanding the cancellation of the sale obtained by the
seller under the terms of a resolutory clause.

The Quebec courts refused to allow his action. Appellant submits that they
erred, principally by failing to give sufficient weight to a letter written by
Caplan to Meco on November 11, 1966:

In virtue of a letter dated the 14th July
1966 from Greenspoon, Freedlander, Plachta & Kryton, Architects which was
subsequently followed by a work order dated the 29th July 1966 signed by the
said firm, as well as by Mr. I. Kugiel of the LaSalle Hotel, you entered
into an Agreement for the supply and installation of a complete indoor
substation at the said hotel, the whole for a price

[Page 266]

Of FORTY-TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY DOLLARS
($42,020.00), including special delivery charges.

Subsequently, you invoiced various smaller
charges totalling THREE THOUSAND AND THIRTY-ONE DOLLARS AND SIXTY-THREE CENTS
($3,031.63).

I understand that of the total amount of
FORTY-FIVE THOUSAND AND FIFTY-ONE DOLLARS AND SIXTY-THREE CENTS ($45,051.63)
the sum of TWENTY THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DOLLARS AND THREE CENTS
($20,680.03) is presently due and unpaid, while the balance of work and
materials remains, for reasons well known to me, still to be supplied.

This will confirm our verbal understanding
to the effect that you will proceed with all due diligence to complete this
work, and that in consideration thereof, I will be bound jointly and severally
with the debtor for the payment of the said full sum of FORTY-FIVE THOUSAND AND
FIFTY-ONE DOLLARS AND SIXTY-THREE CENTS ($45,051.63); it is nevertheless
understood, that you will not require payment of the said sum prior to the 25th
January 1967.

In appellant’s view, this letter is much more
favourable to his case than the note in question in Stendel.

I cannot share this opinion. Neither the joint
and several obligation expressed in the letter nor the promise contained in the
note is capable in itself of removing Caplan’s priority interest in the
building. Moreover, the Quebec
courts unanimously held that the record contained no evidence of a tacit
renunciation on Caplan’s part of the ordinary effects of cancellation of the
sale, namely the annihilation of all privileges caused to encumber the
immovable by the purchaser. I see no grounds for intervention.

For these reasons and those expressed in Stendel,
I would dismiss the appeal with costs.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[2] dismissing an
appeal by the appellant against his conviction of non-capital murder. Appeal
dismissed.

John F. Hamilton, Q.C., and R.G. Thomas,
Q.C., for the appellant.

R.M. McLeod, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered orally
by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—We do not need to hear you,
Mr. McLeod. We agree with the Court of Appeal that the way in which and
the grounds on which the trial judge exercised his discretion in respect of the
attempt of counsel for the accused to challenge for cause is not open to
objection. Further, we do not agree that there was any error in the disposition
made by the Court of Appeal on the other grounds of appeal raised in that
Court, nor do we think that in the circumstances of the present case there was
any error in the failure to direct the jury on the issue of drunkenness.

We would add that in our opinion the procedure outlined
by the Court of Appeal for dealing with challenges for cause provides a useful
guide for trial judges called on to deal with such challenges.

[Page 268]

The appeal is, accordingly, dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR QUEBEC

Criminal law — Evidence — Alibi defence — Failure of accused
to testify — Instructions to the jury — Mention by judge that no conclusion unfavourable
to the accused may be drawn from his failure to testify — Canada Evidence Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10, s. 4(5).

Appeal — Acquittal at trial — Error of law — New trial
ordered — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 613(1), (4), 618(2).

The appellant, who was charged with non-capital
murder, was tried before a judge and jury, and was acquitted. He presented an
alibi defence at the trial but did not testify himself. In giving his
instructions to the jury the judge said that they could not draw any conclu­sion
unfavourable to the accused from the fact that he had not testified. The Court
of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal, which was based on the contention that
this instruction constituted an error of law, and ordered a new trial. Hence
the appeal to this Court.

Held (Laskin C.J. and Dickson J. dissenting): The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Spence, Pigeon, Beetz
and de Grandpré JJ.: Although s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act  provides that
the failure of a person charged to testify shall not be made the subject of comment
by the judge, it does not authorize a trial judge to direct a jury that they
cannot draw their own conclu­sions from the fact that the accused did not
testify. In fact it is open to a jury to draw a logical inference from the
failure of the accused to testify, particularly in a case in which it is sought
to establish an alibi. Accord­ingly the trial judge's direction constituted an
error of law and justified the appeal.

Section 613(4)  of the Criminal Code , which deals with
the powers of the court of appeal on an appeal from an acquittal, contains no
provision similar to s. 613(1) , which states that where there is an appeal
against a conviction, the court of appeal may dismiss the appeal
notwithstanding that it is of the opinion that

[Page 278]

there has been a wrong decision of law in the trial
court, if the court is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice has occurred. However, this Court has already recognized that, in an
appeal from a verdict of acquittal, there were grounds for applying the test
defined in White [1947] S.C.R. 268, and that it was the duty of the Crown to
satisfy the Court that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same if
the trial judge had properly directed the jury. The Crown fulfilled its duty in
the case at bar: the failure of an accused person, who relies upon an alibi, to
testify and thus to submit himself to cross-examination is a matter of
importance in considering the validity of that defence. The jury, in this case,
was instructed that they could not take that fact into account.

Per Laskin C.J. and Dickson J., dissenting: There
may have been error in telling the jury they could not draw an unfavourable
inference from failure to testify. However, although this error was prejudicial
to the Crown, it was not such as to warrant a new trial, unless the Crown could
satisfy the Court with a substantial degree of certainty that the jury would
necessarily have convicted the accused in the absence of the offending words.
An examination of the evidence in the case at bar does not allow us to reach
any such conclusion. If the case turned only on alibi, the appeal would have to
be dismissed, but this does not obtain. Alibi was a second­ary defence,
primarily the case for the accused rested upon the frailty of the evidence of
identification. The evidence was far from strong and positive and it is not
surprising that after hearing it the jury entertained a reasonable doubt as to
appellant's guilt. It is by no means evident that this short sentence buried in
a charge extending through twenty-eight pages of transcript may have changed
the jury's verdict had it not been spoken.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal of Quebec[1],
quashing a verdict of acquittal handed down by a jury and ordering a new trial.
Appeal dismissed, Laskin C.J. and Dickson J. dissenting.

[Page 279]

Lawrence Corriveau, Q.C., for the appellant. 

Francois Tremblay, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Dickson J. was delivered by

DICKSON J. (dissenting)—The appellant Vézeau was acquitted on a
charge of non-capital murder after a five-day trial before Mr. Justice Marcel Crête
and jury at the City of Quebec. The Crown appealed the verdict. The Court of
Appeal for Quebec unanimously allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial. The
appeal comes before this Court pursuant to s. 618(2) (a) of the Criminal Code 
which gives a person who is acquitted of an indictable offence and whose
acquittal is set aside by the Court of Appeal a right to appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada on a question of law.

The accused was charged with the murder of Roland Huard on
October 2, 1969. The murder occurred in a Quebec restaurant, ""L'Oasis"",
in Quebec City. Huard was shot to death. The appeal and the new trial rest upon
consideration of the effect of the following passage in the judge's charge to
the jury:

[TRANSLATION] After you were sworn in as jurors, I pointed
out to you that in our criminal law, the accused before the Court is presumed
to be innocent. Not only must the Crown prove the accused guilty beyond all
reasonable doubt, but the accused himself does not have to establish his
innocence. Neither is he required to testify in his own defence. In this case
the accused did not testify. You may not draw from this fact any conclusion unfavourable
to the accused.

Section 4(1) of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10
provides that every person charged with an offence is a competent witness for
the defence. Subsection (5) of the same section provides that the failure of
the person charged to testify shall not be the subject of comment by the judge
or by counsel for the prosecution. The purpose of this latter subsection is not
obscure. An accused person enjoys the presumption of inno­cence, and the burden
of proof beyond reasonable doubt rests upon the prosecution from the beginning

[Page 280]

to the end of the trial. The jury is so instructed in every jury
trial involving a criminal charge. Comment upon the failure of the accused to
testify might tend to defeat these jural safeguards. As Mr. Justice Ritchie
said in McConnell and Beer v. The Queen[2]:

I think it is to be assumed that the section in question was
enacted for the protection of accused persons against the danger of having
their right not to testify presented to the jury in such fashion as to suggest
that their silence is being used as a cloak for their guilt.

In McConnell and Beer v. The Queen the trial judge, in recharging
the jury, said:

Gentlemen of the Jury, it was pointed out that in the course
of my charge to you I stated that you did not have to accept the explanations
of the accused because those explanations were not made under oath. You are not
to take it from that that there is any onus upon the accused to prove their
innocence by going into the witness box and testifying in their defence. There
is no such onus on these or any accused persons in any criminal trial of
proving their innocence by going into the witness box and testifying in their
own defence. You are not to be influenced in your decision by either of the
accused not going into the witness box and testifying, but the Court does point
out that these explanations were given and when made were not made under oath
and it is not only for that reason alone but for any other number of reasons
that may occur to you, to decide if you will accept these explanations.

Mr. Justice Ritchie quoted with approval a passage from the
reasons of Mr. Justice Evans in the Court of Appeal, of which the following
forms part:

To hold that an accidental slip or an innocuous statement
indicating the failure of the accused to testify must ipso facto result in a
reversible error does violence to the intent and meaning of the Statute.

I am of the opinion that the impugned statement must be
considered solely in the light of possible prejudice to the accused.

This Court in McConnell and Beer held that the remarks of the
trial judge viewed in context and on a reasonable interpretation did not amount
to a

[Page 281]

comment in breach of the section. The language of the trial judge
was taken to be ""not so much a 'comment' on the failure of the persons
charged to testify as a statement of their right to refrain from doing
so.""

McConnell and Beer, supra, was followed in Avon v. The Queen[3],
in which a majority of this Court held that the following passages from the
jury charge did not offend s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act :

The accused did not testify. Evidently, he could have done
so. He is not obliged to do so. I must tell you immediately, because it is
better to say it, it is not because the accused did not testify that you should
believe that he could be guilty. His absence from the witness box, the fact
that he did not testify and did not call any witnesses, has nothing to do with
the trial. Because you will have to come to your decision only on the
well-established principle that the Crown must prove and establish the guilt of
the accused.

Actually, you have merely the Crown's evidence. The defense
(sic) did not call witnesses, and the accused did not testify: he did not have
to. It is up to the Crown to prove its case.

In both of the cases mentioned, one might be forgiven for
concluding that the directions to the jury bore some semblance of comment by
the judge upon the failure of the accused to testify, but the majority of the
Court had regard to the spirit animating the legislation rather than the cold
letter of the law and sustained the convictions.

The present case is not one in which the accused seeks to impugn
the judge's charge on the ground that the latter commented upon the failure of
the accused to testify. That is the situation which usually comes before the
courts. Although s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act  was enacted, as I have
said, to protect the rights of the accused, in the present case the complaint
originates with the Crown. The Crown's complaint, of course, does not stem
directly from s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act . It is founded on the judge's
observa­tion, which followed his comment on the failure of

[Page 282]

the accused to testify, to the effect that the jury could not
draw any unfavourable conclusion from failure of the accused to testify.

The judge may well have erred when he drew the jury's attention
to the failure of the accused to enter the witness box but we do not have to
decide that issue. If there was error, it was error prejudi­cial to the
accused. I think also that there may have been error in telling the jury they
could not draw an unfavourable inference from failure to testify: Corbett v.
The Queen[4], at p.
280; R. v. Steinberg[5]. This
error was prejudicial to the Crown but in my opinion it is not, for the reasons
which follow, such as to warrant a new trial.

I do not think that the impugned sentence was anything more than
an accidental slip, made while the judge was charging upon the presumption of
innocence and onus of proof. The words to which objection is taken, save for
the short comment on failure to testify, follow immediately upon a cor­rect
statement of the law, that the accused does not have to establish his innocence
and that he was under no obligation to testify on his own behalf. The final
sentence of the paragraph is unfortunate, but I have no doubt it was added by
the judge merely to emphasize and underscore his earlier remarks on presumption
of innocence and burden of proof.

Not every error by a trial judge is fatal, in the sense of
requiring a new trial. An accused appeal­ing reversal of an acquittal does not
have the benefit of a curative section such as s. 613(1)(b)(iii), but it is nonetheless
clear that in order for a new trial to be ordered the Crown must satisfy the
Court with a substantial degree of certainty that the jury would necessarily
have convicted the accused in the absence of the offend­ing words. As Kerwin
J., as he then was, said in

[Page 283]

Cullen v. The Queen[6], at p.
665:

...the onus is on the Crown to satisfy the Court that the
verdict would not necessarily have been the same if there had been no error in
law in the trial judge's charge.

For myself, I do not feel any such certainty. As a majority of
the Court hold the view that there must be a new trial in this case, I will
refrain from commenting upon the evidence beyond that which is necessary in
order to elucidate the points I wish to make.

The accused offered an alibi, and it may be that the words of the
charge upon which the Crown rely in asking for a new trial gave rise among the
members of the jury to the impression that they could not take into account,
when assessing the alibi, the failure of the accused to testify. If the case
turned only on alibi or if the evidence of identification had been strong and
positive, I would dismiss this appeal, but neither obtains. Alibi was not the
only defence. Primarily the case for the accused rested upon the fallibility
and frailty of the evidence of identification. Three witnesses gave
identification evidence during the trial—Miss Ghislaine Gosselin and M. Marcel Robitaille,
for the Crown, and Mrs. Jean-Claude Couture for the defence. Gosselin and Robitaille
were customers of the restaurant. Both had been drinking in the restaurant
prior to the shooting. Couture was the waitress who let the murderer into the
restaurant after closing hours.

In evaluating the identification evidence, it is important to
take cognizance of the lighting condi­tions in the restaurant and the
opportunities for observation. After 2:00 a.m. when the restaurant closed, it
was the practice to close the drapes, extinguish all lights except for a blue
light and the light from the cigarette machine, and to rely on

[Page 284]

fluorescent light coming from the kitchen at the back of the
restaurant. Thus there was a fairly sombre atmosphere interfering with vision,
even though the restaurant was small. There was also some grill-work in the
restaurant which, it was argued, served also to obscure the view. Miss Gosselin
could not identify the murderer full-face, as she had only seen him in profile.
She noted that he was about six feet tall, 185-200 lbs., well-built. The only
identifying characteristic which she noted was a crease or hollow on the right
side of his face near the eye. Gosselin picked Vézeau out of a line-up on
January 2, 1970 (the murder occurred October 2, 1969) and identified him in
court.

Robitaille had a greater opportunity to view the murderer than Gosselin,
as he was confronted by the murderer at a distance of one and one-half feet. He
said that he did not recognize the person from this confrontation as he was too
nervous, Huard just having been wounded. He recognized the murderer from
earlier observation when the latter was seated in the restaurant. He described
the murderer as about six feet one inch and well-built. The only identifying
characteristic which he pointed out was sideburns. He picked Vézeau out of a
police line-up on January 2,1970 and again in court. Robitaille's evidence is
contradictory in places, and this fact becomes disturbing in relation to the
question of whether the police showed him any photographs prior to the line-up.
At trial he said that he saw fifteen photos in November, yet at the preliminary
inquiry he said that he saw no photos of Vézeau in November. Whether he was
telling the truth or just confused by the questions addressed at trial and at
the preliminary inquiry were questions for the jury to determine.

Mrs. Couture, though summoned by the Crown, testified as a
defence witness. She described the murderer, whom she let in the door, as six
feel tall, 165-175 lbs. (180-190 lbs. at the time of her statement to the
police) with dark hair. She did

[Page 285]

not recognize the person in the police line-up, although she said
two men resembled the murder­er. Vézeau was not one of those men. She said at
trial that she did not recognize him. She was in an equal or better position
than Gosselin and Robi­taille to observe the alleged offender.

There is no evidence which links Vézeau to the murder other than
that of Gosselin and Robitaille. We have no evidence of motive or any
connection between Huard and Vézeau.

The defence led the evidence of Paul Mouffe, manager of a
Montreal club, who said that Vézeau was with him on the night of the murder and
thus provided an alibi.

The alibi was a secondary defence. Ten pages of the charge were
devoted to identification evidence, two pages to the alibi. The primary
strategy of the defence was to challenge the identification of Vézeau. This is
apparent from the lengthy cross-examination of Gosselin and Robitaille and the
examination-in-chief of Couture. It is not surpris­ing that the jury
entertained a reasonable doubt as to Vézeau's guilt, for it would have been
dangerous to convict on the evidence at trial. The apprehen­sion surrounding
uncritical reliance upon identifi­cation evidence was adumbrated in R. v. Spatola[7].

A jury charge should not be anatomized, cut in pieces and
examined part by part, as though it were a plant or animal in a laboratory
experiment. The charge must be read as whole, together with all of the evidence
at trial. No one could take exception to the conduct of the trial by Mr.
Justice Crête. The jury charge, apart from the words assailed, was not open to
challenge. At the conclu­sion of the charge, the judge asked counsel for their
observations. Crown counsel did not take any objection. This case was almost
entirely one of fact, dependent upon identification. The narrow point of law
raised by the Crown is to be found in

[Page 286]

one short sentence buried in a charge extending through
twenty-eight pages of transcript.

In my view, a properly instructed jury could readily have come to
a conclusion other than that of guilt of the accused. The accused has stood one
trial. Except in a clear case, that should end the matter. I am not satisfied
that the jury would not have come to the same verdict if the language
complained of had never been spoken.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of
Appeal and reinstate the jury verdict of acquittal.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Spence, Pigeon, Beetz
and de Grandpré was deliv­ered by

MARTLAND J.—The appellant, who was charged with non-capital
murder, was tried before a judge and jury, and was acquitted. The respond­ent
appealed to the Court of Appeal of Quebec on various alleged questions of law.
The appeal was allowed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in law in
the instruction to the jury in the last sentence of the following passage in
his charge:

[TRANSLATION] After you were sworn in as jurors, I pointed
out to you that in our criminal law, the accused before the Court is presumed
to be innocent. Not only must the Crown prove the accused guilty beyond all
reasonable doubt, but the accused himself does not have to establish his
innocence. Neither is he required to testify in his own defence. In this case
the accused did not testify. You may not draw from this fact any conclusion unfavourable
to the accused.

A new trial was directed. The appellant appeals from this
judgment pursuant to s. 618(2) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. 34, which
provides that a person acquitted of an indictable offence whose acquittal is
set aside by the Court of Appeal may appeal to this Court on a question of law.

The case for the Crown was that Roland Huard, who had been seated
in a restaurant in the City of

[Page 287]

Quebec, was shot by the appellant, on or about October 2, 1969.
Two witnesses were called to identify the appellant as being the person who had
killed Huard. The appellant did not give evidence at his trial. The defence
called a witness who had been in the restaurant at the time of the killing to
testify that the assailant was not the appellant. Another witness was called to
establish an alibi, who testified that the appellant had been with him in
Montreal during part of the evening when the murder occurred, and that he could
not have been Huard's assailant.

Chief Justice Tremblay, who delivered the reasons of the Court,
said, after citing the above-men­tioned passage from the charge to the jury:

[TRANSLATION] It is possible that this comment con­travenes
s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act  (R.S.C. 1952, c. 307). I do not have to come
to a decision on this point, since it seems to me that this clearly constitutes
an error of law, an improper direction to the jury, who had just been told
""The law requires you to obey the judge's directions on the law.""

Clearly, the jury has the right to take into account the accused's
failure to testify and to draw any logical conclusion.

In R. v. Steinberg (1931 O. R. 222), decided by the Ontario
Court of Appeal, Magee J., speaking of the probatory force of evidence offered
by defence to sub­stantiate his alibi said (at p. 227):

""The accused did not offer his own evidence, and the
jury no doubt had that in mind as well as the bearing of his witnesses.""

In the same case, Hodgins J. (p. 230):

""It must not be forgotten that the alibi set up was not
verified by the oath of the accused. While it must not be mentioned to the jury
that the accused has omitted to testify, it is patent to both Judge and jury
that under those circumstances the alibi has a hollow sound.""

Finally Middleton J. (p. 236):

""No comment may be made upon this to the jury, but the
law does not forbid jurors to use their intelligence and to consider the
absence of denial or explanation.""

The Supreme Court of Canada upheld this decision (1931
R.S.C. 421) and expressed no disapproval of the propositions of law cited
above.

[Page 288]

He also referred to a passage from the reasons for judgment of
Middleton J.A. in R. v. Comba[8], at p.
226, and a passage from the reasons for judgment of Rinfret J. in Coffin v. R.[9],
at p. 355.

Reference should also be made to the view expressed by Pigeon J.,
who delivered the reasons of the majority, in Corbett v. R.[10],
at p. 280:

Section 4.5  of the Canada Evidence Act  provides that the
failure of a person charged ""shall not be made the subject of comment by
the judge, or by counsel for the prosecution"", it does not prevent the
jury from taking the fact into account without being told. No one can
reasonably think that a jury will fail, in reaching a verdict, to take into
account the failure of the accused to testify, specially in a case like this.
This being so, it is a fact properly to be considered by the Court of Appeal
when dealing with the question: ""Is this a reasonable verdict?""

Section 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10, to
which Tremblay C.J. and Pigeon J. refer, provides that:

The failure of the person charged, or of the wife or husband
of such person, to testify, shall not be made the subject of comment by the
judge, or by counsel for the prosecution.

Tremblay C.J. makes it clear that he was not founding his judgment
upon any breach of that provision by the trial judge in his charge. His point
is that the subsection does not require or authorize a trial judge to tell a
jury that they cannot draw their own conclusions from the fact that the accused
has not given evidence. In his opinion, with which I agree, it is open to a
jury to draw an inference from the failure of the accused to testify, and,
particularly, in a case in which it is sought to establish an alibi.

Counsel for the appellant contended that there was no question of
law which warranted the appeal by the respondent to the Court of Appeal,
suggest­ing that the only issue at trial was one of fact as to the
identification of the appellant as being the person who committed the murder.
After analysing

[Page 289]

the evidence, he submitted that the verdict of the jury was
correct.

The point is, however, that the decision of the jury was made in
the light of an express direction that they must not, in reaching a decision,
draw any unfavourable conclusion from the fact that the appellant had not given
evidence. As I have indicated, in my opinion this direction was wrong in law,
and warranted the appeal made by the respondent to the Court of Appeal.

Counsel for the appellant referred us to two judgments of this Court
in McConnell and Beer v. R.[11], and
Avon v. R.[12].

In each of these cases it was contended by the accused that there
had been a breach of s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act  in the judge's charge
to the jury. In the former case the judge had said:

Gentlemen of the Jury, it was pointed out that in the course
of my charge to you I stated that you did not have to accept the explanations
of the accused because those explanations were not made under oath. You are not
to take it from that that there is any onus upon the accused to prove their
innocence by going into the witness box and testifying in their defence. There
is no such onus on these or any accused persons in any criminal trial of
proving their innocence by going into the witness box and testifying in their
own defence. You are not to be influenced in your decision by either of the
accused not going into the witness box and testifying, but the Court does point
out that these explanations were given and when made were not made under oath
and it is not only for that reason alone but for any other number of reasons
that may occur to you, to decide if you will accept these explanations.

It was held by the majority in that case that the language used
by the trial judge was not so much a ""comment"" on the failure of the
accused to testify as a statement of their right to refrain from doing so, and
it should not be taken to have been the intention of Parliament in enacting s.
4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act  to preclude judges from explaining to juries
the law with respect to the rights of accused persons in this regard.

[Page 290]

In the latter case the passage complained of was as follows:

[TRANSLATION] The accused did not testify. Evidently, he
could have done so. He is not obliged to do so. I must tell you immediately,
because it is better to say it, it is not because the accused did not testify
that you should believe that he could be guilty. His absence from the witness
box, the fact that he did not testify and did not call any witnesses, has
nothing to do with the trial. Because you will have to come to your decision
only on the well-established principle that the Crown must prove and establish
the guilt of the accused.

Fauteux C.J., writing the reasons of the majori­ty, said, at p.
654:

However, relying on the concise and accurate distinction
made by Ritchie J. in McConnell and Beer, supra, I would say that the language
used by Cousineau J. is a ""statement"" of an accused's right not to
testify, rather than a ""comment"" on his failure to do so. In my
opinion, the instructions complained of cannot be construed as prejudicial to
the accused or such as to suggest to the jurors that his silence was used to
cloak his guilt. On the contrary, by telling them, as stated above: ""His
absence from the witness box, the fact that he did not testify and did not call
any witnesses, has nothing to do with the trial,"" the learned judge, in a
manner favourable to the accused, set aside the acknowledged right of any judge
of the fact judge or jury-to consider whether the evidence produced by the
prosecution is such that, in the absence of explanation or contradiction, it
can validly justify a conviction.

In each of these cases the decision was that there had not been a
breach of s. 4(5)  in the charge to the jury. In each case it was also said that
even if the comment had been in violation of s. 4(5)  it was a proper case for
the application of s. 592(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code , now s.
613(1) (b)(iii). Counsel for the appellant contends that that paragraph should
be applied in the present case.

Section 613(1) defines the powers of a court of appeal on the
hearing of an appeal against a conviction. Paragraph (b)(iii) of that
subsection empowers the court to dismiss the appeal from conviction
notwithstanding that it is of the opinion that there has been a wrong decision
of law in the trial court, if the court is of the opinion that no

[Page 291]

substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred.

The powers of the court of appeal on an appeal from an acquittal
are defined in s. 613(4)  as follows:

(4) Where an appeal is from an acquittal the court of appeal
may

(a) dismiss the appeal; or

(b) allow the appeal, set aside the verdict and

(i) enter a verdict of guilty with respect to the offence of
which, in its opinion, the accused should have been found guilty but for the
error in law, and pass a sentence that is warranted in law, or

(ii) order a new trial.

Subsection (4) does not contain any provision equivalent to s.
613(1)(b)(iii). The powers of the court under this subsection were considered
by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Paquette[13],
at p. 162. After quoting subs. (4), the Court goes on to say:

It is to be observed that the term, ""no substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice"" is not incorporated in this subsection as
it is in the situation of an appeal by an accused. However, in this ease we
think it appropriate to analogize the test, and we would hold that the Crown
has satisfied us that it cannot be said that but for the misdirection the
verdict of the jury would necessarily have been the same.

The test applied in that case to determine whether a verdict of
acquittal should be set aside, where the Crown had established an error in law
at the trial, is that which had been stated by Kerwin J., as he then was, in
White v. R.[14], at p.
276. It is true that at the time the White case was determined s. 1013(5)  of
the Criminal Code  pro­vided that the powers of a court of appeal on an appeal
by the Crown should mutatis mutandis be similar, inter alia, to its powers
under s. 1014(2) , which enabled it to dismiss an appeal from a conviction, even
though there were grounds which might have warranted a decision in favour of
the appellant, if it was the opinion that no substantial

[Page 292]

wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred. However, in the
case of R. v. Gauthier[15],
Pigeon J., who delivered the reasons of the majority, applied the test defined
in the White case. There was no dissent in respect of this point. In the
present case, therefore, it was the duty of the Crown, in order to obtain a new
trial, to satisfy the Court that the verdict would not necessarily have been
the same if the trial judge had properly directed the jury.

In my opinion that test has been met by the Crown. It was part of
the appellant's defence to the charge that he could not have committed the
offence because he was in Montreal when the murder occurred. Proof of this
alibi was tendered by a witness who claimed to have been with the appellant in
Montreal. The direction of the trial judge precluded the jury, when considering
this defence, from taking into consideration the fact that the appellant had
failed to support his alibi by his own testimony. The failure of an accused
person, who relies upon an alibi, to testify and thus to submit himself to
cross-examination is a matter of importance in considering the validity of that
defence. The jury, in this case, was instructed that they could not take that
fact into account in reaching their verdict.

In the result, I agree with the judgment of the Court of Appeal and
would dismiss this appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Charge of murder—Alleged
drunkenness of accused—Culpability—Adequacy of instruction to jury—No
reversible error.

Appeal—Criminal appeal as of
right—Requirement that formal judgment of Court of Appeal specify ground or
grounds in law upon which dissent based—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, ss. 606, 618(1)(a).

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia[1], dismissing the
appellant’s appeal from his conviction for murder punishable by life
imprisonment. Appeal dismissed.

B.A. Crane, Q.C., for the appellant.

W.H. Deverell, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered orally
by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—We do not need to hear you,
Mr. Deverell. We are all of the opinion that on the facts of this case,
the single issue being the effect of the alleged drunkenness of the accused on
his culpability of murder, the trial judge did not commit any reversible error
in the way in which he dealt with the law, especially when regard is had to his
concluding summation to the jury, or in the way in which he dealt with the
evidence as it related to the limited position of the defence. The appeal
therefore fails and must be dismissed.

Before parting with this case, we wish to
emphasize that a criminal appeal which is brought here as of right, under
s. 618(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , by reason of a dissent on
questions of law in the Court below, should be perfected in compliance with
s. 606  of the Criminal Code  which

[Page 703]

requires that the formal judgment must specify
the ground or grounds in law upon which the dissent is based. That was not done
in this case, and this Court has had occasion to complain of similar failures
in other cases, in some of which it was unclear from the dissenting reasons
whether the dissent turned on a question of law.

Judgment accordingly.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Trial—Joint trial for rape—Evidence—Charge
to jury—Successive acts of intercourse by each accused—Defence of consent—Duty
to deal with issues of fact relating to each accused separately—Facts relating
to consent “interwoven”—Whether bribe attempt by one accused corroborative as
against the other—Applicability of s. 21  of the Criminal Code —Criminal Code ,
ss. 21 , 613(1) (b)(iii), 623(1) .

M and a co-accused R were convicted of raping
the same woman who was on the evidence also raped by a third person. The
convictions were affirmed by the Court of Appeal, that of R unanimously and
that of M by a majority. The main issue at trial had been that of consent or
want of consent of the complainant to the intercourse and other sexual acts
which, admittedly, were performed by the two accused and the third person. M’s
further appeal to this Court was based on the dissent of Dubin J.A. in the
Court of Appeal to the effect that the trial judge had erred (first) in failing
to deal separately with the issues of fact and law which related to the guilt
or innocence of M as distinguished from R, (second) in failing to instruct the
jury that they could acquit M if they found R guilty and (third) in failing to
instruct the jury as to the meaning and effect of s. 21  of the Criminal Code 
if they were to consider the threats and acts of violence by R as relevant
to the guilt or innocence of M.

Leave was given to appeal also on two
additional grounds of alleged error by the trial judge, (first) in failing to
instruct the jury that they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that M
was aware that the complainant was not consenting or that if she were
consenting, she was doing so by reason of a consent extorted by threats or by
fear of bodily harm and (second) in failing to instruct the jury that evidence
of an attempt to suppress evidence could only be cor-

[Page 908]

roborative of the complainant’s evidence with
respect to M if the attempt was authorized or procured by M.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The fact that, in the view of the jury, M
lied in asserting consent by the complainant should not, ipso facto, deprive
him of a right to have the jury properly charged on all the issues for which
there is some evidentiary basis. In the present case however the facts, e.q.
M’s presence when R threw the complainant onto a mattress in the room where
the acts occurred, indicate that there was little difference between the
position of R and M, and the defence itself, based as it was, on the common
stories told by the accused made it idle for the trial judge to separate them
any more than he did.

As to s. 21  of the Criminal Code , it
was made clear by the Crown that it was relying on sexual acts by each of the
accused and not on any common design or complicity by either of them in aiding
or abetting the sexual assaults committed by the other. In the circumstances
the trial judge was not at fault in failing to direct in respect of s. 21 .

Finally on the corroborative effect of the
evidence of an attempt, by an offer of money, to induce the complainant to
withdraw the charges. Evidence of consciousness of guilt, deducible from an
attempt to suppress evidence against him, is evidence which a jury may accept
as corroborative of a complainant’s testimony. The trial judge indicated
initially that there was no evidence that tied M into the attempt to have the
charges withdrawn but he subsequently qualified, to M’s disadvantage, the
initial instruction, leaving it to the jury to decide whether the attempt was
made on behalf of M as well as of R. Even if this was a flaw in the charge, it
did not warrant the setting aside of the verdict and an order for a new trial.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] dismissing appeals
by co-

[Page 909]

accused from their convictions of rape. Appeal
dismissed.

Brian H. Greenspan, for the appellant.

J.D. Ewart, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The appellant Mazza and a
co-accused Rizzuto were convicted, after a trial before Parker J. and a jury,
of raping the same woman who was, on the evidence, also raped by a third
person. He was associated with the co-accused but was not apprehended. On
appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal, the convictions were affirmed, that of
Rizzuto unanimously and that of Mazza by a majority, Dubin J.A. dissenting.
Mazza has appealed to this Court as of right on three points of law on which
Dubin J.A. dissented and on two other grounds on which leave to come here was
granted.

The formal judgment of the Court of Appeal sets
out the grounds of dissent in law in the following terms:

1. that the learned trial judge erred in
law in that in his charge to the jury he failed to deal separately with the
issues of fact and law which related to the guilt or innnocence of VINCENT
MAZZA as distinguished from that of his co-accused, and

2. that he further erred in instructing the
jury that there were only two verdicts for the jury to consider, but ought to
have instructed the jury that they could acquit VINCENT MAZZA if they found
FRANK RIZZUTO guilty, and

3. further erred in failing to instruct the
jury as to the meaning and effect of s. 21  of the Criminal Code  if they
were to consider the threats and acts of violence of FRANK RIZZUTO as relevant
to the guilt or innocence of VINCENT MAZZA,

The two additional grounds on which leave was
given were formulated as follows:

4. That the learned trial Judge erred in
law with respect to the issue of consent in failing to instruct the Jury that
they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Appellant Mazza was
aware that the Complainant was not consenting or that if she were consenting,
she was doing so by reason of a consent which

[Page 910]

had been extorted by threats or by fear of
bodily harm.

5. That the learned trial Judge erred in
law in failing to instruct the Jury that evidence of an attempt to suppress
evidence could only be capable of being corrobarative of the Complainant’s
evidence with respect to the Appellant Mazza if the attempt was authorized or
procured by the Appellant Mazza.

The main issue in the trial was that of consent
or want of consent of the complainant to the intercourse and other sexual acts
which, admittedly, were performed by the two accused and by the third person.
The stories of the complainant and of the two accused were completely
contradictory save as to the locale of the sexual occurrences. The complainant
was brought, with her consent, to certain premises after accepting a ride home
in a car with the two accused and one or two others. On her evidence, the
detour to these premises was to enable the occupants of the car to pick up
another person. There was no other person there, and it was when she asked to
be taken home that the events occurred which led to the charges of rape against
the two accused.

There was evidence, upon which the jury could
act and did, that the accused Rizzuto used violence against the complainant to
get her to submit to a series of sexual acts. After he had thus forced himself
upon the complainant and had left the room, the appellant Mazza engaged in
sexual activities with the complainant. There was no evidence from her of any
active resistance to him but, equally, no evidence from her that would indicate
consent. The third person who followed Mazza into the room after he had
finished his series of sexual acts, admittedly, “raped” the complainant. What
is raised in respect of Mazza’s intercourse and the other sexual acts in which
he engaged with the complainant is alleged non‑direction amounting to
misdirection by the trial judge in his charge in failing to direct the jury on
the issue of Mazza’s awareness that the complainant was not consenting or that
if she did consent, she did so under fear of bodily harm. This is ground 4 of
the issues in appeal, and associated with it is one of the matters comprehended
within ground 1.

[Page 911]

The trial judge’s charge proceeded from the base
of the assertion of counsel for the two accused (who were separately
represented) that the defence of each was common to both, that they were bound
up with one another in meeting the charges of rape. This, of course, does not
excuse a trial judge from the duty, which rests on him or her, to place before
a jury every defence open to an accused for which there is some evidentiary
foundation, or from the duty of dealing separately which each accused on a
joint trial where the evidence indicates that their positions may not be
common, even if counsel may have said this at the outset.

The trial judge in this case dealt fully with
the issue of consent, with credibility of the complainant and of the two
accused and of the other witnesses in respect of this issue, with the contradictions
involved in the evidence, and with the jury’s function to determine, on all the
evidence and in accordance with their own judgment of the veracity of the
witnesses and of the weight they would attach to such evidence as they found
acceptable, whether the Crown had established the want of consent beyond a
reasonable doubt. He did not deal separately on this point with Rizzuto and
with Mazza, and it was this with which Dubin J.A. took issue in the following
passage of his dissenting reasons:

On the evidence before the jury, it was
hardly open to them to acquit Rizzuto and to convict Mazza. On the other hand,
it was open to them to convict Rizzuto but to acquit Mazza. If the jury
believed the complainant’s testimony, it followed that Rizzuto was guilty of
rape. It was open to the jury, however, to accept the evidence of the
complainant and to acquit Mazza. She made her lack of consent apparent to
Rizzuto. She did not do so with respect to Mazza, and Mazza was not present
when Rizzuto raped the complainant. Mazza was obviously a man of the lowest
morals and was lacking in sensitivity. The complainant was a mature woman.
Although the issue of consent was common in the case against each of the
accused, there was a marked contrast in the evidence on this vital issue. With
great respect to the learned trial judge, it was never made clear to the jury
that they could acquit one and not the other...

I did not understand from this and other
passages in the reasons of the learned Justice of

[Page 912]

Appeal that he considered it open to the jury to
find that the complainant had not consented to engage in sexual acts with
Rizzuto and yet also find that she consented to such acts with Mazza. This
would be clearly unrealistic, as Arnup J.A. stated in his majority reasons.
Rather, it was Dubin J.A.’s view that it was open to the jury to find (and they
should have been charged to consider this) that the accused Mazza did not know
that the complainant was not consenting or had an honest belief that she was
(see, in this connection Director of Public Prosecutions v. Morgan[2]) or that there was a reasonable
doubt on the point.

The fact that the accused lied (in the view of
the jury) in asserting consent by the complainant should not, ipso
facto, deprive him of a right to have the jury properly charged on all the
issues for which there is some evidentiary basis. The present case is not,
however, one in which the appellant can complain of the failure of the trial
judge to isolate the question of his possible lack of awareness of non-consent
or of his honest belief that there was consent. He was present when Rizzuto
threw the complainant on the mattress in the particular room, resulting in a
bruise on her head when she hit the baseboard. He followed him into the room
where he found the complainant naked and told her not to dress. When he
finished with her he told her she had to “do the other guys”. To say, in such
circumstances, that Mazza’s position was different from Rizzuto’s is, I think,
very much overstating the case in his favour.

Similar considerations make it abundantly clear
to me that the trial judge did not err in not making any sharp differentiation
in his charge on the facts and on the law between Mazza and Rizzuto. He did
tell the jury that each accused was to be dealt with “individually”, but the
facts and the position advanced by the defence on the basis of the common
stories told by the accused made it idle for the trial judge to separate them
any more than he did.

[Page 913]

Another point of dissent turned on the alleged
misdirection of the trial judge in telling the jury that there were only two
verdicts open to them for each of the accused, that is guilty or not guilty of
rape. According to Dubin J.A. the jury should have been told that there were
four possible verdicts, namely, as to Rizzuto guilty or not guilty and as to
Mazza, guilty or not guilty. He conceded, as is evident from the passage from
his reasons, already quoted, that the jury could not possibly acquit Rizzuto
and convict Mazza but said that the reverse was open to them. In view of what I
have said on the interwoven question of the issue of consent, I need say no
more on this point and it falls accordingly.

The final issue raised by the dissent of Dubin
J.A. concerns the omission of the trial judge to instruct the jury on the
application of s. 21  of the Criminal Code . Although counsel for the
appellant urged this in his factum, it was not seriously pressed in oral
argument. As put by counsel for the appellant in his written submission, the
issue of s. 21  was necessarily involved in the trial judge’s direction that two
verdicts only were open to the jury. The Crown, however, made it clear that it
was relying on sexual acts by each of the accused and not on any common design,
or on complicity by either of them in the sexual assaults committed by the
other by way of aiding or abetting. It was not so much a question of common
purpose or intention carried out by one of the accused but of a common purpose
or intention separately carried out and separately treated in the Crown’s case.
The record is too scanty of any indication of the Crown’s attempt to fasten
guilt on one of the accused under s. 21  by reason of what was done by the
other. I find no fault in the trial judge in not giving any direction in respect
of s. 21 .

This leaves for consideration the fifth point in
this appeal, that relating to the trial judge’s charge on the corroborative
effect of the evidence of an attempt, by an offer of money, to induce the
complainant to withdraw the charges against the two accused. Admittedly,
evidence of conscious-

[Page 914]

ness of guilt, deducible from an attempt to
suppress evidence against him, is evidence which a jury may accept as
corroborative of a complainant’s testimony.

In his charge to the jury, the trial judge made
it clear, when he first dealt with the phone calls by the witness Thompson to
the complainant and her husband, that they only implicated Rizzuto in view of
the fact that the latter admitted that he asked Thompson to telephone, although
denying that any offer of a bribe was involved. There was, as the trial judge
then said, no evidence that tied Mazza into the phone calls, and hence they
were only relevant to the case against Rizzuto and not to the guilt of Mazza.
However, in a later part of the charge the trial judge said this:

When I spoke to you earlier I said there
might not be any evidence pointing to Mazza. On that, I was accepting what
counsel had said that—you may recall when I read Thompson’s evidence, on more
than one occasion he said, “They told me this. They said that”—now that is
direct evidence, if you accept that, you may think that Thompson had authority
from both, but if you believe he did not have authority from Mazza then you
don’t hold that evidence against Mazza.

This clearly qualified, to Mazza’s disadvantage,
the earlier instruction, but it appears to have been prompted by the trial
judge’s reconsideration of Thompson’s evidence and of the possible effect of
the reference in that evidence to “they”, meaning the two accused. The trial
judge obviously felt that he should leave it to the jury to determine whether
Thompson had authority to speak for Mazza as well as for Rizzuto. Assuming that
this was a flaw in the charge, I do not think that it warrants the setting
aside of the verdict and an order for a new trial. The case against Mazza apart
from this, and in the light of my rejection of the other grounds of appeal, was
very convincing and I would apply, in respect of the fifth ground of appeal,
the curative provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code , as
authorized by s. 623(1) .

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Fraud—Elements of
fraud—Directors’ actions re assets of company—Absence of quid pro quo—Basis of
evidence of fraud to go to jury—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, s.
338(1).

In late 1971 Langley’s Limited, a long-established dry-cleaning enterprise in Toronto, owned a substantial portfolio of
“blue-chip” securities valued at $1,443,460. The control of the company, some
90 per cent of the common shares, was held by two estates and an individual
represented by a chartered accountant, Leonard Johnston. Mr. Johnston was
approached by one of the accused, Olan, President of First Montreal City
Corporation Limited, to discuss the purchase of the controlling shares. It was
agreed that the controlling common shares and certain preferred shares of Langley’s would be acquired by First
Montreal for approximately $1,485,000 payable in cash. Toward the end of the
negotiations Mr. Johnston also met the other accused Hudson, President and
Director of Beauport Holdings, and Hartnett, Vice‑President and Director
of Beauport Holdings and legal adviser to Hudson. Before closing First Montreal assigned its rights under the agreement
to Beauport. Thereafter Hudson
and Hartnett played the dominant roles aided by Olan who was to receive a
finder’s fee of approximately $67,000 for negotiating the sale. As at November
30, 1971 the total current assets of Beauport Holdings were $149,968.30 and the
total assets $738,966.87. The closing date for the purchase of the Langley’s shares was to have been December 2, 1971, but, as the purchasers did not
have the necessary money, was postponed. A series of financial manœuvres
followed. A bank account had been opened in name of Beauport Holdings on
December 8, 1971, and the accused met with the bank manager concerning the
certification of a cheque for $1,025,000 to be drawn on the account. There were
no funds in the account but the manager was advised that a deposit of $488,000
was available and would be deposited later the same day. At a second meeting
the manager agreed to

[Page 1176]

the certification but only on conditions—he
was to be present at the closing and retain possession of the cheque until the
purchase of Langley’s was completed, when the accused would take possession of
Langley’s portfolio, sell the securities and with the proceeds cause Langley’s
to buy another company owned by them. On December 10, 1971, the accused completed
through Beauport Holdings the purchase of approximately 90 per cent of Langley’s common shares; the preferred
shares were purchased later. The vendors received the certified cheque for
$1,025,000 drawn on the account of Beauport Holdings plus $246,545 being the
proceeds of a loan to Beauport Holdings.

Another company, Beauport Financial
Corporation Limited, had been incorporated by Hudson and Hartnett on November
23, 1971. Immediately after the purchase of the Langley’s shares a meeting of
the new Board of Directors of Langley’s was convened which authorized the sale
of all securities owned by Langley’s, the purchase of 11,000 shares of
Gibraltar Mines Ltd. for $49,500, the purchase from First Montreal of the
outstanding shares of a Quebec company, Advertising Associates, for $400,000,
and the subscription by Langley’s for 10,000 shares in Beauport Financial at
$10 per share. Further steps were taken and as a result Beauport Financial
received from Langley’s
$790,000 which it loaned to Beauport Holdings to complete by Beauport Holdings
the purchase of Langley’s. The
issues were whether the $790,000 was expended in furtherance of the bona
fide business interests of Langley’s, or merely in advancing the personal
interests of the accused, and whether Langley’s suffered deprivation as a
result of this action. The accused were tried and convicted of defrauding Langley’s of money and valuable securities
to a value of $1,190,000 contrary to s. 338  of the Criminal Code , however
the Court of Appeal set aside the conviction. Leave was granted to appeal to
the Supreme Court on the question as to whether the Court of Appeal had erred
in holding that there was no evidence of fraud to go to the jury and in its
consideration of the applicability and scope of the principles of law in Cox
and Paton v. The Queen, [1963] S.C.R. 500, as they related to each
accused.

[Page 1177]

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

From Cox and Paton it is apparent that
proof of deceit is not essential to support a conviction under s. 338(1). Where
it is alleged that a corporation has been defrauded by its directors deception
is not an essential element of the offence. The words “other fraudulent means”
in s. 338(1) include means which are not in the nature of a falsehood or a
deceit and they encompass all other means which can properly be stigmatized as
dishonest. While the courts have been loath to attempt an exhaustive definition
of “defraud” one can say that two elements are essential, “dishonesty” and
“deprivation”. Using the assets of the corporation for personal purposes rather
than bona fide for the benefit of the corporation can constitute
dishonesty in a case of alleged fraud by directors of the corporation.
Deprivation is satisfied on proof of detriment, prejudice or risk of prejudice;
it is not essential that there be actual loss. On the facts it was here open to
the jury to find that the exchange of the Langley portfolio for a loan was something other than a quid pro quo. The
Court of Appeal erred in its consideration of the applicability and scope of
the principles of law in Cox and Paton v. The Queen as they
related to each accused and in holding that there was no evidence of fraud to
go to the jury.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The respondents were tried and
convicted before judge and jury on the charge of defrauding Langley’s Limited,
between December 1, 1971, and December 31, 1971, of money and valuable
securities having an aggregate value of $1,190,000, more or less, contrary to
s. 338  of the Criminal Code . Section 338(1)  makes it a crime to defraud
the public or any person of any property, money or valuable security by deceit,
falsehood or other fraudulent means. The word “defraud” is not defined.

The Court of Appeal for Ontario set aside the conviction and entered a verdict of acquittal. This
Court granted leave to appeal from the order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario upon the following question of law:

Did the Ontario Court of Appeal err in
holding that there was no evidence of fraud to go to the jury and, in that
connection, did it err in its consideration of the applicability and scope of
the principles of law in Cox and Paton v. The Queen, [1963]
S.C.R. 500 as they related to each accused?

The judgment in Cox and Paton is helpful
in considering the substantive offence of fraud although the relevant count
under discussion in that case was conspiracy to commit fraud and not the
substantive offence itself. In Cox and Paton, the accused had entered
into an option agreement for the purchase from the principal shareholder, one
Donaldson, of all of his shares in the capital stock of a company known as
Brandon Packers Limited. The option agreement declared the stated intention of
the optionee (the accused) to procure that Brandon Packers Limited would issue
bonds to the extent of $400,000 for sale, and the optionor, Donaldson, agreed
to use his best endeavours to promote the sale of the bonds. The option was
exercised. Prior to closing, about $275,000 of the bonds had been sold. At
closing, numerous steps were taken, including a daylight loan from a chartered
bank, but essentially what occurred was this: (i) Donaldson caused Brandon
Packers to subscribe for preference shares of the value of $200,000 in the
capital stock of Fropak Limited, a company controlled by the accused; (ii) with
the

[Page 1179]

monies received upon such subscription, Fropak
advanced $183,560 to two personal holding corporations owned and controlled by
the accused; (iii) the personal corporations paid Donaldson $183,560 for, and
took delivery of, his shares in Brandon Packers Limited; (iv) Fropak received
promissory notes from the two personal corporations totalling $183,560. In the
result, Donaldson received in cash the purchase price of his shares. The
accused, through their personal corporations, acquired those shares. Brandon
Packers Limited had expended $200,000 for preference shares of Fropak Limited,
and Fropak was left with promissory notes of the two personal holding
corporations in the amount of $183,560, plus $6,440. In substance, Brandon
Packers Limited became the source of the funds used by the accused to purchase
Donaldson’s shares and acquire control of Brandon Packers Limited.

The Test for Fraud

The paragraph in Cox and Paton which
particularly concerns us in the present appeal is to be found in the judgment
of Cartwright J., speaking for the Court, at pp. 512-513, reading:

In the course of argument on this branch of
the appeal counsel for the appellants submitted that there was no evidence that
the appellants defrauded Brandon Packers Limited or that they intended to do so
because, as it was said, there was no evidence of any false representation made
to the company or of any official of the company having been deceived into
parting with the moneys referred to in the particulars furnished. Assuming,
without deciding, that there was a dissent on this point within the meaning of
s. 597(1)  of the Criminal Code , I would reject this argument, I will
examine it only in connection with the transaction relating to the $200,000 which
is the first item in the particulars. I have already indicated my agreement
with the statement of Freedman J.A. that “implicit in the entire transaction
was the representation of the accused that this was a legitimate bona fide investment
for Brandon Packers Limited to make” and with his view that there was ample
evidence to warrant a finding that this representation was false to the
knowledge of the accused. If it deceived Donaldson, who was still nominally at
least in control of the company, into paying over the $200,000 to Fropak that
would be a fraud on the company. If, on the other hand, it is suggested that
Donaldson was not deceived but paid the money over knowing that the

[Page 1180]

transaction was not bona fide, that
the Fropak shares were worthless and that their purchase was merely a step in a
scheme to enable the accused to buy the shares of Brandon Packers Limited with
his own money, that would simply be to say that Donaldson was particeps
criminis. If all the directors of a company should join in using its funds
to purchase an asset which they knew to be worthless as part of a scheme to
divert those funds to their own use they would, in my opinion, be guilty under
s. 323(1) of defrauding the company of those funds. Even supposing it could be said
that, the directors being “the mind of the company” and well knowing the true
facts, the company was not deceived (a proposition which I should find it
difficult to accept), I think it clear that in the supposed case the directors
would have defrauded the company, if not by deceit or falsehood, by “other
fraudulent means”.

In Cox and Paton the guilt of the accused
rested essentially on the conclusion that the investment of $200,000 in the
shares of Fropak was not a legitimate bona fide investment for Brandon
Packers. It is apparent from the quoted passage that proof of deceit is not
essential to support a conviction under s. 338(1). Where it is alleged that a
corporation has been defrauded by its directors, deception of the corporation
is not an essential element of the offence. The words “other fraudulent means”
in s. 338(1) include means which are not in the nature of a falsehood or a
deceit; they encompass all other means which can properly be stigmatized as
dishonest.

In R. v. Lemire[1], the accused was charged with having
defrauded the public through the submission of fictitious expense accounts. Mr.
Justice Martland, writing for the majority of this Court, dealt with the
argument that no one was deceived by the expense accounts because they did not contain
a detailed list of the expenditures as contemplated by the form used in making
a claim. He said, pp. 185-186: “Whether or not they deceived the people who saw
them, they were the necessary means used to obtain the payments and without

[Page 1181]

them the payments would not have been made. They
were fraudulent.” See also R. v. Renard[2], at p. 358.

In Scott v. Metropolitan Police
Commissioner[3], the
House of Lords held that in the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud,
deceit is not a necessary ingredient, although in a great many cases the fraud
may have been perpetrated by deceit. In the course of his speech, Viscount
Dilhorne, with whom Lord Reid, Lord Simon of Glaisdale and Lord Kilbrandon
agreed, after referring to the Criminal Law Revision Committee’s Eighth Report
on “Theft and Related Offences,” 1966 (Cmnd. 2977) had this to say, at p. 839:

If, as I think, and as the Criminal Law
Revision Committee appears to have thought “fraudulently” means “dishonestly”,
then “to defraud” ordinarily means, in my opinion, to deprive a person
dishonestly of something which is his or of something to which he is or would
or might but for the perpetration of the fraud be entitled.

Lord Diplock spoke to the same effect, at p.
841:

The intended means by which the purpose is
to be achieved must be dishonest. They need not involve fraudulent
misrepresentation such as is needed to constitute the civil tort of deceit.
Dishonesty of any kind is enough.

In the earlier English case of R. v. Sinclair[4], the defendants were charged with
conspiring to cheat and defraud a company, its shareholders and creditors by
fraudulently using its assets for purposes other than those of the company, and
by fraudulently concealing such use. The judge directed the jury as to fraud,
saying, at p. 1249:

To prove fraud it must be established that
the conduct was deliberately dishonest. In the circumstances of this case what
sort of test should be applied as to whether the conduct was dishonest? It is
fraud if it is proved that there was the taking of a risk which there was no
right to take which would cause detriment or prejudice to another.

[Page 1182]

The defendants were convicted and appealed. The
Court of Appeal, in upholding the convictions, had this to say, at p. 1250:

To cheat and defraud is to act with
deliberate dishonesty to the prejudice of another person’s proprietary right.
In the context of this case the alleged conspiracy to cheat and defraud is an
agreement by a director of a company and others dishonestly to take a risk with
the assets of the company by using them in a manner which was known to be not
in the best interests of the company and to be prejudicial to the minority
shareholders.

The general direction as to fraud in the
summing-up commences by stating that to amount to fraud the conduct must be
deliberately dishonest. That is plainly right.

Courts, for good reason, have been loath to
attempt anything in the nature of an exhaustive definition of “defraud” but one
may safely say, upon the authorities, that two elements are essential,
“dishonesty” and “deprivation”. To succeed, the Crown must establish dishonest
deprivation.

Using the assets of the corporation for personal
purposes rather than bona fide for the benefit of the corporation can
constitute dishonesty in a case of alleged fraud by directors of a corporation.
This proposition finds full support in Cox and Paton.

The element of deprivation is satisfied on proof
of detriment, prejudice, or risk of prejudice to the economic interests of the
victim. It is not essential that there be actual economic loss as the outcome
of the fraud. The following passages from the English Court of Appeal judgment
in R. v. Allsop[5] in
my view correctly state the law on the role of economic loss in fraud, at pp.
31, 32:

Generally the primary objective of
fraudsmen is to advantage themselves. The detriment that results to their
victims is secondary to that purpose and incidental. It is “intended” only in
the sense that it is a contemplated outcome of the fraud that is perpetrated.
If the deceit which is employed imperils the economic interest of the person
deceived, this is sufficient to constitute fraud even though in the event no
actual loss is suffered and notwithstanding that the deceiver did not desire to
bring about an actual loss.

[Page 1183]

We see nothing in Lord Diplock’s speech [in
Scott] to suggest a different view. “Economic loss” may be ephemeral and
not lasting, or potential and not actual; but even a threat of financial
prejudice while it exists it may be measured in terms of money . . .

Interests which are imperilled are less
valuable in terms of money than those same interests when they are secure and
protected. Where a person intends by deceit to induce a course of conduct in
another which puts that other’s economic interests in jeopardy he is guilty of
fraud even though he does not intend or desire that actual loss should
ultimately be suffered by that other in this context.

See also R. v. Smith[6]; Welham v. Director of Public
Prosecutions[7] and R.
v. Knelson and Baran[8].

The Facts

One of the dangers in this case is the risk of
being overwhelmed by factual minutiae. Superficially, the facts are
complicated. Stripped of unessential, it is clear what took place. I do not
propose a detailed recital as, in my opinion, the appeal should be allowed and
a new trial ordered, but to answer the question upon which leave to appeal has
been granted it is necessary to sketch the relevant transactions. In late 1971,
when the impugned events took place, Langley’s Limited was a dry-cleaning enterprise, long-established in the
City of Toronto, owning a
substantial portfolio of “blue-chip” securities valued at $1,443,460. The
controlling interest in the company, comprising some 90% of the common shares,
was owned by two estates and an individual represented by a chartered
accountant, Mr. Leonard Johnston. In the autumn of 1971, Mr. Johnston was
approached by one of the accused, Mr. Olan, President of First Montreal
City Corporation Limited, for the purpose of discussing purchase of the
controlling shares. The negotiations which followed led to an agreement under
which the controlling common shares, and certain preferred shares, of Langley’s would be purchased by First
Montreal for approximately $1,485,000 payable in cash. Toward the end of the
negotiations, Mr. Johnston also met the

[Page 1184]

other two accused, Mr. Hudson, President and
Director of Beauport Holdings, and Mr. Hartnett, Vice‑President and
Director of Beauport Holdings and legal adviser to Mr. Hudson. Before the
actual closing, First Montreal assigned all of its rights under the agreement
to Beauport Holdings. Thereafter, Hudson and Hartnett played the dominant
roles, aided in some respects by Olan, who, it was agreed, would receive a
finder’s fee of approximately $67,000 for negotiating the sale. As at November 30, 1971, total current assets of
Beauport Holdings amounted to $149,968.30 and total assets of the company
amounted to $738,966.87. The closing of the purchase of the Langley’s shares was to have taken place on
December 2, 1971, but the purchasers did not then have the money with which to
close. Closing date was postponed.

Mr. Leslie Smith, Manager of a branch of
Toronto-Dominion Bank located in Toronto, testified that in the month of
December, 1971, he had two separate discussions with the three accused
concerning the certification of a cheque in the amount of $1,025,000 to be
drawn on the account of Beauport Holdings in that bank. The account had been
opened on December 8, 1971.
On the first occasion, there were no funds in the account, but Smith was
advised that there was a deposit of $488,000 available and that the balance of
the funds would be deposited later the same day. Smith refused to certify the
cheque, as his modest credit limits of $10,000 unsecured and $20,000 secured did
not permit him to authorize an overdraft in the amount of the shortfall of
$537,000. On the second meeting, the respondents asked for certification of a
$1,025,000 cheque on conditions which proved to be acceptable to Smith. It was
agreed that he would be present at the closing and retain possession of the
cheque until such time as the purchase of Langley’s had been completed, at
which time the accused would take possession of the Langley’s portfolio, sell
the securities, and with the proceeds cause Langley’s to buy another company
they owned.

[Page 1185]

On December 10, 1971, the accused completed,
through Beauport Holdings, the purchase of approximately 90% of the Langley’s common shares; the preferred
shares were purchased later. In satisfaction, the vendors received the
certified cheque for $1,025,000, drawn on the account of Beauport Holdings,
plus $246,545, being the proceeds of a loan from one Orenstein to Beauport
Holdings. Upon payment being tendered, the accused were handed a briefcase
containing all of the stocks and bonds owned by Langley’s. The briefcase was immediately turned over to two representatives
of a brokerage firm who, accompanied by Smith and Hudson, and possibly Olan, went to the office of the brokerage firm where
a cheque in the amount of $500,000 was issued, payable to Langley’s. This cheque represented the
first instalment of the proceeds from sale of the securities.

I should here mention that, prior to the
closing, the respondents Hudson and Hartnett caused to be incorporated, on November
23, 1971, a company under the name of Beauport Financial Corporation Limited,
of which Hartnett became President and Director. Immediately following the
purchase of the Langley’s shares from the former owners on December 10, a
meeting of the new directors of Langley’s, namely Hudson, one Teeter, and one
Joseph, was convened at which four items of business were transacted. The
first, headed “Sale of Securities,” involved the passage of a resolution
authorizing Hudson to sell all
the securities owned by Langley’s.
The actual resolution was preceded by these few words:

The Chairman suggested that in view of
certain plans which he had for the Corporation it would be advisable that its
investment portfolio be liquidated.

The second item authorized the purchase from
Beauport Holdings of 11,000 shares in the capital of Gibraltar Mines Ltd. for
$49,500. The third item involved the purchase from First Montreal of the
outstanding shares of a Quebec
company, Advertising Associates Limited, for $400,000. The final item
authorized Langley’s to
subscribe for 10,000 shares in the capital of Beauport Financial at a price of
$10 per share.

[Page 1186]

Later the same afternoon, at a meeting of the
board of directors of Beauport Financial, attended by Hartnett and Teeter, it
was explained that when the Corporation was organized it was intended to be a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Langley’s. A resolution was passed authorizing issuance to Langley’s of up to a maximum of 99,997
shares of Beauport Financial at a price of $10 per share. Another resolution
was passed authorizing the officers of the corporation to make loans to
Beauport Holdings. By the end of the day Langley’s had become a subsidiary of Beauport Holdings and Beauport
Financial had become a subsidiary of Langley’s. Beauport Holdings thus became the top company in the corporate
structure.

The money used by Beauport Holdings to take over
Langley’s, according to
Hartnett, came from:

—a deposit of $88,000 into the account of
Beauport Holdings,

—a loan of $400,000 from Hudson,

—a loan of $400,000 from First Montreal,

—a loan of $100,000 from Beauport
Financial,

—the sale of 11,000 shares of Gibraltar
Mines by Beauport Holdings to Langley’s for $49,500.

These monies were sufficient to meet the
certified cheque for $1,025,000. Additionally, there was the loan from
Orenstein.

In response to a demand for particulars the
Crown alleged that the $1,190,000 referred to in the charge was made up as
follows:

(1) Payment by Langley’s Limited to the
First Montreal City Corporation on or about December 10, 1971, in the amount of
four hundred thousand dollars ($400,000.00);

(2) Payment by Langley’s Limited to
Beauport Financial Corporation Limited on or about December 10, 1971, in the
amount of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00);

(3) Payment by Langley’s Limited to
Beauport Financial Corporation Limited on or about December 14, 1971, in the
amount of two hundred and ninety thousand dollars ($290,000.00);

(4) Payment by Langley’s Limited to Beauport Financial Corporation Limited on or about
December 27,

[Page 1187]

1971, in the amount of four hundred
thousand dollars ($400,000.00).

The purchase of the shares of Advertising
Associates no longer seems to be regarded by the Crown as being the subject of
fraudulent acquisition. The case, therefore, turns on items (2), (3), and (4).
Item (2) refers to the share subscription by Langley’s for shares in Beauport Financial. Item (3) arose in these
circumstances. On December 14, 1971, the sum of $290,000 was paid by Langley’s to Beauport Financial and a like sum was paid by Beauport
Financial to First Montreal. At trial, it was common ground that the price paid
by Langley’s for the shares of
Advertising Associates had been later reduced to $350,000 from $400,000. Olan,
through First Montreal, had earlier purchased the shares of Advertising
Associates for $300,000, with a $10,000 deposit It was the Crown’s contention
that the $290,000 paid by Langley’s to Beauport Financial to First Montreal on
December 14 was in payment of the Advertising Associates’ shares and that the
$400,000 paid by Langley’s to First Montreal on December 10, following sale of
the Langley’s portfolio, and loaned on the same day by First Montreal to
Beauport Holdings, was for the purpose of putting Beauport Holdings in funds wherewith
to complete the purchase of the Langley’s shares and not in payment of the
shares of Advertising Associates. Item (4) relates to the repayment out of
funds originating in Langley’s
of the loan of $400,000 by Hudson to Beauport Holdings. As a result of transactions (2), (3) and (4),
Beauport Financial received from Langley’s the sum of $790,000 which it in turn loaned to Beauport Holdings
enabling Beauport Holdings to complete the purchase of Langley’s.

The conflict in this case is essentially very
narrow. It centres simply on whether there was evidence upon which a jury
properly instructed could find beyond reasonable doubt that Langley’s suffered deprivation from
dishonest action of respondents. To show this narrowness of the dis-

[Page 1188]

pute, it is necessary only to quote the argument
of the accused respondents. First, the respondent Hartnett:

73. It is respectfully submitted that the
Crown failed to prove any deprivation of Langley’s. The respondent does not take issue with the appellant’s submission
that economic loss is not a necessary ingredient in the offence of fraud. It is
respectfully submitted, however, that in a case where no economic loss is
shown, the Crown must establish other facts to show that the victim of a fraud
was dishonestly deprived of something. The evidence adduced in the present case
does not establish such deprivation. The appellant says deprivation was shown
in two ways. First, it submits that corporate assets were used for personal
purposes and were therefore not available for corporate purposes such as other
investments or maintaining a stable financial base. It is submitted that in
fact, the Crown proved at trial that Langley’s portfolio had been turned into other investments and that at the
date of those investments, there was no evidence that such investments would
fail to provide a stable financial base.

Secondly, the appellant has submitted that
deprivation was shown in that the corporate assets were put at risk. The risk
taken, according to the appellant arose from the exchange of $1,190,000.00 in
liquid assets for $49,500.00 worth of Gibraltar shares, $350,000.00 of
Advertising Associates shares and $790,000.00 of shares of Beauport Financial.
The evidence shows that the shares of Gibraltar and Advertising Associates were
valuable assets. Further, the evidence establishes that the purchase of
$790,000.00 worth of shares in Beauport Financial and Beauport Financial’s loan
of $790,000.00 to Beauport Holdings were proper business transactions and that
at the time of the loan from Beauport Financial to Beauport Holdings, Beauport
Holdings had substantial assets sufficient to cover the amount of the loan.

Next, the respondent Hudson:

16. Consistent with its application of Cox
and Paton v. The Queen to the facts of this case the Court of Appeal
for Ontario held that the Crown in the case at bar had failed to satisfy the
onus on it of showing the dubious nature of the promissory notes given to
Beauport Financial, and further held that there was no evidence to go to the jury
from which they could conclude that the value of those notes was so tenuous and
illusory as to taint the whole transaction with fraud.

17. At the very best, even on the test
proposed by the appellant some prejudice or risk of prejudice must be conclusively
provided in order to result in a finding of

[Page 1189]

dishonesty. When a charge arises in
circumstances where all the directors of the corporation are said to have
defrauded the corporation there must be proof that the corporation was deprived
of something to which it was entitled without having obtained something in
return which could be reasonably regarded as quid pro quo.

The issues are whether the $790,000 of
Langley’s’ assets used to purchase shares in Beauport Financial were expended
in furtherance of the bona fide business interests of Langley’s, or
expended in advancing the personal interests of the accused, and whether
Langley’s suffered deprivation, in the sense described above, as a result of
this action. There can be no doubt that the purchase of the controlling block
of Langley’s shares could not
have been effected without utilization of the Langley’s’ portfolio. But this is not decisive. Beauport Holdings would
appear to have contributed from its own assets the sum of $88,000, plus the shares
of Gibraltar Mines worth $49,500. Again, this is not decisive. The question is
whether there was evidence that the accused dishonestly deprived Langley’s for personal ends. Was the
investment of $790,000 by Langley’s in its subsidiary, Beauport Financial, with that money to be
loaned by Beauport Financial to Beauport Holdings to enable Beauport Holdings
to acquire control of Langley’s,
a legitimate investment for Langley’s to make? Did this investment cause detriment, prejudice, or risk
of prejudice to Langley’s?

The principal asset, indeed almost the only
asset, of Beauport Financial was the indebtedness to it of Beauport Holdings.
Therefore, the worth of the investment by Langley’s in Beauport Financial is determined by the ability of the
ultimate recipient of the funds, Beauport Holdings, to repay the moneys loaned.
It should be noted that this loan was by way of unsecured demand notes. The
issue thus resolves into an examination of the ability of Beauport Holdings to
repay on demand the loan of $790,000 made to it by Beauport Financial.

It was not necessary for the Crown to establish
that the investment in Beauport Financial was “worthless”, to use the term of
Cartwright J. in Cox and Paton, or of “negligible worth”, to use

[Page 1190]

the words of Freedman J.A. in the same case. I
do not think that Cartwright J. intended to lay down the proposition that in
order to sustain a charge of fraud, it must be shown that the victim of the
fraud was caused to exchange something of worth for something entirely without
worth. On the evidence in Cox and Paton, it was open to the jury to
conclude, in the opinion of Cartwright J., that Fropak Limited had no assets of
any value. In that case, the detriment was plain and entire. The question to be
determined in each case is rather whether there was deprivation caused in
furtherance of personal ends. The Crown contends that the case of Cox and
Paton and the case at bar are on all fours, that there are minor points of
difference, but essentially the cases are symmetrical. In Cox and Paton, the
victim, Brandon Packers, was caused to buy shares of Fropak, a company revived
for the purpose of the transaction, which loaned the funds to the private
companies of the accused, enabling those companies to purchase the controlling
shares of Brandon Packers. In the case at bar, the alleged victim, Langley’s,
was caused to buy shares in Beauport Financial, a company incorporated for the
purpose of the transaction, which loaned funds to Beauport Holdings, with which
at least two of the accused were closely associated, enabling Beauport Holdings
to purchase the controlling shares of Langley’s. In Cox and Paton, it
was open to the jury to find that the promissory notes given by the two
personal holding companies of the accused to Fropak were of little or no worth.
Yet those companies would appear to have ended up with the shares earlier owned
by Donaldson and, to that extent, could not be said to be worthless. In the
present case, Beauport Holdings ended up with the controlling shares of Langley’s. To that extent, there is a
further similarity in the two cases.

In Cox and Paton, there was evidence that
the covenant to repay given by the personal corporations was of little value.
In the case at bar, the ability of Beauport Holdings to repay on demand a loan
in the amount of $790,000 is the critical issue. Ability to repay is not
determined by asset value alone, but rather by an appraisal of the entire
financial position of the debtor, including both

[Page 1191]

assets and liabilities. As we are here concerned
with a demand loan, the relationship between current assets and current
liabilities is of particular importance.

The jury had before it, as Exhibit 3, the
audited balance sheet of Beauport Holdings as at December 31, 1971 which showed, as at that
date, current assets of $16,953 and current liabilities of $1,164,415. The
asset side of the balance sheet consisted of (i) the current assets ($16,953);
(ii) an investment, being the down-payment on an option to purchase the shares
of another company ($250,000); (iii) the investment in Langley’s ($1,378,810);
(iv) mining claims situated in the Northwest Territories ($250,000); (v)
deferred pre-production expenditures ($19,691), and (vi) organization expenses
($4,613). The current liabilities of $1,164,415 included the demand notes
payable to Beauport Financial ($793,205) and the Orenstein note payable
February 8, 1972 ($250,000). Included also under liabilities were shareholders
equity represented by capital stock ($805,648), contingency reserve ($12,500)
and deficit ($62,496). According to the financial statement, Beauport Holdings
sustained a net operating loss during the nine months ended December 31, 1971 in the amount of $278,020.
Current liabilities exceeded current assets by $1,147,462. It was open to the
jury faced with this evidence, and with no evidence that the value of the
mining claims exceeded book value, to find that the net worth of Beauport
Holdings was such that it would have been quite impossible for the company to
have repaid on demand the loan of $790,000, or even any substantial part of
this amount. It was thus open to the jury to find that the investment of
$790,000 in the shares of Beauport Financial was made to the clear detriment of
Langley’s. It was open to the
jury to ask this question—what possible legitimate business reason could have
prompted the disposal by Langley’s of a portfolio of high quality securities
and, in effect, the substitution therefor, as to $790,000, of unsecured demand
promissory notes of a company with a working capital deficit of over $1,100,000
and over which company Langley’s had no control?

[Page 1192]

There is further evidence which bears upon
Beauport Holdings’ ability to repay. The resolution passed by the Board of
Beauport Financial, authorizing loans to Beauport Holdings, and the discussion
which preceded it, read as follows:

Loan to Beauport Holdings Limited

The chairman then presented an application
of Beauport Holdings Limited for a line of credit and loans from this
Corporation. Unaudited financial statements of Beauport Holdings Limited, one
immediately before and one immediately after the acquisition of 13,453 shares
of common stock of Langley’s
Limited were presented and examined. It was pointed out that Beauport Holdings
Limited now owns approximately 90% of the voting stock of Langley’s Limited and
Langley’s Limited in turn owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of this
Corporation. There followed a lengthy discussion particularly as to how
Beauport Holdings Limited proposes to repay any loans to it by this
Corporation. It was pointed out that the 13,453 common shares of Langley’s
Limited will be free and clear when Beauport Holdings pays the loan from
Charles Orenstein In Trust in full; that a loan from a bank at a lower interest
rate is probably feasible with said 13,453 shares as collateral because
Langley’s Limited owns valuable real property free and clear of any liens and
in view of the earning power of Langley’s Limited. As an alternative Langley’s Limited can declare substantial
dividends to its stockholders the proceeds of which can be used by Beauport
Holdings Limited to pay its indebtedness to this Corporation. Mr. Hartnett
pointed out that he is a director of Beauport Holdings Limited and therefore
disqualified himself from voting. Upon motion duly made and seconded, it was
unanimously:

RESOLVED that the officers of this
Corporation be and they hereby are authorized, from time to time, to make loans
in such amounts and on such terms as they deem to be in the best interest of the
Corporation to Beauport Holdings Limited.

It was open to the jury to find to be false the
statement that the 13,453 common shares of Langley’s Limited would be free and clear when Beauport Holdings paid the
loan from Charles Orenstein In Trust in full. At the date of the meeting
Beauport Holdings was also in debt to Hudson in the amount of $400,000 and in debt to First Montreal City
Corporation in the amount of $400,000. Equally, it was open to the jury to find

[Page 1193]

in the quoted passage, expressing the views of
the participants themselves, cogent evidence of the kind of assets Langley’s acquired in substitution for its
investment in high quality marketable securities. It would appear that, when
the loans were made, the only way in which those controlling Beauport Financial
could see Beauport Holdings fulfilling its loan obligation, owed in substance
to Langley’s, was either in effect (i) by mortgaging the property and business
of Langley’s itself, or (ii) by Langley’s paying the money to itself by
declaring a dividend to Beauport Holdings which would then pay Beauport
Financial which would then pay Langley’s. On this evidence, it seems to me that
a jury could find that the loan was other than a stable, secure and bona
fide investment for Langley’s.
If Langley’s should have
encountered financial difficulties, it should have been able to call in the
loan immediately for an injection of additional working capital. Before the
accused came into the picture, with its portfolio intact, a substantial fund of
liquid assets was available to Langley’s. The loan to Beauport Holdings could only be realized by Langley’s placing its own property at risk,
or paying itself money which it clearly would not have in a situation of
financial difficulty. In short, in my opinion, it was open to a jury to find
that the exchange of the portfolio for the loan was something other than a quid
pro quo.

I wish to turn now to the judgment of the Court
of Appeal for Ontario. That
Court was of the view that Cox and Paton v. The Queen was
distinguishable on a number of grounds. Briefly these were: (i) for its cash
assets, Brandon Packers obtained shares whose value was negligible; (ii)
implicit in the transaction was the representation that the investment in
shares of Fropak was a legitimate bona fide investment for Brandon
Packers to make; (iii) the two private companies of Cox and of Paton, which
obtained the shares of Brandon Packers, gave promissory notes to Fropak to
repay Fropak for moneys advanced to the two companies to buy the controlling
shares of Brandon Packers from Donaldson; (iv) in Cox and Paton it was
the Crown’s theory at trial that Brandon Packers had made loans to companies
controlled by Cox and

[Page 1194]

Paton which were not only unauthorized, but
without any intention that they should be repaid; in the instant case, not only
was there abundant evidence of authorization but, also, there was no evidence
that the accused did not intend that Beauport Holdings should repay to Beauport
Financial the loans which had been made to Beauport Holdings; (v) in Cox and
Paton the Crown alleged that the accused had caused Brandon Packers to pay
$208,750 in alleged management fees for negligible services.

Point (i) refers to value, as to which I will
have more to say in a moment. With respect, point (ii) is not distinguishing,
as implicit in the case at bar is the representation that the investment by
Langley’s in Beauport Financial and the loan by Beauport Financial to Beauport
Holdings of the moneys so invested was a legitimate bona fide investment
for Langley’s to make. In the minute book itself, appears the statement that
this investment would be advisable “in view of certain plans which he [the
Chairman—Hudson] had for the
Corporation”. But that is all that appears. The evidence is silent as to
justification. Why was it a legitimate bona fide investment? What was
the reason for liquidating Langley’s portfolio? In my opinion, it was proper for the judge at trial to
leave it to the jury to decide whether the respondents honestly believed that
the disposal of the portfolio and re-investment of the proceeds was in the best
interests of Langley’s. Point
(iii), in my opinion, does not raise any distinguishing feature. In the instant
case, Beauport Holdings (of which Hudson and Hartnett were President and Vice‑President,
respectively), gave promissory notes to Beauport Financial (Fropak in the Cox
and Paton case) to “repay” (the word used by the Court of Appeal for Ontario) Beauport Financial for moneys
advanced to Beauport Holdings to buy the controlling shares of Langley’s. Point (iv) raises the question
of intention to repay. In Cox and Paton, this Court did not find it
necessary to deal with the point. In any event, an intention to repay has never
been of avail in the past in negating fraud if the conduct of the accused is
otherwise shown to involve dishonest deprivation for personal ends. An
intention to repay might, at most, be relevant at sentencing. Point (v) also,
in my view, fails to distinguish. It

[Page 1195]

may have been an aggravating feature in Cox
and Paton, but as noted in the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario
in the case at bar, the Court of Appeal in the Cox and Paton case did
not find it necessary to pass upon the question of whether the evidence was
sufficient to justify the theory of the Crown in respect of the management
fees.

After discussing the points which, in his
opinion, distinguished this case from Cox and Paton, Mr. Justice
Arnup, writing for the Court, accurately stated the question to be answered by
that Court, as follows:

…was there evidence of an intention by the
appellants to cheat Langley’s,
and to transfer for fraudulent purposes the liquid investment portfolio of Langley’s for the benefit of the
appellants?

To answer that question, the Court of Appeal
considered it necessary to make some examination, as I have attempted to do, of
the financial position of Beauport Holdings. In doing so, the Court first
rejected the proposition advanced by counsel for Hudson, that having regard to the financial statement of Beauport Holdings
before the transaction took place, it was in a position to purchase, for the
price which was paid, the shares of Langley’s. The Court then conceded that “undoubtedly the investment,
indirect as it was, in Beauport Holdings was much more speculative than the
shares sold out of the investment portfolio of Langley’s”. If that is so, it would seem to me to go some considerable
distance in supporting the contentions of the Crown that it was proper to leave
the case to the jury. Where there was this sort of evidence and no evidence in
justification, the question of whether the exchange of a secure investment for
one “much more speculative”, constituted detriment in the circumstances was one
for the jury alone to answer.

The Ontario Court of Appeal made three findings:
(i) in no way could it be said that the assets of Beauport Holdings were
worthless, or even of negligible value; (ii) its assets were of substantial
value; (iii) there was no evidence fit to go to the jury that the value of the
asset was so tenuous and illusory as to taint the whole transaction with fraud.
In my opinion, with great respect, the Court

[Page 1196]

of Appeal erred in these findings. First, it
erred in law in applying a test of “worthless” or “negligible”. The proper
question was whether there was detriment or prejudice to Langley’s. Second, it erred in its
assessment of the asset position of Beauport Holdings which, apart from the Langley’s shares, consisted of a $250,000
deposit, committed to another project, and some mining claims. None of those
assets could be regarded as a current asset readily available for payment of a
demand loan. Third, it erred in ignoring the liability position of Beauport
Holdings and, in particular, the current liabilities which exceeded $1,160,000.
In assessing ability to pay, the liabilities of the debtor are of equal or
perhaps greater importance than the assets.

In my opinion, in answer to the question of law
referred to this Court, the Court of Appeal for Ontario erred in holding that there was no evidence of fraud to go to the
jury and in its consideration of the applicability and scope of the principles
of law in Cox and Paton v. The Queen as they related to each
accused. In my view, there was evidence to be left to the jury as to each of
the accused.

Although not raised in any of the factums, an
oral argument was advanced to the effect that this Court lacked jurisdiction to
hear the present appeal because, as I understand the argument, we were
concerned only with sufficiency of evidence and sufficiency of evidence raises
only a question of fact, not appealable to this Court. In my view, the Court
has jurisdiction. The question is not one of sufficiency of evidence but
whether there is any evidence to go to the jury. This is a question of law: see
R. v. McKay[9]. In
the present case, the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal reads in part:

As I have indicated, it is our conclusion
that at the end of the Crown’s case the trial Judge ought to have ruled that
there was no evidence to go to the jury on

[Page 1197]

Count 1, and should have directed the jury
that they were to bring in a verdict of not guilty on all three counts of the
indictment and not merely counts 2 and 3.

Additionally, it is the duty of this Court to
give the judgment which the Court below should have given.

I would accordingly allow the appeal, set aside
the judgment of the Court of Appeal and direct a new trial. Apart from the
issue here under consideration, the Court of Appeal found errors in the trial
judge’s charge to the jury warranting a new trial. Leave to appeal to this
Court was limited to the one issue set forth earlier in these reasons. The
other issues which, in the opinion of the Court of Appeal, warranted a new
trial, were not canvassed before this Court.

Appeal allowed, new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Evidence—Cross-examining on
previous convictions—Admissions by witness—Leave to question the accused on his
record as a juvenile delinquent—Judge’s charge to jury—Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. 34, ss. 306, 593, 609—Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10,
s. 12—Juvenile Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. J-3, ss. 3, 20(1), 26, 38.

Appellant, aged 19, was found guilty by the
Court of Queen’s Bench, Criminal Side, for the district of Montreal, consisting
of a judge and jury, on a charge of breaking and entering with intent (s. 306  Cr.C .).
He appealed to the Court of Appeal on the ground that the trial judge erred by
allowing evidence of the cross-examination of appellant, in which he
contradicted the evidence he had given in chief and admitted having been found
guilty, under the Juvenile Delinquents Act, of offences, under the Criminal
Code . The Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction; hence the appeal to this
Court.

Held (Laskin C.J.
and Spence, Dickson and Estey JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and Pratte JJ.: Under s. 12 of the Canada
Evidence Act  and s. 593  Cr.C ., the trial judge properly allowed
in evidence the cross‑examination of the appellant upon his record as a
juvenile delinquent. The word “offence” as used in s. 12(1)  of the Canada
Evidence Act  includes a delinquency consisting in a violation of the Criminal
Code  which is enforceable under the Juvenile Delinquents Act, and a
finding of delinquency under this Act is equivalent to a conviction within the
meaning of s. 12  of the Canada Evidence Act . The right to
cross-examine a witness with the view of establishing the falsity of the
evidence-in-chief should not be less absolute in the case of a former juvenile
delinquent than in other cases. The admissions of the appellant during his
cross-examination constitute sufficient proof of the delinquencies of which he
was found guilty under the Juvenile Delinquents Act, with-

[Page 406]

out it being necessary to produce the
official record. Moreover, nothing in the pre‑sentencing report furnished
to the trial judge indicated that these admissions were erroneous; this report
in fact related to the penalties imposed on the appellant rather than to the
findings of guilty made against him.

Further, so far as s. 593  Cr.C . is
concerned, the appellant put his character in issue when he stated that he had
never been convicted nor arrested; it was open to the Crown to contradict this
proof of good character by proof of prior convictions.

So far as the judge’s charge to the jury is
concerned, even if the judge erred in stating that the appellant lied when he
denied any previous arrest, this error, in the circumstances of the case, had
no influence on the jury’s decision not to believe the appellant.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Estey JJ., dissenting: By telling the jury
that the accused had lied when he stated that he had never been arrested, the
trial judge committed an error justifying a new trial. The record contained no
evidence of an arrest. Even if it was concluded that the appellant had
committed delinquencies as a juvenile delinquent, the Juvenile Delinquents
Act does not allow such findings to be treated as convictions that can be
proved in evidence under s. 593  Cr.C . A finding of juvenile
delinquency under the Juvenile Delinquents Act is not equivalent to a
conviction under the Criminal Code .

APPEAL against a decision of the Court of
Appeal of Quebec[1] affirming a guilty
verdict handed down by a jury. Appeal dismissed, Laskin C.J. and Spence,
Dickson and Estey JJ. dissenting.

Peter M. Gold, for the appellant.

Henry Keyserlingk, for the respondent.

The judgment of Chief Justice Laskin and Spence,
Dickson and Estey JJ. was delivered by

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Province of Quebec pronounced
on the 17th of March 1975 by which judgment the said Court of Appeal dismissed
an appeal from the conviction of the appellant after the verdict of a jury on
the charge that he did

TO WIT: Phillip MORRIS à MONTREAL district
MONTREAL on or about June 10th 1973, did unlawfully break and enter a place
other than a dwelling house, to wit: a building situated at 6665 Saint-Jacques
West, the property of K-Tel International Ltd., with intent to commit an
indictable offence therein, committing thereby an indictable offence, according
to section 306 -1 -a-e of the Criminal Code , against the form of the Statute
in such case made and provided and against the Peace of Our Sovereign Majesty
the Queen, Elizabeth the Second, Her Crown and Dignity.

Dated August 7, 1973.

The appellant was actually apprehended as he
climbed out of a window of the subject premises in an attempt to leave them.
Section 306(2)  of the Criminal Code  provides:

(2) For the purposes of proceedings under
this section, evidence that an accused

(a) broke and entered a place
is, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, proof that he broke and
entered with intent to commit an indictable offence therein; or

(b) broke out of a place is,
in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, proof that he broke out after

(i) committing an indictable offence
therein, or

(ii) entering with intent to commit an
indictable offence therein.

[Page 408]

Undoubtedly, in view of this provision and the
above recited circumstance, counsel for the appellant called the appellant to
give evidence. Normally, it would be expected that under such circumstances,
the appellant would have very considerable difficulty in adducing evidence
which would raise any reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury. There were,
however, in the evidence adduced, a considerable number of facts which made it
possible that the appellant’s excuse for entry into the premises, i.e., that he
had merely been seeking shelter from a heavy rainstorm and had unwittingly
locked himself in the premises, might raise a considerable doubt. Therefore, as
the learned trial judge, Hugessen A.C.J., said, in his charge to the jury:

…but it’s going to come down to your
assessment of the credibility of the accused.

The appellant was nineteen years of age at the
date of the alleged offence and the time of the trial. So soon as counsel for
the appellant called that appellant as a witness, the following questions and
answers were put:

Q. Mr. Phillip Morris, have you ever
been convicted of a criminal offense?

A. No. None whatsoever.

Q. Have you ever been arrested before?

A. No.

Q. This is the first time?

A. Yes.

Q. This incident?

A. Yes.

After the appellant had given evidence-in-chief,
he was cross-examined and at a certain point counsel for the Crown interrupted
his examination, requested that the jury be excused, and then applied for the
right to cross-examine the appellant upon his alleged record as a juvenile.
After considerable argument, the learned trial judge ruled:

…so I’m prepared to admit,
Mr. Keyserlingk, the question, or a series of questions if necessary, with
regard to any conviction of the accused of an offence described in the Juvenile
Delinquents Act. You can call the Jury back.

The following cross-examination of the appellant
then took place:

[Page 409]

Q. Mr. Morris, you’ve mentioned to the
Members of the Jury that you had never been previously arrested or convicted of
any offence whatsoever. Is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Is it not a fact that in nineteen
sixty-three, before the Juvenile Court, you were charged with and found guilty
of attempted theft?

A. I don’t remember.

Q. Is it not true that in nineteen
sixty-nine you were charged again before the Juvenile Court, convicted of
damages to third party’s property, causing damages?

A. I don’t remember exactly.

Q. O.K., do you remember if in nineteen
seventy you were charged with and found guilty of theft and illegal possession,
in nineteen seventy?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you remember if in nineteen
seventy-two, before the Juvenile Court, that you were found guilty of breaking
and entering?

A. Guilty.

Q. You were found guilty in nineteen
seventy-two. Is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. That would have been at the age of
eighteen… seventeen?

A. Seventeen.

Upon the conclusion of the evidence, the learned
trial judge charged the jury in what was, with respect, a remarkably correct
yet brief charge referring to the question of the record in the following
terms:

Now, just before terminating, I’d like to
say one word about the accused’s record, which was brought up too. First of
all, it seems quite clear to me that in his evidence in chief, the accused
lied. When he started out, the very first thing he said was that he had never
been convicted. He had never been arrested. You can draw what conclusions you
like from that. You may choose to think that he was frightened, didn’t want to
bring out before you the fact that he’d been in trouble with the police before,
as a juvenile. You may choose to think that he felt that his record as a
juvenile was not important or wasn’t covered by what was asked of him. You may
also choose to think that even if he deliberately lied on that subject, that
what he told you in the rest of his testimony was the truth. You’re the entire
Judges of this. It would equally be within your realm, in your

[Page 410]

power, to come to the conclusion that
having lied to you on this matter, which you may think is important, that the
rest of his story is pretty doubtful. That’s your decision to make. The only
thing I would ask you to do, and I’m sure that your common sense will tell you
this, I would ask you to be very careful not to convict the accused simply
because he’s been convicted before. Our whole system proceeds on the basis that
a man pays his debt to society when he’s convicted, and when he comes back into
society, that debt is paid and he’s not made to pay it twice or three times or
four times. So you can take that record of his into account when you’re
assessing his credibility, and you may feel it’s a great importance, but I
would not want you to convict a man simply because he has previously been
convicted.

The jury rendered a verdict of guilty and the
learned trial judge, after hearing representations as to sentence, to which I
shall refer hereafter, sentenced the appellant to three months’ suspended
sentence to the 3rd of May 1974
and required him to report to a probation officer every two weeks together with
other terms of probation.

The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal
for the Province of Quebec and
his appeal was dismissed as I have outlined.

Leave to appeal to this Court was granted by the
order of the Court pronounced on the 21st of June 1975. Although that order was general, the only issue argued before this
Court was as to the propriety of permitting the cross-examination of the
appellant upon his alleged record, as I have recited it aforesaid, and also the
propriety of the learned trial judge’s charge to the jury upon that topic. I
have come to the conclusion that the conviction cannot stand.

In the first place, it was said that the
accused, the present appellant, lied when he swore that he had never been
arrested. I have quoted the learned trial judge’s charge thereon and I
emphasize again the words:

First of all, it seems quite clear to me
that in his evidence in chief, the accused lied. When he started out, the very
first thing he said was that he had never been convicted. He had never
been arrested.

(The underlining is my own.)

[Page 411]

I deal first with the statement that the
appellant lied when he said he had never been arrested. It will be seen that
the appellant did state quite plainly in examination-in-chief that he had never
been arrested. Then, in cross-examination by Crown counsel, the appellant
affirmed that he had made that statement. In subsequent cross-examination, the
accused appears to have admitted that he had been “convicted”, a subject on
which I shall comment later, but he was never again asked if he had been
arrested. So that at the close of the trial, the only evidence as to whether or
not the accused had been arrested, as distinguished from convicted, was his own
statement that he had not been arrested. There is nothing impossible in such a
situation. The acts with which the appellant was charged (I am using the most
indefinite word intentionally) were of a minor nature in the case of a juvenile
and it is quite within the realm of possibility that he should have been
summonsed to appear before the Juvenile Court judge, but not arrested, or even
brought before the Juvenile Court by his father who seems to have been always
present. Therefore, in so far as the learned trial judge expressed to the jury
the opinion that the accused had lied when he said he had never been arrested,
such charge was plainly incorrect. The only evidence before the court was his
own, in chief, that he had not been so arrested. The matter is important
because when the learned trial judge reported to the Court of Appeal dealing
with his subsequent discovery of the facts in reference to the so-called
record, he said:

If this fact had been made known to me while
the case was still in the hands of the jury, I might have taken a different
attitude although I do not think so. In my view the accused had opened the door
to evidence of his bad character by attempting to lead evidence of good
character and the jury were entitled to know that he had perjured himself in
his evidence in chief when he stated that he had never been arrested.

Even if there had been no virtue in the balance
of the argument to this Court by counsel for the appellant, I would have felt
that this fault was sufficient to have required a new trial.

Secondly, even presuming that there had been no
reference in either the examination-in-chief or

[Page 412]

the cross-examination, or in the charge to the
jury, to arrest, I am of the opinion that the reference to the so-called
“convictions” of the appellant, when he was a juvenile, was in error and was a
fatal fault.

It is quite evident that when counsel for the
Crown cross-examined the accused, the present appellant, he must have had
before him a statement of the accused’s juvenile record. Such a document was
not tendered to the court at that time because of the accused’s apparent
agreement with the allegations made by Crown counsel that he had on various
occasions been “convicted”. Upon sentence, however, counsel for the Crown
produced a document which was marked as Ex. S-1, which purports to be a record
signed by “A.M. Racine, Acting Clerk, Social Welfare
 Court” which reads as follows:

It will be noted that as to the former offences
set out on this so-called record, there are no convictions registered. In the
first, third and fourth, the disposition would appear to be sine die adjournment,
and in the second, the accused had been placed in a boys’ farm and training
school on the 8th of May 1967 but on the 12th of August 1968

[Page 413]

that placement had been cancelled. Again, there
is nothing surprising as to this disposition. Section 16 of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. J-3, provides:

16. The
court may postpone or adjourn the hearing of a charge of delinquency for such
period or periods as the court may deem advisable, or may postpone or adjourn
the hearing sine die.

Counsel were agreed that a sine die adjournment
was a frequent method of disposition in the juvenile court. Despite this fact,
counsel for the Crown, in his cross-examination, which I have quoted above, on
several occasions, put to the accused the question “you were charged with and
found guilty” and undoubtedly left the impression with everyone in the
courtroom that he was having the accused admit the convictions.

The accused, the present appellant, was then
nineteen years of age and there is no reason to believe that he was
sufficiently versed in court procedure to know and appreciate that he had not
been convicted but that the court had merely adjourned the disposition of the
case to a day unstated. I do not think that one may rely on this ground of
admission at all in the light of the statement in Ex. S-1 over the signature of
the Clerk and I am of the opinion that that Ex. S-l was part of the record
properly before the Court of Appeal and should have been considered on the
appeal. For this reason alone, I would be of the opinion that the conviction
could not stand.

It is the submission of counsel for the
appellant that even if the appellant’s admission on cross-examination had been
correct and that he had been found guilty of various acts of juvenile
delinquency those facts could not be proved against him as convictions. The
learned trial judge, in permitting the cross-examination, relied on s. 593 
of the Criminal code  which provides:

593. Where,
at a trial, the accused adduces evidence of his good character the prosecutor
may, in answer thereto, before a verdict is returned, adduce evidence of the
previous conviction of the accused for any offences,

[Page 414]

including any previous conviction by reason
of which a greater punishment may be imposed.

and also on s. 12 of the Canada Evidence
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10, which provides:

12. (1) A
witness may be questioned as to whether he has been convicted of any offence,
and upon being so questioned, if he either denies the fact or refuses to
answer, the opposite party may prove such conviction.

(2) The conviction may be proved by
producing

(a) a certificate containing
the substance and effect only, omitting the formal part, of the indictment and
conviction, if it is for an indictable offence, or a copy of the summary
conviction, if for an offence punishable upon summary conviction, purporting to
be signed by the clerk of the court or other officer having the custody of the
records of the court in which the conviction, if upon indictment, was had, or
to which the conviction, if summary, was returned; and

(b) proof of identity.

The Criminal Code  section provides
that when at trial the accused adduces evidence of good character, the
prosecutor may adduce evidence of previous conviction of the accused for
any offence. (The underlining is my own.) Section 12  of the Canada
Evidence Act  permits a witness to be questioned as to whether he had been convicted
of any offence. (The underlining is my own.)

Counsel for the Crown submitted very forcefully
that when the accused, here appellant, had given the evidence-in-chief, which I
have recited above, he had put his character in issue and brought himself
exactly within s. 593 . There are three decisions of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario upon this subject: R.
v. MacDonald[2]; R.
v. St. Pierre[3] and
R. v. Merolla, decided on the 19th of April 1974. I have not the report
of the latter case but it is cited and discussed in MacDonald where
Arnup J.A. adopted Dubin J.A. in St. Pierre. There,

[Page 415]

dealing with a case where counsel for the
accused led in chief evidence of prior convictions and had been stopped by the
learned trial judge, he stated:

I do not think that by responding to those
questions which are put to the accused for admittedly tactical reasons it can
be said that he has put his character in issue. His questions and answers with
respect to his past criminal record should be viewed in the same light as if
they were brought out in cross-examination.

Of course, as Arnup J.A. pointed out, if the
answers should be considered as if they had been brought out in
cross-examination, then the learned trial judge would have had to have warned
the jury that they could be considered only on the question of credibility and
not as character evidence. Whether or not the circumstance that the questions
as to record were put first in examination in chief rather than later by the
Crown in cross-examination has the effect ascribed by Arnup J.A. and Dubin J.A.
in the cases cited, I am still of the opinion that when the questions are put
to the accused, as distinguished from any witness, which R. v. Bradbury[4], was concerned with, then what may
be adduced in reply thereto is governed by the provisions of s. 593  of the
Criminal Code  and, in plain words, that section permits only proof
of convictions. As I have said, here, in fact, there were no convictions nor
any findings of guilt of delinquency, but, even if there had been the latter, I
am of the opinion that such findings could not be considered as “convictions”
within s. 593 .

The Juvenile Delinquents Act, in
s. 3, provides:

3. (1) The
commission by a child of any of the acts enumerated in the definition “juvenile
delinquent” in subsection 2(1), constitutes an offence to be known as a delinquency,
and shall be dealt with as hereinafter provided.

(2) Where a child is adjudged to have
committed a delinquency he shall be dealt with, not as an offender, but as one
in a condition of delinquency and therefore requiring help and guidance and proper
supervision.

[Page 416]

Section 20(1) of the same statute sets out in
exact detail the power of the court when a child is “adjudged to be a juvenile
delinquent”. The section provides:

20. (1) In
the case of a child adjudged to be a juvenile delinquent the court may, in its
discretion, take either one or more of the several courses of action
hereinafter in this section set out, as it may in its judgment deem proper
in the circumstances of the case:

(a) suspend final
disposition;

(b) adjourn the hearing or
disposition of the case from time to time for any definite or indefinite
period;

(c) impose a fine not exceeding
twenty-five dollars, which may be paid in periodical amounts or otherwise;

(d) commit the child to the
care or custody of a probation officer or of any other suitable person;

(e) allow the child to remain
in its home, subject to the visitation of a probation officer, such child to
report to the court or to the probation officer as often as may be required;

(f) cause the child to be placed in a
suitable family home as a foster home, subject to the friendly supervision of a
probation officer and the further order of the court;

(g) impose upon the
delinquent such further or other conditions as may be deemed advisable;

(h) commit the child to the charge
of any children’s aid society, duly organized under an Act of the legislature
of the province and approved by the lieutenant governor in council, or, in any
municipality in which there is no children’s aid society, to the charge of the
superintendent, if there is one; or

(i) commit the child to an
industrial school duly approved by the lieutenant governor in council.

It is to be noted that the court is given many
options but those options do not include or even refer to the conviction of the
child or to the sentence of the child and it can only be concluded that it was
the express policy of Parliament that a child found to be a juvenile delinquent
should not be stigmatized as one who had been convicted and should not be
subject to a sentence. This again is demonstrated in the words appearing in
s. 38 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act:

[Page 417]

and that as far as practicable every
juvenile delinquent shall be treated, not as criminal, but as a misdirected and
misguided child, and one needing aid, encouragement, help and assistance.

I also cite Attorney General of British
Columbia v. Smith[5], and
particularly the words of Fauteux J., as he then was, at p. 710.

It is true that s. 26 of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act commences with the words “No juvenile delinquent shall,
under any circumstances, upon or after conviction…” but I am of the opinion
that the use of the word “conviction” in that section cannot have the
effect of depriving such sections as s. 3 and s. 20, to which I
have referred, of their plain meaning which bars conviction and substitutes a
finding of guilt of the offence of delinquency. I, therefore, am of the opinion
that even if there had been findings of delinquency as to the appellant made
when he was a juvenile, and there were not, then such findings could not be
considered “convictions” for the purpose of permitting evidence as to them to
be adduced by virtue of s. 593 of the Code.

It was also the submission of counsel for the
appellant that the findings of juvenile delinquency, even if they had been made
and as I repeat they were not, were not offences within the meaning of that
word in s. 593 of the Code or s. 12 of the Evidence Act.
There is much strength in the submission of counsel for the appellant on this
point but I do not think it necessary to come to any determination on it in
view of the opinion I expressed as to the three points with which I have dealt.

Therefore, I would allow the appeal. Such a
result would naturally be followed by an order for a new trial. In this case,
however, the appellant was convicted and sentenced on the 1st of February 1974.
The sentence was only a three months’ suspended sentence with probation
thereafter and a note to the effect that there might be a further order for
probation at the end of the three months. It is now 1978. Under these
circumstances, I see no practical value of a new trial whatever result

[Page 418]

there may be from such process. I would quash
the conviction.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz
and Pratte JJ. was delivered by

PRATTE J.:—I have had the advantage of reading
the reasons for judgment prepared for delivery by my brother Spence, and
contrary to him, I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.

The facts giving rise to this appeal are
generally outlined in the reasons of my brother Spence; I do not propose to
repeat them except when I feel it desirable for a better understanding of these
reasons or where my understanding of the facts is different from his.

The main issue in this appeal is as to whether the
cross-examination of the appellant in which he contradicted the evidence he had
given in chief and admitted having been found guilty of a certain number of
delinquencies under the Juvenile Delinquents Act was properly allowed by
the trial judge under both s. 12  of the Canada Evidence Act  and
s. 593  Cr.C .

Before dealing with this problem however it is
appropriate to consider first the submission of the appellant that whatever the
merits of the decision of the trial judge, as to the admissibility of the cross-examination
of the appellant upon his record as a juvenile, the verdict cannot stand
because there is no proper evidence of the appellant ever having been found
guilty of any delinquency. If this proposition were valid, it would necessarily
follow that, contrary to the view expressed by the trial judge in his charge,
the appellant did not lie in his examination in chief and a new trial clearly
ought to be ordered.

It is well established that a conviction does
not need to be proven by the production of the official record; it is just as
validly proven by the admission of the convicted party. This method is indeed
impliedly recognized by s. 12  of the Canada Evidence Act  which
provides for an alternate, albeit not exclusive, method of proving a prior
conviction

[Page 419]

that is denied by the witness (Rex v. Lalonde[6]). A conviction that is admitted by a
witness does not need to be otherwise proven and such evidence ought not to be
disregarded except possibly in exceptional circumstances showing clearly that
the admission was made in error. Human beings are not prone to admit their
weaknesses and it is not to be feared that a witness will admit lightly to a
conviction which was not entered against him; the reluctance of the appellant
here in admitting his convictions bears out this very human trait. Wigmore, On
Evidence, Chadbourn revision, Vol. 4, No. 1270 (at p. 656) writes as
follows: “That there is any real risk of reaching an erroneous result by taking
the witness’ own admission against his credit, extracted on cross-examination,
is impossible; there is in such a case no need to insist upon a copy:…”.

In Jones v. Director of Public Prosecutions[7], Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest, when
making reference to the proof of the commission by the accused of an offence other
than that charged, spoke thus at p. 685: “The admission of the accused
when asked questions in cross-examination would be proof and there is no
essential requirement that proof should be given in any other way…”. In Koufis
v. The King[8], Taschereau
J., as he then was, writing for the majority of the Court said with reference
to s. 12  of the Canada Evidence Act , at p. 489: “If the
accused admits having committed the offence, the answer, being a collateral
one, is obviously final”.

Here, when he was cross-examined on his record
before the Juvenile Court, the appellant initially remembered having been found
guilty of theft and illegal possession in 1970 and of breaking and entering in
1972 when he was 17; he denied any recollection of having been found guilty of
attempted theft in 1963 and of damage to a third party’s property in 1969. Upon
being further questioned by the Crown and without any apparent reason therefor,
the appellant suddenly recovered his memory and admitted the two convictions of

[Page 420]

1963 and 1969. Here is the whole
cross-examination of the appellant:

Q. Mr. Morris, you’ve mentioned to the
Members of the Jury that you had never been previously arrested or convicted of
any offence whatsoever. Is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Is it not a fact that in nineteen
sixty-three, before the Juvenile Court, you were charged with and found guilty
of attempted theft?

A. I don’t remember.

Q. Is it not true that in nineteen
sixty-nine you were charged again before the Juvenile Court, convicted of
damages to third party’s property, causing damages?

A. I don’t remember exactly.

Q. O.K., do you remember if in nineteen
seventy you were charged with and found guilty of theft and illegal possession,
in nineteen seventy?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you remember if in nineteen
seventy-two, before the Juvenile Court, that you were found guilty of breaking
and entering?

A. Guilty.

Q. You were found guilty in nineteen
seventy-two. Is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. That would have been at the age of
eighteen… seventeen?

A. Seventeen.

Q. And how old were you when you were
alleged to have gone into the building itself, under the circumstances that
have been referred to, was this at the age of nineteen?

A. Yes.

Q. And you say that you don’t remember the
earlier convictions that I referred to? Could you tell the Members of the Jury,
then, what you do remember, as to how… for what alleged incident you were found
guilty?

A. I remember being convicted of breaking
and entering when I was a juvenile, nineteen seventy-two I think.

Q. And theft in nineteen seventy, and
illegal possession do you remember that?

A. No.

Q. What, for instance, do you remember,
other than the breaking and entering?

A. That’s all I remember. It happened so
long ago.

[Page 421]

Q. I see. Nineteen seventy you don’t
remember going to Juvenile Court?

BY HIS LORDSHIP:

He says he remembers nineteen seventy and
nineteen seventy-two, Mr. Keyserlingk.

BY MR. HENRY R. KEYSERLINGK

ATTORNEY FOR THE PROSECUTION:

He says he only remembers the breaking and
entering.

BY THE WITNESS:

I can’t remember exactly what happened,
nineteen seventy, that day.

Q. Would it be accurate to say that you
would have been convicted of theft and illegal possession in nineteen seventy?

A. Yes.

Q. And that in nineteen sixty-nine, with
regards to causing damages to a third party’s property…

A. Yes.

Q. And to nineteen sixty-three, for
attempted theft?

A. Yes.

Q. Thank you. No further questions.

In short, in his cross-examination, the
appellant admitted four offences; it is my view that these must be taken as
proven.

It was, however, argued before us that these
admissions of the appellant should be disregarded because they would be
contrary to the information contained in a document produced as exhibit S-1 by
the Crown as a presentence report and which allegedly shows that the appellant
was never found guilty of any offence as a juvenile.

This submission, on the part of the appellant,
finds its source in the following expression of opinion of the learned trial
judge in his report to the Court of Appeal, pursuant to s. 609  Cr.C .:

There is, however, one point about this
appeal which concerns me. As stated above, the accused admitted, on
cross-examination, that he had been convicted as a juvenile delinquent. In the
face of such an admission, no further proof of his convictions seemed to me to
be necessary or desirable. However, after the verdict and before sentence,
there was produced as exhibit S-1 a

[Page 422]

copy of the accused’s Juvenile Court
record. This document indicates that technically there were no convictions registered
against the accused and that, even though he was confined for some time at the
Boys’ Farm at Shawbridge, all the charges against him had been continued sine
die without any formal disposition being made. If this fact had been made
know[n] to me while the case was still in the hands of the jury, I might have
taken a different attitude although I do not think so. In my view the accused
had opened the door to evidence of his bad character by attempting to lead
evidence of good character and the jury were entitled to know that he had
perjured himself in his evidence in chief when he stated that he had never been
arrested.

If I was wrong in ruling as I did, the
evidence in question was clearly of great significance to the jury and in my
respectful opinion there must be a new trial.

This exhibit S-1 was not before the Court of
Appeal; speaking for the Court, Chief Justice Tremblay had this to say:
[TRANSLATION] “Exhibit S-1 is not in the joint record and I am quite doubtful
that it prevails over the formal admissions of appellant”.

This exhibit has now been located and is part of
the record before us. I can find nothing in the document that would tend to
support the view expressed by the trial judge in his report and which is now
being urged upon us.

This document, exhibit S-1, reads as follows:

[Page 423]

It should first be observed that this document
makes no reference to the 1963 and 1969 convictions that were admitted by the
appellant in his cross-examination; on the other hand, the two 1967 offences
shown in exhibit S-1 were not referred to at the trial and this includes the
offence in respect of which the accused was placed at the Boys’ Farm &
Training School. The two offences in 1970 and 1972, which were rather readily
admitted by the appellant in his cross-examination, appear last on this
exhibit. It is contended that this document shows that all charges against the
appellant were adjourned sine die without the appellant ever having been
found guilty of an offence as a juvenile. This contention is erroneous. First
of all, the document does not purport to give the complete juvenile record of
the appellant; it omits the offences of 1963 and 1969 which have been admitted
by the appellant in his cross‑examination. I therefore fail to see how
the document can, in any way, be used to rebut the evidentiary value of the
admissions of these two offences.

As to the four offences listed in the exhibit
and which include those in 1970 and 1972 that were admitted by the appellant,
the opinion of the trial judge that: “all the charges were continued sine
die without any formal disposition being made” totally ignores the meaning
of the word “Sentences” which heads the last column on the exhibit. In matters
pertaining to Canadian penal legislation, the French word “sentence” is
the equivalent of the English word “sentence”; both have the same meaning and
are used in reference to the determination and pronouncement of punishment or
like action following a finding of guilt; both words are utilized to define the
fate or punishment of a person who has been adjudged guilty, (see Websters’
Dictionary of Synonyms Vo “sentence”). The definition of the English word
“sentence” as given in Black’s Law Dictionary, revision 4th ed., is
applicable to the French word “sentence” as used in Canadian criminal
legislation:

The judgment formally pronounced by the
court or judge upon the defendant after the conviction in a criminal
prosecution, awarding the punishment to be inflicted. Judgments formally
declaring to accused legal consequences of guilt which he has confessed or of
which

[Page 424]

he has been convicted. The word is properly
confined to this meaning.

With this in mind, it appears clearly that the
actions described under the heading “Sentences” in exhibit S-1 relate to the
issue of the penalty following a finding of guilt rather than to the issue of
guilt of the “délits” themselves. In other words, the information given
in summary form in the column “Sentences” purports to describe the steps taken
by the Juvenile Court pursuant to s. 20(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents
Act after the appellant has been “adjudged to be a juvenile delinquent”, i.e.
after he has been found guilty of a violation of a provision of the Criminal
code . What this column shows is that in all cases but one, the Court
postponed making a decision as to what course or courses of action, among those
enumerated in s. 20(1) of the Act, it would take in respect to the
appellant who had already been found to be a delinquent as a result of having
committed the offences listed in the second column headed “Délits”. Confirmation
for this view is found in the supplementary material that was filed before us
at the time of the hearing of this appeal under s. 67 of the Supreme
Court Act and which was accepted on a limited basis, i.e. for the
sole purpose of allowing us to obtain a clear understanding as to the import of
exhibit S-1. This material shows that the appellant admitted each one of the
four charges laid against him and listed in exhibit S-1; it further shows that
in respect of the third offence the decision to commit the appellant to the Boys’
Farm & Training School was taken pursuant to s. 20(1) of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act after the court had come to the conclusion that “the child
is a juvenile delinquent”. It is worth noting that such a decision could not
have been validly taken under s. 16 of the Act, under which the authority
of the Court is limited to postponing or adjourning the hearing of a charge of
delinquency; in effect the measures envisaged by s. 20(1) of the Act may
not be taken by the Court until after the juvenile has been found to be a
delinquent, i.e. guilty of the offence with which he has been charged.

With respect, I find nothing in the record that
is in contradiction with the admissions made by the

[Page 425]

appellant in his cross-examination and which
could be construed to be in support of the views expressed by the trial judge
in his report. The evidence is that the appellant committed a number of
violations of the provisions of the Criminal Code  as a result of which
he was found to be a juvenile delinquent; in respect of one offence he was
committed to a juvenile school and in respect of the other offences the
“sentence” was adjourned sine die.

Such being the case, I now come to consider the
main issue in the appeal which is as to whether the cross-examination of the
appellant upon his record as a juvenile was admissible in evidence under
s. 12  of the Canada Evidence Act  or under s. 593  Cr.C . The
trial judge allowed the cross-examination under both provisions and his
decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.

Dealing first with s. 12  of the Canada
Evidence Act , it reads in part as follows:

12. (1) A
witness may be questioned as to whether he has been convicted of any offence,
and upon being so questioned, if he either denies the fact or refuses to
answer, the opposite party may prove such conviction.

It is submitted by the appellant that this
section is not applicable in the premises on two grounds, namely: (i) a
delinquency is not an offence within the meaning of this expression as used in
s. 12 ; and (ii) a finding of delinquency is not to be construed as a
conviction for the purposes of s. 12 . It would follow, according to the
appellant, that barring the application of s. 593  Cr.C ., the
cross-examination of the appellant was illegally admitted as evidence, because it
was not legally admissible under s. 12(1) .

As to the first ground, it should first be
observed that the word “delinquency” which is described as an offence in ss. 3
and 22(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act embraces within its meaning
two

[Page 426]

categories of acts; the first category includes
acts that are in violation of “any provision of the Criminal Code  or of
any federal or provincial statute, or of any by-law or ordinance of any
municipality” (Juvenile Delinquents Act, s. 2(1)), or, as Fauteux J. put
it in Attorney General of British Columbia v. Smith[9], at p. 710, that are
“punishable breaches of the public law, whether defined by Parliament or the
Legislatures”; the second category includes sexual immorality or other similar
form of vice which, while not illegal in the case of adults, should be
repressed in the case of juveniles.

Leaving aside the delinquencies of the second
category that I have mentioned above, the Juvenile Delinquents Act does
not prescribe any special rule of human conduct for juveniles; the Criminal
Code  and the other statutes referred to above are applicable to juveniles
and non-juveniles alike. Essentially, the Juvenile Delinquents Act does
not create any offence; the offence results from the violation of another
statute which, in the case at bar, is the Criminal Code . But, when the
offence is committed by a juvenile, a particular method of enforcement is
prescribed: the usual type of penalty imposed in criminal matters, i.e. imprisonment
or fine, intended to act as a deterrent of wrongful action, is generally
replaced by various courses of action left at the discretion of the Court and
designed to provide the child with such care, education and protection as he
requires in order to rehabilitate himself and mature into a law‑abiding
citizen. The Act “provides a special procedure for the discipline and treatment
of children outside of the ordinary criminal courts, although their
delinquencies may be offences under the Criminal Code ” (per Laskin J.A.,
as he then was, in R. v. Horsburgh[10],
at pp. 756 and 757). In Attorney General of British Columbia v. Smith,
supra, Fauteux J., as he then was, speaking for the Court, rightly pointed
out at p. 708 that: “The primary legal effect of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act,…, is the effective substitution, in the case of juveniles,
of the provisions of the Act to the enforcement

[Page 427]

provisions of the Criminal Code  or” of
any other relevant statute.

In that case, the main question was as to
whether the Juvenile Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1952 c. 160, which to all
intents and purposes is identical with the corresponding existing legislation,
was intra vires the Parliament of Canada as being legislation in
relation to criminal law. In coming to the conclusion that the Act was intra
vires, Fauteux J. made some interesting comments as to the nature of the
legislation and of the substitution of the type of punishment effected thereby;
at p. 708, he said:

…a reference to the preamble, appended to
the Act when originally adopted in 1908, 7-8 Edward VII, c. 40, as well as to
the interpretation section and the main operative provisions of the Act,
will show that this substitution of the provisions of the Act to the
enforcement provisions of other laws, federally or provincially enacted, is a
means adopted by Parliament, in the proper exercise of its plenary power in
criminal matters, for the attainment of an end, a purpose or object which, in
its true nature and character, identifies this Act as being genuine legislation
in relation to criminal law.

And referring to the operative provisions of the
Act, he added at p. 710:

They are directed to juveniles who violate
the law or indulge in sexual immorality or any other similar form of vice or
who, by reason of any other act, are liable to be committed to an industrial
school or a juvenile reformatory. They are meant,—in the words of Parliament
itself,—to check their evil tendencies and to strengthen their better
instincts. They are primarily prospective in nature. And in essence, they
are intended to prevent these juveniles to become prospective criminals and to
assist them to be law-abiding citizens. Such objectives are clearly within the
judicially defined field of criminal law.

In the case at bar, the delinquencies adjudged
against the appellant all consisted in violations of various provisions of the Criminal
Code . We are not therefore concerned here with delinquencies of the second
category or even with a delinquency that, although in the first category, would
consist in the violation of a federal statute other than the

[Page 428]

Criminal Code  or
of a provincial statute or of any by-law or ordinance of any municipality.

The question that stands up for determination is
therefore quite narrow: it is whether the word “offence” as used in
s. 12(1)  of the Canada Evidence Act  includes a delinquency
consisting in a violation of the Criminal Code  which is enforceable
under the Juvenile Delinquents Act rather than under the Code itself.

Both the Criminal Code  and the Juvenile
Delinquents Act were passed by Parliament under its authority to legislate
in respect to criminal law and procedure in criminal matters; the same is true
of s. 12  of the Canada Evidence Act  in so far as it applies to
criminal proceedings.

It would, in my opinion, be most extraordinary
to say the least if Parliament, in using as broad a word as “offence” in a
statute applicable to criminal proceedings, had intended to designate something
less than the offences that are truly criminal in nature and which as such
Parliament has the full exclusive legislative authority to create and regulate
pursuant to its criminal law-making power contained in s. 91, head 27 of
the B.N.A.A.; there is no indication of any such intention in the Canada
Evidence Act  or in any other relevant piece of legislation. The historical
background of s. 12(1)  provides no support either for the theory that a
distinction ought to be made between the same violations of the law on the sole
basis of the method of punishment.

In brief, the expression “any offence” in
s. 12(1)  clearly includes an offence that is a violation of the Criminal
Code  when it is punishable under the Code; in the absence of any
expressed legislative intent to the contrary, I cannot logically bring myself
to the view that the same expression excludes the same violation when it is
punishable under the Juveniles Delinquents Act which, like the Code, is
“genuine legislation in relation to criminal law”.

I express no opinion as to whether the meaning
of the word “offence” as used in s. 12(1)  of the Canada Evidence Act  should
otherwise be restricted so as to exclude certain kinds of delinquencies.

[Page 429]

The appellant has referred us to two decisions: Krassman
v. The Queen[11] by the
Alberta Supreme Court, Appellate Division, and Adelphi Book Store Limited v.
The Queen[12], by
the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal. Neither one of these two decisions has any
application to the case at bar; they are both concerned with the extent to
which certain provisions of the Criminal Code  are applicable to offences
created by other federal statutes, and not with the scope of the Canada
Evidence Act .

The second ground advanced by the appellant is
that a finding of delinquency under the Juvenile Delinquents Act is not
to be construed as a conviction for the purposes of s. 12  of the Canada
Evidence Act ; therefore, a person who has been found guilty of delinquency
could not be said to have been “convicted”. This submission of the appellant is
based on the fact that a Juvenile Court is, under the Act, empowered to adjudge
a child to have committed a delinquency and not to convict a child of
having committed a delinquency.

It is true that in the Juvenile Delinquents
Act, a finding of guilt is not usually described as a “conviction”. But it
does not necessarily follow that by apparently avoiding the use of the
expression “conviction”, Parliament has intended to confer upon the juvenile
courts, with respect to the assessment of guilt, a power that is substantially
different from the power “to convict”. This goes to the meaning of both
expressions.

The word “conviction” is not a term of art that
is applicable only to Criminal Code  offences punishable in the manner
provided in the Code. When used in a statute, its meaning varies
depending on the context in which it is found; it may or may not include the
imposition of a penalty. Generally, however, a “conviction is where a person is
found guilty of an offence” (Jowitt’s Dictionary of English Law, 2nd ed.
Vo “conviction”). The verb “to convict” is defined in the Oxford English
Dictionary as follows: “To prove (a person) guilty of an

[Page 430]

offence which makes him liable to legal
punishment”. The definitions contained in Funk and Wagnalls New Standard
Dictionary are along similar lines. Also, it has been said that the
expression is broad enough to include a plea of guilty (R. v. Grant[13]; R. v. Blaby[14], per Hawkins J., at p. 172; R.
v. Manchester Justices[15]). In
Smith v. The Queen, the word “conviction” was used both in this Court[16] and in the Manitoba Court of Appeal[17] to designate the decision of a juvenile
court declaring a juvenile to be a delinquent.

The meaning of the verb “to adjudge” is broader
than and includes that of “to convict”; generally, “to adjudge” means to
pronounce judicially and one of its meanings is to sentence or condemn; Black’s
Law Dictionary, 4th ed., Vo “adjudge”:

ADJUDGE. To pass on judicially, to decide,
settle, or decree, or to sentence or condemn. People v. Rave, 364 Ill.
72, 3 N.E. 2d 972, 975.

Webster’s Third New International Dictionary:

1(a) To decide or rule upon as a judge or
with judicial or quasi-judicial powers; … (b) to pronounce judicially… 2. archaic,
To sentence or condemn (a person) to some punishment.

Funk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of
the English Language:

1. To award or bestow by formal decision;…
2(1) To give a judicial decision concerning; adjudicate upon; decide
judicially.

In general use, adjudge does not
always imply that the decision given is final. Judges of inferior courts, or
arbitrators and referees, adjudge of matters sometimes transmitted to superior
courts for final adjudication… 3. To decree; sentence; condemn; as King Charles
was adjudged to die.

[Page 431]

In some cases, the word “adjudged” has been held
to be synonymous with “convicted”:

Tarlo’s Estate[18], at p. 140.

Blaufus v. People[19], at p. 111.

And in Old English law, the word “adjudged” was
sometimes used to mean “sentenced” (Arch‑bold, Criminal Pleading and
Evidence, 19th ed., at p. 400).

In my opinion, therefore, the power of the
juvenile court to adjudge guilt is equivalent to the power of an ordinary
criminal court to convict and I cannot see any essential difference between the
power to adjudge a person guilty of an offence and the power to convict a
person of the same offence. With respect, I find no merit in the submission of
the appellant that a finding of delinquency should not be construed as a
conviction for the purposes of s. 12  of the Canada Evidence Act .

The appellant has also submitted that applying
s. 12(1)  to a juvenile record would violate the intent and spirit of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act, and would run contrary to the objectives of the statute,
as expressed in the preamble to the Juvenile Delinquents Act of 1908 (c.
40) and as reflected in s. 38 of the present Act.

The aim of the Juvenile Delinquents Act is
that juvenile offenders should be assisted and reformed rather than punished;
it is therefore desirable that juvenile offenders, when reformed, should be
given some degree of protection against being dragged back into the criminal
class by the automatic operation of the law made for ordinary criminals. But,
whatever be the virtue of these objectives and the desirability of their being
attained, they cannot by themselves justify putting on s. 12(1)  an
interpretation that cannot otherwise be supported and which would effectively prohibit
the cross-examination of a former juvenile on his juvenile record when, in his
examination in chief, he has given erroneous information as to such record. I
do not know of any valid reason that makes it imperative or even desirable that
erroneous evidence given by

[Page 432]

former juvenile delinquents should have to be
unchallengeable in cross-examination. A law that would encourage the successful
suppression of truth could hardly be said to be conducive to the rehabilitation
of delinquents, be they juvenile or not. If a witness does not speak the truth,
the higher interests of justice require that the truth be told to the jury “in
order that they may understand the kind of witness they have before them” (Ward
v. Sinfield[20], at
p. 697, per Lopes J.).

There is indeed a distinction which must not be
overlooked between cross-examination as to prior convictions which is governed
by s. 12.1, and cross-examination which is aimed at weakening the evidence
given in chief by exposing the errors, omissions or contradictions of the
testimony of the witness or by eliciting from him statements contrary to his
own evidence.

Cross-examination as to prior convictions is not
directly aimed at establishing the falsity of the witness’s evidence; it is
rather designed to lay down a factual basis—prior convictions—from which the
inference may subsequently be drawn that the witness’ credibility is suspect
and that his evidence ought not to be believed because of his misconduct in
circumstances totally unrelated to those of the case in which he is giving
evidence. The evidentiary value of such cross-examination is therefore purely
inferential.

By comparison, where the cross-examination is
directed at eliciting from the witness answers that are contrary to his
evidence-in-chief, the attack on credibility is no longer based on an inference
of unreliability of the witness, but on the actual proof of the witness’s
unreliability in the case itself, as established by the contradiction between
various portions of his evidence. This type of cross-examination is essential
if the search for truth is ever to successful. Cross‑examination would
become pointless if it were not available to attempt to prove the falsity of
the evidence given in chief. In Jones v. Director of Public Prosecutions[21], Lord Devlin said, at p. 708: “If a
witness cannot be cross-examined to test the veracity and accuracy of

[Page 433]

his evidence-in-chief, he cannot be
cross-examined at all:…”.

In Stirland v. Director of Public
Prosecutions[22], the
proposition was laid down by the Lord Chancellor, Viscount Simon at
p. 326, that the accused “may… be cross-examined as to any of the evidence
he has given in chief, including statements concerning his good record, with a
view to testing his veracity or accuracy or to showing that he is not entitled
to be believed on his oath.” It is true that in Jones v. D.P.P. (ibidem), doubts
were expressed by some of their Lordships as to the generality of this
proposition, but those were based exclusively on the wording of proviso (f) of s.1
of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1898 which has no counterpart here. I have
therefore no reservation that the rule enunciated in Stirland is a
correct statement of the law as it exists here.

In R. v. Davison et al.,[23], Martin J.A., speaking for the
Ontario Court of Appeal, properly said at p. 444:

I conclude that, save for cross-examination
as to previous convictions permitted by s. 12  of the Canada Evidence
Act , an accused may not be cross-examined with respect to misconduct or
discreditable associations unrelated to the charge on which he is being tried
for the purpose of leading to the conclusion that by reason of his bad
character he is a person whose evidence ought not to be believed.
Cross-examination, however, which is directly relevant to prove the falsity of
the accused’s evidence does not fall within the ban, notwithstanding that it
may incidentally reflect upon the accused’s character by disclosing
discreditable conduct on his part.

It is true that there is a theory according to
which the trial judge would, under s. 12(1) , enjoy a discretion under
which he could disallow questions about previous convictions that, in his
considered opinion, would have no relevancy to the veracity character of the
witness and would therefore not assist the jury in assessing his credibility,
or possibly would have a probative value as to the credibility of the witness
that would be vastly outweighed by the prejudice that it would raise against
him: R. v. McLean[24]; see
also Phipson,

[Page 434]

12th ed., Nos. 1601 & 1605; R. v.
Sweet-Escott[25].

I need not express my opinion as to the merit of
this theory; it is sufficient to say that even if the trial judge has a
discretion under which he may disallow questions about previous convictions,
such discretion, whatever its scope, ought not, in my view, to be exercised so
as to forbid cross-examination which is aimed at eliciting from the witness
some admissions that would tend to establish the lack of veracity of some
portions of his examination-in-chief.

The right to cross-examine with the view of
establishing the falsity of the evidence-in-chief should not be less absolute
in the case of a former juvenile delinquent than in that of a former
non-juvenile delinquent. By such cross-examination, the credibility of the
former juvenile delinquent is not attacked because of his delinquency, but
because of the fact that, when no longer a juvenile, he lied in his examination
in chief: this is an entirely different situation and the protection that is
afforded to a juvenile cannot be assumed to extend to entitling him not to
speak the truth under oath.

Finally, I would like to add that the history of
the development of the rule of evidence now expressed in s. 12  of the Canada
Evidence Act  and which finds its statutory origin in s. 6 of the Criminal
Procedure Act of England of 1865, 28-29 Vict., c. 18, confirms that the
rule was not intended to restrict the scope of cross-examination as to credit
or otherwise and ought not therefore to be so construed as to prevent
cross-examination on a matter that has been opened up by the
examination-in-chief of the witness, be he the accused (see Koufis v. The
King[26],
per Kerwin J., at p. 487).

I am therefore of the opinion that, in the
circumstances of this case, the cross-examination of the appellant upon his
record as a juvenile delinquent came within s. 12(1)  of the Canada
Evidence Act  and was properly allowed in evidence.

[Page 435]

There remains for me to deal with a matter that
arises out of the manner in which the trial judge charged the jury as to the
previous record of the appellant.

In his examination-in-chief, the appellant
testified in part as follows:

Q. Mr. Phillip Morris, have you ever
been convicted of a criminal offense?

A. No. None whatsoever.

Q. Have you ever been arrested before?

A. No.

In his cross-examination, which I have
reproduced at length, the appellant admitted convictions of four criminal
offences while he was a juvenile.

That there is a contradiction between the
evidence of the appellant in his cross-examination and in his examination-in-chief
is plain; indeed, such contradiction is admitted by the appellant.

It is therefore not surprising that the trial
judge should have charged the jury that the basic problem facing them was as to
the credibility of the appellant:

It really, in my view, gentlemen, is going
to come down… this doesn’t bind you, what I say, but it’s going to come down to
your assessment of the credibility of the accused. You observed him, watched
him when he testified before you, you observed his demeanour, his manner, his
facial expression. It’s up to you to decide whether you feel that he’s telling
you the truth.

Subsequently, the trial judge spoke as follows:

Now, just before terminating, I’d like to
say one word about the accused’s record, which was brought up too. First of
all, it seems quite clear to me that in his evidence in chief, the accused
lied. When he started out, the very first thing he said was that he had never
been convicted. He had never been arrested. You can draw what conclusions you
like from that.

In the rest of his charge, the judge made no
reference to any arrest of the accused but only to his record as a juvenile and
his convictions as such.

It is suggested that the charge contains a fatal
error in that the trial judge would have said that

[Page 436]

the appellant lied when he denied any previous
arrest, while there is no evidence of any such arrest. I do not agree with this
suggestion.

It is undoubtedly true that there is no direct
evidence that the appellant was ever arrested if the word “arrest” is
interpreted to mean the apprehension or detention of a person by another in
order that the former may be brought into court to answer for the offence with
which he is charged; but, I am not convinced that in the context of this trial,
the word “arrest” was used by the trial judge in such a technical sense.

Furthermore, a brief reading of the charge shows
that the trial judge did not actually say that the appellant lied when he
denied any previous arrest. In the first part of the relevant portion of the
charge the trial judge stated his own opinion that the accused lied in his
examination‑in‑chief. Then, he proceeded to state accurately what
the accused had said, i.e. that he had never been convicted, that he had
never been arrested; but he did not stop there; he continued to say: “You can
draw what conclusions you like from that.” This last sentence does, in my mind,
qualify the statement of the trial judge that the accused lied and leaves the
question open as to whether the judge meant that the accused lied on one count
or on both counts.

In my view, however, it is not necessary to rule
on the meaning of the charge in that particular respect. Even if the judge had
clearly and erroneously stated that the appellant lied when he denied any
previous arrest, I cannot conceive that in the circumstances of the case at bar
such statement would have had any influence on the decision of the jury. The
evidence of the appellant was not believed by the jury because he unequivocally
lied, not only in his examination-in-chief, as pointed out by the trial judge,
but also in his cross-examination which the judge did not mention; whether he
lied as to his convictions or his arrest or both would not have made him more
or less believable to the jury. When the jury reached its verdict, the evidence
of the accused was still very fresh in its mind: the whole of the trial from
the swearing in of the jury to the verdict was completed within a

[Page 437]

day. They necessarily remembered that the
cross-examination of the appellant bore exclusively on his prior convictions
without any reference being made to his arrest.

Furthermore, the jury could not but have been
unfavourably impressed by the lack of candor of the appellant during his
cross-examination. Indeed, it is clear that throughout his cross‑examination
and in spite of his early denials, the appellant had a complete recollection of
the various offences of which he had been found guilty as a juvenile; nothing
that was said to him during his short cross-examination could have refreshed
his memory and yet he suddenly acknowledged two offences which he could not
remember a few moments before.

The admissions made by the appellant at the end
of his cross-examination made it so plain that he lied in his
examination-in-chief and also at the beginning of his cross-examination that I
find it impossible to believe that the reference by the trial judge to the
arrest of the accused, if it were wrong, had any influence whatsoever on the
decision of the jury to disbelieve the appellant. I cannot convince myself
either that twelve reasonable men, properly instructed, would have believed the
evidence of the appellant.

I find confirmation for this view in the fact
that the alleged error on the part of the trial judge was not raised as a
ground of appeal by the appellant in his notice of appeal to the Court of
Appeal or in his factum in this Court. It is plain that appellant did not feel
that the reference of the judge to the denial by the appellant of any prior
arrest, although it might have been inaccurate, carried any weight with the
jury.

The above makes it unnecessary to consider
whether the cross-examination of the appellant was admissible under s. 593 
Cr.C . However, since the views expressed by my brother Spence in this
regard are contrary to those of the trial judge and of the Court of Appeal, I
feel that the following observations are in order.

I agree with the trial judge and the Court of
Appeal that the appellant put his character in

[Page 438]

issue when he stated that he had never been convicted
nor arrested; these statements were nothing but an attempt on his part to lead
evidence of good character. By projecting the image of a law-abiding citizen,
the appellant’s purpose could only have been to show that because of his
character he was not likely to have committed the offence with which he was
charged.

In R. v. Baker[27], the accused had given evidence
that for four years he had been earning an honest living; this, in the opinion
of the Court of Criminal Appeal, was evidence of good character which laid him
open to cross-examination as to character.

In R. v. Samuel[28], the Court of Criminal Appeal found
that someone charged with larceny had put his character in issue when he gave
evidence with regard to two previous occasions in which he had returned lost
property to its owner. Referring to this evidence and to the questions leading
to it, the Lord Chief Justice spoke thus, at pp. 10 and 11:

Of course, if a man has done that, it is an
indication that he is an honest person.

…

…the only object of those questions could
be to induce the jury to say: “This man is one of those people who, if he finds
property, gives it up; in other words, he is an honest man.” That was obviously
the purpose of the questions, and I certainly could not give any colour to the
suggestion that all they mean is that the appellant is a man who, if he finds
property, gives it up. The short answer to that is that if a prisoner puts his
character in issue, he puts his whole character in issue, not such parts as may
be convenient to him, leaving out the inconvenient parts. In the opinion of the
court, it is clear that those questions did put the appellant’s character in
issue. He was asking the jury to assume that he was a man who dealt honestly
with property which he found. Therefore, it was perfectly legitimate for
counsel for the prosecution to put to him in cross-examination his previous
convictions.

Discussing the problem as to the kind of
evidence that would qualify as character evidence, Cross, On Evidence, 4th
ed., wrote as follows at p. 367:

[Page 439]

Generally speaking the accused’s own
evidence of his character takes the form of allusions to his innocent or
praiseworthy past, and the decisions certainly do not indicate any great
reluctance on the part of the courts to hold that he has put his character in
issue by such a reference. A man’s allegations concerning his regular
attendance at mass, his assertion that he had been earning an honest living for
a considerable time, and his affirmative answer to the question whether he is a
married man with a family in regular work have been treated as instances in
which…

the accused has put his character in issue.

It has been submitted that the appellant did not
put his character in issue when he gave evidence as to his good behavior
because this evidence would have been given in chief for “tactical reasons”
within the meaning of the rule adopted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R.
v. St. Pierre[29]; R.
v. Merolla, April 19, 1974, unreported and R. v. MacDonald[30]. This rule, whatever may be its
validity when the accused admits prior convictions in his examination‑in‑chief,
can have no application when he denies any conviction; the rationale for the
rule is that it is less damaging to the credibility of an accused to bring out
his record of past convictions in examination-in-chief than to have the matter
dealt with by the Crown in cross-examination; such rationale is simply not
applicable where the evidence of the accused tends to prove his good behavior
rather than his misconduct. With respect, I find no merit in this submission.

I cannot agree either with the suggestion that
evidence of good character can be rebutted solely by proof of prior
convictions. Whenever the accused puts his character in issue, it is open to
the Crown to prove the bad character of the accused, i.e. that his
general reputation or actual moral disposition is bad. While this is often done
by the proof of prior convictions, this is not, by any means, the only form of
evidence of bad character that is permissible. Section 593  Cr.C . has
never been constructed so as to restrict solely to prior

[Page 440]

convictions the evidence of bad character that
can be made against the accused, and I do not agree that it should. Indeed, the
object of this provision of the Code is quite the opposite: it is to
insure that prior convictions will be allowed as evidence of bad character
although they offend the rule that bad character cannot generally be proven by
specific acts of misconduct (1953) 11, The Cambridge Law Journal, at p. 377,
“Is the Prisoner’s Character Indivisible?” per R.N. Gooderson; R. v.
Triganzie[31]; it
is also to permit, contrary to the rules of evidence respecting collateral
matters, the proof of prior convictions otherwise than through the cross‑examination
of the accused and in spite of any denial on his part.

I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO

Criminal law—Appeal—Supreme Court of
Canada—Jurisdiction—Appeal against sentence—No cross-appeal by Crown—Increased
sentence requested in Crown’s statement of fact and law—Sentence increased by
Court of Appeal—Right of Court of Appeal to increase sentence—Supreme Court
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. 5-79, s. 41—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34,
ss. 603, 605, 607 and 614—Criminal Appeal Rules (Ont.), 10 to 25.

The accused had pleaded guilty to charges of
rape and wounding. He was sentenced to 12 years concurrent. On his appeal
against sentence this was increased to life imprisonment. Leave to appeal to
the Supreme Court of Canada was granted on the question whether, on an appeal
by the accused against sentence, where there was no cross appeal by the Crown
to have the sentence increased, the Court of Appeal on dismissing the appeal
had the power to increase the sentence imposed on the accused. The appeal was
heard before a Court composed of eight judges. In the result the appeal failed
on an equal division of the members of the Court. The accused made application
for a re-hearing; this was granted and the full bench considered the appeal on
re-argument.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be
dismissed.

Per Curiam:
The Supreme Court of Canada has jurisdiction under s. 41 of the Supreme
Court Act to entertain an appeal against a sentence imposed for the
commission of an indictable offence but will not entertain an appeal against
the fitness of a sentence.

Per Martland,
Judson, Pigeon and de Grandpré JJ.: Section 614(1) provides that, where an
appeal is taken against sentence, the court of appeal shall, unless the
sentence is one fixed by law, consider the fitness of the sentence appealed
against and may … vary the sentence with(in) the limits
prescribed by law for the offence … The words “vary the sentence within the
limits prescribed by law” are plain words which fix the scope of the power
conferred upon the Court by reference to the maximum applicable penalty and are
not to be read as restricted to a variation by way of reduction.

If the accused had not been given adequate
notice that at the hearing of his appeal consideration would be given to an
increase in his sentence, it would have to be held that he was not given an
opportunity to be heard before the adverse determination was made against him.
In this case, Counsel for the Crown made it known in the statement of fact and
law filed prior to the hearing. Due to this notice the objection to
jurisdiction is based purely on a matter of form. There is no basis for adverse
comment against Counsel for the Crown or the Court below.

Per Ritchie
and de Grandpré JJ.: Parliament having fixed the Court of Appeal with the obligation
to “consider the fitness of the sentence”, it would take clear statutory
language to limit that consideration to the question of whether the sentence
was too severe while precluding any consideration of whether it was severe
enough. There is no such language in the Criminal Code  and
s. 614(1)  constitutes a mandatory direction to the Court of Appeal to
consider both aspects of the question. The Court of Appeal has power to
increase a sentence when an appeal is taken in accordance with s. 603(1) 
by a person convicted at trial and this power is not dependant on an appeal
being asserted by the Crown under s. 605 .

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz JJ. dissenting. A right of appeal is
altogether statutory (s. 602) and is governed by the Criminal Code  and
as to procedure (s. 607 ) by the rules of court, in this case the Criminal
Appeal Rules (Ont.), 10 to 25. The Crown in serving notice on the appellant
attempted to assert a

[Page 829]

right of appeal from sentence without
complying with the provisions of the Code or the Rules. Further, the
powers of the Court of Appeal defined in s. 614 of the Code are
exact and do not permit that court to exercise powers other than these given.
The powers in paras. (a) and (b) are disjunctive. The word
“or” at the end of para. (a) does not permit the Court to
exercise its jurisdiction under both paragraphs. It must choose whether to
exercise its powers under para. (a) by varying or under
para. (b) by dismissing the appeal. The Crown attempted to
short-circuit the proper procedure and to intimidate the accused from asserting
his right of appeal.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Dickson J., dissenting (after the first hearing): An appeal
should not be understood to carry additional jeopardy to an appellant beyond
that already incurred as a result of the trial, especially where criminal
justice is involved. The judgment in appeal is a departure by a provincial
appellate Court from judicial justice and a venture into a species of
administrative justice, a departure from ordinary appellate procedure all the
more startling because criminal justice is involved.

Per Beetz J., dissenting:
After a re-hearing of the appeal there is no reason to alter the views
previously expressed.

Per Beetz J., dissenting
(after the first hearing): The wording of s. 614 was not meant to
relieve the Crown from the need to seek leave and, such leave being granted,
from actually appealing, merely because a convicted person avails himself of
his right to try to have his sentence reduced; nor does s. 614 give to the
Court of Appeal jurisdiction to hear what amounts to an appeal as of right by
the Crown despite the explicit provision in the Code and where no formal
notice was given to the convicted person.

RE-HEARING OF AN APPEAL from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] imposing
a sentence of life imprisonment on the appellant on an appeal from sentence, 12
years concurrent, on a plea of guilty to rape and to causing bodily harm.
Appeal dismissed, Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz JJ. dissenting.

J.R. Belleghem, for the appellant.

E.G. Hachborn, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Dickson J. after
the first hearing was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—I have had
the advantage of seeing the reasons proposed by my brothers Spence and Pigeon.
There are two questions in this appeal, a preliminary question of jurisdiction
and the question going to the merits on which leave to appeal was granted. Like
my brother Spence, I am in agreement with my brother Pigeon in his disposition
of the question of jurisdiction, a disposition that affirms jurisdiction in
this case and which consequently involves the overruling of the Goldhar case[3], and of other cases which adopted its
approach to deny jurisdiction. On the question of the merits, I am fully in
accord with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Spence.

What prompts me to add observations of my own is
a troubled concern about the way in which I think the two questions in this
appeal have been assessed. Both in the Goldhar case and in other cases,
such as Paul v. The Queen[4], which
applied it, and in the reasons of my brother Pigeon in the present case, the
issue of jurisdiction was resolved according to different canons of statutory
construction leading to different results. My brother Pigeon declares in the
present case in favour of literal construction while Fauteux J. (as he then
was) in Goldhar and in Paul was of the view that literal
construction would lead to repugnancy with other statutory provisions.

[Page 831]

Does this mean then that the choice of a canon
of construction determines the meaning and application of a statutory provision
which is under review? My experience does not persuade me that the matter is so
simple. The relevant question is surely that of determining why one approach is
selected rather than another, involving therefore a consideration of the
factors that bear on the selection. I assume in this connection that different
results will flow according to the selection made. This is not however
invariably so. In the vast majority of the cases where statutes have to be
interpreted and the interpretation determines the result, it makes no
difference which canon of interpretation (be it the so-called literal rule or
the golden rule or the mischief rule) is chosen.

There are contradictions or difficulties in all
of the canons that have been usually relied on. Judges may disagree on what the
plain meaning is even when they agree that it is the plain meaning or literal
approach that should prevail. Similarly, judges may disagree on what is the
social purpose of a statute, although agreeing that under the mischief rule
that is what they should seek in construing a statutory provision. In my view,
we cannot escape making our own determination of purpose, or policy, regardless
of the canon that is invoked; indeed, we make it when we purport to apply one
canon rather than another. The present appeal is illustrative of this view in
respect of both of the questions that are involved in it.

I take first the preliminary question of
jurisdiction. It is to me unreal to think that literal construction determines
the result when in order to arrive at it a detailed review of legislative
history is required (and properly so) and the purpose of the measure under
review is pursued through an examination of the changes made in the
jurisdiction and role of this Court. Once it is admitted, as it must be here,
that reasonable men can differ on the effect of language directed to a
particular end which itself is in issue, we are in a situation where our
conclusion will be influenced by our view of what this Court’s jurisdiction and
role should be. Since I would not exclude cases from the leave jurisdiction of
this Court unless it is quite plain

[Page 832]

that they have been excluded by statute, and
since I do not regard the present appeal as plainly excluded I support the
conclusion of my brother Pigeon on the question of jurisdiction.

On the question of the merits, I think this is
eminently a case where under any canon of construction the result reached by my
brother Spence is the preferable one. I readily admit to a predisposition to
that result by reason of my dissent, as a member of the Ontario Court of
Appeal, in R. v. Willis[5]. My
conclusion there was based on a full examination of the legislative history, on
an assessment of social purpose as I saw it reflected in the statutory
language, and on my appreciation of the nature of an appeal. I have never
understood an appeal to carry additional jeopardy to an appellant beyond that
already incurred as a result of the trial; and this must be especially so where
criminal justice is involved.

The result that I reached in the Willis case
and that I would reach here has been made even clearer to me by the canvass
that my brother Spence has made of the language of the various provisions of
the Criminal Code  bearing upon the issue, a canvass which emphasizes
literal construction of the whole of s. 614(1)  in the context of the
rights of appeal open to the Crown as well as to the accused.

The provincial appellate Courts in this country
appear to have been influenced by English cases without, at least so far as
their reasons disclose, dwelling on the terms of the English legislation on
which those cases were based. The judgment of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R.
v. Christakos[6], which
seems to have become a pivotal case on the question at issue, contains nothing
but a bare reference to some English cases. The majority in R. v. Willis purported
to proceed on a literal approach and it was applied without more by the Quebec
Court of Appeal in Valade v. R.[7] Since
this was the approach taken by my brother Spence in reaching an opposite
result, I am reinforced in

[Page 833]

my observations on the canons of construction.

As is well known, the English Criminal Appeal
Act of 1907 (U.K.), c. 23 gave express power to increase a sentence on
an appeal by the accused. There was no right of appeal against sentence in the
Crown, and hence it might well have been the view of the Court of Appeal that
the language of s. 4(3) of the 1907 Act (which empowered it “if they think
that a different sentence should have been imposed … [to] pass such other
sentence warranted in law by the verdict”) would support the exercise of power
to impose a harsher sentence even without express authority to do so. But s. 4(3)
included the words “whether more or less severe”, indicating an appreciation by
the British Parliament of the ordinary limits of an appeal, especially in
criminal matters. I may add that the English Criminal Appeal Act of 1968
(U.K.), c. 19, s. 10, as amended by the Courts Act, 1971
(U.K.), c. 23, s. 56 and Sch. 8 has removed the express power
theretofore given to increase a sentence upon an appeal against it by an
accused.

I regard the judgment in appeal as a departure
by a provincial appellate Court from judicial justice and as a venture into a
species of administrative justice, a departure from ordinary appellate
procedure all the more startling because criminal justice is involved.

I would allow the appeal as proposed by my
brother Spence.

Laskin C.J. and Dickson and Beetz JJ. also
concurred in the judgment of

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This appeal was
argued at an earlier date before a court composed of eight judges. Several
members of this Court, including myself, wrote reasons for judgment and in the
result the appeal failed upon an equal division of the eight members of the
Court. The

[Page 834]

appellant made application for a rehearing which
application was granted and all nine members of the Court considered the appeal
upon reargument.

I am still of the opinion that the appeal should
be allowed and I, therefore, repeat hereunder my reasons for judgment as
previously delivered. They are as follows:

I have had the opportunity to peruse the reasons
for judgment written by Mr. Justice Pigeon and I adopt the facts as stated
in those reasons and will find it necessary to refer to very few other facts.

In so far as Mr. Justice Pigeon finds that
this Court had jurisdiction to consider this appeal, I am in complete agreement
with him and I have nothing to add. With respect, however, I am of the opinion
that the appeal should succeed and that the Court of Appeal for Ontario had no
jurisdiction to increase the sentence imposed upon the accused when the Crown
had chosen merely to serve upon the accused a notice that if he persisted in
his appeal the Crown would request the court to impose a more severe sentence.
This conclusion entails the determination that in my opinion, the decision of
the Court of Appeal in R. v. Willis[8],
was in error and that also the decision of the Court off Appeal for Manitoba in
R. v. Christakos[9], and
of the Quebec Court of Appeal in Valade v. The Queen[10], suffered from like defect.

I commence with the proposition that a right of
appeal is altogether statutory. This principle itself appears in the Criminal
Code  in s. 602 . It reads:

602. No
proceedings other than those authorized by this Part and Part XXIII shall be
taken by way of appeal in proceedings in respect of indictable offences.

The right of appeal of the attorney general or
counsel at his direction is granted by s. 605 of the Code and as to
sentence is dealt with in para. 1(b) thereof which reads:

[Page 835]

605. (1) The
Attorney General or counsel instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the
court of appeal

…

(b) with leave of the court of
appeal or a judge thereof, against the sentence passed by a trial court in
proceedings by indictment, unless that sentence is one fixed by law.

Section 607 [am. 1972 (Can.), c. 13,
s. 53] of the Code governs procedure on appeals by either the Crown
or the accused and provides particularly that the appellant “shall give notice
of appeal or notice of his application for leave to appeal, in such manner and
within such period as may be directed by rules of court”. Those rules of court,
in the case of Ontario, are contained in Rules 10 to 25 of the Criminal Appeal
Rules and Rule 12(2) thereof provides that:

12. (2) Where the appeal is from sentence… the
Notice of Appeal shall be served within thirty days from the day of sentence.

Rule 13(b) provides:

13. (b) Service of a Notice of
Appeal shall be effected … in all other cases by delivering to the office of
the Registrar personally or by registered mail three copies of a Notice of
Appeal, and, in addition, in appeals by an Attorney General, by personal
service on the convicted person.

When the Crown served notice upon the accused,
the appellant in the Court of Appeal and in this Court, of an intention to
request a more severe sentence, it was, in fact, attempting to assert a right
of appeal from sentence. The Crown was doing so without carrying out the
formalities required by the provisions of the Code which I have cited
and the proper carrying out of such requirements was, in my view, requisite for
obtaining the right to ask the Court of Appeal to increase the sentence, and
failing due compliance with those requirements, the Crown had no jurisdiction
to apply for an increase in sentence and the Court had no jurisdiction to grant
such an increase: Dennis v. The Queen[11].

[Page 836]

If the Crown had complied with the requirements,
then the Crown would have had to make application for leave to appeal from the
sentence and both upon such application and on the appeal itself, if leave to
appeal had been granted, the Crown would have the same onus as has an appellant
on all appeals. Using the procedure which the Crown used in this particular
case, there was no statutory onus at all upon the Crown and it would appear
that, in fact, the onus was thrown upon the accused not only in his vain
attempt to demonstrate that the sentence imposed on him was too severe but to
prevent that sentence from being increased. I am, moreover, of the opinion that
the powers of the Court of Appeal defined in s. 614 of the Code are
exact and do not permit the Court to exercise powers other than those given.
Section 614(1) provides:

614. (1)
Where an appeal is taken against sentence the court of appeal shall, unless the
sentence is one fixed by law, consider the fitness of the sentence appealed
against, and may upon such evidence, if any, as it thinks fit to require or to
receive,

(a) vary the sentence with the
limits prescribed by law for the offences of which the accused was convicted,
or

(b) dismiss the appeal.

In the present appeal, the certificate of the
formal judgment of the Court of Appeal reads, in part:

THIS COURT DID ORDER THAT the said appeal
should be and the same was thereby dismissed but that the sentence of twelve
(12) years on the charge of rape should be varied to one of life imprisonment.

Jessup J.A., in giving reasons for the Court of
Appeal, said:

In the result I would dismiss the
appellant’s appeal but vary the sentence on the charge of rape by changing it
to one of life imprisonment.

So the certificate of the formal order
accurately reflects the reasons given for the Court of Appeal.

It will be seen, therefore, that the Court of
Appeal purported to act under both para. (a) and para. (b)
of s. 614(1) in that it not only dismissed the appeal as authorized by
para. (b) but it also varied the sentence as authorized by para. (a).
The

[Page 837]

powers in paras. (a) and (b)
are disjunctive. The word “or” is the word which is at the end of para. (a)
and I am of the opinion that s. 614 of the Code does not permit a
court on the consideration of a specific appeal to exercise its jurisdiction
under both paras. (a) and (b) but that the Court of Appeal
must choose whether to exercise its powers under para. (a) by
varying or under para. (b) by dismissing the appeal. I think this
is a convincing indication that by the words of s. 614(1)(a), “vary
the sentence with the limits prescribed by law for the offences of which the
accused was convicted”, Parliament only intended to permit a variation by way
of decrease upon the appeal of an accused person or, if the Crown were the
appellant, to consider a variation by way of increase upon the Crown’s appeal.

It is, I think, of some interest and value to
note that in the United Kingdom, when the power of the Court of Appeal to
increase sentence was granted by s. 4(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1907
(U.K.), c. 23, the Appellate Court was empowered to quash the sentence
passed at trial and “(2) pass such other sentence warranted in law by the
verdict (whether more or less severe) in substitution therefor”. Thus, the
Parliament in the United Kingdom by specific words granted a power to increase.
No such words as “whether more or less severe” appear in s. 614(1)(a)
of the Code and, in my view, the words “such other sentence warranted in
law” as they appear in the United Kingdom statute and the words “the sentence
with the limits prescribed by law” as they appear in the Criminal Code  are
exactly in pari materia. It is, I think, indeed significant that
Parliament in the United Kingdom thought it necessary to add a specific
authorization for the imposition of a more severe sentence.

I note also the opening words of s. 614(1)
“where an appeal is taken against sentence” and that the words are not “where
any appeal is taken against sentence”, again indicating that the power to vary
is limited to a power in considering an appeal not in considering a motion by
the Crown urged at the time that an appeal by the accused is before the Court.

[Page 838]

There is another reason for my conclusion which
I find most convincing. In the present case, counsel for the Attorney General
relying on R. v. Willis, supra, first advised counsel for the appellant
by telephone and later confirmed by letter that if the appellant had put his
sentence in issue the Court of Appeal would be at liberty to increase it if it
saw fit and that the Crown would be asking the Court of Appeal to increase the
sentence, possibly to life. The Crown and the appellant’s counsel agreed to
adjourn the appeal and maintain the status quo of the proceedings to enable the
appellant’s counsel to obtain instructions. Jessup J.A., in his reasons for
judgment, said:

The appellant was given notice of the
Crown’s motion from its Statement of Law and Fact and did not abandon his
appeal but rather argued it with vigour.

I am of the opinion that this is a most objectionable
in terrorem procedure.

An accused person, on the advice of counsel, is
of the opinion that he has a serious appeal as to the quantum of sentence which
he wishes to urge before the Court of Appeal. The Crown seeks to intimidate him
from doing so by threatening that if he does urge his appeal then the Crown
will ask that the sentence be increased. If the Crown desires to obtain an
increase in sentence, then the Crown should apply for leave to appeal against
sentence and take on the burden of an appellant to which I have already
referred, rather than by threatening the accused that if he is bold enough to
assert his own right of appeal dire results will ensue.

To the foregoing reasons, I wish to add the
following.

I am of the opinion that there is another factor
of some importance. Had the Crown acted in accordance with the usual procedure
and cross-appealed against sentence as I have already pointed out, the Crown
would have had to obtain leave to do so. The time for application for leave, as
I

[Page 839]

have noted above and as fixed by Rule 12(2) of
the Criminal Appeal Rules, was within thirty days from the date of
sentence.

The sentence was passed on July 11, 1973. The
appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal by notice dated July 13, 1973 but
served on July 18, 1973. The time for application for leave to cross-appeal,
therefore, had expired on August 10, 1973. There is nothing in the appeal to
show, that the Crown had at that date any intention to cross-appeal and, in
fact, there is no indication that the Crown was considering asking for an
increase of sentence until October 16, 1973 when counsel for the Attorney
General verbally advised counsel for the appellant of an intention to ask the
Court of Appeal to increase the sentence.

If the Crown had sought to bring the matter
before the Court of Appeal at that time, it would have had to apply for an
extension of the time within which application for leave might be given. Such
application is governed by the provisions of s. 607(2) of the Code which
provides:

(2) The court of appeal or a judge thereof
may at any time extend the time within which notice of appeal or notice of an
application for leave to appeal may be given, but this subsection does not
apply where a sentence of death has been imposed pursuant to a conviction.

Although the said subsection does not set
out any criteria for the grant of such extension of time, it has been said in a
series of cases that such extension will not be granted as of course but only
upon special circumstances. So, in R. v. Raymond[12], Montgomery J.A., considering such
an application, said at p. 659:

The reason given is insufficient: It should
not be beyond human ingenuity to devise an administrative system whereby the
proper officers of the Crown could decide whether or not to appeal within 15
days of such a judgment; if this cannot be arranged, the department should make
representations to have either the Court’s rules of practice or the Criminal
Code  suitably amended. To accept this as a reason for extending the delay would
be tantamount to deciding that the Crown is more or less automatically entitled
to a delay in every case of

[Page 840]

an appeal of this nature. The accused, if
he wishes to obtain a delay, must demonstrate some special circumstances; there
is no reason why this rule should not apply to the Crown.

and in R. v. Antoine[13], Guy J.A., considering such an
application as a member of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, held that in order
to grant the application he would have had to find that there was an intention
to appeal sentence prior to the time for making the application for leave
having expired. As I have said, no such intention on the part of the Crown was
manifest in the present case.

I cite this point as further demonstration of
the fact that the Crown, by choosing the procedure it has chosen in the present
case, has in fact short-circuited the proper procedure provided in the Criminal
Code  for bringing to the Court of Appeal the Crown’s submission that a
sentence passed at trial should be increased. Not only must the Crown, under
the ordinary procedure, apply for and obtain leave to appeal but the Crown must
do so within a thirty-day period after the sentence and if the Crown does not
make application within that limited period it must obtain an extension of that
period for some special reason. None of that procedure, of course, was required
from the Grown under the circumstances existing in the present appeal.

The result of the rehearing is that the appeal
stands dismissed by a majority of five judges to four. Therefore, it is
apparent that after two arguments in this Court the appellant still is
condemned to a sentence of life imprisonment by this slim majority after an
experienced provincial court judge having heard all the evidence was of the
opinion that a twelve-year sentence was proper.

It may well be that Parliament will wish to
consider whether the provisions of s. 614  of the Criminal Code  should
be at least clarified if not amended. Parliament, in such consideration, might

[Page 841]

have regard for the fact that the statutes in
the United Kingdom, which as I have pointed out previously made specific
provision permitting the Court of Criminal Appeal to increase the appellant’s
sentence upon his application to decrease it, have been amended by the Criminal
Appeal Act, 1968 (U.K.), c. 19, s. 11(3), by which the power of
the Court of Appeal was limited to quashing the sentence or passing such
sentence or making such order as the Court thought appropriate for the case and
as the court below had power to pass or make “but the Court shall so exercise
their powers under this subsection that, taking the case as a whole, the
appellant is not more severely dealt with on appeal than he was dealt with by
the court below”. This provision was enacted despite the fact that the Crown in
the United Kingdom has no appeal against the sentence passed after trial.

For all of those reasons, I would allow the
appeal and restore the sentence imposed by the Provincial Court Judge.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Pigeon and de
Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

PIGEON J.—This case having been reheard before
the full Court I will first repeat the reasons written by me after the first
hearing.

Before Provincial Court Judge, D.V. Latimer, the
appellant pleaded guilty to charges of rape and wounding. He was sentenced to
twelve years concurrent. On his appeal against sentence, this was increased to
life imprisonment. Leave to appeal was granted by this Court on the following
question of law:

On an appeal by the accused against
sentence, where there is no cross-appeal by the Crown to have the sentence
increased does the Ontario Court of Appeal on dismissing the accused’s appeal
have the power to increase the sentence imposed upon the accused?

[Page 842]

Rather than summarize the reasons stated by
Jessup J.A. for the Court of Appeal, I will quote the essential.

The Appellant appeals his sentence of
twelve years imposed after his plea of guilty to a charge of rape and his
sentence of twelve years concurrent imposed upon his plea of guilty to a charge
of causing bodily harm with intent to wound, maim or disfigure. The sentences
having been put in issue, the Crown moves for their increase, citing Regina
v. Willis, [1969] 1 O.R. 64. The appellant was given notice of the
Crown’s motion from its Statement of Law and Fact and did not abandon his
appeal but rather argued it with vigour.

Under circumstances indicating planning and
deliberation, the appellant went at night to a home where the
fourteen-year-old, virginal complainant was baby-sitting. After assaulting her
with his fists he forcibly stripped her of all her clothes and, although she
was menstruating, then raped her. He then forced the complainant, unclothed
except for a jacket she threw on, to go outside with the evident intention of
taking her somewhere in his car. When the complainant attempted to run away he
overtook her and forced her back into the house. When the complainant then
attempted to use the telephone, the appellant knocked her to the floor and with
a paring knife stabbed her repeatedly in the face and eyes and about the throat
until the knife broke. As a result the complainant may lose the sight of one
eye. The appellant then fled the house abandoning the wounded complainant.
While the appellant had considerable to drink the evening of the crimes, there
is no suggestion that he lacked the requisite intent to commit them.

…

The reports and evidence available to the
learned Provincial Judge at the time of sentencing show that the appellant is
not insane, mentally ill or psychotic. However, he suffers from a
personality disorder manifested in impulsiveness, low stress tolerance, anger
which he does not know how to handle properly and difficulty in knowing his own
sexual identity. Dr. Karen Galbraith, a psychologist, and Dr. Peter
Rowsell, a psychiatrist, both agreed that he was dangerous to the community.
Both were testifying for the appellant.

…

[Page 843]

When an accused has been convicted of a
serious crime in itself calling for a substantial sentence and when he suffers
from some mental or personality disorder rendering him a danger to the
community but not subjecting him to confinement in a mental institution and
when it is uncertain when, if ever, the accused will be cured of his
affliction, in my opinion the appropriate sentence is one of life. Such a
sentence, in such circumstances, amounts to an indefinite sentence under which
the Parole Board can release him to the community when it is satisfied, upon
adequate psychiatric examination, it is in the interest of the accused and of
the community for him to return to society. The policy expressed in my opinion
is that of the Criminal Division of the English Court of Appeal, cf. Thomas,
Principles of Sentencing at pp. 272-279.

In the result I would dismiss the
appellant’s appeal but vary the sentence on the charge of rape by changing it
to one of life imprisonment.

On the hearing of this appeal, counsel for the
Crown objected to the jurisdiction of this Court relying on Goldhar v. The
Queen[14], v.
decision rendered on an application for leave to appeal heard by a court of
five judges in which it was held, Cartwright J. dissenting, “that this Court
has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against a sentence imposed for the
commission of an indictable offence”. In my view, that decision is not binding
and should not be followed for the following reasons.

Before the 1949 amendments, the Supreme Court
Act did not confer jurisdiction to this Court in criminal cases. This was
due to the following words in s. 36: “except in criminal causes and in
proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari or
prohibition arising out of a criminal charge”. Therefore, any jurisdiction in
criminal matters had to be found in the Criminal Code  or other statute.

In Goldhamer v. The King[15], the appeal to this Court was from
a judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal increasing the sentence passed on
conviction. This had been done on an appeal by the Crown under s. 1013  of
the Criminal Code  then in

[Page 844]

force as replaced by 1923 (Can.), c. 41,
s. 9 and reading in part as follows:

1013. A
person convicted on indictment may appeal to the Court of appeal against his
conviction,…

(2) A person convicted on indictment, or
the Attorney General, or the counsel for the Crown at the trial, may with leave
of a judge of the court of appeal, appeal to that court against the sentence
passed by the trial court, unless that sentence is one fixed by law.

…

Appeals to this Court were then governed by ss.
1024  and 1024 (a) of the Criminal Code . The latter section[16] governed appeals by leave from judgments
setting aside or affirming a conviction of an indictable offence in the case of
a conflict with a judgment of another court of appeal in a like case.
Therefore, it was clear that the only possible foundation for the appeal was in
s. 1024 of which the only relevant part, subs. 1, then read as follows:

1124. Any
person convicted of any indictable offence, whose conviction has been affirmed
on an appeal taken under section ten hundred and thirteen may appeal to
the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of such conviction:[17] Provided that no such appeal can be taken
if the court of appeal is unanimous in affirming the conviction, nor unless
notice of appeal in writing has been served on the Attorney General within
fifteen days after such affirmance or such further time as may be allowed by
the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof.

It was held that this Court had no jurisdiction
Duff J. saying:

As my brother Idington points out, the word
“conviction” cannot, perhaps, be said to be capable of only one necessarily
exclusive meaning, and it may be capable of being employed with a signification
including the sentence. Section 1013  does, however, I think, distinguish very
clearly between the conviction and the sentence for

[Page 845]

the purposes of appeal, and the Act of
13-14 Geo. V, by which the present section was brought into force, made no
change in section 1024 . Accordingly, I think the word “conviction” in the
last mentioned section should be read in its less technical sense, and
consequently that there is no right of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
from the judgment given by a court of appeal on an appeal under
subsection (2) of section 1013 .

In 1949, after the Privy Council had affirmed[18] (A.G. Ont. v. A.G. Can.) the
opinion of this Court on a reference[19] (Re
Privy Council Appeals), Parliament enacted important amendments to
the Supreme Court Act by 1949 (Can.), c. 37. Appeals to the Privy
Council which had previously been abolished in criminal matters only, by re-enacting
in 1933 s. 1024.4  of the Criminal Code , were definitely abolished
in all cases. Much wider provision than before was made for appeals by special
leave in a new s. 41, the material part of which is as follows
(parentheses indicate words deleted in 1956):

41. (1)
Subject to subsection three (and to section forty-four) an appeal
lies to the Supreme Court of Canada with leave of that court from any final or
other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge
thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be
appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, whether or not leave to appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada has been refused by any other court.

(3) No appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada lies under this section from the judgment of any court acquitting
or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an
indictable offence or, except in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction,
of an offence other than an indictable offence.

The first case in which leave to appeal in a
criminal cause was sought to be obtained under those provisions appears to be The
Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. of Canada Ltd. et al. v. The Queen. It is
unfortunately reported on the merits only[20].
The judgment appealed to this Court was a decision of the Court of Appeal for
Ontario

[Page 846]

affirming with variation an order of prohibition
issued out of the Supreme Court of Ontario under the provisions of s. 31
of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 26, as amended,
subsequent to a conviction upon indictment for an offence under that Act. The
appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario had been taken under the provisions
of the Criminal Code  pertaining to an appeal from a sentence and the
Court of Appeal had varied the judgment appealed from expressly holding it to
be a sentence by virtue of s. 1012 (e) of the Criminal
Code  providing that for the purposes of appeal: “ ‘sentence’ includes any
order of a trial court made on conviction with reference to the person
convicted …” ([1954] O.R. 377, at p. 396). The application for leave was
first heard on June 22, 1954. A re-argument was directed that took place on
December 6, 1954. On January 25, judgment granting leave was rendered by the
full Court. No written reasons were delivered and the decision was recorded as
follows in the Minute Book:

The majority being of the opinion that this
Court has jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal, the applications therefor are
allowed.

The material filed by the applicants on the
motions for leave shows that the applications were made exclusively under
s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, The decision in Goldhamer was
referred to as showing that this Court did not have jurisdiction under the Criminal
Code . On the merits, the judgment of the Court of Appeal was affirmed and
this would seem to indicate that this Court did not consider that the Court
below had erred in asserting jurisdiction to deal with the order as being a
sentence.

The next case of an application for leave to
appeal in a criminal cause under the Supreme Court Act was Parkes v.
The Queen[21]. The
subject-matter of the appeal was a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario
dismissing an appeal from a decision of a County Court judge finding

[Page 847]

that the appellant was an habitual criminal and
sentencing him to an undetermined term in the penitentiary under the provisions
of s. 660  of the Criminal Code . It was held unanimously by a Court
of five judges that such a decision is a judgment within the meaning of that
word in s. 41(1)  and does not fall within the terms of s. 41(3)  so
that this Court had jurisdiction to grant leave. In the reasons of the Court no
reference was made to the decision in the Goodyear case, but it was
referred to in the material on the application for leave. On the merits, the
appeal was allowed unanimously and the sentence of preventive detention was
quashed[22]. (This
precedent has been uniformly followed in appeals from sentences of preventive
detention, jurisdiction being asserted to hear such appeals in a number of
cases culminating in Poole v. The Queen where the majority of the full
Court held that this applied not only against the finding that the accused is
an habitual criminal but also to the conclusion that it is expedient to
sentence him to preventive detention.)

A few years later, s. 41 was considered in
connection with an offence other than an indictable offence in Smith v. The
Queen[23]. The
appeal was from the dismissal of an application for a writ of certiorari against
a finding of delinquency against a child under the Juvenile Delinquents Act.
Leave to appeal was granted subject to argument as to the right to grant
leave. On the merits, the appeal was allowed. The reasoning of Kerwin C.J. (at
p. 642), concurred in expressly by Judson J. and inferentially by the
other members of the Court, was as follows on the question of jurisdiction.

This Court had power to grant leave to
appeal under subs. (1) of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C.
1952, c. 259:

41. (1)
Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the Supreme Court with leave
of that Court from any final or other judgment of the highest court of final
resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which

[Page 848]

judgment can be had in the particular case
sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or not leave to appeal to
the Supreme Court has been refused by any other court.

Subsection (3) reads:

41. (3) No
appeal to the Supreme Court lies under this section from the judgment of
any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction
or acquittal of an indictable offence or, except in respect of a question of
law or jurisdiction, of an offence other than an indictable offence.

It has no application as the judgment of
the Court of Appeal is not one affirming a conviction.

It will be noted that up to nearly ten years
after the enactment of s. 41, this Court uniformly adhered to literal
construction and granted leave to appeal in criminal matters from any judgments
not excluded by subs. (3). Consideration must now be given to the decisions in
which a different view was taken. This will be done in chronological order.

In Goldhar v. The Queen[24], the application was for leave to
appeal a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing an appeal
against a sentence imposed on conviction for an indictable offence. In the
reasons of the majority of the five judges sitting, Fauteux J., after saying
that no right of appeal to this Court was given in such case by the provisions
of the Criminal Code , pointed out the inconsistencies that would ensue
if this Court had jurisdiction in the matter of sentence under s. 41 of
the Supreme Court Act and said (at p. 70):

I cannot think that Parliament ever
intended or even contemplated these inconsistencies flowing from either one of
these interpretations. And this, in my view, clearly indicates that it was
never intended by Parliament that the right of appeal given under s. 41
would extend to indictable offences, as distinguished from non indictable
offences.

Reference was made to Goldhamer v. The King but
not to any of the previous decisions above mentioned dealing with the
application in criminal matters of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act after
its replacement by the statute of 1949.

[Page 849]

In Paul v. The Queen[25], substantially the same reasoning
was made on an application for leave to appeal from the refusal of a Court of
Appeal to hear an appeal in a summary conviction matter or alternatively from
the dismissal of the appeal to a County Court judge. It was held on a four to
three division that this Court did not have jurisdiction. Taschereau J. (as he
then was) said (at pp. 457-458):

It was held in Goldhar v. The Queen, that
if an appeal from a sentence was not given by 41(3), nor the Criminal Code , we
could not find any authority in 41(1) to review a sentence imposed by the
Courts below. In that case it was stated by Fauteux J. with whom all the
members of the Court agreed, Cartwright J. dissenting, that in order to
determine if a convicted person could appeal against a sentence in a matter of
indictable offence, it was not permissible to look to s. 41(1)  for the
authority to intervene, but only in the Criminal Code  which does not
permit an appeal against a sentence.

The general proposition that matters which
are not mentioned in 41(3) must be taken to be included in 41(1) has been ruled
out in Goldhar, supra.

Fauteux J. said (at p. 467):

The proposition that judgments which are
not within the scope of s. 41(3) are necessarily embraced in s. 41(1)
has been ruled out in the Goldhar case, where a strict adherence to the
rule of literal construction of s. 41 was, in the matter, shown to lead to
repugnancy. Such a result would equally obtain if the judgment refusing leave
to appeal, in this case, was held to come within s. 41(1). For on the same
reasoning, one would have to hold that, for indictable offences, s. 41(1)
authorizes an appeal to this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
refusing leave to appeal to its Court from the verdict or judgment of first
instance on grounds of mixed law and facts or pure facts. Such a jurisdiction
would be inconsistent with the limitation of our jurisdiction to pure questions
of law in criminal appeals from convictions or acquittals of offences.

The majority decision in Paul v. The Queen was
followed by a Court of five judges in R. v. J.

[Page 850]

Alepin Frères Ltée[26]. Also in R.
v. MacDonald[27], a
four to three decision, an appeal by the Crown from a judgment setting aside a
sentence of preventive detention was quashed, the majority relying on the
decisions in Goldhar, Paul and Alepin Frères.

There is a clear conflict between the four last
mentioned cases and the other judgments adhering explicitly or implicitly to a
different view of s. 41. This means that on any view of the rule of stare
decisis the Court has to choose between the two conflicting views.

In my opinion, the literal construction is
preferable not only because in the absence of ambiguity the literal meaning
should always be adhered to despite any inconsistencies short of absurdity, but
also because any assumption that Parliament did not intend to depart from the
previous state of the law is unjustified. Section 41 was enacted substantially
in its present form at the time when appeals to the Privy Council were being
abolished and this court was being made truly supreme. The Privy Council had
enjoyed unlimited jurisdiction by special leave and it is apparent that the new
provision was intended to effect the change from a limited specific
jurisdiction to a broad general jurisdiction. To hold that the inconsistencies
resulting from this sweeping change indicate the intention of leaving some wide
gaps open is, in my view, entirely unwarranted. On the contrary, the enactment
of a provision that undoubtedly confers some jurisdiction in criminal matters
beyond that existing under the Criminal Code , clearly indicates
Parliament’s will to remedy the omission to extend the jurisdiction of this
Court in criminal cases when the Privy Council’s jurisdiction in such cases was
effectively abolished after the Statute of Westminster.

No reason has been advanced for construing the
words “convicting” and “conviction” in subs. (3) of s. 41 otherwise than
the same words in s. 1024.1  of the Criminal Code  in force when it
was enacted

[Page 851]

had been construed in the Goldhamer case.
It is already firmly established by a long line of cases in this Court that
those words in s. 41(3) do not include a judgment imposing a sentence of
preventive detention. It is also established by the decision of the full Court
in the Goodyear case that those same words do not apply to an order of
prohibition that was a sentence within the meaning of the definition of that
word in the same Criminal Code . Although the possibility of a
distinction with respect to other sentences was left open in Poole, this
now appears impossible on further consideration especially in view of what was
said in Goldhamer.

For those reasons, it does not appear to me that
s. 41(3) should be construed otherwise that in accordance with the strict
meaning of “convicting” and “conviction” as established by the Goldhamer decision.
This means that, in my view, the objection to jurisdiction fails. However, I
consider it appropriate to point out that such conclusion implies no departure
from our rule of never entertaining an appeal concerning the fitness of a
sentence.

Dealing now with the question on which leave was
granted in this case, the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code  are
the following:

603. (1) A
person who is convicted by a trial court in proceedings by indictment may
appeal to the court of appeal

(a) against his conviction…

or

(b) against the sentence passed by
the trial court, with leave of the court of appeal or a judge thereof unless
that sentence is one fixed by law.

605. (1) The
Attorney General or counsel instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the
court of appeal

…

(b) with leave of the court of
appeal or a judge thereof, against the sentence passed by a trial court in

[Page 852]

proceedings by indictment, unless that
sentence is one fixed by law.

607. (1) An
appellant who proposes to appeal to the court of appeal or to obtain the leave
of that court to appeal shall give notice of appeal or notice of his
application for leave to appeal, in such manner and within such period as may be
directed by rules of court.

(2) The court of appeal or a judge thereof
may at any time extend the time within which notice of appeal or notice of an
application for leave to appeal may be given, but this subsection does not
apply where a sentence of death has been imposed pursuant to a conviction.

…

614. (1)
Where an appeal is taken against sentence the court of appeal shall, unless the
sentence is one fixed by law, consider the fitness of the sentence appealed
against, and may upon such evidence, if any, as it thinks fit to require or to
receive,

(a) vary the sentence with
the limits prescribed by law for the offence of which the accused was
convicted, or

(b) dismiss the appeal.

…

(In 614(1)(a) “with” is a
typographical error, it should read “within” as in s. 593  of the Criminal
Code  as enacted by 1953-54, c. 51).

The question, in my view, is whether, on an
appeal against sentence by the accused, the words “vary the sentence within the
limits prescribed by law” are to be read as restricted to a variation by way of
reduction.

Counsel for appellant relied heavily on the
judgment of this Court in Richard v. The Queen[28]. It was an appeal in a summary
conviction case. At trial, the accused who had been charged with criminal
negligence in the operation of his motor vehicle, was convicted of the lesser
offence of driving in a manner that was dangerous to the public. On his
appeal from this conviction he was, at the end of the trial de novo, convicted
of criminal negligence as originally charged. The majority in this Court,
reversing the Ontario Court

[Page 853]

of Appeal, held that, in what is now
s. 755(1), the words “the appeal court shall hear and determine the appeal
by holding a trial de novo” meant in the case of an appeal “from
a conviction” a determination in respect of such conviction, not in respect of
the charge originally laid. Consequently, the judge hearing the appeal had no
power to enter a conviction of the more serious offence originally charged,
because the conviction for the lesser included offence involved an acquittal of
the more serious offence. There was no provision which, on an appeal by the
accused from the conviction for the lesser offence, authorized the judge
hearing such appeal to set aside that acquittal.

In my view, this decision on the construction of
a different provision concerning appeals from summary convictions is of no
assistance in the instant case. It dealt with the meaning of the words
“determine the appeal from a conviction”, while here the words used are “vary
the sentence within the limits prescribed by law”. In my view, those are plain
words which fix the scope of the power conferred upon the court by reference to
the maximum applicable penalty, irrespective of the prior decision. I am unable
to find any good reason for departing from this plain meaning or for
introducing restrictions.

A full review of the legislative history of the
enactment was made by Laskin J.A. (as he then was) in his dissenting reasons in
R. v. Willis[29]. Concerning
the power to vary mentioned in Rule 503 (Ontario) and in Rule 100 of the Supreme
Court of Canada Rules, I cannot, with respect, agree that, without those
provisions the power to increase or decrease damages in civil cases, even
without a cross-appeal or notice to vary, would exist. In my view, those rules
involve a recognition that the jurisdiction exists to do it and do not

[Page 854]

create it. Rule 100 reads:

Rule 100.—It shall not, under any
circumstances, be necessary for a respondent to give notice of motion by way of
cross-appeal, but if a respondent intends upon the hearing of an appeal to
contend that the decision of the court below should be varied, he shall, within
fifteen days after the service of the notice of appeal, or such further time as
may be prescribed by the Court or a Judge in Chambers, give notice of such
intention to all parties who may be affected thereby. The omission to give such
notice shall not in any way interfere with the power of the Court on the
hearing of an appeal to treat the whole case as open, but may, in the discretion
of the Court, be ground for an adjournment of the appeal or for special order
as to costs.

It seems to me that this provision as written
clearly implies that, once the case is inscribed in appeal, jurisdiction exists
to “treat the whole case as open”. The giving of notice to vary is only a
procedural requirement which can be remedied or waived, if omitted. The same
should be said, I think, with respect to the prescribed form for prisoner
appeals including this notification:

11. Further take notice that if you appeal
from sentence the Court of Appeal may increase your sentence without further
notice to you if the Court of Appeal considers the sentence inadequate.

Although those rules and forms cannot have the
effect of conferring a jurisdiction which the courts of appeal would not
otherwise have, they ought, I think, to be considered as of great authority in
support of the proposition that the jurisdiction does exist. I will also note
that decisions similar to that of the Ontario Court of Appeal in the Willis case
were rendered by the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Christakos[30] and by the Quebec Court of Appeal
in Valade v. R.[31]

[Page 855]

If the accused had not been given adequate
notice that at the hearing of his appeal, consideration would be given to an
increase in his sentence, I would think that the same rule ought to be applied
as in Lowry and Lepper v. The Queen[32]
where sentence was passed without hearing submissions. It would have to be held
that the accused was not given an opportunity to be heard before the adverse
determination was made against him. In this case however, counsel for the Crown
made it known prior to the hearing that an increased sentence would be
required. This was mentioned in the statement of fact and law filed by the Crown
on the appeal.

Due to this notice, it seems to me that the
objection to jurisdiction is based purely on a matter of form. Counsel for the
Crown could, under s. 605(b) apply for leave to appeal against the
sentence. The time for making this application is not fixed by law and may be
extended at any time by the Court of Appeal under s. 607 as well as Rule
28(1) of the Supreme Court of Ontario Criminal Appeal Rules.

Even assuming that an application by counsel for
the Crown to the Court of Appeal was necessary for directing an increase in
sentence, I fail to see what could prevent the Court at the hearing of the
appeal from treating the statement of fact and law as a notice of appeal and
granting an extension of time, no question could be raised as to counsel’s
instructions, R. v. Badall[33]. To
say that the Court of Appeal lacked jurisdiction because all this was not
spelled out in a formal order is, in my view, to treat as going to jurisdiction
a purely formal objection. Sometimes, as in Dennis v. The Queen[34], a failure to comply with certain
formalities is destructive of jurisdiction, but this is so only when, by law,
jurisdiction is made dependent on a particular formality that was omitted. This
is not one of those cases as I see it.

[Page 856]

I would also consider as without substance the
objection that, under s. 614(1) the Court of Appeal may vary the sentence or
dismiss the appeal and therefore cannot do both as was done by the formal
order in this case. What was intended to be done is abundantly clear: it was to
vary the sentence. This cannot be nullified by the superfluous addition of
words purporting to dismiss the appeal.

It does not appear to me that the construction
of s. 514 Cr. C. can be influenced by consideration of s. 4(3)
of the United Kingdom Criminal Appeal Act 1907 (7 Edw. VII, c. 23)
which was in the following terms:

4. (3) On an appeal against sentence the
Court of Criminal Appeal shall, if they think that a different sentence should
have been passed, quash the sentence passed at the trial, and pass such other
sentence warranted in law by the verdict (whether more or less severe) in
substitution therefor as they think ought to have been passed, and in any other
case shall dismiss the appeal.

It must first be noted that the United Kingdom
Act gave a right of appeal to the person convicted only, not to the Crown as
well. In such a situation, one can readily see why it was deemed necessary to
provide explicitly that, on an appeal, the Court would have jurisdiction, not
only to decrease, but also to increase the sentence. No such implication ever
arose under our Code in which there is a right of appeal by the Crown as
well as by the person convicted.

It must also be considered that while the
sections of our Criminal Code  dealing with appeals were, in 1923,
generally replaced by verbatim copies of the corresponding provisions of the
above-mentioned U.K. Act, such was not the case with respect to the particular
provision with which we are here concerned. The right of appeal from sentence
by the Crown as well as by the person convicted was preserved. Section 1015(1) 
defining the powers of the Court of Appeal on appeals against sentence was a
re-enactment of s. 1055A enacted by 1921 (Can.) c. 25, s. 22, as
noted by Laskin J.A., as he then was, in R. v. Willis, supra,

[Page 857]

at p. 73, it was not copied from
s. 4(3) of the U.K. Act, anymore than present s. 614  was.

I should also say that I doubt very much
whether, in any case, the omission in an enactment of some words found in a
similar enactment of another jurisdiction can ever have the effect of
restricting the clear meaning of the words actually used. Would not this imply
that words used elsewhere could never be omitted as surplusage?

Concerning the propriety of Crown prosecutors,
on an appeal from sentence by the accused, requesting an increase without a
formal inscription in appeal to that end, I would quote those words of Goddard
L.C.J. spoken on behalf of a Court on which he sat with Lewis J. and Denning J.
(as he then was) (Re: Harry John McBain[35],
at pp. 114-5):

The appellant was convicted on the clearest
possible evidence, and was sentenced to three years’ penal servitude. He had
not been convicted before. He applied for leave to appeal against both
conviction and sentence. The Court refused his application for leave to appeal
against conviction, but gave him leave to appeal against sentence for one
reason only, in order that it might consider whether or not it should
substantially increase his sentence.

Hitherto, when this Court has considered an
application for leave to appeal against sentence, and has formed the opinion
that the sentence was not severe enough, it has generally warned the applicant
that if he persists in his appeal the Court may increase his sentence. This
Court no longer intends to take that course. The Criminal Appeal Act, 1907,
does not require it, but by section 4(3) provides that where a prisoner
applies for and obtains leave to appeal against his sentence, this Court, if it
thinks that a different sentence should have been passed, shall pass such
sentence as it thinks ought to have been passed, whether greater or less than
the sentence actually passed.

In that case there was no increased sentence,
but the benefit of time served pending judgment in

[Page 858]

appeal was denied. However, three other cases
are noted in which a two year increase was ordered. Two other such cases are
noted in the 1962 Criminal Law Review (pp. 495, 853). It is true that
the United Kingdom Parliament provided by the Criminal Appeal Act 1968
(U.K.), c. 19 s. 11(3), that the Court of Appeal shall so exercise
their powers that the appellant is not more severely dealt with on appeal than
he was dealt with by the Court below. However, the Canadian Parliament has not
so amended s. 614(1) Cr. C. and has not repealed the right of
appeal by the Crown against sentence.

Inasmuch as counsel for the accused had
reasonable notice that an increased sentence was sought and opportunity to be
heard on that, as was the case herein as in Willis, every essential of
proper judicial conduct was met. On any view of this case, there is no basis
for adverse comment against counsel for the Crown or the Court below.

At the rehearing, counsel for the appellant
pressed the argument that, if the power of the Court of appeal was sought to be
supported on the basis that it could grant an extension of time to the Crown
for a cross-appeal against sentence and treat its request for an increase as
such a cross-appeal, the accused was entitled to urge that no proper ground was
established for such use of the Court’s discretion. In my opinion, the mere
fact that the Court of Appeal at the hearing feels that there are serious
grounds to question the adequacy of the sentence is quite sufficient to justify
a decision to grant an extension and entertain submissions on that issue,
provided the accused is not taken by surprise and given an adequate opportunity
to be heard on the point. Furthermore, I remain of opinion that upon any appeal
against sentence for an indictable offence the Court of Appeal has anyway full
jurisdiction to vary as deemed proper.

I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 859]

de Grandpré J. also concurred in the judgment of

RITCHIE J.—I have had the advantage of reading
the reasons for judgment of the other members of the Court which were delivered
on the first hearing of this appeal and I agree with their unanimous conclusion
as to the jurisdiction of this Court.

The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal of
Ontario was invoked by the appellant himself in accordance with the provisions
of ss. 603 , 607  and 614  of the Criminal Code , and s. 614(1)  makes
it plain that in the exercise of that jurisdiction the court “shall …
consider the fitness of the sentence.” In the discharge of this duty, the court
is not limited to considerations affecting the appellant but must also have
regard to the welfare of the community and the public interest generally. The
deterrent effect which the sentence may have on others and to some extent the
standards which have been established in other cases of a like kind, are also
relevant and in the present case the stark horror of the crime itself would of
necessity be compelling consideration.

Parliament having fixed the Court of Appeal with
the obligation to “consider the fitness of the sentence”, it would, in my view,
require clear statutory language to limit that consideration to the question of
whether the sentence was too severe while precluding any consideration of
whether it was severe enough. There is no such language in the Criminal
Code , and I am of opinion that the opening paragraph of s 614(1)
constitutes a mandatory directory direction to the Court of Appeal to consider
both aspects of the question.

In the result, where an appeal against sentence
is taken by the person convicted seeking to have the sentence reduced, the
court may see fit to increase the sentence and this is a risk to which all such
persons are exposed whether or not the Attorney General has appealed.
Conversely, where an appeal is taken against sentence by the Attorney General
seeking to have the sentence increased,

[Page 860]

the court may consider it fitting to reduce the
sentence and is empowered so to order without any appeal having been asserted
by the convicted person.

Whether an appeal is taken by the accused or at
the instance of the Attorney General, it is characterized in the Criminal
Code  as an appeal “against the sentence” and in either event the only
restriction upon the power of the court to vary the sentence is that contained
in s. 614(1) (a) which provides in effect that the sentence can only
be varied “within the limits prescribed by law for the offence of which the
accused was convicted”.

It has been suggested that as the powers of
s. 614(1)(a) and (b) are phrased in the alternative, the
section does not permit a court to exercise its jurisdiction under both
subsections in the same case and that it must choose whether it is to vary
the sentence or dismiss the appeal. In the present case the court ordered that
the appeal be dismissed “but that the sentence of twelve (12) years on the
charge of rape should be varied to one of life imprisonment”. I take the view
that in exercising its power to increase the sentence the Court of Appeal by
implication dismissed the appellant’s appeal and that the portion of the formal
judgment ordering that the appeal be dismissed was pure surplusage which in no
way vitiates the order.

As I have indicated, I am of opinion that the
Court of Appeal has power to increase a sentence when an appeal is taken in
accordance with s. 603(1) by a person who has been convicted at trial and
that this power is in no way dependant upon an appeal being asserted by the
Attorney General under s. 605. I would accordingly answer the question of
law upon which leave to appeal was granted in the affirmative.

I would accordingly dismiss this appeal.

BEETZ J. (dissenting)—After a rehearing
of this appeal, I see no reason to alter the views I had previously expressed.
[v. infra]

[Page 861]

BEETZ J. (dissenting) [after the
first hearing]—I agree with Mr. Justice Pigeon as to the jurisdiction of
this Court to hear this appeal. But I find myself in agreement with
Mr. Justice Spence’s analysis and construction of s. 614  of the Criminal
Code .

By virtue of s. 603(1)(b) and
s. 605(1)(b), a person convicted by a trial court and the Attorney
General may both, with leave of the Court of Appeal or a judge thereof, appeal
the sentence passed by the trial court. The wording of s. 614  reflects
both possibilities in a single enactment. However, such economy of words was
not, in my view, meant to relieve the Attorney General from the need to seek
leave and, such leave being granted, from actually appealing, merely because a
convicted person avails himself of his right to try to have his sentence
reduced. Nor does s. 614  give to the Court of Appeal jurisdiction to hear
what amounts to an appeal as of right by the Crown where the Code explicitly
provides against such a right and where no formal notice was given to the
convicted person. Even if failure to observe formalities relating to
application for leave, to the granting of leave and to notice may be remedied
in time, it was not remedied in this case.

I would dispose of this appeal as is proposed by
Mr. Justice Spence.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Abuse of process—Delay in
instituting prosecution—Witness deceased—Prejudice to accused—Stay of
proceedings—Jurisdiction of the Courts—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, ss. 7(3), 602, 605(1).

On February 26, 1973, an information was
sworn against the appellant alleging a kidnapping and robbery committed on October 5, 1971. A warrant was issued and the
appellant was later arrested on April 3, 1973. At the opening of the trial, the
County Court judge granted a stay of the proceedings on the ground that the
accused was prejudiced because of the delay in commencing the prosecution, a
person who would have been a key witness having died in the interval. An application
for mandamus was dismissed by a judge of the Supreme Court of British
Columbia on the basis that the trial judge had jurisdiction to do what he had
done and, having exercised his discretion bona fide, his decision could
not be revised. The Court of Appeal unanimously held that inordinate delay was
not a fact which would give discretion to the County Court judge to stay the
proceedings, reversed the judgment of the Supreme Court and granted the mandamus.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: There is no rule in our criminal
law that prosecutions must be instituted promptly and ought not to be permitted
to be proceeded with if a delay in instituting them may have caused prejudice
to the accused. Nor is there any general discretionary power in courts of
criminal jurisdiction to stay proceedings regularly instituted because the
prosecution is considered oppressive.

The absence of any provision in the Criminal
Code  contemplating the staying of an indictment by a trial judge or an
appeal from such decision is a strong indication against the existence of any
power to grant such stay. Section 7(3)  of the Criminal Code  which
preserves common law defences does not apply to a discretionary stay of
proceedings.

[Page 1022]

Per Laskin
C.J. and Judson, Spence and Dickson JJ.: The principle that a criminal court,
like a civil court, is entitled to protect its process from abuse, being
recognized, the question of discretion becomes a matter of discipline, keyed to
particular situations which, as an outgrowth of case law, commend themselves as
of a kind in which the principle may be raised. Every court having criminal
jurisdiction has the power to stay proceedings which are an abuse of process or
oppressive and vexatious.

However, the power to prevent abuses of
process is one of special application and its exercise cannot be a random one.
In this case, there is no basis, despite the allegations of prejudice, upon
which abuse of process could be invoked. Prosecutions initiated a lengthy
period after the alleged commission of an offence must be left to take their
course and to be dealt with by the court on the evidence, which judges are
entitled to weigh for cogency as well as credibility.

APPEAL from a judgment of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal[1],
reversing a judgment

[Page 1023]

of the British Columbia Supreme Court[2], dismissing an application for mandamus against
a County Court judge who had granted a stay of proceedings. Appeal dismissed
and stay of proceedings set aside.

Sidney B. Simons and Peter Jensen, for
the appellant.

John E. Hall, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Judson, Spence
and Dickson JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This appeal, which is here by
leave of this Court, raises five related questions. They are (1) whether there
is a principle of abuse of process which a trial judge may invoke to stay
proceedings against an accused on a criminal charge; (2) if so, whether that
principle could properly be invoked in the present case; (3) if so, whether a
County Court judge presiding at the trial of the accused has the power to order
a stay or whether prohibition must be resorted to in a superior Court; and (4)
if there is such power in the County Court judge, whether its exercise is reviewable
by way of mandamus; and (5) if so, whether the British Columbia Court of
Appeal erred in this case in reversing the judgment of Rae J. who refused an
order of mandamus to Ladner Co. Ct. J. to proceed with the trial of the
accused.

The abuse of process alleged in this case
relates to the delay of the police over a time period of not quite twenty
months to arrest the accused on charges of offences committed on October 5,
1971, with the result that by the time he was arrested on April 3, 1973,
pursuant to a warrant issued on February 26, 1973, and by the time his
preliminary inquiry was held in June, 1973, certain persons, who would have
been available as witnesses, if the police had acted more promptly, had either
died or had left the vicinity, their whereabouts unknown. The accused
contended, and the County Court judge agreed, that the police knew as much
about the alleged offences shortly after October 5,

[Page 1024]

1971 as they knew at the time they moved to
arrest the accused about twenty months later and, in the meantime, a bottle
allegedly containing some fingerprints had been destroyed and two persons who
would have been material witnesses for the accused had become unavailable, one
having died and the other having disappeared.

It appears from the record that, on
investigating the offences later charged against the accused, the Vancouver police issued a pick-up request
for his arrest but no warrant was issued until February 26, 1973, the date on which an
information was sworn in respect of the offences. The accused was known to the Vancouver police, having been arrested
under a bench warrant on October 4, 1971, at Vancouver with respect to a traffic charge. He was released the next day (the
day on which the offences involved herein were allegedly committed) under a
direction to appear on October 29 to answer the traffic charge. He failed to
appear and a bench warrant was issued to arrest him in respect of this matter
but nothing was done at that time about seeking his arrest on the charges
involved in this case. The accused alleged that he was working in the Creston
area of British Columbia during the period between the date of the offences and
his arrest, there being no attempt to conceal his whereabouts, and that he was
known in that area.

When the accused appeared for trial on November 21, 1973, and the indictment against him
was preferred, his counsel moved before plea that the presiding County Court
judge stay the proceedings as an abuse of process. This the trial judge did,
saying in his reasons that he was moved to do so not because of unconscionable
delay alone—and he found that there was such delay—but because associated
therewith were facts which were prejudicial to the accused, namely, the
destruction of evidence and the unavailability of witnesses. The trial judge
concluded that to refuse a stay would be to deny to the accused his right to a
fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. He thus
invoked, without express reference however, s. 2(e) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights. I am unable to appreciate the application of this

[Page 1025]

provision to the issue of abuse of process as it
arises on the facts in this case, and so I propose to deal with that issue as
one not dependent on the Canadian Bill of Rights.

The present case, so far as I am aware, and so
far as the researches of counsel have disclosed, is the first in which abuse of
process is raised in connection with a delay of the police authorities to bring
charges against an accused and thus (as he alleges) to prejudice him in his
ability to meet them. There is no suggestion that the delay in taking steps to
apprehend the accused was deliberate, or the result of some design to make it
more difficult for him to offer a defence. Since there is no statute of limitations
in respect of the offences (kidnapping and robbery) with which the accused was
charged, the question arises whether there can be, perhaps by analogy to laches
in equity, any principle of foreclosure of prosecution by reason of delay in
laying of charges after police investigation has run its course.

The Crown moved against the trial judge’s stay
by mandamus but it was refused by Rae J. who held on the authority of Regina
v. Koski[3], a
decision of Munroe J., a brother judge in the same Court, that the County Court
judge had jurisdiction in appropriate circumstances to order the stay, and that
since he had made the order in the bona fide exercise of his discretion
and on evidence adduced before him, there was no reviewable issue on mandamus.
The British Columbia Court of Appeal agreed that there was jurisdiction,
not confined to superior courts, to order a stay of criminal proceedings in the
exercise of discretion for abuse of process on the part of the prosecution
(adopting in this connection the views of the Ontario Court of Appeal in The
Queen v. Osborn[4]), but
it did not agree that the facts of the present case warranted the exercise of
that discretion in favour of a stay. The pivotal question, however, was whether
the Crown could successfully invoke mandamus to set aside the stay, and
on this point the British Columbia Court of Appeal concluded that mandamus lay
and should be

[Page 1026]

directed to the trial judge to require him to
proceed with the trial.

The British Columbia Court of Appeal ordered mandamus
on the ground that “the County Court judge declined to exercise his
jurisdiction to hear and determine the case upon a point clearly preliminary to
the proceeding and upon matters which preceded the preferring of the
indictment”. I take this to mean that it was not open to the trial judge to
base his stay of proceedings on the fact of the dilatory investigation into the
offences with which the accused was later charged. Speaking for the British
Columbia Court of Appeal, McIntyre J.A. noted in the course of his resons that

…The complaint is made not of the manner in
which the prosecution itself has been conducted nor of the form or nature of
the indictment but solely of matters which arose in the investigatory stages
and before the indictment was preferred…

An issue was raised by the accused at the
opening of this appeal as to the power and scope of power of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal to entertain an appeal from the refusal of Rae J. to
give an order of mandamus. The power is expressly set out in s. 719(1) 
of the Criminal Code , and s. 719(2)  makes applicable mutatis
mutandis Part XVIII of the Code which embraces rights of appeal to
the Supreme Court of Canada. Leave having been granted, the appeal is properly
here and must be governed by the scope of review open in mandamus proceedings.

Mandamus will
lie, of course, to compel an inferior Court to exercise its jurisdiction but it
will not go if the only issue is that such a Court has, in the course of its
jurisdiction exercised a discretion in a particular way. The burden of the
reasons given by Rae J. in refusing to order mandamus is that the County
Court judge had power to stay proceedings for abuse of process, and that in
granting the stay he had exercised his discretion in the matter on evidence which
he assessed and that his determination was, accordingly, not challengeable by mandamus.
The British Columbia Court of Appeal accepted that the County Court judge

[Page 1027]

had the power to order a stay for abuse of
process but, as I understand its reasons, the power was incidental to his
jurisdiction over the accused and over the offences charged against the accused
which were before him for trial; the order for a stay was a determination of an
issue preliminary or collateral to trial, resulting in a refusal to exercise
jurisdiction and was hence reviewable on mandamus.

If I have correctly assessed the reasons of the
British Columbia Court of Appeal, I cannot agree with them. What the trial
judge did was done in the course of a jurisdiction which he admittedly
possessed, that is jurisdiction to try the accused for the offences charged
against him. I do not think that the matter involved calls for a refined
determination of whether the trial had begun at the time the application for a
stay was made. It may be that for some purposes it had not yet begun, but we
are concerned here with an issue of jurisdiction and the questioning of an
exercise thereof by a prerogative writ. The relevant question, in my opinion,
is whether the County Court judge committed an error of law in purporting to
exercise a discretion on grounds that did not call for it or, to put the matter
another way, on a basis which did not raise the issue on which discretion was
exercised. If that be so, mandamus would lie to compel him to proceed
with the trial of the charges preferred against the accused. We are not
concerned here with a statutory discretion but with one alleged to reside in
the judge as an aspect of his control over the process of the Court in which he
presides, involving a power to prevent its abuse by directing a stay of
proceedings.

I come then to the two central questions in this
case, namely, first, whether abuse of process is a ground upon which a Court
may direct a stay of criminal proceedings and, second, whether if there is such
a doctrine it extends to delay in charging an accused where that delay is
associated with likely prejudice to his defence.

[Page 1028]

The seminal Canadian case on abuse of process as
a ground for a judicial stay of criminal proceedings is The Queen v. Osborn,
supra, reversed on appeal to this Court. In that case, the accused was
indicted on a charge of conspiracy to utter forged documents some eight months
after he had been acquitted on a directed verdict of a substantive forgery
offence, the same facts being involved in the conspiracy charge. The Crown had
appealed unsuccessfully against the directed acquittal before laying the new
charge which came on for trial eight months after it was laid. At this second
trial, the trial judge rejected the plea of autrefois acquit and
incident thereto rejected an assertion of res judicata; and, although
urged to exercise a discretion to stay the indictment as oppressive and an
abuse of process, he proceeded with the trial without ruling on whether he had
such a discretionary power. The accused was convicted and the sole ground of
appeal was that the trial judge had a discretion to stay proceedings as
oppressive and vexatious, amounting to an abuse of process, and should have
done so.

The Ontario Court of Appeal (and I point out
that I was then a member of the Court assigned to the appeal) did not go beyond
the ground raised, namely abuse of process, in dealing with the appeal, and
hence gave no consideration to res judicata which was considered and
applied by this Court in the later case of Kienapple v. The Queen[5]. Two propositions were enunciated by
the Ontario Court of Appeal in the Osborn case; first, the inherent
jurisdiction of a Court in civil cases to prevent abuse of process through
oppressive or vexatious proceedings was also exercisable in criminal
proceedings and the policy considerations expressed by Lord Devlin in Connelly
v. Director of Public Prosecutions[6], at
p. 442 were apt; and second, it was a discretionary jurisdiction or, as I
prefer to call it, a discretionary power, the exercise of which ought to have
been considered on the facts of the Osborn case. Since the trial judge
had not addressed himself to the issue, the Court of Appeal must do so.

[Page 1029]

The Court declared that it was not prepared to
say that the laying of a second charge on the same facts was ipso facto a
ground for exercising the power to stay. To use the words of Jessup J.A.,
speaking for the Court (at p. 157):

The discretion is to be exercised in favour
of an accused only where a real injustice will otherwise result, but such a
case should be rare. It should always be invoked before arraignment on the
indictment alleged to be oppressive and cannot be raised after trial on such an
indictment.

In the particular case, the Court of Appeal
concluded that “the long delay coupled with the Crown’s intervening appeal
results in unjust oppressiveness from the second indictment;” and, being of the
opinion that the trial judge should accordingly have stayed proceedings on that
indictment, the Court quashed the conviction thereon and directed an acquittal.

On further appeal to this Court the conviction
was restored, but no majority view emerged as to whether a Court could stay or
dismiss criminal proceedings by reason of abuse of process or whether a Court’s
power to prevent abuse of process extended to staying a second charge arising
out of the same facts on which an accused was previously acquitted or convicted
where a plea of autrefois or of issue estoppel was inapplicable.
Although the seven-Judge Court
was unanimous in result, six of the members of the Court had divided opinions
and the seventh, Fauteux C.J.C., merely agreed that the appeal should be
allowed and the conviction restored, giving no indication of any view on the
issues in the appeal.

Hall J., speaking also for Ritchie and Spence
JJ., declared that the question of the Court’s jurisdiction to intervene to
prevent an abuse of process did not arise because, on the record, there was no
evidence of oppression. An examination of the course of proceedings persuaded
him that such delays as may have occurred were attributable in the main to the
accused and not to the Crown, nor could anything be made of the fact that the
Crown

[Page 1030]

appealed the acquittal on the first charge, its
right to do so being statutory. Pigeon J., with whom Martland and Judson JJ.
concurred, expressed the view that there was no rule in Canada that a trial judge had a discretion
to stay proceedings on a second indictment because of injustice amounting to
oppression, when successive charges are brought against an accused on the same
facts. He rejected any reliance on the opinion in the Connelly case
because in England at that time the Court of Appeal had no such power, as
appellate Courts in Canada have long had, to order a new trial when quashing a
conviction, and hence it could be said to be unfair to allow a second trial on
the same facts under a new charge when there could not be a retrial of the
offence first charged. Moreover, although the House of Lords suggested that it
would be a desirable rule of practice to include in one indictment all charges
arising out of the same facts, the proposed rule was not applied in the
particular case and there was unanimity that no unfairness arose in charging
and convicting the accused of robbery after his conviction of murder in the
course of the robbery was quashed for misdirection. Pigeon J. concluded that
there was no unfairness or oppression under Canadan criminal law in obliging an
accused to stand trial on the same charge if a conviction thereon is quashed
because of an error in the course of his trial; and he held that no different
view should be taken if, after an incorrect charge is laid and an acquittal
results, the accused is correctly charged with a different offence on the same
facts.

There is no assertion by Pigeon J. in the Osborn
case that a Court may not in any circumstances stay or dismiss criminal
proceedings for abuse of process, and this question was more explicitly left
open by Hall J. in that case. What my brother Pigeon made clear was that abuse
of process could

[Page 1031]

not be invoked to warrant a stay of proceedings
against a prosecution on a second charge on the same facts on which a directed
verdict of acquittal was entered on a different earlier charge. This Court in Osborn
did not consider whether res judicata or issue estoppel applied.
That was a matter with which it had been concerned in the earlier case of Wright,
McDermott and Feeley v. The Queen[7], and
it later applied the doctrine in Kienapple, both Judson and Pigeon JJ.
joining in the majority judgment and the entire Court accepting it as
applicable in criminal proceedings but being divided on whether it should be
applied on the facts of the Kienapple case. The issue that was raised in
Osborn was a more generalized one but, as happens with general
propositions, their scope must be tested by concrete situations through which a
measure or measures of their ambit may be formulated.

So it is here. In a broad sense, pleas of autrefois
convict and acquit, and of res judicata and issue estoppel
may be said to be aspects of abuse of process; they may be regarded as
crystallized means of control, having a particular ambit of operation but not
exhaustive of the scope of abuse of process. To recognize it as a desirable
general notion for judicial control of the criminal process does not mean that
its only bounds are the discretion of a trial judge which must inevitably be
respected. That discretion must itself be addressed to situations capable of
being embraced in the general notion and cannot itself be the touchstone of
abuse of process.

One such situation, recognized long ago in case
law, arises where use is sought to be made of the criminal courts to collect a
debt or to realize on some civil claim: see Rex v. Leroux[8]; Rex v. Bell[9];

[Page 1032]

Regina v. Leclair[10]; Re
State of Nebraska
and Morris[11]. Another situation, in which there is a
spectrum of cases and where their disparate facts do not admit of common
treatment, is that which arises when a charge is withdrawn or dismissed for
want of prosecution and then re‑laid: see Regina v. Koski, supra, (where
there were numerous delays in proceeding against a juvenile, none of them
caused by the accused, and where after accused appeared for trial with a number
of witnesses for the second time, an adjournment was sought by the Crown and
was refused by the Court which dismissed the charges for want of prosecution
and subsequently ordered a stay of proceedings when a new information was sworn
containing the same charges); Regina v. Heric[12] (where adjournment refused to Crown
and charge dismissed when no evidence presented, and where new charge, laid on
same facts, held to be abuse of process but res judicata also held to be
available to accused); Re Davis and The Queen13[13] (stay of proceedings to cure procedural
error and re-laying of information not an abuse of process); Attorney-General
for Saskatchewan v. McDougall[14] (charge
withdrawn after plea of not guilty and several adjournments and then re-laid
and after further adjournments accused acquitted after trial; Crown on appeal
by way of trial de novo proposing to lead evidence not presented to
Court of first instance; held to be abuse of process); Regina v. Kowerchuk[15] (not an abuse of process where
Crown at time of trial withdrew charge and laid new information for virtually
same drug offence because unable to produce analyst as required witness on
charge as originally laid); Regina v. Del Puppo[16] (abuse of process where, inter
alia, after charge dismissed for want of procesution following delays and
adjournment new information sworn on same

[Page 1033]

charge to get around Court’s refusal to grant
another adjournment).

A variation on this situation is the attempt to
proceed on a second identical information after the accused has been discharged
following a preliminary inquiry: see Re Sheehan and the Queen[17] (prohibition granted but Court
recognized indictment could be preferred with consent of Judge or of
Attorney-General pursuant to Cr. Code, s. 505(4)).

Abuse of process has been put forward in a
number of Canadian cases as a ground for staying or prohibiting criminal
proceedings where there has been excessive and unexplained delay in bringing
the accused to trial after the charge or after committal for trial: see Regina
v. Falls and Nobes[18] (frequent
delays because of non-appearance of complainant and accused appearing 16 and 17
times respectively over a period of about two years during which time charge
withdrawn and re-laid; delay oppressive and prejudicial to accused and
proceedings stayed); Regina v. Burns, Fairchild and Donnelly[19] (no abuse of process where delay
between preliminary hearing and trial not occasioned by Crown); Regina v.
Thorpe[20] (two‑year
unexplained delay of Crown after committal for trial before trial date fixed
held to be prejudicial to fair trial and abuse of process); Re Vroom and
Lacey v. The Queen[21] (no
abuse of process by mere fact of repeated delays, although none attributable to
the accused, or by reason of the swearing of three successive informations
where they all concerned the same charge).

Abuse of process as a ground for staying
proceedings was invoked where an accused was removed for trial to a place
remote from that

[Page 1034]

where the offences were allegedly committed and
was prejudiced in his ability, by reason, for example, of prohibitive cost, to
bring witnesses, and thus denied his right to make full answer and defence: see
Regina v. Ittoshat[22]. Again, abuse of process was made the
ground of a stay of proceedings in a case where the accused committed the
alleged offence at the instigation of a police officer who instilled the idea
and actively persuaded and encouraged the accused to carry it out: see Regina v. Shipley[23]. This Court dealt with a similar
situation, one going beyond the involvement of an agent provocateur, in Lemieux
v. The Queen[24], where
Judson J. for the Court held that an accused could not be found guilty of
breaking and entering a dwelling house where the scheme to entrap the accused
had been set up by the police with an informer and the owner of the dwelling
house had cooperated, giving possession of the house to the police who had
urged the informer to break in with the assistance of others including the
accused.

I have paraded this long list of cases to show how
varied are the fact situations in which judges of different levels and of
different Provinces have used abuse of process as a way of controlling
prosecution behaviour which operates prejudicially to accused persons. I pass
no judgment on the correctness of any of the decisions, but they do indicate by
their very diversity the utility of a general principle of abuse of process
which judges should be able to invoke in appropriate circumstances to mark
their control of the process of their Courts and to require fair behaviour of
the Crown towards accused persons. It will not escape notice that the decisions
I have cited are almost all quite recent, and a perusal of them would reveal
how much they have been influenced by Connelly v. Director of Public Prosecutions,
supra, and particularly by the reasons of Lord Devlin in that case.

[Page 1035]

Although the members of the House of Lords in Connelly
were unanimous in sustaining the conviction of robbery (charged in a
separate indictment and arising out of the same facts which supported an
indictment for murder tried previously and on which a conviction was recorded
which was quashed on appeal for misdirection), they were also unanimous that,
as Lord Reid put it, “there must always be a residual discretion to prevent
anything that savours of abuse of process”: [1964] 2 All E.R. 401, at
p. 406. The leading judgment on this question was that of Lord Devlin who
was supported in his views thereon by concurring reasons of Lord Reid and Lord
Pearce. The disagreement of Lord Morris and Lord Hodson related to their
apprehension of allowing mere judicial discretion, as, for example discretion
to stay an indictment, to determine the limits of abuse of process as a means
of controlling criminal proceedings, a point to which I adverted earlier in
these reasons. Thus, Lord Hodson said in his reasons (at p. 432):

…I cannot concede that there ought to be
given to the judge a discretion, which in my opinion he has not hitherto been
allowed, to interfere with anything that he personally thinks is unfair. If one
disclaims such a proposal but seeks to substitute a discretion to determine, in
accordance with principle, whether or not a prosecution should be stopped, I do
not know what principle can be applied. In the case now under consideration
different judges will as the history of the case shows, have different views as
to what is unfair and I should find the discretion, if there is one, immensely
difficult to exercise at all, nor should I know how to exercise it judicially.
If there were such a discretion I do not understand why so many cases have been
decided and so much learning has been expended in considering the doctrine of
autrefois convict and autrefois acquit. Has all this been a waste of judicial
time? It would seem so if all the judge had to do was to exercise his
discretion whether or not a second indictment in such a case as this should be
allowed to proceed. After all, the cases, although they may not all be
consistent and may be difficult to justify on the basis of autrefois acquit or
autrefois convict, seem to me to cling at least to the central principle that a
second trial is permissible on a charge, other than that dealt with at the
first trial,

[Page 1036]

arising out of the same facts and involving
an issue not disposed of at the first trial;…

Lord Morris expressed himself in two passages of
his extensive reasons as follows:

The power (which is inherent in a court’s
jurisdiction) to prevent abuses of its process and to control its own procedure
must in a criminal court include a power to safeguard an accused person from
oppression or prejudice. That power, as is demonstrated by a stream of
authority to which I will refer, has, however, never been regarded as endowing
a court with a power to say that evidence given in reference to one charge may
not be repeated in reference to another and different charge. Nor does it
enable a court to order that a prosecution be dropped merely because of some
rather imprecise regret that an accused should have to face another charge.

…

…It would, in my judgment, be an
unfortunate innovation if it were held that the power of a court to prevent any
abuse of its process or to ensure compliance with correct procedure enabled a
judge to suppress a prosecution merely because he regretted that it was taking
place. There is no abuse of process if to a charge which is properly brought
before the court and which is framed in an indictment to which no objection can
in any way be taken there is no plea such as that of autrefois acquit or
convict which can successfully be made.

Although Lord Devlin viewed abuse of process in
a wider compass, he too did not regard it as coincident with any discretion
which a trial judge might exercise. His exposition of abuse of process as a
means of judicial control of the criminal process was related mainly to a
contention by the Crown that “[it] has a right to bring forward its case in as
many indictments as it chooses and that the court is bound to proceed on each
of them, whether or not it considers that the Crown is behaving oppressively”
(at p. 438). Lord Devlin rejected the submission that the danger of abuse
is a matter for the Crown, which should be trusted not to abuse its powers.
Considering the point to be one of great constitutional importance he said that
“The courts cannot contemplate for a moment the transference to the executive
of the responsibil-

[Page 1037]

ity for seeing that the process of law is not
abused” (at p. 442). He developed his approach to the contention of the
Crown on three bases, as follows (at p. 438):

…First, a general power, taking various
specific forms, to prevent unfairness to the accused has always been a part of
the English criminal law and I shall illustrate this with special reference to
the framing of indictments. Secondly, if the power of the prosecutor to spread
his case over any number of indictments was unrestrained, there could be grave
injustice to defendants. Thirdly, a controlling power of this character is well
established in the civil law.

His conclusion from his examination of those
three matters was stated in these words (at p. 446):

The result of this will, I think, be as
follows. As a general rule a judge should stay an indictment (that is, order
that it remain on the file not to be proceeded with) when he is satisfied that
the charges therein are founded on the same facts as the charges in a previous
indictment on which the accused has been tried, or form or are a part of a
series of offences of the same or a similar character as the offences charged
in the previous indictment. He will do this because as a general rule it is
oppressive to an accused for the prosecution not to use r.3 [of Sch. 1 to the Indictments
Act, 1915, permitting joinder of charges in one indictment if they are
founded on the same facts or are part of a series of offences of the same or a
similar character] where it can properly be used, but a second trial on the
same or similar facts is not always and necessarily oppressive, and there may
in a particular case be special circumstances which make it just and convenient
in that case. The judge must then, in all the circumstances of the particular
case, exercise his discretion as to whether or not he applies the general rule.
Without attempting a comprehensive definition, it may be useful to indicate the
sort of thing that would, I think, clearly amount to a special circumstance.
Under s. 5(3) of the Act of 1915 a judge has a complete discretion to
order separate trials of offences charged in one indictment. It must,
therefore, follow that where the case is one in which, if the offences in the
second indictment had been included in the first, the judge would have ordered
a separate trial of them, he will in his discretion allow the second indictment
to be proceeded with. A fortiori, where the accused has himself obtained an
order for a separate trial under s. 5(3).

[Page 1038]

Moreover, I do not think that it is
obligatory on the prosecution, in order to be on the safe side, to put into an
indictment all the charges that might conceivably come within r.3, leaving it
to the defence to apply for separation. If the prosecution considers that there
ought to be two or more trials, it can make its choice plain by preferring two
or more indictments. In many cases this may be to the advantage of the defence.
If the defence accepts the choice without complaint and avails itself of any
advantage that may flow from it, I should regard that as a special
circumstance; for where the defence considers that a single trial of two
indictments is desirable, it can apply to the judge for an order in the form
made by GLYN-JONES, J., in R. v. Smith (170).

It remains to determine what rule of
practice should be applied in this particular case. Should it be the rule which
your lordships, if you are of my opinion, will declare as the right rule to
govern future cases; or should it be the rule of practice in force at the time
of the first trial? If the decision in R. v. Jones (168) had embodied a
rule of law, it might well be said that the prosecution would simply be in the
unfortunate position of a party who has good grounds for thinking that he is
acting as the law requires him to do and then finds that the decision of which
he is relying is upset. A rule of practice is in my opinion different. When
declared by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rule must be followed until
that court or a higher court declares it to be obsolete or bad or until it is
altered by statute. The rule in R. v. Jones (168) was accepted by both
sides without challenge as governing the position at the first trial; and in
his address to the jury in the passage which my noble and learned friend LORD
MORRIS OF BORTH-Y-GEST has quoted (171), counsel for the defence referred to
the possibility of a second trial in the event of an acquittal. The rule must
be applied in the present case though not in the future, and on that ground I
would dismiss this appeal.

If, as I think, and as all members of the House
of Lords in Connelly recognized, there is merit in the principle that a
criminal Court, like a civil Court, is entitled to protect its process from
abuse, the question of discretion becomes a matter of discipline, keyed to
particular situations which, as

[Page 1039]

an outgrowth of case law, commend themselves as
of a kind in which the principle may be raised.

Connelly was
considered in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Humphrys[25], where a differently constituted
House of Lords was concerned with whether issue estoppel, which was also
considered in Connelly (and considered favourably by a majority there)
applied in English criminal law, particularly in relation to jury verdicts, and
whether, if it did apply generally, it could be invoked in a prosecution for
perjury referable to testimony of the accused in the earlier proceedings. The
House of Lords in Humphrys, after canvassing English, Australian and
some American case law and some writings on the subject—counsel apparently did
not direct its attention to Canadian case law—concluded unanimously that issue
estoppel did not apply in England, but that if it did apply it could not
(subject to a reservation by Lord Salmon) be invoked in a prosecution for
perjury. Although, according to the reasons of Lord Fraser of Tullybelton, “the
question whether a Court in England can decline to allow a prosecution to
preceed, on the ground that it is oppressive, was not argued”, three members of
the Court in Humphrys expressed an opinion on the question. All three,
Viscount Dilhorne and Lords Salmon and Edmund-Davies, supported the power of a
superior court to prevent unfairness to an accused, but Viscount Dilhorne was
of the view that this power did not extend to preventing an indictment properly
preferred from being proceeded with, and he also doubted whether the power to
prevent abuse of process extended to magistrates’ courts, being troubled by a
possible lack of uniformity among different benches, a result that I should
have thought was equally possible among superior court judges and curable as to
both by the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords. Lord Salmon and Lord Edmund-Davies
took a contrary view on the question whether a judge has power to intervene to
decline to allow a prosecution to proceed if it amounts to an abuse of process,
holding that there

[Page 1040]

was such a power which Lord Salmon
characterized, as did Lord Devlin in Connelly, as one of great
constitutional importance that should be jealously preserved. Lord
Edmund-Davies was of the view that the power resided in every court, and
although Lord Salmon had no concluded view on whether inferior courts had such
power he did say that if they did and exercised it mistakenly their error could
be corrected by mandamus, the procedure that was resorted to in the
present case.

Apart from the generality of support for the
proposition that a criminal court may stay proceedings which are an abuse of
process or oppressive and vexatious and that, in the view at least of Lord
Edmund-Davies which is the view I hold, the power may be invoked by every court
having criminal jurisdiction (such courts being presided over in Canada generally
by persons qualified as lawyers), neither Connelly nor Humphrys are
of direct assistance in the present case. They do, however, underline, as I
would myself, that the power to prevent abuse of process is one of special
application and its exercise cannot be a random one.

The facts and indeed the situation now before us
do not, in my view, provide any basis for considering the invocation of the
court’s power to stay the proceedings against the accused. The appellant is in
effect asking the courts to undertake the supervision, through their power to
control prosecutions before them, of the operation and efficiency of police
departments, departments which vary in organization and in size and in the
demands that are made upon them. Absent any contention that the delay in
apprehending the accused had some ulterior purpose, courts are in no position
to tell the police that they did not proceed expeditiously enough with their
investigation, and then impose a sanction of a stay when prosecution is initiated.
The time lapse between the commission of an offence and the laying of a charge
following appre-

[Page 1041]

hension of an accused cannot be monitored by
Courts by fitting investigations into a standard mould or moulds. Witnesses and
evidence may disappear in the short run as well as in the long, and the accused
too may have to be sought for a long or short period of time. Subject to such
controls as are prescribed by the Criminal Code , prosecutions initiated
a lengthy period after the alleged commission of an offence must be left to
take their course and to be dealt with by the Court on the evidence, which
judges are entitled to weigh for cogency as well as credibility. The Court can
call for an explanation of any untoward delay in prosecution and may be in a
position, accordingly, to assess the weight of some of the evidence.

In the result, I see no basis, despite the
allegations of prejudice, upon which abuse of process could be invoked in this
case and hence it did not provide an occasion for the exercise of discretion. Regina
v. Koski, supra, if it be correctly decided (and, as I said, I pass no
judgment on it), is a far different case from the present one. Its invocation
by Rae J. shows the danger of generalizing the application of the doctrine of
abuse of process.

For the reasons aforesaid, differing in part
from those of the British Columbia Court of Appeal with whose conclusion,
however, I agree, I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz
and de Grandpré J.J. was delivered by

PIGEON J.—On February 26, 1973 an information
was sworn against the appellant alleging a kidnapping and robbery committed on October 5, 1971. A warrant was issued and the
appellant was later arrested on April 3, 1973. A preliminary enquiry was held
in June 1973 and the appellant was committed to trial. When he appeared for
trial before a County Court judge on November 21, 1973, on an indictment
preferred by an agent of the Attorney General of British Columbia, he moved for
a stay of the proceedings as an abuse of process. His contention was that the
delay in bringing him before the Court was prejudicial to his defence, that a
person who would have been a

[Page 1042]

key witness had died in the interval. It was
also asserted that the appellant had not been in hiding and could readily have
been arrested sooner if the police had acted with reasonable diligence. The
County Court judge accepted those submissions and stayed the proceedings.

An application for mandamus heard by a
judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia was dismissed on the basis that
the County Court judge had jurisdiction to do what he had done and, having
exercised his discretion bona fide and on evidence before him, his
decision could not be revised. This judgment was unanimously reversed on
appeal, W.R. McIntyre J.A. saying for the Court:

I do not treat lightly the argument that an
accused may suffer prejudice by delay even before criminal proceedings
commence. It may well be that a case could arise where real prejudice could
result from such delay. It is my view, however, that such delay would
ordinarily raise a substantive defence. The provisions of the Criminal Code 
above referred to (s. 577.3  and s. 737 ) would give the Trial Judge ample
power to see the accused received what he is entitled to, that is, a fair trial
according to law and in a proper case, where delay has denied the right to make
full answer and defence, an acquittal might well result. In my view, however,
facts which would give the discretion to the County Court Judge to stay the
proceedings had not arisen in the case at bar. Matters should have proceeded
and the respondent could have raised had he been so disposed the matters
complained of at his trial.

I now turn to the final question. Is
mandamus available to the Crown in this case? With the utmost deference I am
unable to share the view of the Judge appealed from that the remedy of mandamus
may not be given here. It is well settled in my opinion that where a Judge
having a jurisdiction to exercise declines to do so because of a decision on a
preliminary question which does not go to the merits as regards either fact or
law mandamus will lie. I refer to such cases as Rex v. Pochrebny, [1930]
1 W.W.R. 139 and on appeal [1930] 1 W.W.R. 688 where a reference is made to
leading authorities on the subject and to Regina v. Smith (1974), 16
C.C.C. (2d) 11 and to Regina v. Taylor ex parte Stunden, [1964] 3 C.C.C.
363.

In the case at bar it is clear that the
County Court Judge declined to exercise his jurisdiction to hear and to
determine the case upon a point clearly preliminary to the proceeding and upon
matters which preceded the

[Page 1043]

preferring of the indictment. In my view
the preliminary objection was unfounded and mandamus should go.

I cannot find any rule in our criminal law that
prosecutions must be instituted promptly and ought not to be permitted to be
proceeded with if a delay in instituting them may have caused prejudice to the
accused. In fact, no authority was cited to establish the existence of such a principle
which is at variance with the rule that criminal offences generally are not
subject to prescription except in the case of specific offences for which a
prescription time has been established by statute. I have to disagree with the
view expressed by McIntyre J.A. that there could be factual situations giving
to a trial judge discretion to stay proceedings for delay. For the reasons I
gave in The Queen v. Osborn[26], I
cannot admit of any general discretionary power in courts of criminal
jurisdiction to stay proceedings regularly instituted because the prosecution
is considered oppressive. In fact, I think the correct view is that which was
expressed as follows by Viscount Dilhorne in Director of Public Prosecutions
v. Humphrys[27] (at
pp. 510-511):

In Mills v. Cooper, [1967] 2 Q.B.
459, where justices had dismissed a summons on the ground that it was
oppressive and an abuse of the process of the court, Lord Parker CJ (at
p. 467), while holding that it was not, said: ‘…every court has undoubtely
a right in its discretion to decline to hear proceedings on the ground that
they are oppressive and an abuse of the process of the court.’

I must confess to some doubt whether this
is a correct statement of the law in relation to magistrates’ courts. If it is,
it appears to me to be fraught with considerable dangers. One bench, thinking a
prosecution should not have been brought, will dismiss it as oppressive and
vexatious. Other benches on precisely the same facts may take a completely
different view, with the result that there is a lack of uniformity in the
administration of justice.

Nor is the existence of the power my noble
and learned friends, Lord Salmon and Lord Edmund-Davies, think the judge has
and its exercise without considerable dangers.

A judge must keep out of the arena. He
should not have or appear to have any responsibility for the institu-

[Page 1044]

tion of a prosecution. The functions of
prosecutors and of judges must not be blurred. If a judge has power to decline
to hear a case because he does not think it should be brought, then it soon may
be thought that the cases he allows to proceed are cases brought with his
consent or approval.

If there is the power which my noble and
learned friends think there is to stop a prosecution on indictment in limine,
it is in my view a power that should only be exercised in the most exceptional
circumstances.

In considering the situation in the courts of Canada, due weight should be given to the
effect of the codification of our criminal law. Here is in what terms s. 7(3) 
preserves common law defences:

7. (3) Every
rule and principle of the common law that renders any circumstance a
justification or excuse for an act or a defence to a charge continues in force
and applies in respect of proceedings for an offence under this Act or any
other Act of the Parliament of Canada, except in so far as they are altered by
or are inconsistent with this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada.

This provision refers to a “defence”, not to a
discretionary stay of proceedings. In this connection, I would point out that
in Kienapple v. The Queen[28] as
in Doré v. Attorney General of Canada[29], res judicata (rather than issue
estoppel), was accepted as a defence on the merits, not as a preliminary plea.
This distinction is important. It happens here, that the case was not tried
before a superior court judge and, therefore, mandamus lay to revise a
decision on a preliminary question which did not go to the merits, (Kipp v.
Attorney General of Ontario[30]).
However, if the same decision had been made by a superior court judge, such
remedy would clearly not be available and it does not seem that an appeal would
lie.

[Page 1045]

By virtue of ss. 602 and 605(1) there is a right
of appeal only if the decision is “a judgment or erdict of acquittal”. What is
an “acquittal” was considered in The Queen v. Sheets[31]. It was there [???] that a judgment
quashing an indictment, not on account of “procedural or technical defects” but
on the interpretation of the section under which the accused was charged, was
in effect an “acquittal”. The reasons given for the full Court by Fauteux C.J.
do not seem to contemplate any disposition which would be neither a dismissal
of the charge on the merits, nor a quashing on procedural grounds, although it
is expressly stated that a quashing on the ground of prescription is an
“acquittal”. It is obvious that the dismissal of a charge upon one of the
special pleas mentioned in s. 535, is a disposition on the merits and,
therefore, an “acquittal”.

In my view, the absence of any provision in the Criminal
Code  contemplating the staying of an indictment by a trial judge or an
appeal from such decision, is a strong indication against the existence of any
power to grant such stay. The present legislative policy is clearly in the direction
of allowing a right of appeal from final trial court judgments on indictable
offences in all cases. Section 9  of the Criminal Code  gives a right of
appeal against conviction for contempt of court and this was extended in 1972
to a conviction for contempt in the face of the court. Section 719(5)  enacted
in 1965, gives a right of appeal in habeas corpus matters. It would
hardly be consistent with such policy to have a discretionary jurisdiction that
could be exercised by superior court judges in criminal matters where the only
possible appeal would be a direct appeal to this Court under s. 41(1) of
the Supreme Court Act. Considerations of policy may not be of much
importance in the application of explicit statutory provisions because policy
decisions are essentially for Parliament. It is quite another matter when we
are dealing with unwritten principles.

I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Arrest—Resisting a peace officer in the
execution of his duty—Acquittal for breach of the peace does not make arrest
unlawful—Resistance an offence—Criminal Code , ss. 25 , 31 , 449(1) (b), 450(1) (b);
Police Act, S.Q. 1968, e. 17, s. 54,

Respondent was arrested in a restaurant during a
raid. He had been drinking and refused to co-operate with the police, verbally
abusing them and refusing to give his name. The constable who arrested him
handed him over to Constable Gauthier, who took him to a police car for
questioning. He was then taken by Constable Dorion to a police wagon.
Respondent resisted arrest and a scuffle with Constable Dorion ensued. Biron
was charged with (1) causing a disturbance in or near a public place by
shouting in a restaurant, contrary to s. 171 (a)(1)  of the Criminal Code , and
(2) resisting a peace officer in the execution of his duty, contrary to s.
118 (a). Biron was convicted of both offences in the Municipal Court. He was
acquitted of the first offence in a trial de novo. He was also acquitted
of the second offence in the Quebec Court of Appeal. The Crown was granted
leave to appeal the second acquittal. The ques­tion at issue is whether the
charge of resisting a peace officer in the execution of his duty must fail
because of the acquittal on the offence of causing a disturbance. Respondent
claims that his arrest was not lawful because the right to arrest him for a
summary convic­tion offence had to be based on s. 450(1) (b) of the Criminal
Code .

Held (Laskin C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ.
dis­senting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon and de Grandpré
JJ.: The validity of an arrest under s. 450(1) (b) of the Criminal Code 
must be determined in relation to the circumstances which were apparent to
the peace officer at the time the arrest was made. The power of arrest

[Page 57]

which that paragraph gives has to be exercised prompt­ly,
yet it is impossible to say that an offence has been committed until the party
arrested has been found guilty by the courts. The wording of this paragraph
means that the power to arrest without a warrant is given where the peace
officer himself finds a situation in which a person is apparently committing an
offence.

The arrest of Biron was lawful, and, consequently,
his resistance to Dorion constituted an offence.

During the raid, it was Dorion's duty to take
custody of persons who might be arrested by police officers in the building. In
taking Biron into custody, he was carrying out the duty which had been given to
him as a police officer by s. 54 of the Police Act, S.Q. 1968, c. 17.
Furthermore, s. 31(2) of the Criminal Code  provides that Dorion was
justified in receiving Biron into custody since, as a part of the police force
conducting the raid, he reasonably believed that Gauthier, who turned Biron
over to him, had witnessed a breach of the peace,

Per de Grandpré J.: An arrest is a specific
act, clearly limited as to time, which cannot be broken down into several
stages. Once the arrest is made, the concept of arrest ceases to apply, and a
new concept, that of custody, becomes applicable.

Per Laskin C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ., dissent­ing:
At the time and place of the arrest, no offence under s. 171(1) (b) of the Criminal
Code  had been committed and the arrest therefor was, qua the
accused, unlawful. The protection of the constable by s. 25  did not make the
arrest lawful qua the accused. Furthermore, our law has not deprived the
citizen of his right to resist unlawful arrest. His resistance may be at his
own risk if the arrest proves to be lawful. Section 31  is not an arrest power,
but a protection for the person or persons making an arrest, just as is s. 25 .
It is limited to protection in respect of an arrest for breach of the peace. By
no stretch of the imagination can s. 31  be turned into a general power of
arrest or justification in respect of any criminal offence on the theory that
all offences under the Criminal Code  constitute breaches of the peace.
Finally, it is simply a ""bootstrap"" argument to contend that
resistance to Dorion became unlawful because he, Dorion, was justified in
taking custody of the accused following his arrest.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Province
of Quebec, allowing an appeal from a conviction. Appeal allowed, Laskin C.J.
and Spence and Dickson JJ. dissenting.

J. Allard and G. Denis for the appellant.

S. Ménard and Christine Truesdell for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ. was
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—It is of cen­tral
importance in this Crown appeal to appreciate how this case got to this Court
and what were the issues that brought it here. The accused, having been
convicted on a charge of resisting a peace officer, one Dorion, in the
execution of his duty at a certain place on a certain date, successfully
appealed his conviction and was acquitted by the Quebec Court of Appeal, Deschênes
J.A. (as he then was) dissenting. If the dissent was on a question of law, the
Crown had an appeal as of right under s. 621(1) (a) of the Criminal Code . The
Crown, however, sought leave to appeal, indicating it wished to raise for the
first time the applicability of s. 31(2)  of the Criminal Code . Leave was
granted without limitation, but on con­dition of the Crown paying the costs of
the appeal in any event. Even the unrestricted leave could not of course
enlarge the scope of the appeal beyond questions of law, as s. 621(1) (b) makes
abundantly clear.

The issues in this appeal have a background that must be
explained. The accused was charged with two offences following a raid by the
police on certain restaurant premises in which he was arrested. The arrest was
made by Constable Maisonneuve, and another constable, one Gauthier, led

[Page 59]

the accused to a police car for interrogation. Then he was taken
to a police wagon by Constable Dorion, who had a grip on the accused, and by
another constable. The accused offered resistance, causing Dorion to fall, but
the accused also fell, sustaining severe facial injuries. The two charges laid
against the accused were (1) causing a dis­turbance in or near a public place
by shouting in the restaurant, contrary to what is now s. 171(1)  (a)(i) of the Criminal
Code ; and (2) resist­ing a peace officer, Dorion, in the execution of his
duty, the resistance being offered in front of the restaurant, contrary to what
is now s. 118 (a) of the Criminal Code .

The two charges (that of causing a disturbance by shouting being
a summary conviction offence only) came before the same judge who convicted on
both. The charge of causing a disturbance under s.171(1) (a)(i) was appealed by
way of trial de novo and the accused was acquitted. There the matter
stood and still stands on that charge. The charge of resisting the peace
officer Dorion was appealed to the Quebec Court of Appeal and an acquittal
resulted as already indicated.

I would have been content simply to adopt the reasons of Beetz
J.A. and of Kaufman J.A. in the Quebec Court of Appeal and to dismiss the
Crown's appeal without more, were it not for its submissions under s. 31(2)  and
its invocation of what I regard as a completely unsupportable find­ing by Deschênes
J.A. that there was a lawful arrest on a form of an offence on which the
accused was not tried nor with which he was even charged. I shall come to this
last mentioned matter later in these reasons after I have dealt with the
submissions under s. 31(2) .

Whether the accused was guilty of an offence under s. 118 (a)
depends in this case on whether he was under lawful arrest. I do not question,
despite the contentions of counsel for the respondent

[Page 60]

accused, that the accused offered resistance to Dorion; it was
not, however, suggested that it was of such a character as to amount in itself
to the use of excessive force. There was, however, but one arrest, that
effected by Maisonneuve in the restau­rant; there was no suggestion of any
release and re-arrest. The issue turns therefore on its lawful­ness. We are not
concerned in this case with a constable's own responsibility or liability for
effecting an allegedly unlawful arrest. It is to that that provisions such as
s. 25  of the Criminal Code  are addressed, I would find it astonishing
that a provision concerned with a constable's criminal or other responsibility,
and which immunizes him in specified circumstances in respect of an arrest that
he has made, should become the vehicle for provid­ing a basis upon which an
accused may himself be convicted of resisting the arrest. To do that is to turn
a protective provision, a shield, for the constable into a sword against an
accused by treating the protection as an expansion of the powers of arrest
given by what is now s. 450  of the Criminal Code .

The particular provision of s. 450  which is of relevance here is
subs. 1(b), authorizing a peace officer to arrest without a warrant ""a
person whom he finds committing a criminal offence"". Maisonneuve arrested
the accused without a warrant and the charge laid in respect of that arrest was
causing a disturbance by shouting under the now s. 171(1) (a). It turns out that
no such offence was committed at the time and place, and the arrest therefor
was, qua the accused, unlawful. So far as the constable was concerned,
his unlawful conduct was protected under s. 25 . I repeat that the protection of
the constable did not make the arrest lawful qua the accused. There are
some cases which seem so to say. R. v. Shore[1] and
R. v. Dand[2], both
judgments of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, are in that class.

[Page 61]

The Shore case can stand on the finding that the police
officer who made the arrest was empowered so to do under the provincial liquor
statute, which authorized an arrest without warrant of a person found
intoxicated in a public place. The reference in that case to s. 25  of the Criminal
Code , in the bare narrative of its terms, seems to have been gratuitous
but, if not, and if in context it was relied upon to support the power of
arrest I would regard the Shore case to be wrongly decided. The Dand case
indicates that this last mentioned view of the Shore case is the one
that the British Columbia Court of Appeal took, and hence I hold the Dand case
should similarly be overruled.

It seems to me that the British Columbia Court of Appeal later
dissociated itself from the Shore and Dand cases by its decisions
in R. v. Klat[3] and
R. v. Cottam[4]; but,
having regard to my opinion that those first mentioned cases were wrongly
decided on the point under discussion, I need not embark upon any close
examination of the Klat and Cottam cases to see whether relevant
distinc­tions are open. In the Klat case, reliance was placed upon the
judgment of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Attorney General for Sas­katchewan
v. Pritchard[5], and
I am of the opinion that Culliton C.J.S. stated the law correctly, as it
applies here, in the last paragraph of his reasons as follows (at p. 154):

While a peace officer has no right to arrest without a
warrant a person he finds committing an offence unless an offence was in fact
committed, nevertheless even if the officer was in error in so arresting, if he
acted on reasonable and probable grounds he is given protection under s. 25 of
the Code.

In short, the position of a person accused of an offence founded
upon an allegedly lawful arrest which turns out to have been unlawful is one
thing; the position of the arresting officer as a possible accused in a
criminal prosecution or as a defendant in a civil suit arising out of the
arrest is an

[Page 62]

entirely different thing: see Frey v. Fedoruk[6].

The reasoning and judgment of the English Court of Appeal in Wiltshire
v. Barrett[7], have
no application to this case. It was a civil action for damages against a
constable for assault and wrongful arrest, not a criminal prosecution, as here,
against an accused person for resisting a peace officer in the execution of his
duty. The Wiltshire case involved a provision of the English Road
Traffic Act, 1960 which prohibited a person, on pain of fine or
imprisonment, from driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle on a road or
other public place when he was unfit to drive through drink or drugs. This
prohibition, in s. 6(1), was fortified by s. 6(4) which empowered a police
constable to arrest without warrant a person com­mitting the aforesaid offence.
There was no such provision in the Road Traffic Act as s. 25  of the Criminal
Code , which provides justification for a police constable when acting on
reasonable and probable grounds. Hence, when the issue arose in Wiltshire as
to protection of the constable from civil suit if he overstepped the literal
command of s. 6(4) , the Court there looked to statutory purpose and context and
interpreted ""committing"" in s. 6(4)  to mean ""apparently
committing"", so as to make it immaterial whether the arrested person be
found not guilty of the offence for which he was arrested without warrant. As
Lord Denning put it (at p. 275 of the report) it is enough if the arrested
person reasonably appeared to the constable to be committing an offence under
the Act.

The position taken in Wiltshire, in the context of
principle which I support, is well put by Salmon L.J. (at p. 281 of [1965] 2
All E.R.) as follows:

[Page 63]

The first point raised by counsel for the plaintiff is one
of importance and some difficulty. He contends that, in order for the arrest to
be lawful, the person arrested must in fact be guilty of the offence; no matter
how drunk he may appear to have been when arrested, he has an irrefutable claim
for damages for false impris­onment if he is subsequently acquitted of being
unfit to drive through drink. This argument is found on the language of s. 6(4)
of the Road Traffic Act, 1960. It is in this subsection that the power to
arrest must be found, for the offence in question is a misdemeanour and not a
felony and, accordingly, there is no common law power of arrest without
warrant. The subsection reads: ""A police constable may arrest without
warrant a person committing an offence under this section."" Clearly on a
literal construction of these words there is much force in the contention of
counsel for the plaintiff. He relies on the well established principle that any
statute which impinges on the liberty of the subject should be strictly
construed against the Crown; see Bowditch v. Balchin, (1850), 5 Exch.
378. I agree that it is of great impor­tance that nothing should be done which
could in any way weaken that general principle. Moreover, if the legislature
intends to give a police constable power to arrest without warrant on
reasonable suspicion, it should do so in plain and unambiguous language which
anyone can understand; see Ledwith v. Roberts, [1936] 3 All E.R.
at p. 593. It is our duty to apply those principles and to give the language of
this subsection its natural meaning if possible, but none the less in the end
to give it its appropriate construction according to its context and the
subject-matter with which it deals: ... I entirely agree with my lords that
these considerations lead irre­sistibly to our construing the word
""committing"" as ""apparently committing"". This must have
been the intention of Parliament. I reach this conclusion for the same reasons
as my lords, which are the same as those which commended themselves to this
court construing similar language in a similar Act in Trebeck v. Crou­dace, [1918]
1 K.B. 158. The very nature of the offence requires this construction.

This passage indicates how far removed the Wiltshire case
is from the present one, how differ­ent is a civil suit against a constable
charged with enforcing road traffic legislation, from a criminal prosecution
against an accused person for resisting

[Page 64]

an unlawful arrest in respect of which the constable is given
express protection from criminal and civil liability if he acted on reasonable
and probable grounds: see also R. v. Dean[8].

There is a further point that merits emphasis. If the word
""apparently"" is to be read into s. 450(1)  (b), logical consistency,
if not also ordinary canons of construction, demand that the word be read into
s. 449(1) (a) which empowers any person to arrest without warrant a person whom
he ""finds committing"" an indictable offence. Moreover, it is plain to
me, on grounds of context in aid of construction, that when s. 449(1) (a) is
read with s. 449(1) (b), the former could not possibly embrace arrest without
warrant on apparency or on reasonable and probable grounds. Further, reasonable
and probable grounds for an arrest without warrant govern s. 450(1) (a) and s.
450(1) (c) but the words are excluded from s. 450(1) (b), and I see no textual or
policy justification for reading them or the equivalent term
""apparently"" into s. 450(1) (b).

Of course, as Kaufman J.A. points out in his reasons, a
constable's lot is a heavy and even unenviable one when he has to make an
on-the-spot decision as to an arrest. But he may be overzealous as well as
mistaken, and it may be too that when a charge or charges come to be laid the
Crown attorney or other advising counsel may mistake the grounds and thus lay a
charge which does not support the arrest. We cannot go on a guessing expedition
out of regret for an innocent mistake or a wrong-headed assessment. Far more
important, however, is the social and legal, and indeed political, principle
upon which our criminal law is based, namely, the right of an individual to be
left alone, to be free of private or public restraint, save as the law provides
otherwise. Only to the extent to which it so provides can a person

[Page 65]

be detained or his freedom of movement arrested.

The position as it relates to resistance to unlaw­ful arrest was
established at common law as early as 1709 in R. v. Tooley[9],
and has been reaffirmed time and again: see, for example, R. v. Curvan[10];
R. v. Wilson[11], at
p. 745, referring also to the qualification of the use of excessive force in
resist­ing. It has been part of our criminal law from the beginning and is
reflected in the provisions of the Criminal Code , which has sought to
balance the competing interests in freedom and order by giving the peace
officer protection in specified circum­stances where he has exceeded his
authority to make an arrest. Our law has not, as I understand it, deprived the
citizen of his right to resist unlaw­ful arrest. His resistance may be at his
own risk if the arrest proves to be lawful, but so too must the police officer
accept the risk of having effected a lawful arrest. Of course, even if the
resisted arrest is unlawful, the person resisting may still become culpable if
he uses excessive force.

Where does s. 31(2)  of the Criminal Code  stand in this
assessment? It reads as follows:

Every peace officer is justified in receiving into
cus­tody any person who is given into his charge as having been a party
to a breach of the peace by one who has, or who on reasonable and probable
grounds he believes has, witnessed the breach of the peace.

Section 31  is not an arrest power, but a protection for the
person or persons making an arrest, just as is s. 25 . Moreover, it is limited
to protection in respect of an arrest for breach of the peace, and in that
respect has a connection with s. 30, which does speak expressly of detention of
a person com­mitting a breach of the peace. By no stretch of the imagination
can either s. 30  or s. 31  be turned into a general power of either arrest or
justification in respect of any criminal offence on the theory that all
offences under the Criminal Code  constitute [sic]

[Page 66]

breaches of the peace. This would eliminate at one swoop, and by
a side wind at that, any protection that an accused would have against any
conse­quential charges if he was illegally arrested under ss. 449  and 450 , the provisions
of the Criminal Code  which define powers of arrest. The caution uttered
by Cartwright J., as he then was, speaking for this Court in Frey v. Fedoruk,
supra, at pp. 526 and 530, should be recalled and heeded. He said this:

If it should be admitted as a principle that conduct may be
treated as criminal because, although not otherwise criminal, it was a natural
tendency to provoke violence by way of retribution, it seems to me that great
uncertainty would result. I do not think it safe by the application of such a
supposed principle to declare an act or acts criminal which have not, up to the
present, been held to be criminal in any reported case.

This would be my view if the matter were not covered by
authority, but it also appears to me to be supported by authority. 1n my view
it has been rightly held that acts likely to cause a breach of the peace are
not in themselves criminal merely because they have this tend­ency, and that
the only way in which such conduct can be dealt with and restrained, apart from
civil proceedings for damages, is by taking the appropriate steps to have the
persons committing such acts bound over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.

I am of opinion that the proposition implicit in the
paragraph quoted above [from the judgment of O'Hallo­ran J.A. in the court
appealed from] ought not to be accepted. I think that if adopted, it would
introduce great uncertainty into the administration of the Crimi­nal Law,
leaving it to the judicial officer trying any particular charge to decide that
the acts proved con­stituted a crime or otherwise, not by reference to any
defined standard to be found in the code or in reported decisions, but
according to his individual view as to whether such acts were a disturbance of
the tranquillity of people tending to provoke physical reprisal.

[Page 67]

But there is more to be said on s. 31(2)  to show its
inapplicability here. It is patent on its face that any resort to it can only
be to give Dorion protec­tion for receiving the accused into his custody,
albeit the latter was unlawfully arrested by Maisonneuve. Even so, this may be
taking the matter too far because it is arguable, in the context of ss. 30  and
31 , that s. 31(2)  is limited to a peace officer taking in charge a person
detained by an ordinary citizen. Be that as it may, it is simply a
""bootstrap"" argument to contend that resistance to Dorion became
unlawful because he, Dorion, was justified in taking custody of the accused
following his arrest by Maisonneuve.

I come then to the issue raised by the dissenting reasons of Deschênes
J.A. He opened his reasons by remarking on the narrow frame of the charge laid
against the accused under the now s. 171(1)  (a)(i), and he endorsed the
acquittal of the accused upon the trial de novo. That done, he proceeded
to hold that the acquittal of the accused did not necessarily free him of
liability for resist­ing arrest, and on this principle (which is contrary to
the view expressed in the Pritchard case) he went on to find that the
accused was guilty of an offence under s. 171(1)  (a) (i) by swearing or using
obscene language. I quote his words, peremptory in their statement and in their
conclusiveness:

It seems to me unquestionable that appellant had committed
the offence under Section 160 of the Crimi­nal Code, by shouting or at least
""by swearing"" and ""using insulting or obscene language"".
That he was not charged with it does not eliminate the blunt fact that he was
committing it in the very sight of the constables and against them.

I do not think that an appellate court or appellate judge should
essay, on an appeal in respect of a charge of resisting an officer in the
execution of his duty, based as it was on an arrest for a specific form of an
offence, to ignore that form altogether and proceed without more to find the
accused guilty of another form of the offence with which he was not charged and
to which he was not

[Page 68]

obliged to offer any defence, and, moreover, which was not before
the appellate court in any shape that would warrant cognizance thereof. Indeed,
to come to the conclusion that the accused was so guilty, Deschênes LA. had to
make findings of fact (without the usual trial in which facts are first found)
and it seems to me that in expressing a dissent which is based on fresh
findings of fact Deschênes IA. cannot be said to have dissented on a question
of law under s. 621(1) (a). Equally, I do not see how his view can be
regarded as raising a question of law under s. 621(1) (b).

I need not decide in this case the invariable correctness of the
proposition in the Pritchard case that, as illustrated in the present
case, the acquit­tal on the charge under s. 171(1)  (a) (i) (especially when the
matter was not carried forward to a further appeal) ""established once and
for all that the respondent was not found committing a crimi­nal offence"".
That can be left for further consider­ation. The proposition is indubitably
correct here.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. was
delivered by

MARTLAND J.—This is an appeal, by leave of this Court, from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Province of Quebec, which, by a majority
of two to one, allowed the appeal of the respondent, hereinafter referred to as

officer, contrary to what is now s. 118 (a) (then s. 110(a)) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, which provides;

is guilty of

(d) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for
two years, or

(e) an offence punishable on summary conviction.

The charge related to resistance to an officer of the Montreal
police force, Constable Dorion.

The facts which gave rise to this charge were as follows:

The Montreal police made an authorized raid on a Montreal bar on
October 24, 1970. The raid was in search of illegal firearms and liquor. Biron
was at the bar while the raid was taking place. He had been drinking. He
refused to co-operate with the police, verbally abusing them and refusing to
give his name.

Biron was arrested inside the restaurant by Constable Maisonneuve.
He was led outside by Constable Gauthier for questioning. He was handed over by
Constable Gauthier to Constables Dorion and Marquis, who took him to a police
car. Subse­quently, Constable Dorion tried to take him to the police wagon. Biron
protested his arrest at this point and a scuffle with Constable Dorion
occurred.

Biron was charged with creating a disturbance in a public place
by shouting, contrary to s. 171 (a)(î) of the Code (then s. 160(a)(i)). He was
also charged with resisting a peace officer, as previously mentioned.

Section 171 (a)(î) provides as follows: 

171. Every one who

(a) not being in a dwelling-house causes a disturbance in or
near a public place,

(i) by fighting, screaming, shouting, swearing, singing or
using insulting or obscene language,

[Page 70]

is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.

Biron was convicted of both offences before a judge of the
Municipal Court. A trial de novo was held in respect of the s.
171 (a)(i) offence. He was acquitted of ""creating a disturbance by
shouting"" on the ground that there was no evidence he had been shouting as
was alleged in the information.

Biron appealed the s. 118 (a) conviction to the Quebec Court of
Appeal. By a two to one majori­ty, the appeal was allowed and Biron was
acquitted.

Beetz J.A. (as he then was) and Kaufman J.A. allowed the appeal
on the ground that the arrest had not been a lawful one. They held that where a
police officer arrests without a warrant on a sum­mary offence he must actually
find the accused ""committing a criminal offence"". Where this is not
so, the arrest is illegal and the person is entitled to resist the arrest
reasonably.

Beetz J.A. found that the arrest was not a lawful one by
reviewing the evidence and determining that Biron had not created a disturbance
within the meaning of s. 171 (a)(i).

Kaufman J.A. found that the fact that Biron had been acquitted of
the substantive offence with which he was charged was in itself determinative
that he had not been committing the offence.

Deschênes J.A, (as he then was) dissented. He would have found
the arrest lawful and Biron guilty of resisting a lawful arrest. His approach
was similar to that of Beetz J.A., but he reached a different determination on
the facts, finding that Biron was in fact committing the offence of creat­ing a
disturbance under s. 171 (a)(i) at the time he was arrested, even though the
disturbance was not by shouting.

On the appeal to this Court, the Crown relied upon the provisions
of s. 31(2) of the Code, the effect of which had not been argued in the Court
of Appeal. Section 31  provides as follows:

[Page 71]

31. (1) Every peace officer who witnesses a breach of the peace
and every one who lawfully assists him is justified in arresting any person
whom he finds committing the breach of the peace or who, on reasonable and
probable grounds, he believes is about to join in or renew the breach of the
peace.

(2) Every peace officer is justified in receiving into
custody any person who is given into his charge as having been a party to a
breach of the peace by one who has, or who on reasonable and probable grounds
he believes has, witnessed the breach of the peace.

The question in issue is as to whether the charge against Biron
of resisting Dorion in the execution of his duty must fail because of his
successful appeal from his conviction under s. 171 (a)(i) for causing a
disturbance.

It is contended on behalf of Biron that he could not be so
convicted because he was not under lawful arrest, and so was entitled to resist
Dorion's efforts to take him to the patrol wagon. It is argued that he had not
been lawfully arrested because Maisonneuve's right to arrest him for a summary
conviction offence had to be based on s. 450(1) (b) of the Code, which provides
that:

450. (1) A peace officer may arrest without warrant

(b) a person whom he finds committing a criminal offence,

It is submitted by the respondent that Maisonneuve did not find him
committing a criminal offence because he was acquitted on the charge laid
against him. Reliance is placed on the judg­ment of the Court of Appeal for
Saskatchewan in Attorney General for Saskatchewan v. Pritchard[12].

Paragraph (a) of s. 450(1) permits a peace officer to arrest
without a warrant:

(a) a person who has committed an indictable offence or who,
on reasonable and probable grounds, he

[Page 72]

believes has committed or is about to commit an indictable
offence,

This paragraph, limited in its application to indictable
offences, deals with the situation in which an offence has already been
committed or is expected to be committed. The peace officer is not present at
its commission. He may have to rely upon information received from others. The
paragraph therefore enables him to act on his belief, if based on reasonable
and probable grounds.

Paragraph (b) applies in relation to any criminal offence and it
deals with the situation in which the peace officer himself finds an offence
being com­mitted. His power to arrest is based upon his own observation.
Because it is based on his own discov­ery of an offence actually being
committed there is no reason to refer to a belief based upon reasonable and
probable grounds.

If the reasoning in the Pritchard case is sound, the
validity of an arrest under s. 450(1) (b) can only be determined after the trial
of the person arrested and after the determination of any subse­quent appeals.
My view is that the validity of an arrest under this paragraph must be
determined in relation to the circumstances which were apparent to the peace
officer at the time the arrest was made.

This was the view of the Court of Appeal in England in Wiltshire
v. Barrett[13], when
interpret­ing a provision of the Road Traffic Act, 1960 (Can.), c. 16.
Section 6(1) of that Act made it an offence for a person who, when driving or
attempt­ing to drive a motor vehicle on a road or other public place, is unfit
to drive through drink or drugs,

Subsection (4) of s. 6 provided:

A police constable may arrest without warrant a person
committing an offence under this section.

The case was a civil action for assault and wrongful arrest. The
plaintiffs car had been overtaken

[Page 73]

and stopped by the police. A constable sought to arrest the
plaintiff, who resisted by remaining in his car. He was removed after a
struggle and taken to the police station. He was examined by the police doctor,
who concluded that he was not unfit to drive. He was then released. No further
action was taken against him. Subse­quently he sued the police constable who
had arrested him.

Lord Denning said, at p. 273:

Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that this section only
empowered a constable to arrest a person who was actually committing an offence
under the section; and, accordingly, that the constable was only justified if
he could prove that the person was in fact guilty; whereas counsel for
the defendant submitted that a constable was entitled to arrest any person who
was apparently committing an offence; and, accordingly, the constable
was justified so long as it appeared to him that the man was unfit
through drink, even though the man should afterwards be found to be not
guilty. This question has to be answered by examining the contents of this
par­ticular statute; see Barnard v. Gorman, [1941] 3 All E.R. 45
at pp. 50, 51; [1941] A.C. 378 at p. 387. On examining this
statute, I find it very similar to the statute considered by this court in Trebeck
v. Croudace, [1916-17] All E.R. Rep. 441; [1918] 1 K.B. 158. Just as Lord
Wright thought, [1941] 3 All E.R. at p. 55; [1941] A.C. at p. 394, that,
in that context, ""drunk"" meant ""apparently drunk"", so I
think that, in this context, ""committing an offence"" means
""apparently committing an offence"". My reasons are these: this
statute is con­cerned with the safety of all of Her Majesty's subjects who use
the roads in this country. It is of the first importance that any person, who
is unfit to drive through drink, should not be allowed to drive on the road;
and that the police should have power to stop him from driving any further. The
most effective way to do it is by arresting him then and there. The police have
to act at once, on the facts as they appear on the spot; and they should
be justified by the facts as they appear to them at the time and not on any ex
post facto analysis of the situation. Their conduct should not be condemned as
unlawful simply because a jury afterwards acquit the driver…

[Page 74]

Our attention was drawn to the wording of s. 217(1) of the
Act of 1960, which says that

""A person who takes and drives away a motor vehicle
without having either the consent of the owner thereof or other lawful
authority ...""

shall be liable to fine or imprisonment; and to s. 217(4),
which says that

""A police constable may arrest without warrant a person
reasonably suspected by him of having com­mitted or of attempting to commit an
offence under this section.""

It was said that this section expressly empowered arrest on
reasonable suspicion. If Parliament intended a like power under s. 6, surely
they would have expressed it in like language. But I think that different
considerations apply. Section 217 deals with offences where the power of arrest
may be exercised some time after the offence has been committed. It may be
based, not on the constable's own observation, but on information received from
others; whereas s. 6 deals with offences where the power of arrest is to be
exercised at the very time when a person is committing the offence, or very
soon after-wards. So much so that the constable acts on his own observation.
Naturally enough there is a difference in language.

My conclusion is that, on the true construction of s. 6(4),
a constable is justified in arresting the driver of a motor car if the driver
was apparently committing an offence under the section.

In my opinion this reasoning can properly be applied to the
interpretation of s. 450(1) (b). It is true that the Wiltshire case
was a civil action for damages, but it necessitated the judicial interpre­tation
of a statutory provision which is substantial­ly the same. There being no English
equivalent of s. 25  of the Criminal Code  to provide the constable with
protection from suit, he could only escape from civil liability for damages if
he could estab­lish that he was entitled to make the arrest. His power to
arrest without warrant arose in respect of ""a person committing an offence
under this sec­tion"". The Court held that he was justified in making the
arrest if the person arrested was appar­ently committing the offence.

[Page 75]

In the Wiltshire case the statutory provision involved the
power to arrest without a warrant a person unfit to drive because of drink or
drugs and the Court referred to the public importance of an arrest being
promptly made in such circumstances. Paragraph (b) of s. 450(1) deals
with the power to arrest without a warrant a person found committing any
criminal offence. It is certainly of public importance that the peace officer
should be able to exercise this power promptly.

If the words ""committing a criminal offence"" are to be
construed in the manner indicated in the Pritchard case, para. (b) becomes
impossible to apply. The power of arrest which that paragraph gives has to be
exercised promptly, yet, strictly speaking, it is impossible to say that an
offence is committed until the party arrested has been found guilty by the
courts. If this is the way in which this provision is to be construed, no peace
officer can ever decide, when making an arrest without a warrant, that the
person arrested is ""committing a criminal offence"". In my opinion the
wording used in para. (b), which is oversimplified, means that the power to
arrest without a warrant is given where the peace officer himself finds a
situation in which a person is apparently committing an offence.

In the present case Constable Maisonneuve observed an apparent
offence being committed by Biron. That he was justified in so thinking is shown
by the fact that, at trial, Biron was convicted of the offence of causing a
disturbance, and that his appeal from conviction resulted from the fact that
the information charged only causing a disturbance ""by shouting"",
which ""shouting"" the judge on appeal found was not established by the
evidence.

In my opinion the arrest of Biron by Maisonneuve was lawful, and,
consequently, the resistance offered by Biron to Dorion constituted an offence.

[Page 76]

Even if the arrest by Maisonneuve was not lawful, it is my view
that Biron was guilty of the offence charged. It was Maisonneuve who made the
arrest, not Dorion. Following the arrest, Biron was placed in the custody of
Gauthier, who then placed him in the custody of Dorion. The resistance with
which Biron was charged was resistance to Dorion and the question in issue is
as to whether Dorion was resisted in the execution of his duty.

His duty is defined in s. 54 of the Police Act, S.Q. 1968,
c. F7:

54. It shall be the duty of every municipal police force and
each member thereof to maintain peace, order and public safety in its territory
and in any other territory under its jurisdiction, to prevent crime and
infringements of its by-laws and to seek out the offenders.

On the night in question Dorion was one of a group of police who
conducted a raid upon a bar in Montreal. It was a part of his duty, in
connection with that raid, to take custody of persons who might be arrested by
police officers in the building, and that is what happened in the case of Biron.
In taking him into custody he was carrying out the duty which had been given to
him as a police officer.

Section 31(2) of the Code provides that Dorion was justified in
receiving Biron into custody, The arrest made by Maisonneuve was because he con­sidered
Biron to be committing a disturbance, in a public place, which would be a
breach of the peace. It is evident that Dorion, who was a part of the police
force conducting the raid, reasonably believed that Gauthier, who turned Biron
over to him, had witnessed a breach of the peace.

I interpret the word ""justified"" in s. 31(2)  as meaning
that Dorion had lawful sanction to receive Biron into his custody. He received
him into his custody in the course of performance of his duties as a peace
officer at the scene of the raid. Biron offered resistance to him in the
execution of that duty. In my opinion that is sufficient to make

[Page 77]

Biron guilty of the offence with which he was charged under s.
118 (a).

I would allow the appeal and restore the conviction.

DE GRANDPRÉ J.—I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of
Martland J., and I am in agreement with him.

I might add a few words concerning the distinc­tion which I feel
must be emphasized between arrest and custody of an individual. In my opinion,
an arrest is a specific act, clearly limited as to time, which cannot be broken
down into several stages. Once the arrest is made, the concept of arrest ceases
to apply, and a new concept, that of custody, becomes applicable. To my mind,
this very clear distinction is the result of the two paragraphs of s. 31  of the
Criminal Code , even though the latter is found under the heading
""Pro­tection of Persons Administering and Enforcing the Law"". If the
fact that a peace officer took an individual into custody in the circumstances
men­tioned in the section constituted only one phase of an arrest, there is no
question, to my mind, that the section would have been worded quite
differently.

Section 133  of the Criminal Code  (formerly s. 125 ) is not
without relevance, and it must be read in light of the decision of this Court
in R. v. James Whitfield[14].

Accordingly I would allow the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal Law—Coroner's inquest—Committal for refusing to testify—Application
for writ of prohibition refused—Civil proceeding—Court of Queen's Bench
(Criminal Side) lacks jurisdiction—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss.
2(10), 413(2)—Coroners Act, 1966-67 (Que.), c, 19, ss. 1, 7, 13 and 30.

Appellant had been called by the coroner as a
witness. Having refused to testify, he was repeatedly committed for contempt of
court. At the continuation of the inquest, appellant was again invited to
testify and refused to do so. In the interval of adjournment, he submitted to
the Court of Queen's Bench, Criminal Side, a motion praying that a writ of
prohibition be issued against the coroner, arguing that the matter was dealt
with by the Criminal Code  and that the coroner had exhausted his
jurisdiction with respect to contempt of court. This motion was dismissed for
the reason that the matter in question was dealt with by the Code of Civil
Procedure. This judgment was upheld by the Court of Appeal which
concluded that, as the matter was of a civil nature, only the Superior Court
had authority to hear a motion for prohibition against the coroner. Appellant
was granted leave to appeal by this Court.

Held (Laskin C.J. and Spence, Pigeon and
Beetz JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Dickson and de Grandpré
JJ.: The Coroners Act, which is not claimed to be unconstitutional, does
not create a court in the ordinary sense. The coroner has not been a part of
the structure of criminal justice since 1892. The link was completely severed
at that time, and subsequent legisla­tive changes have only made this fact more
apparent. The traditional role of the coroner, as it existed in

[Page 10]

England, disappeared, and was replaced by a function
which was not primarily of a criminal nature, but came to have a social
context. While the investigation of crime is important, it is no longer the
determining aspect. The proceeding itself is not as such concerned with. the
investigation of crime because the inquest is not a trial and there is no
accused. It goes without saying that if the writ of prohibition is to be
regarded as a ""proceeding in criminal matters"", the Superior Court
alone has jurisdiction, and the finding of the Court of Appeal in the case at
bar is not in error.

Per Laskin C.J. and Spence, Pigeon and Beetz JJ.,
dissenting: At the date of Confederation, by the common law and by statute
proceedings at a coroner's inquest were Procedure in Criminal Matters which
were subsequently properly dealt with as such by the Parlia­ment of Canada. It
cannot be said to be otherwise when a ""coroner's inquisition"" was the
equivalent of an indictment returned by a grand jury, It cannot be said that as
a result of the changes subsequently made by Parlia­ment, a coroner no longer
has any criminal jurisdiction. His duties under the Code cannot be considered
of negligible importance.

Concerning the definition of ""court of criminal
jurisdiction"" in s. 2(10)  of the Criminal Code , it in no way
implies that all courts not enumerated have no criminal jurisdiction. All it means
is that such courts have no jurisdiction to try indictable offences.

[Page 11]

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence, Pigeon and Beetz JJ. was
delivered by

PIGEON J. (dissenting)—This appeal is from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for the Province of Quebec affirming a judgment of the
Court of Queen's Bench (Crown side) dismissing an application for a writ of
prohibition against the coroner for the District of Montreal. One Pocetti who
had joined with Faber on the application and on the appeals, died before the
hearing in this Court.

The appelant had been called as a witness at the continuation of
an inquest held by the coroner over a death which the coroner had earlier
stated to be in his opinion due to a crime. The appellant had refused to
testify after being repeatedly committed for contempt. The Court of Appeal held
that the proceedings were not in a criminal matter and, therefore, the Court of
Queen's Bench (Crown side) being a superior court of criminal jurisdiction
exclusively, had no jurisdiction in the circum­stances. This is the only
question arising for deci­sion on this appeal.

It appears desirable at first to review the history of coroner's
inquests. When the criminal law of England was introduced in Quebec at the
start of the British regime as confirmed by the Quebec Act, a coroner's
inquisition, as it was called, could be treated as equivalent to an indictment
when it was presented charging some person with murder or manslaughter. In
Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England (21st ed.), one reads
(at p. 274):

The court of the coroner is also a court of record,
to inquire, when any one dies in prison, or comes to a violent or sudden death,
by what manner he came to his end. And this he is only entitled to do super visum
corporis.

The finding of such inquest is equivalent to the find­ing of
a grand jury; and, therefore, a woman tried on the coroner's inquest for the
murder of her bastard child may be found guilty, under the statute, of
endeavoring to conceal its birth, there being no distinction in this respect
between the coroner's inquisition and a bill of indictment returned by the
grand jury. 2 Leach, 1095; 3 Campb., 371; Russ. & Ry., C.C., 240. But in
order to found an indictment on a coroner's inquest, the jurors,

[Page 12]

and not merely the coroner, must have suscribed it. Imp. Cor.,
65.—(Chitty.)

That such became the practice in Canada is apparent from the
following provisions of the Act 4-5 Vict. c. 24, passed in 1841 at the first
session of the first provincial parliament of Canada:

IV. And be it enacted, that every Coroner, upon any
inquisition taken before him, whereby any person shall be indicted for
manslaughter or murder, or as an acces­sory to murder before the fact, shall,
in presence of the party accused, if he can be apprehended, put in writing the
evidence given to the jury before him, or as much thereof as shall be material,
giving the party accused full opportunity of cross-examination; and shall have
author­ity to bind by recognizance all such persons as know or declare any
thing material touching the said manslaughter or murder, or the said offence of
being acces­sory to murder, to appear at the next Court of Oyer and Terminer,
or Gaol Delivery, or other Court at which the trial is to be, then and there to
prosecute or give evidence against the party charged; and every such Coroner
shall certify and subscribe the same evidence, and all such recognizances, and
also the inquisition before him taken, and shall deliver the same to the proper
Officer of the Court in which the trial is to be, before, or at the opening of
the Court.

V. And be it enacted, that when and so often as any person
shall be committed for trial by any Justice or Justices, or Coroner as
aforesaid, it shall and may be lawful for such Prisoner, his Counsel, Attorney
or Agent, to notify the said committing Justice or Justices, or Coroner, that
he will so soon as Counsel can be heard, move Her Majesty's Court of Superior
Jurisdiction for that part of the Province in which such person stands
committed, or one of the Judges thereof, for an order to the Justices of the
Peace, or Coroner for the District where such Prisoner shall be confined, to
admit such Prisoner to bail, .. .

After Confederation those provisions were promptly reenacted by
the Parliament of Canada in an act passed in 1869 entitled ""An Act
respect­ing the duties of Justices of the Peace, out of Sessions, in relation
to persons charged with Indictable Offences"", (1869 (Can.), c. 30, s.
60,

[Page 13]

61). In the Revised Statutes of Canada 1886, the same provisions
essentially unchanged were s. 92 and 93 of c. 174, The Criminal Procedure
Act, under the heading ""Duties of Coroners and Justices"".

From this it seems clear to me that, at the date of
Confederation, by the common law and by statute, proceedings at a coroner's
inquest were Procedure in Criminal Matters and were properly dealt with as such
by the Parliament of Canada. I fail to see how it could be said to be otherwise
when a ""coroner's inquisition"" was the equivalent of an indictment
returned by a grand jury. That the coroner proceeded on his own initiative
without a charge being laid certainly could not make any difference when it is
remembered that a grand jury might investigate on its own and return a
presentment. See Blackstone, same edition, p. 301:

A presentment, generally taken, is a very comprehen­sive
term, including not only presentments properly so called, but also inquisitions
of office, and indictments by a grand jury. A present, properly speaking,
is the notice taken by a grand jury of any offense from their own knowledge or
observation, without any bill of indictment laid before them at the suite of
the king, as the presentment of a nuisance, a libel, and the like; upon which
the officer of the court must afterward frame an indictment, before the party
presented can be put to answer it.

An important change was made when s. 642  of the Criminal Code  1892
was enacted as 1892 (Can.), c. 29:

642. After the commencement of this Act no one shall be
tried upon any coroner's inquisition.

At the same time s. 568 determined the duties of a coroner after
an inquest, as follows:

568. Every coroner, upon any inquisition taken before him
whereby any person is charged with manslaughter or murder, shall (if the person
or persons, or either of them, affected by such verdict or finding be not
already charged with the said offence before a magistrate or justice), by
warrant under his hand, direct that such person be taken into custody and be
conveyed, with all

[Page 14]

convenient speed, before a magistrate or justice; or such
coroner may direct such person to enter into a recogni­zance before him, with
or without a surety or sureties, to appear before a magistrate or justice. In
either case, it shall be the duty of the coroner to transmit to such magistrate
or justice the depositions taken before him in the matter. Upon any such person
being brought or appearing before any such magistrate or justice, he shall
proceed in all respects as though such person had been brought or had appeared
before him upon a warrant or summons.

These provisions in somewhat different form are now to be found
in s. 462 (formerly s. 448) and s, 506 (3) (formerly s. 488 (3)) of the present
Crimi­nal Code.

I cannot agree that as a result of those changes it can properly
be said that a coroner no longer has any criminal jurisdiction. Even if his
duties under the Code, when a person is alleged to have com­mitted murder or
manslaughter, are only to issue a warrant or to require a recognizance and, in
either case, to transmit the evidence to the justice before whom the person
charged is to appear, those duties certainly cannot be considered of negligible
impor­tance. If a justice who receives an information hears the evidence of
witnesses for the sole purpose of deciding whether he will issue a summons or
warrant under s. 440 (now s. 455.3(1)) of the 1953 Criminal Code , will anyone
contend that the pro­ceedings before him are not in a criminal matter? At the
date of Confederation, the proceedings at an inquest by a coroner undoubtedly
came within the ambit of Procedure in Criminal Matters just as much as the proceedings
before a grand jury. Parliament gave them a different effect when enacting the Criminal
Code , 1892. There is noth­ing in that enactment indicating an intention to
alter the legal character of those proceedings.

Concerning the definition of ""court of criminal
jurisdiction"" in s. 2(10)  of the Criminal Code  of 1953 (now an
unnumbered paragraph of s. 2 ), I must point out that this is not a definition
of that expression in its usual meaning, but in the very special meaning it has
in s. 413(2)  (now s. 427 ). In short, it means a court having jurisdiction to
try an indictable offence. This is apparent from the fact

[Page 15]

that this definition does not include summary con­viction courts,
although such courts do exist and are mentioned frequently in Part XXIV of the Criminal
Code . It is also apparent from the refer­ence to courts presided over by a
municipal judge in the cities of Montreal and Quebec. Therefore, the definition
of ""court of criminal jurisdiction"" in no way implies that all courts
not enumerated have no criminal jurisdiction. All it means is that such courts
have no. jurisdiction to try indictable offences.

It is established by the decision of this Court In Re Storgoff[2]
that any remedy by prerogative writ against proceedings in a criminal matter
is to be treated as a matter of criminal procedure. Estey J., at p. 593, quotes
these words from Lord Esher in Ex Parte Woodhall[3]
(at p. 836):

If the proceeding before the magistrate was a pro­ceeding
the subject-matter of which was criminal, then the application in the Queen's
Bench Division for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus, which if
issued would enable the applicant to escape from the consequences of the
proceeding before the magistrate, was a proceeding the subject-matter of which
was criminal.

From the judgment rendered in the Ontario Court of Appeal by
Schroeder J.A. in Wolfe v. Robinson[4], I
will quote the following passages (at pp. 135, 137):

It is too late in the day to contend, as did counsel for the
Attorney-General, but not too strenuously, that the Coroner's Court is not a
criminal Court of record. The office of coroner is one of great antiquity and
is believed by some historians to go back to Saxon times, but its historical
development can with greater certainty be traced back to a period close to the
time of the Norman Conquest. ...

The Coroner's Court being a criminal Court of record, only
the Parliament of Canada has authority to enact legislation as to the Rules of
Practice and. Procedure

[Page 16]

to be followed in that forum in accordance with the
provisions of s. 91(27) of the B.N.A. Act.

In Batary v. Attorney General for Saskatchewan[5],
this Court gave consideration to some provisions of the Coroners Act of Saskatche­wan
including the following:

15. (1) The coroner and jury shall at the first sitting of
the inquest view the body unless a view has been dispensed with under section 9
or 10, and the coroner shall examine on oath, touching the death, all persons
who tender their evidence respecting the facts and all persons who in his opinion
are likely to have knowledge of relevant facts.

(2) Subject to subsection (3), no person giving evi­dence at
the inquest shall be excused from answering a question upon the ground that the
answer thereto may tend to criminate him or may tend to establish his liability
to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person or to a
prosecution under any Act of the Legislature, but if he objects to answering
the question upon any such ground he shall be entitled to the protection
afforded by section 5  of the Canada Evidence Act  and by section 33 of
the Saskatchewan Evidence Act.

(3) Before a person gives evidence at the inquest subsection
(2) shall be read to him by the coroner... .

Cartwright J. said, speaking for the majority of this
Court (at pp. 477-8):

Considered by themselves, without regard to the history of
the Act, and bearing in mind the rule that the intention to legislate outside
its allotted field is not lightly to be imputed to the legislature, these
sections could, I think, be construed as not rendering a person charged with an
offence arising out of the death compel­lable to give evidence at the inquest;
but when s. 15 as it now reads is contrasted with its predecessor s. 15 which
was repealed by Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1960, c. 14, s. 3, this construction
scarcely seems possible.

The earlier s. 15 read as follows:

The coroner and jury shall, at the first sitting of the
inquest, view the body, unless a view has been dis­pensed with under section 9
or 10, and the coroner shall examine on oath, touching the death, all persons
who tender their evidence respecting the facts and all persons whom he thinks
it expedient to examine as being likely to have knowledge of relevant facts;
pro­vided that a person who is suspected of causing the

[Page 17]

death, or who has been charged or is likely to be
charged with an offence relating to the death, shall not be compellable to give
evidence at the inquest, and if he does so shall not be cross-examined and
provided further that before such person gives any evidence this section shall
be read to him by the coroner.

I think the conclusion inescapable that by enacting s. 15 in
its present form the legislature intended to change the law and to render a
person charged with murder compellable to give evidence at the inquest on the
body of his alleged victim. Such legislation trenches upon the rule expressed
in the maxim nemo tenetur seipsum accusare which has been described (by
Coleridge J. in R. v. Scott, 1856, Dears & B. 47 at 61, 169 E.R. 909)
as ""a maxim of-our law as settled, as important and as wise as almost
any other in it."" This rule has long formed part of the criminal law of
England and of this country. With great respect for the contrary view expressed
in the Court of Appeal, I am of opinion that any legisla­tion, purporting to
make the change in the law referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph
or to abrogate or alter the existing rules which protect a person charged with
crime from being compelled to testify against himself, is legislation in
relation to the Criminal Law including the Procedure in Criminal Matters and so
within the exclusive legislative authority of the Par­liament of Canada under
head 27 of s. 91 of the British North America Act.

I can see no reason for viewing in a different light the general
character of the Coroners' Act of Quebec and I cannot agree with the
suggestion that the legal character of a coroner's inquest be different when a
charge has already been laid. If that was true, it would mean that the procedure
would be governed by Federal law in such a. case and by provincial law in all
other cases. In my view, the decision in Batary, although rendered in a
case where the suspected person was actually charged before the inquest, is
equally applicable where a person is likely to be charged. The legisla­tion
under consideration purported to replace a provision expressly dealing with
both situations on the same footing and it was held invalid on the basis
that it was ""in relation to the Criminal Law including the Procedure in
Criminal Matters"". No distinction was made in pronouncing such invalidi­ty
on that basis and this conclusion on the charac­ter and validity of the
legislation cannot be treated as restricted to the particular situation arising
out

[Page 18]

of the facts of the case. Even if it could be so considered, the
same conclusion should be reached in the instant case as to the character of
the coroner's inquest.

However, because in the present case we are solely concerned with
the jurisdiction of the Court of Queen's Bench (Crown side) to issue a writ of
prohibition, no opinion has to be expressed respect­ing the constitutional
validity of any part of the Quebec Coroners' Act. The Provincial
Legislature undoubtedly has some jurisdiction, coroners are provincial
appointees. Where should the line be drawn between Procedure in Criminal
Matters which is within federal jurisdiction and the Administration of Justice
in the Province which is within provincial competence does not come for
decision today. However, one must remember that in matters which are in
themselves of criminal law, the abstinence of the Federal Parliament from
legislating to the full limit of its powers does not enlarge the field of
provincial jurisdiction: Henry Birks & Sons Ltd. v. City of Montreal,[6]
(at p. 811).

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of
Appeal and refer the case back to that Court for a decision on the merits of
the appeal from the judgment refusing to allow a writ of prohibition to issue.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Dickson and de Grandpré
JJ. was delivered by

DE GRANDPRÉ J.—Appellant Claude Faber (Jacques Pocetti now being
deceased) asks this Court to quash a unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal[7],
affirming the judgment at first instance, and to authorize the issuance of a
writ of prohibition against the Coroner for the district of Montreal.

In the fall of 1967 the Coroner conducted an inquest into the
death of one Jules Csoman. Sever-al times during the course of that inquest the
Coroner summoned appellant before him as a wit­ness: on each occasion appellant
declined to testify

[Page 19]

and was accordingly convicted of contempt of court. The relevant
details are the following:

—December 11, 1967—seven days; —December 18, 1967—four days;
—December 20, 1967—three months.

On January 8, 1968 the Coroner handed down the following
""open"" verdict:

[TRANSLATION] That in my opinion a crime was com­mitted,
that the acts constituting it are those described above, and that one or more
persons unknown should be held responsible. Police recommended to continue
their investigations and make a report in due course.

At the instance of counsel for the Crown the Coroner, on March 5,
1968, again summoned appellant, and the latter maintained his refusal to
testify. The inquest was continued to March 12, 1968, and in the interval
appellant submitted to George S. Challies A.C.J., sitting in the Court of
Queen's Bench, Criminal Side, a motion praying that a writ of prohibition be
issued. The principal argument relied on by appellant in his motion was that
the matter was dealt with by the Criminal Code , and the Coroner had
exhausted his jurisdic­tion with respect to the offence of contempt of court.

Challies A.C.J. refused to accept this argument, and took the
view of the Crown, that the matter in question was dealt with by the Code of
Civil Procedure.

The question of the jurisdiction of the Court of Queen's Bench,
Criminal Side, was not raised before Challies A.C.J. It was, however, argued
before the Court of Appeal, which on May 28, 1969 unanimously concluded that,
as the matter was of a civil nature, only the Superior Court had authority to
hear a motion for prohibition against the Coroner.

On June 16, 1969, on a motion by appellant, this Court granted
leave to appeal on the following question of law:

[TRANSLATION] Did the Court of Appeal err in law in holding
that the Court of Queen's Bench (Criminal Side) was without jurisdiction to
hear and determine the

[Page 20]

merits of the motion by appellant to have a writ of
prohibition issued?

There is no question that if the writ of prohibi­tion sought
by appellant is to be regarded as a ""proceeding in criminal matters""
pursuant to s. 708  of the Criminal Code  (formerly s. 680 ), the Court of
Queen's Bench, Criminal Side, had jurisdiction to hear and determine the merits
of appel­lant's motion. In Minister of National Revenue v. Lafleur[8]
this Court pointed out, at p. 416:

[TRANSLATION] Since In re Storgoff, supra, a writ of
prohibition is considered as a civil or criminal proceed­ing depending on the
subject-matter to which it applies.

The Lafleur decision also notes that if the subject-matter
is of a criminal nature the Superior Court lacks jurisdiction, as the latter
then belongs at first instance exclusively to the Court of Queen's Bench,
Criminal Side.

Further, it goes without saying that if the case is of a civil
nature the Superior Court alone has jurisdiction, with the result that the
finding of the Court of Appeal in the case at bar is not in error.

Before proceeding with consideration of the arguments raised by
appellant, two points in the record should be noted:

(1) appellant does not dispute the constitutionality of the Coroners
Act, but asks the Court to interpret it in the light of prior decisions
holding that a coroner's inquest is first and foremost a criminal matter;

(2) appellant does not maintain that the Coroner lacked
jurisdiction to sentence him to prison as a result of his refusal to testify,
but he contends that this jurisdiction is conferred on the Coroner by the Criminal
Code , and that consequently it is more restrictive (e.g. s. 472 , formerly
456) than it would be if the case were governed by the Code of Civil
Procedure (Arts. 49 et seq.).

Within the lines thus indicated appellant relies especially on
the authority of the decision of this Court in Batary v. The Attorney
General for Saskatchewan et al[9]. In
my opinion that case does not resolve the issue: it is only necessary to
re-read the reasons of Cartwright J., as he then was,

[Page 21]

delivering the majority ruling (Fauteux J., as he then was,
dissenting) in order to realize this. The headnote summary being sufficiently
precise, I cite it here in extenso:

The criminal law in force in Saskatchewan is that of England
as it existed on July 15, 1870, except as altered, varied, modified or affected
by the Criminal Code  or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada. Under
that law as it existed on that date, a person charged with murder and awaiting
trial could not be compelled to testify at an inquest into the death of the
deceased with whose murder he was charged. No alteration has been made in this
state of the law by the combined effect of ss. 2 , 4(1)  and 5  of the Canada
Evidence Act  and ss. 448  and 488(3)  of the Criminal Code . These
sections of the Canada Evidence Act  do not have the effect of render­ing
an accused a compellable witness at the coroner's inquest. It would require
clear words to bring about so complete a change in the law as it existed in
1870. It would be a strange inconsistency if the law which care-fully protects
an accused from being compelled to make any statement at a preliminary inquiry
should permit that inquiry to be adjourned in order that the prosecu­tion be
permitted to take the accused before a coroner and submit him against his will
to examination and cross-examination as to his supposed guilt. In the absence
of clear words in an Act of Parliament or other compelling authority, that is
not the state of the law. The case of R. v. Barnes, 36 C.C.C. 40, not
followed.

By enacting s. 15 of the Coroners Act in its present
form, the Legislature intended to change the law and to render a person charged
with murder compellable to give evidence at the inquest on the body of his
alleged victim. Such legislation trenches upon the rule expressed in the maxim nemo
tenetur seipsum accusare. Any legislation purporting to make such a change
in the law or to abrogate or alter the existing rules which protect a person
charged with a crime from being compelled to testify against himself, is legislation
in relation to the Criminal Law including the Procedure in Criminal Mat­ters
and therefore within the exclusive legislative author­ity of the Parliament
under s. 91(27) of the B.N.A. Act.

In the case at bar appellant, at the time he was required to
testify, had not been charged with any offence as a result of the death of Csoman,
and as a matter of fact no charge has been brought against him to date, In my
view the effect of this

[Page 22]

fundamental difference is that Batary has no application to
the case at bar.

This is especially true as, at p. 478, Cartwright J. takes care
to state that:

Questions other than those with which I have dealt above
were raised in the course of the argument but I do not find it necessary to
deal with them.

The fact remains that, until the decision of the British Columbia
Court of Appeal in R. v. McDonald[10], the
""criminal nature"" of the coron­er's inquest had almost never been
questioned. That decision, at the very least, disturbed this quasi-certain
position, and I shall only cite the relevant summary here:

A person who may be, but has not been, charged with an
offence under the Criminal Code  or under a penal provincial statute with
respect to his conduct or actions involving the death of a person, is a
compellable witness at a Coroner's inquest inquiring into that death. The maxim
nemo tenetur seipsum accusare does not exempt him from testifying.

Although certain sections of the Coroners Act, R.S.B.C.
1960, c. 78, may be inoperative or ultra vires they are clearly severable,
and the rest of the Act, including a section fixing the number of jurors at
six, is intra vires the Legislature of British Columbia as legis­lation
in relation to the administration of justice in the Province under s. 92(14) of
the B.N.A. Act. A Coroner's Court is not a criminal Court in the sense
of a Court administering ""the Criminal Law"" or dealing with
""criminal matters"" within the meaning of s. 91(27) of the B.N.A.
Act, and hence the procedure in a Coroner's Court does not come under the
jurisdiction of Parliament.

In order to answer the question before the Court it is necessary
to consider the role of the coroner in Quebec at the present time, the nature
of the institution and the purpose of the inquests en-trusted to him by the
law. Such an undertaking could take us far afield, and I shall merely indicate
the general outline,

The Courts have reviewed the development of the coroner's
function on several occasions, and I

[Page 23]

refer to the following decisions here for back-ground purposes,
not that I subscribe to their conclusions, but because they provide useful data
for analysis of the question: R. v. Hammond[11];
R. v. Lalonde et al.[12];
Wolfe v. Robinson[13].

It must be noted that, notwithstanding the title of the
proceedings at bar, no such thing as the ""Coroner's Court (Montreal)""
or the ""Court of Record (Montreal)"" exists. As there is no federal
legislation concerning the coroner (except inciden­tally), the nature and
functions of this institution must be sought exclusively in c. 19 of 1966-67 (Que.),
given royal assent on June 29, 1967 and titled the Coroners Act. Nowhere
in this Act is any mention made of a Coroner's Court. Rather, the Act
provides, inter alia, the following:

(1) a coroner is appointed for a judicial district or part of a
judicial district (s. 1);

(2) permanent coroners are appointed in accordance with the Civil
Service Act (s. 7);

(3) the coroner is required to make a return to the Attorney
General on every case investigated (s. 13);

(4) similarly, the coroner must make a return to the Attorney
General on each inquest (s. 30).

These are definitely not the prerogatives of a ""court""
in the ordinary sense. Even if it could be said that coroners as a whole
constitute a court, the latter would not be a court of record, as can clearly be
seen from ss. 13 and 32 of the Act. These sections subject the coroner to a
requirement, and we need only refer here to the last paragraph of s. 32:

He shall also deposit forthwith in the office of the clerk
of the peace of the district where the inquest was held the originals of the
documents mentioned in paragraphs a, b and c and a copy of the return
contemplated in section 30.

[Page 24]

The conclusion that coroners do not constitute a court, even less
a court of record, under the legisla­tion of Quebec, appears to me to be in
accordance with the provisions found in the Criminal Code . A ""court
of criminal jurisdiction"" is defined as follows in s. 2 :

(a) a court of general or quarter sessions of the peace,
when presided over by a superior court judge or a county or district court
judge, or in the cities of Montreal and Quebec, by a municipal judge of the
city, as the case may be, or a judge of the sessions of the peace,

(b) a magistrate or judge acting under Part XVI, and

(c) in the Province of New Brunswick, the county court.

There is thus no reference to a Coroner's Court. Further, s. 23
of the Canada Evidence Act  makes a clear distinction between a court and
a coroner:

(1) Evidence of any proceeding or record whatever of, in, or
before any court in Great Britain or the Supreme or Exchequer Courts of Canada,
or any court in any province of Canada, or any court in any British colony or
possession, or any court of record of the United States of America, or of any
state of the United States of America, or of any other foreign country, or
before any justice of the peace or coroner in any prov­ince of Canada, may be
given in any action or proceed­ing by an exemplification or certified copy
thereof, purporting to be under the seal of such court, or under the hand or
seal of such justice or coroner, as the case may be, without any proof of the
authenticity of such seal or of the signature of such justice or coroner, or
other proof whatever.

(2) Where any such court, justice or coroner has no seal, or
so certifies, such evidence may be made by a copy purporting to be certified
under the signature of a judge or presiding magistrate of such court or of such
justice or coroner, without any proof of the authenticity of the signature, or
other proof whatever.

What can be said of the coroner's functions under Quebec
legislation? The answer is to be found in s. 11 in the case of investigations:

The coroner must investigate the circumstances of the death
of any person whose death does not appear to him to have resulted from natural
causes or to have been purely accidental but which may have occurred from

[Page 25]

violence, or negligent or culpable conduct of a third
person.

He shall also make such an investigation whenever the
Attorney-General requires him to do so.

and in s. 14 in the case of inquests:

The coroner must hold an inquest into the circum­stances of
a death whenever he has reason to believe, after his investigation, that the
death occurred from violence, or negligent or culpable conduct of a third
person.

He must also hold an inquest whenever the Attorney-General
requires him to do so.

The jurisdiction is thus quite general in nature, and not
primarily criminal. I shall return to this point below.

The position is quite different from what it was nearly a century
ago, when in 1879 the Quebec legislature, by c. 12 of 1879 (Que.), provided as
follows:

WHEREAS it is expedient to put an end to the holding of
useless inquests in the Province of Quebec, in the case of sudden deaths
arising from accidents and without the commission of any crime; Therefore, Her
Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislature of Quebec,
enacts as follows:

1. No coroner shall hold an inquest on the death of any
person, unless he is furnished with a certificate signed by a justice of the
peace establishing that there is reason to suspect that such death has been
caused by the commission of a crime, or when such inquest is demanded by a
requisition in writing signed by the mayor, the curé, pastor or missionary of
the locality, or by a justice of the peace of the county.

Since that time there has been a regular evolu­tion in the
thinking of the legislator. We need only refer to the following major dates.

In 1880, by c. 10 of 1880 (Que.), it was enacted that no inquest
should be held unless the coroner had reason to believe ""that a crime has
been committed, or that the deceased died from violence or unfair means, or
under such circumstances as require investigation"" (s. 1).

In 1892, c. 26 of 1892 (Que.) gave the coroner jurisdiction where
""he has good reason for believing

[Page 26]

that the deceased did not come to his death from natural causes
or from mere accident or mischance, but came to his death from violence or
unfair means or culpable or negligent conduct of others, under circumstances
requiring investigation by a coroner's inquest"" (s. 1).

In 1964, the penultimate stage of this evolution is found in c.
29 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, s. 16, which reads as follows:

The coroner may himself investigate the circum­stances which
preceded or accompanied the death of any person, when he has good reason to
believe that the deceased came to his death, not from natural causes or from
mere accident or mischance, but from violence, or negligent or culpable conduct
of some other person, under circumstances such as might subsequently require
the holding of a coroner's inquest.

The Attorney-General may also, whenever he deems it
expedient in the public interest, direct the coroner to make an investigation
into the circumstances which have preceded or accompanied the death of any
person.

The coroner shall give a burial permit when it is
established by his investigation that the deceased came to his death from
natural causes or from mere accident or mischance.

This evolution in the legislation of Quebec, which shifts the
jurisdiction of the coroner from investigation of crimes to investigation of
every-thing that is not natural of purely accidental, is not without relevance,
in my opinion, to the development in the thinking of the legislator having
jurisdiction in criminal proceedings.

In 1841, by c. 24 of 1841 (Can.), the province of Canada enacted,
in ss. IV and V:

IV. And be it enacted, that every Coroner, upon any
inquisition taken before him, whereby any person shall be indicted for manslaughter
or murder, or as an acces­sory to murder before the fact, shall, in presence of
the party accused, if he can be apprehended, put in writing the evidence given
to the jury before him, or as much thereof as shall be material, giving the
party accused full opportunity of cross-examination; and shall have author­ity
to bind by recognizance all such persons as know or declare any thing material
touching the said man-slaughter or murder, or the said offence of being acces­sory
to murder, to appear at the next Court of Oyer and Terminer, or Gaol Delivery,
or other Court at which the

[Page 27]

trial is to be, then and there to prosecute or give evidence
against the party charged; and every such Coroner shall certify and subscribe
the same evidence, and all such recognizances, and also the inquisition before
him taken, and shall deliver the same to the proper Officer of the Court in
which the trial is to be, before, or at the opening of the Court.

V. And be it enacted, that when and so often as any person
shall be committed for trial by any Justice or Justices, or Coroner as
aforesaid, it shall and may be lawful for such Prisoner, his Counsel, Attorney
or Agent, to notify the said committing Justice or Justices, or Coroner, that
he will so soon as Counsel can be heard, move Her Majesty's Court of Superior
Jurisdiction for that part of the Province in which such person stands
committed, or one of the Judges thereof, for an order to the Justices of the
Peace, or Coroner for the District where such Prisoner shall be confined, to
admit such Prisoner to bail, whereupon it shall be the duty of such committing
Justice or Justices, or Coroner, with all convenient expedition to transmit to
the office of the Clerk of the Crown, close under the hand and seal of one of
them, a certified copy of all informations, exami­nations, and other evidences,
touching the offence wherewith such Prisoner shall be charged, together with a
copy of the warrant of commitment and inquest, if any such there be, and that
the packet containing the same shall be handed to the person applying therefor,
in order to such transmission, and it shall be certified on the outside thereof
to contain the information touching the case in question.

In 1869 Parliament demonstrated the same thinking in ss. 60 and
61 of 1869 (Can.), c. 30.

It was reaffirmed in 1886 in c. 174 of the Revised Statutes of Canada.

92. Every coroner, upon any inquisition taken before him,
whereby any person is indicted for manslaughter or murder, or as an accessory
to murder before the fact, shall, in the presence of the accused, if he can be
apprehended, reduce to writing the evidence given to the. jury before him, or
as much thereof as is material, giving the accused full opportunity of
cross-examination; and the coroner shall have authority to bind by recogni­zance
all such persons as know or declare anything material touching the manslaughter
or murder, or the offence of being accessory to murder, to appear at the next
court of oyer and terminer, or gaol delivery, or other court or term or sitting
of a court, at which the

[Page 28]

trial is to be, then and there to prosecute or give evidence
against the person charged; and every such coroner shall certify and subscribe
the evidence and all the recognizances, and also the inquisition taken before
him, and shall deliver the same to the proper officer of the court at the time
and in the manner specified in the seventy-seventh section of this Act. 32-33
V., c. 30, s. 60.

93. When any person has been committed for trial by any
justice or coroner, the prisoner, his counsel, attorney or agent may notify the
committing justice or coroner, that he will, as soon as counsel can be heard,
move before a superior court of the Province in which such person stands
committed, or one of the judges thereof, or the judge of the county court, if
it is intended to apply to such judge, under the eighty-second section of this
Act, for an order to the justice or coroner for the territorial division where
such prisoner is confined, to admit such prisoner to bail,—whereupon such
committing justice or coroner shall, as soon as may be, transmit to the office
of the clerk of the Crown, or the chief clerk of the court, or the clerk of the
county court or other proper officer, as the case may be, close under his hand
and seal, a certified copy of all informations, examina­tions and other
evidences, touching the offence where-with the prisoner has been charged,
together with a copy of the warrant of commitment and inquest, if any such
there is; and the packet containing the same shall be handed to the person
applying therefor, for transmission, and it shall be certified on the outside
thereof to contain the information concerning the case in question. 32-33 V.,
c. 30, s. 61.

Reference should also be made to paras. (c) and (d) of s. 2 of
this Act, which contain the following definitions:

(c) The expression ""indictment"" includes informa­tion,
inquisition and presentment as well as indictment, and also any plea,
replication or other pleading, and any record;

(d) The expression ""finding of the indictment""
includes also the taking of an inquisition, the exhibiting an information and
the making of a presentment.

This whole position was profoundly altered in 1892, when for the
first time a complete Criminal Code was adopted.

[Page 29]

(1) The definitions found in paras. (i) and (j) of s. 3
are quite different, and read as follows:

(i) The expression ""indictment"" and
""count"" respectively include information and presentment as well as
indictment, and also any plea, replication or other pleading, and any record;
R.S.C., c. 174, s. 2(c).

(j) Finding the indictment includes also exhibit­ing an
information and making a presentment; R.S.C., c. 174, s. 2(d).

(2) Section 642  states that:

After the commencement of this Act no one shall be tried upon
any coroner's inquisition.

(3) Section 568 limits the powers of the coroner:

Every coroner, upon any inquisition taken before him whereby
any person is charged with man-slaughter or murder, shall (if the person or
persons, or either of them, affected by such verdict or finding be not already
charged with the said offence before a magistrate or justice), by warrant under
his hand, direct that such person be taken into custody and be conveyed, with
all convenient speed, before a magistrate or justice; or such coroner may
direct such person to enter into a recognizance before him, with or without a
surety or sureties, to appear before a magistrate or justice. In either case,
it shall be the duty of the coroner to transmit to such magistrate or justice
the depositions taken before him in the matter. Upon any such person being
brought or appearing before any such magis­trate or justice, he shall proceed
in all respects as though such person had been brought or had appeared before
him upon a warrant or summons.

For the purposes of the case at bar (since the issue arose in
1967), the evolution of the Criminal Code  ceases with the 1953 version:

448. (1) Where a person is alleged, by a verdict upon a
coroner's inquisition, to have committed murder or

[Page 30]

manslaughter but he has not been charged with the offence, the
coroner shall

(a) direct, by warrant under his hand, that the person be
taken into custody and be conveyed, as soon as possible, before a justice, or

(b) direct the person to enter into a recognizance before
him with or without sureties, to appear before a justice.

(2) Where a coroner makes a direction under subsec­tion (1)
he shall transmit to the justice the evidence taken before him in the matter.

Simple comparison of these enactments indi­cates that the coroner
is not now a part of the structure of criminal justice. The link was com­pletely
severed in 1892, and subsequent legislative changes have only made this fact
more apparent. The traditional role of the coroner, as it existed in England,
disappeared, and was replaced by a duly Canadianized function, one which was
not primarily of a criminal nature, but came to have a social context. This
development can be seen, for instance, in the last paragraph of s. 30 of the Coroners
Act:

The coroner, in his report, may make any useful suggestions
for the protection of society.

At the present time the coroner's inquest may be taken to have at
least the following functions, apart from the investigation of crime:

(a) identification of the exact circumstances surrounding a
death serves to check public imagination, and prevents it from becoming
irresponsible;

(b) examination of the specific circumstances of a death and
regular analysis of a number of cases enables the community to be aware of the
factors which put human life at risk in given circumstances;

(c) the care taken by the authorities to inquire into the
circumstances, every time a death is not clearly natural or accidental,
reassures the public and makes it aware that the government is acting to ensure
that the guarantees relating to human life are duly respected.

In this situation, while the investigation of crime is important,
it is not the determining aspect of the

[Page 31]

coroner's functions, with the result that the ""crimi­nal""
aspect is not predominant.

Furthermore, the proceeding itself is not as such concerned with
the investigation of crime. As has been indicated on several occasions,

(a) the inquest is not a trial;

(b) there is no accused.

In view of this, I am unable to accept the conclusions stated in
decisions holding that the coroner is a court, or a court of record, with
criminal jurisdiction, especially as in many such cases the observation was
made obiter. On the contrary, as I indicated above, I accept the conclu­sion
of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. McDonald, cited
above; and I extract this sen­tence from the reasons of Bull J. (at p. 305):

I therefore conclude that the very nature of the inquiry
held by the Coroner in Canada, which is not a trial and at which there is no
party or person accused and the function of which is to investigate many other
matters than to find that murder or manslaughter has been committed, is such
that this Court cannot fairly be said to be a ""Court of Criminal
Jurisdiction"", whose procedures before such a verdict, if any, are
with respect to 'Criminal Matters' or 'criminal law' in order to come under the
exclusive authority of Parliament.

Similarly, I adopt the following paragraphs from the reasons of
McFarlane J., found at p. 308 following a quotation from the judgment of the
Ontario Court of Appeal in Wolfe v. Robinson, cited above:

To this apt description I would add that at a Coron­er's
inquest, under the Act, there is no lis, no accused and no charge, The
statute does not purport to confer jurisdiction to try any person accused of
any wrongful act, to acquit, convict or punish. Where the jury's verdict is
that the deceased came to his death by murder or manslaughter their inquisition
shall certify the per-sons (if any) guilty of the murder or manslaughter or of
being accessories before the fact of such murder (s. 15). This is an incidental
or ancillary function and does not of itself set the criminal law in motion.
Coroners are also required to hold inquests in many cases where there is no
suggestion or suspicion of wrongdoing. It may be said fairly that one of the
salutary results of inquests is to allay suspicions and remove doubts.

[Page 32]

In my opinion the legislation in its pitch and sub-stance is
enacted in relation to the administration of justice in the Province, thus
being within the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Province under head
14 of s. 92.

For all these reasons, therefore, Salvas J., speak­ing for the
Court of Appeal, properly wrote:

[TRANSLATION] According to the terms of Canada's
constitution, "". .. the ... Maintenance, and Organiza­tion of Provincial
Courts, both of Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction"" falls within the
exclusive authority of the legislature of this province (B.N.A. Act, 1867,
s. 92(14)).

There is no Coroner's Court in the province of Quebec, In
this province the courts ""in civil, criminal and mixed matters"" are
set out in the first section of the Courts of Justice Act (R.S.Q. c.
20). This list does not include a Coroner's Court. Section 3 of the same
statute provides that the coroner is an officer of justice, one of the officers
of justice appointed in each district by the Lieutenant Governor in Council for
""the administration of justice in the Province"".

The coroner is dealt with by a special Quebec Act (15-16
Eliz. II, c. 19). The inquest of Coroner Lapointe is that prescribed by s. 14
of this Act (Section IV, para. 1). Paragraph Two of this Section (ss. 19 to 29)
pre-scribes the rules of procedure and of evidence which are applicable to this
inquest. It is here that the question arises as to whether this proceeding and
this evidence are ""proceedings in criminal matters"" (Cr. Codes.
680). Appellant says they are; this is his fundamental argu­ment. In
support of his thesis, he cites s. 27 (15-16 Eliz. II, c. 19), which provides
that:

'The ordinary rules of evidence in criminal matters shall
apply to coroners inquests.'

With all due respect, I feel that, on the other hand, the
argument that appellant derives from this provision is unfavorable to his case.
If the coroner's inquest were a criminal matter s. 27 would be superfluous.
Thus, the Canada Evidence Act , which applies to the entire coun­try,
provides that Part I of the said Act, with which we are concerned here, applies
to ""all criminal proceedings"" (R.S.C. c. 307, s. 2).

[Page 33]

Appellant argues that the Superior Court referred to in the
provision of s. 23 (15-16 Eliz. II, c. 19) dealing specifically with the
punishment of recalcitrant wit­nesses is the superior court of criminal
jurisdiction. In the province of Quebec this court is the Court of Queen's
Bench, sitting as a criminal court of original jurisdiction (Cr. Code s. 2(14)
and R.S.Q. e. 20, s. 61). The Superior Court is again mentioned in ss. 21 and
22. When in the Coroners Act the Quebec legislator refers to the
Superior Court it is clear, in my view, that the intended reference is to the
Superior Court, which was established by another Act of the aforesaid
legislator (R.S.Q. c. 20, s. 21). If that legislator had wished to refer to a
superior court of criminal jurisdiction in s. 23 of the Coroners Act, he
would have spoken of the ""Court of Queen's Bench, sitting as a criminal
court of original jurisdiction"" (R.S.Q. c. 20, s. 61). In short, the
legislator said clearly what he meant to say.

In my view the inquest prescribed by s. 14 of the Coroners
Act is not a criminal matter. On the contrary, its purpose is to determine
whether there has been a crime, or more precisely, whether there was a criminal
matter associated with the death of an individual. It is limited to the
""circumstances of a death"". The inquest is that of the coroner, and
not of the ,Crown or of some other party. Before the coroner there is neither
an accuser or an accused. The purpose of the inquest is not the prosecution or
punishment of an accused.

The Coroners Act derives from the exclusive power of
provincial legislatures to make laws in relation to ""the administration of
justice in the province"" and ""the imposition of punishment ... for
enforcing"" such laws (B.N.A. Act, s. 92(14) and (15)),

The inquest held by Coroner Lapointe is not a crimi­nal
matter within the meaning of s. 680  of the Criminal Code . As the court
of first instance was a court sitting ""in criminal matters"", (of art.
7.08  C. Cr.) it had no jurisdiction to rule on the merits of appellant's
motion. For this reason, I conclude that the motion should be dismissed.

I would dismiss the appeal with costs.

Appeal dismissed with costs, LASKIN C.J. and

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO

Criminal law—Evidence—Surprise evidence at trial—Admissibility—Relevancy
of Document—Whether document in possession of accused—Pre-trial disclosure—Preliminary
enquiry—Motion to re-elect—Criminal Code , s. 3(4) .

A search, pursuant to a warrant issued on the basis
of suspicion that certain fire arms were present in appel­lant's home, resulted
in the discovery of counterfeit money, a loaded pistol and ammunition, $1,713
in cash and some handwritten notes in Italian. The appellant was charged with
(first) possession without lawful excuse of six counterfeit notes, (second) the
possession of a weapon dangerous to the public peace and (third) possession of
a restricted weapon for which he did not have a registration certificate. The
handwritten notes were found in the kitchen cupboard and were not men­tioned at
all during the preliminary enquiry, were not disclosed to the defence prior to
the beginning of the trial but were introduced and mentioned for the first time
during the second day of the trial which took place before a judge alone.
Expert evidence identified the notes as a copy of the constitution of a Mafia
related secret society which preached and practised violence.

The trial judge granted an adjournment to permit
examination of the document. The defence made application for re-election in
order that the trial should proceed before a judge and jury but this was
refused. Appellant was convicted on all three counts and his appeal was dismissed
by the Court of Appeal, Arnup J.A. dissenting. Hence the appeal to this Court
on two questions only:

(1) was there evidence upon which the trial judge
could find that the possession of the weapon was for a purpose dangerous to the
public peace? and (2) did the

[Page 787]

failure of the Crown to disclose to the defence the
existence of exhibit 5 until after the trial had com­menced constitute a
miscarriage of justice?

Held (Laskin C.J. and Spence J. dissenting):
The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon,
Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. Referring to the first ques­tion, the
evidence justified the unanimous conclusion in the courts below that the
document was in the possession of the appellant. It was not necessary to invoke
the presumption of law that, when a husband and wife live together, the husband
is in possession and control of the premises in which they reside. In the
circumstances, the trial judge was entitled to draw an inference from the
possession of the document that the accused was a member of the organization to
which the document referred and therefore had possession of the weapon for a
purpose dangerous to the public peace.

Referring to the second question, there was no
obliga­tion on the Crown to disclose before trial to the defence the existence
of the document and the intention of the prosecution to introduce it into
evidence as an exhibit. The sole purpose of the preliminary enquiry is to
satisfy the magistrate that there is sufficient evidence to put the accused on
trial and the Crown has the discretion to present only that evidence which
makes out a prima facie case. At trial Crown counsel has full discretion
as to what witnesses should be called for the prosecution and the Court will
not interfere with the exercise of that discretion unless it can be shown that
the prosecutor has been influenced by some oblique motive. The accused must
however be guaranteed a fair trial, thus if the introduction of new evidence
takes the accused by surprise he is entitled to a postponement, as was obtained
by the appellant. The fact that the document was only revealed on the second
day of the trial (a) did not affect the conduct of the trial prior thereto; (b)
did not entitle the accused to make a second option (to be tried by judge and
jury rather than by judge alone) which as a rule must be made in the light of
the charge not in light of the evidence. In other words, there was no miscar­riage
of justice.

In reaching a conclusion as to whether or not a
miscarriage of justice exists the courts are entitled to take into account the
fact that the accused did not testify.

Per Laskin C.J. and Spence J. dissenting: The
police officers and the Crown in a carefully considered procedure

[Page 788]

concealed from the appellant and his counsel the
possession of the handwritten notes and their intention to use them at trial
until the trial had proceeded for some time. There was utter surprise to
defence counsel, however, in view of the fact that the trial did not proceed at
once and the statement by appellant's counsel that he had, as a result of the
adjournment, ample opportunity to prepare his case, no prejudice to the accused
was established. The appeal should none the less succeed on the basis that
without the document the Crown had not made out a prima facie case
that the possession of the weapon was for a purpose dangerous to the public
peace and that the Crown had failed to prove that the document was in the
possession of the appellant. The document found as it was in the kitchen
casually stored with household accounts inferred possession with the
appellant's wife and not with the appellant. The police procedure on discovery
of the document prevented the police from being able to show that it was in the
appellant's possession. Even if the document had been proven to be in the
possession of the appellant in such circumstances as would permit an inference
of his knowledge of its contents, it had no probative value to show that the
appellant possessed the weapon found for a purpose dangerous to the public. The
expert evidence demonstrated quite conclusively that the document related to an
organisation which died after an historic trial some 60 years ago. Such a
fragile basis for linking the accused with some unnamed and unoutlined crimi­nal
organization could not constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1]
dismissing an appeal from a conviction by Moore, Co. Ct. J., for possession of
a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace. Appeal dismissed, Laskin
C.J. and Spence

[Page 789]

J, dissenting.

A. Maloney, Q.C., for the appellant. 

A. Campbell, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence J. was delivered by

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal from the judgment
of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on January 26, 1973, which, by a
majority, dismissed an appeal from the judgment of the trial judge pronounced
on June 30, 1972, after a trial without a jury.

The appellant had been convicted on three charges: firstly,
possession of counterfeit money, secondly, possession of a weapon for a purpose
dangerous to the public peace, and thirdly, posses­sion of a restricted weapon.
The appellant had pleaded guilty to the third charge but none the less argued
in the Court of Appeal that the conviction thereon should be set aside. The
Court of Appeal unanimously confirmed the conviction on the first and third
counts and we are not concerned with those counts in this Court.

On the second count, that is, the possession of a weapon for a
purpose dangerous to the public peace, the majority of the Court, for reasons
given by the Chief Justice of Ontario, dismissed the appeal. Arnup J.A. gave
reasons for dissenting and would have allowed the appeal. The formal judg­ment
of the Court expressed the dissent of Arnup J.A. in these words:

The Honourable Mr. Justice Arnup dissenting therefrom and
expressing the opinion that the appeal against the conviction on charge two
(possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace) should be
allowed on the following grounds, in law, namely: that there was no evidence
upon which the trial judge could find that the possession of the weapon was for
a purpose dangerous to the public peace

The appellant applied to this Court for leave to appeal upon
other grounds of law and this Court,

[Page 790]

by its Order pronounced May 7, 1973, permitted an appeal to this
Court upon the following addi­tional ground:

Did the failure of the Crown to disclose to the defence the
existence of exhibit five until after the trial had commenced constitute a
miscarriage of justice?

I find it necessary to deal at considerable length with the
circumstances surrounding the charge of possession of a weapon for a purpose
dangerous to the public peace. I have taken most of the facts hereinafter
recited from the evidence given for the Crown by Detective Jack Carr, and
particularly from his cross-examination.

A shooting affray occurred at Newtonbrook Plaza in North York
Township in Metropolitan Toronto. During the ensuing investigation, the police
came to the conclusion that some numbers of persons related by blood and being
immigrants from a district in Italy known as Calabria might have been involved
and that offensive weapons might be found in the possession of many of those
people. Therefore, Detective Sergeant Mouncey instructed Detective Carr to obtain
a series of search warrants for offensive weapons applicable to various people
including the appellant. The actual search warrant was produced at trial and
marked as Exhibit 2; a search for the material upon which the application for
the search warrant had been based made during the course of the trial proved in
vain and Detective Carr from his memory could not give any information on that
topic. At any rate, Detective Carr admitted that he had never heard of the
appellant Francesco Cac­camo prior to having obtained the warrant to search his
residence and did not know any background. Detective Carr and three other
officers, all in plain clothes, on Sunday, August 1, 1971, arrived at the front
door of the premises—Detec­tive Carr and Detective Turner approaching the front
door while two other officers, Constable Wauchope and Constable Clark,
approached the rear door and waited until Detective Turner, having been
admitted to the front door, in turn admitted the two latter officers to the
rear door. The four officers then seemed to have divided up their task of
searching the premises with Detective

[Page 791]

Carr confining his search to the kitchen, although he was
assisted from time to time in that task by Detective Turner.

The first discovery by the officers was an American twenty-dollar
bill which had been torn in two pieces, which Detective Turner found in a
dresser in the master bedroom. He immediately asked the appellant whose money
that was and the appellant explained that it was money which he had found in
the same torn condition in the street. This was a genuine twenty-dollar bill.

Detective Turner continued his search of that dresser drawer and
under clothing found six Bank of Canada notes which turned out to be
counterfeit and which gave rise to the charge of possession of counterfeit
money to which I have already referred. Again, Detective Turner questioned the
appellant as to these counterfeit bank notes, receiving an explanation with
which we are not concerned.

Then, Constable Clark, for some unexplained reason, proceeded to
search the person of the appellant and found the sum of $1,713, again in
genuine money, in his right front pocket. For the third time, Detective Turner
questioned the appel­lant as to the possession of this sum of money and simply
had the reply that it was the appellant's personal property as he had not
banked that week.

Constable Wauchope lifted down, from the top right-hand side of a
clothes closet at the foot of the bed, a blue box which contained a black
pistol already loaded with six rounds of ammunition which Constable Wauchope
removed from the weapon, and then Constable Clark found a box containing an
additional eight rounds of 6.35 ammunition with a cleaning brush and cleaning
fluid. Once more, Detective Turner, cautioned the appellant on the offence of
possession of a restricted weapon. The appellant's answer did not appear in the
evidence.

During this time, with the appellant and Detec­tive Turner going
back and forth between the living room, master bedroom and kitchen, Detective

[Page 792]

Carr continued his desultory search in the kitchen. It would
appear that Mrs. Rosa Caccamo, the appellant's wife, who did not understand Eng­lish
and who was in such an obviously pregnant condition that the officers thought
it better that she should remain seated, stayed in the kitchen. Detective Carr
found nothing which interested him except that, with household bills, in the
kitchen cupboard in what would appear to be a plastic envelope he found several
slips of notepaper hand-written in Italian. This plastic envelope was on the
first shelf of the cupboard. It could hardly be imagined that it was in any way
concealed. Detec­tive Carr removed this plastic container and put it in his
pocket. So far as he was aware, Mrs. Cac­camo did not observe him doing this
and neither he nor Detective Turner, who had observed Detective Carr's
movements, made any reference to the papers to either Mrs. Caccamo or to the
appellant when he returned in a moment or two to the kitchen. These papers,
with the counterfeit money, the torn bill, the genuine money, and the pistol
with its ammunition, were all removed from the premises. The appellant was
charged with the three offences which I have outlined and eventual­ly came up
for preliminary hearing.

At the preliminary hearing, Detective Carr was not called by the
Crown as a witness. Counsel for the appellant, however, did call Detective Carr
as a witness, It must be remembered that there is no evidence to indicate that
either the appellant or his wife knew of the removal of these papers written in
Italian from the kitchen cupboard nor, of course, that the appellant's counsel
would have any knowl­edge of them. The appellant's counsel, therefore, did not
examine Detective Carr upon this topic but he did put to Detective Carr this
question: ""Q. And then what did you do?"", to which Detective Carr
replied ""A. Well, I looked in various places in the kitchen. I made a
search of the kitchen.""

Q. About how long?

A. Oh, possibly ten minutes.

When cross-examined at the trial as to his fail­ure to mention
the discovery of these papers written in Italian, Detective Carr made two
significant statements: Firstly, that he made no mention of these papers, and,
secondly,

[Page 793]

It wasn't my decision to make at that time; as I say, I knew
nothing of the actual contents [of the papers written in Italian]. I knew
basically what it was about. I had never seen a translation. In fact, I didn't
know there had been a translation made of the papers. I knew nothing of their
actual contents except what I have stated here today.

At the trial, these papers written in Italian were the subject of
a great deal of evidence and the question of the papers, which were marked as
Exhibit 5, is the kernel of the dissent of Arnup J.A. and of the chief issue
before this Court. The papers were produced and identified by Detective Carr
and evidence in reference to them was given by Sergeant Dino Chiarot of the
RCMP. Chiarot was Italian by parentage and had spent five years in Italy
working for the RCMP in conjunction with the Department of Immigration. His
evidence shall be referred to hereafter. This evidence was submitted prior to
counsel for the appellant being permitted to cross-examine Detective Carr. At
the close of Detective Carr's cross-examination, the Crown announced:

Your Honour, I am prepared—I have had an opportu­nity to
consult with some senior police officers and I am prepared to call as a witness
Dr. Alberto Sabatino, S-a-b-a-t-i-n-o, who is the head of the Mafia Unit of the
Federal Italian Police and who is in Italy and who has had an opportunity to
examine this document. It would be some day next week before I could have Dr. Sabatino
here and I could advise Your Honour exactly when I could have him here and ask
leave to call him.

To summarize the evidence in reference to the production of this
document, it seems to me most apparent that the police officers and the Crown
in a carefully considered procedure concealed from the appellant and his
counsel the possession of this document, their view of the significance of the
document, and their intention to use the document at the trial until the trial
had proceeded for some time and then sprang the existence of that docu­ment on
the counsel for the appellant when he was in an almost helpless position to
meet its import.

How carefully the Crown's procedure had been worked out is
demonstrated by the fact that the

[Page 794]

Crown's first expert witness to prove the contents of the
document and its import was Sergeant Chiarot of the RCMP but when it appeared
that the learned trial judge was doubtful of the weight of that evidence, the
Crown quickly undertook to produce the evidence of Dr. Sabatino, the expert
from Italy, whom the Crown spoke of as having already been consulted. It is
these circumstances which the court is called upon to consider on the question
as to which leave to appeal was granted by the Order of this Court and which I
have cited above. There was certainly utter surprise to the counsel for the
appellant at the trial and the question would be very easy of decision had the
trial proceeded at once without an opportunity to cure that surprise. That,
however, did not occur.

The Crown was granted an adjournment from June 2, 1972, to June
12, 1972, and on the latter date counsel for the Crown stated to the learned
trial judge that the defence had requested a fur­ther adjournment for the
purpose of examining the document. The court convened again on June 26, 1972,
and counsel for the appellant made a vain attempt to re-elect so that the trial
should proceed before and judge a jury. Upon that application being refused,
the trial proceeded on June 28, 1972, and Dr. Alberto Sabatino gave evidence
for the Crown.

Counsel for the appellant then called only defence witness
Professor Stanley Chandler, Chairman of the Department of Italian and Hispanic
Studies of the University of Toronto. There may be some significance in the
fact that Dr. Sabatino's evidence immediately preceded the evi­dence of
Professor Chandler and it might well have been more efficient for the defence
to have had an opportunity to go over Dr. Sabatino's evidence with its own
expert Professor Chandler prior to Professor Chandler giving his evidence.
However, counsel for the appellant in this Court made no issue of this point
and on the other hand expressed himself as satisfied that the delay in the
trial had permitted the defence adequate opportu­nity to prepare its case.
Counsel for the appellant did argue that the failure to reveal the existence of

[Page 795]

this document at the preliminary hearing or any conferences
between counsel for the Crown and counsel for the appellant between the date of
the preliminary hearing and the date of trial deprived such counsel of an
opportunity to make an intelli­gent election as to the mode of trial and
submitted most strenuously that had the defence been in possession of the
knowledge that the document was to be introduced the defence would never have
re-elected trial before a judge alone without a jury and that therefore the
defence should have been granted its motion and permitted to reverse its
re-election and go back to the forum to which the appellant had originally been
committed for trial, that is, to a judge and jury.

As the learned trial judge pointed out in dispos­ing of that
application, such an order would, of course, have resulted in a mistrial after
the trial had continued for some considerable time, and it is difficult to
understand upon what legal basis this ground of appeal can be put.

As I have said, had there been any prejudice to the appellant by
failure to allow him full answer and defence, I would have been of the opinion
that a mistrial had resulted and would have been ready to have allowed the
appeal and sent the matter back for a new trial. I am inclined to believe that
the frank statement by counsel for the appellant has eliminated that
possibility and unless there is some legal principle which requires the
revelation of the whole case for the Crown to the accused or his counsel prior
to the trial no order declaring a mistrial is possible. During the argument in
appeal, many cases were discussed and also the writings and speeches of
well-recognized legal experts.

The present Mr. Justice Martin of the Court of Appeal for Ontario
in his 1955 Special Lecture to the Law Society of Upper Canada put the matter,
I think, with respect, most accurately:

But notwithstanding the. pronouncements of courts from time
to time as to the duty of Crown counsel to adduce at the trial all evidence in
his possession, favourable as well as unfavourable to the accused, there has
been no case so far as I know that directly says it is the duty of Crown
counsel to disclose or to adduce all his evidence at the preliminary hearing.

[Page 796]

This I am ready to accept as a concise summary of the law. What
was said to be the practice in the Province of Ontario was enunciated by Mr. W.
B. Common, Q.C., then Director of Public Prosecu­tions for the province, when
making a submission before the Joint Committee of the Senate and the House of
Commons on Capital and Corporal Pun­ishment when he said:

I might say for those members of the Committee who are
unfamiliar with the procedure at a trial—and I am not going into technical
matters—it will suffice to say this: that in all of the cases not only in
capital cases but usually in all criminal cases there is complete disclosure by
the prosecution of its case to the defence. To use a colloquialism, there are
no ""fast ones"" pulled by the Crown. The defence does not have to
disclose its case to the Crown. We do not ask it for a complete and full
disclosure of the case. If there are statements by wit­nesses, statements of
accused, the witness is supplied with copies, they know exactly what our case
is, and there is nothing hidden or kept back or suppressed so that the accused
person is taken by surprise at a trial by springing a surprise witness on him.
In other words, I again emphasize the fact that every safeguard is pro­vided by
the Crown to ensure that an accused person, not only in capital cases but in
every case receives and is assured of a fair and legal trial.

It is regrettable that the crown attorney in this particular
prosecution seems to have paid scant attention to Mr. Commons' very well-known
statement and I am of the opinion that it is not sufficient to toss the matter
aside so casually as counsel for the Crown does in his factum to this Court in
the words:

Although it is conceded that it may have been better under
the circumstances of this case for the crown to have made pre-trial disclosure
of the fact that the police had learned of the accused's possession of Exhibit
#5,....

In my view, it is the duty of the court to be vigilant to assure
itself that the appellant has had a fair trial and if the regrettable conduct
of the prosecution, using that term to cover both the police and Crown counsel,
ever results in unfair­ness then the court should act with decisiveness to
reverse such unfairness. As I have said, in the present case, such unfairness
has not been proved

[Page 797]

and I cannot understand how the circumstances could be made the
base for any right of further election as to the mode of trial.

This brings me to the consideration of the ground of appeal based
upon dissenting reasons of Arnup J.A. in the Court of Appeal for Ontario,
namely, that there was no evidence upon which the trial judge could find that
the possession of the weapon was for a purpose dangerous to the public peace.
It was Arnup J.A.'s view that without ex. 5, the document written in Italian,
the Crown had not made out a prima facie case that the posses­sion of
the weapon was for a purpose dangerous to the public peace. In addition to the
possession of that document, the trial judge, as Arnup J.A. points out, relied
upon the following circum­stances:

(i) ession by the accused of six $10 counterfeit bills,

(ii) possession of a loaded pistol, on top of a war­drobe in
his bedroom, in a box with eight additional rounds of ammunition,

(iii) the accused had $1,713 in cash in his trouser pocket.

In my view, none of those three circumstances, without Exhibit 5,
could constitute a prima facie case for the conviction on the charge of
possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace.

It is significant that the search for which the warrant was
obtained was not in any way connected with counterfeiting or the possession of
counter­feit money and the discovery of counterfeit money was a mere accident
in the course of the search. There was utterly no evidence that the appellant
had been in any way connected with counterfeiting or with the uttering of
counterfeit money and there was no evidence of any kind that the appellant had
been in any way connected with violence or with a crime of violence.

We therefore must turn to consider the admissi­bility and
probative value of Exhibit 5. It has been assumed below that the document was
found in the possession of the accused and therefore that, as put

[Page 798]

by the Chief Justice of Ontario in giving the majority reasons,
""the finding of a document of the nature of exhibit five is prima facie
evidence against him"". Surely the finding of the document itself is
not sufficient and it must have been found in the possession of the accused.
Was it found in his possession?

The appellant was born in Calabria but so were thousands of other
residents in Metropolitan Toronto. The document is in the Italian language, or
perhaps more particularly, as I shall discuss later, in an Italian dialect, and
Calabria is a district in Italy. The document was found in the form of sheets
of notepaper written by hand in a dialect and contained in a plastic container
to­gether with household bills on the first shelf of a cupboard in the kitchen
of a house occupied by the appellant.

The appellant was confronted with each of the other items taken
by the police officers from the appellant's residence and was questioned in
refer­ence thereto. He was not confronted with this ex. 5. It was never
mentioned to him and the record contains no statement from either the appellant
or anyone else in his family or anyone who could be said to be connected with
him in any way indicat­ing the appellant's knowledge of that document.

Under the common law in civil cases, it has been determined,
although not invariably, that one was in possession of whatever was physically
in prem­ises occupied by him whether he knew or not of even the existence of
such chattels: South Staf­fordshire Water Company v. Sharman[2].
Surely, however, when it is sought to draw an inference of ""connection
with criminal activity"", to again use the words of the Chief Justice of Ontario,
a much more appropriate test of possession is that found in the Criminal
Code .

Section 3 , subsection (4) , of the Criminal Code  provides:

3. (4) For the purposes of this Act,

[Page 799]

 (a) a person has anything in possession when he has it in
his personal possession or knowingly

(i) has it in the actual possession or custody of another
person, or

(ii) has it in any place, whether or not that place belongs
to or is occupied by him, for the use or benefit of himself or of another
person; and

(b) where one of two or more persons, with the knowledge and
consent of the rest, has anything in his custody or possession, it shall be
deemed to be in the custody and possession of each and all of them.

To find a person in possession by that section, it must be shown
that he had the article in his personal possession, and here it was not, or
know­ingly had it in any place whether or not that place belongs to or is
occupied by him for the use or benefit of himself or another person. As I have
said, despite the fact there was opportunity to obtain that evidence had the
police chosen to do so, there was in fact no evidence that the appellant had
the document knowingly in any place, and I am, therefore, of the opinion that
the Crown failed to prove that this document was in the possession of the
appellant.

It would be sufficient to dispose of the appeal upon this basis.
It is not a case of an article found in some place which is in the sole custody
of an accused person, for instance, his own bedroom drawer and where the
accused simply denies knowledge of it; there would be many circum­stances which
would permit a court to disbelieve such denial of knowledge. Here, there was no
attempt to find out from the appellant whether he knew of the existence of the
document and the document was not in his personal room or clothes but was in
the kitchen evidently quite casually stored with household accounts. The much
more natural tie-up of possession would be with the appellant's wife and not
with the appellant. To put it briefly, I am of the opinion that the police
procedure upon the discovery of this document defeated the police from being
able to show that it was in the appellant's possession. This view would itself
be sufficient to allow the appeal because, as I

[Page 800]

have said, if the document was not proved to be in the
appellant's possession then the existence of that document could not be added
to the other circumstances which I have cited above. Therefore, there certainly
could be no prima facie case for a conviction upon the charge of
possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace.

Moreover, even if this document should be held to be legally in
the possession of the appellant in such circumstances as would permit an
inference of his knowledge of the contents, then a further problem arises as to
whether it is admissible to prove that the appellant's possession of the pistol
was for a purpose dangerous to the public peace. Sergeant Chiarot and Dr. Sabatino
described the document, one might summarize, as being the constitution and
rituals of a secret society in Italy which preached and practised violence. The
Crown relied particularly upon the evidence of a recog­nized expert, Dr. Sabatino,
who would appear to have been a very senior officer in the criminal police of
Italy and a director within its Mafia investigation services. Dr. Sabatino's
evidence was extremely lengthy, both in chief and in cross-examination, but
since the whole purpose for the calling of this evidence was to show that a
person in the possession of that document must have some connection with that
secret criminal organization in Italy, his answer on the specific point should
be considered. He was asked this question by the Crown:

Q. Have you been able to form an opinion as to the position
of the person who would be in possession of a document such as Exhibit 5?

After objection and argument, the questioning continued:

BY THE CROWN: Q. Well, just answer ""yes"" or
""no"", first of all, Doctor Sabatino. Have you been able to come to
such an opinion?

A. On what, sir?

Q. The position of the person who would be in posses­sion of
Exhibit 5?

A. Yes.

[Page 801]

Q. Now, upon what did you base that opinion?

 

A. I would base it on two fundamental motives. First of all,
I would see if the person has possession of this code, whether he would have it
for professional reasons because a person that studies sociology, or newspaper
man or a police officer, excluding all this, then I would examine the code in
relation to the other elements. To the places that the subject frequents as far
as consummations of crimes, etc. Then I would form an opinion as far as that
person that he does belong to the Mafia.

Q. Would the question of whether or not, for exam­ple, an
unauthorized firearm found in the saine house—

Objection and argument.

Q. Doctor Sabatino, assuming it were a fact, would the fact
that an unauthorized firearm was found in the same home as Exhibit number 5
have any bearing upon your opinion regarding the position of the person who had
possession of Exhibit 5?

A. In Italy, my duty is not to adjudicate but as far as a
Magistrate calling the attention of the Magis­trate in this respect, in the
presence of the codice and the arm, there are two things I would consid­er—

THE COURT: We are wasting time, I think Mr. Armstrong.

THE CROWN: Sorry, Your Honour?

THE COURT: I say I think we are wasting time. THE CROWN: I
thought he was about to — THE COURT: Well, is the answer coming?

THE INTERPRETER: I was just-one more word, Your Honour.

THE WITNESS: I would consider it the same thing.

BY THE CROWN: Q. I am sorry?

A. Having the gun in the same house where this document was
found, I would consider the same thing but it is up to the Magistrate to decide
in it.

BY THE COURT: Well, Doctor, you say you have studied the
methods and organization of the Mafia?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Well, are there ranks within the Mafia? 

A. Yes.

[Page 802]

Q. You mean you have the men that do the work and others
that give orders and directions?

A. Yes. Yes, It would be like a pyramid, sir.

Q. Well, are the workers not allowed to bear arms or
have this type of document in their possession?

A. As far as these documents, sir, I have the impres­sion
that there is few in circulation. During my activity either through the
personnel or my own knowledge, we have followed hundreds of searchings or
thousands of searchings during the period of ten years and we have only found
few, very few, of similar codes. There are copies that might be around but not
many.

As far as we are concerned, this is not a funda­mental element.
Depends on what crime that person has done; a Mafiosa crime or what. First of
all, extortion, sir.

Arnup J.A. summarized that answer in these words:

I do not find in it any testimony justifying a finding that
without any external evidence linking the accused to the organization or to
some kind of activity in which the organization engages, the mere prossession
of this very rare document gives rise to an inference of ""connection""
with the organization.

As I read his evidence this witness testified to the
contrary effect.

I am in complete agreement with Arnup J.A.'s statement and I
think that the testimony of Dr. Sabatino must be considered in the light of the
evidence given for the defence by Professor Chan­dler. It is true that the
learned trial judge found that Professor Chandler's evidence was not of much
assistance to him and that such evidence seemed entirely divorced from reality
but that evidence, being a matter of expert opinion in no way dependent on
credibility, may be assessed as well by this Court as by the learned trial
judge and that evidence, I think, demonstrated quite conclu­sively that the
document, if it were the constitution and rituals of a secret organization and
not a mere collection of antiquities from various sources many of which were
designated by Professor Chandler, was a constitution and set of rituals of an
organi­zation which flourished in Naples and not in Calabria and which died
after a historic trial in

[Page 803]

1912-60 years before the document was found in the residence of
the appellant. I cannot imagine a more fragile ground for an argument that the
appellant was linked with some unnamed and unoutlined criminal organization. If
there were some modern day, or, more properly, 19th Century Viking writers,
would one's possession of some of the sagas show that he had not a mere
antiquarian interest in ancient forebears but an active membership in a present
day collection of criminals? How can this slim evidence constitute proof beyond
reasonable doubt? To merely state the proposition is to disprove it.

For this reason, even if Exhibit 5 had been proved to be in the
possession of the appellant, then I am of the opinion that it has no probative
value to show that the appellant possessed this weapon for a purpose dangerous
to the public peace. Therefore, I am in agreement with Arnup J.A. that the
Crown has not proved a prima facie case upon the charge.

In view of the fact that without this evidence there is nothing
upon which the Crown could base the charge, I would allow the appeal upon this
count and not merely grant a new trial but direct an acquittal.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz
and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

DE GRANDPRÉ J.—Appellant was convicted at Toronto, on June 30,
1972, by His Honour Judge Moore of the following charges:

(1) possession, without lawful justification or excuse, of
six counterfeit Bank of Canada $10 notes, contrary to the Criminal Code ,
section 408 ;

(2) possession of a weapon, to wit, a .25 calibre pistol for
a purpose dangerous to the public peace, contrary to the Criminal Code , section
83 ;

(3) possession of a restricted weapon, to wit, a .25 calibre
pistol for which he did not have a registration certificate issued to him,
contrary to the Criminal Code , section 91 .

[Page 804]

Following these convictions, sentence was passed as follows:

(1) Twelve months;

(2) Six months, to be served consecutively to the previous
sentence;

(3) $150 or, in the alternative, two weeks imprisonment
consecutive to the terms previously referred to.

The Court of Appeal was unanimous in dismiss­ing the appellant's
appeal with respect to counts 1 and 3. It is to be noted that, as to count 3,
appellant had pleaded guilty at the trial but had argued that the introduction
of exhibit 5, of which more later, vitiated the whole trial.

Before we turn to the examination of count 2, which is the only
one at issue before this Court, it should be noted that appellant's wife, Rosa Cac­camo,
had been convicted with him of possession of counterfeit money, a conviction
unanimously set aside by the Court of Appeal which directed that a verdict of
acquittal be entered in her case.

To establish that the possession by appellant of a .25 calibre
pistol was for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, the Crown relied on the
following circumstances which were accepted by the trial judge:

(1) the possession by the accused of the six $10 counterfeit
bills which were the basis of the conviction under count 1;

(2) the possession of a loaded pistol on top of a wardrobe
in his bedroom, in a box with eight additional rounds of ammunition, which was
the basis of the conviction under count 3;

(3) the possession by the accused in his trouser pocket of
$1,713 in cash;

(4) the discovery on the first shelf of a kitchen cupboard
of handwritten notes in Italian which were filed as exhibit 5.

The circumstances of this discovery and the impact of those notes
on the case are summarized

[Page 805]

by Gale, C.J.O., whose judgment is reported at 11 C.C.C. (2d) 249
(p. 253):

The accused's house was searched by the police pursuant to a
warrant alleging that certain firearms were suspected of being present there.
During that search, the coun­terfeit money and a .25—calibre pistol were both
found in the dresser in the accused's bedroom. In a kitchen cupboard, the
police also found the handwritten notes, in Italian, which at the trial became
ex. 5. They seized the notes without the appellant's knowledge and without
asking him for any explanation as to what they were. At trial, the Crown introduced
the notes as an exhibit and called two expert witnesses to explain their
significance and meaning. One witness was an R.C.M.P. officer with extensive
experience in Italy as an assistant to Canadian immigration officials, which
duties had given him knowledge of the workings of secret criminal organiza­tions
in Italy. The other witness, one Dr. Alberto Sabati­no, was a senior Italian
police official, with special knowledge of secret criminal organizations, such
as the Mafia. Both men indicated that the document seized in the appellant's
home was a type of constitution of a secret Italian criminal organization
related to the Mafia and that anyone in possession of it almost certainly had
to belong to the organization. The defence also called an expert witness, a Dr.
Chandler, who stated that the organization described in the document was
virtually extinct since 1912 and had no relationship to the Mafia. The Crown
tendered this evidence, of which the defence had no prior notice, as relevant
to the issue of whether the accused's possession of the pistol was for a
purpose dangerous to the public peace.

As to count 2, the question was expressed in the following terms
by Gale, C.J.O., at p. 254:

Did the mere possession of ex. 5 by the male accused so
connect him with the organization about which it is written as to permit the
inference that his possession of the gun was for a purpose dangerous to the
public peace?

An affirmative answer was given to that question by a majority of
the Court, the dissenting view of

[Page 806]

Arnup J. being expressed in the following terms in the Order of
February 14, 1973:

there was no evidence upon which the trial judge could find
that the possession of the weapon was for a purpose dangerous to the public
peace.

On the basis of that dissent, an appeal as of right was entered
by appellant upon which the Crown moved to quash the appeal for lack of
jurisdiction on the ground that there was no dissent in the Court of Appeal on
a question of law. This application to quash was dismissed by five judges of
this Court on April 30, 1973, without reasons.

While the question of jurisdiction has not been pressed before
us, I wish to underline that on the sole basis of the reasons for judgment
delivered by Arnup J., I would hesitate to recognize that we have jurisdiction
as of right, his reasons appearing to go to the weight of the evidence and not
to its non-existence. Should these reasons be considered as having been
completed by the Order of Febru­ary 14, 1973, so as to bring into play the
classic distinction between ""no evidence"" and ""insuffi­cient
evidence"", expressed again in two recent decisions of this Court: R. v.
Caouette[3]; Parnerkar
v. The Queen[4]?

I am strongly inclined to the view that the thinking of Arnup J.
is to be found in his reasons and not in the Order and that accordingly we have
no jurisdiction as of right. Be that as it may, I am ready to adopt the
pragmatic approach taken by this Court in Steinberg v. The King[5]
and to exam­ine the merits of the admissibility of exhibit 5.

In the case at bar, there is a second point at issue by special
leave of this Court, namely the following question of law:

Did the failure of the Crown to disclose to the defence the
existence of exhibit 5 until after the trial had commenced constitute a miscarriage
of justice?

I—Admissibility of exhibit 5

The Crown, of course, had the burden of prov­ing that the exhibit
in question had been found in

[Page 807]

the possession of the appellant. The courts below
undoubtedly came to the conclusion that this point had been established because
all of the judges examined the question of admissibility in the light of such a
possession. Indeed, Arnup J., in his dissent, writes that ""the mere
possession of the document"" does not connect the accused with the mafia
organization. Such concurrent findings in the courts below cannot be the result
of an over-sight considering that the provisions of s. 3(4)  of the Criminal
Code  had been argued at length in connection with another aspect of the
case.

ln the circumstances, appellant cannot succeed on this ground.
The possession of s. 3(4) of the Criminal Code is a question of fact
capable of proof by inference. The courts below having reached a unanimous
conclusion on that basis the matter must end there, because the facts proved are
sufficient to support that inference.

It is not necessary therefore to invoke in support of the
conclusion that the appellant was in posses­sion of exhibit 5 the principle
that ""when a hus­band and wife live together, it is a presumption of law
that the husband is in possession and control of the premises in which they
reside"". See R. v. Lawson[6], (British
Columbia Court of Appeal); R. v. Mandzuk[7], (British
Columbia Court of Ap­peal); R. v. Tokarek[8] (British
Columbia Court of Appeal).

Possession of exhibit 5 by appellant having been established, it
remains to be seen whether, in the circumstances, the mere possession of a
document of this sort, in the absence of further evidence connecting the
appellant with a criminal organiza­tion, did in law entitle the magistrate to
draw the inference that appellant was a member of such organization and
therefore had possession of the weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public
peace. In my view, this submission has been answered fully by the majority in
the Court of

[Page 808]

Appeal and I would adopt on this point the reasons of Gale,
C.J.O.

Counsel for appellant, however, has referred us to a number of
authorities which, in his submis­sion, establish that exhibit 5 was not
admissible because not relevant. In my view, the major deci­sions to which we
have been referred do not bear out this conclusion.

In Thompson v. The King[9], the
prosecution on a charge of gross indecency tendered evidence that on the
occasion of his arrest the appellant was carrying powder puffs and that in his
rooms were found indecent photographs of boys. The House of Lords held that, in
the special circumstances of the case, the evidence was admissible on the issue
of identity. However, the speeches of the learned Lords indicate that in fact,
in other circumstances, documents found either on the person or in the room
occupied by an accused person could very well be accepted in evidence for other
purposes.

In Picken v. The King[10], a
decision of this Court, a new trial was ordered because there had been produced
before the jury in a case of abortion various articles found in the home of the
accused by the police, acting on a search warrant, when these articles had no
real pertinency between the Crown and the accused. However, Duff, C.J.,
speaking for the Court, was careful to point out that he was making an
exception for the ""knitting needle and the bicycle spoke"".

Emkeit v. The Queen[11], does
not add to the above, the problem being of a very different nature, namely the
reading of an inflammatory poem by Crown counsel in presence of the jury.

More to the point, it seems to me, is our decision of Prosko
v. The King[12] where
three judges

[Page 809]

expressed no hesitation to accept that it was proper for the
Crown to produce the articles found in the room of the appellant charged with
murder. Idington J. had this to say at p. 235:

The only other question upon which counsel for appel­lant
rested his appeal was the fourth question on the stated case, which reads as
follows:

Was there error in permitting the Crown to produce before
and exhibit to the jury as exhibits certain objects which were found in the
possession of one or other of the accused on or in the premises occupied by one
or other of them?

I, with great respect, find it difficult to treat such a
question seriously. Some of the articles found were not worthy of serious
consideration by the jury, but the false moustache and flashlight, for example,
were important items well worthy of consideration in a case such as this
dependent to so great an extent as it was upon circum­stantial evidence.

That which was incapable of being fitted into the chain of
circumstances to be relied upon, of course, would be discarded by the jury to
whom we must attribute common sense.

It became the duty of the crown officer to present the
suit-case contents as found and let the jury determine what was relevant and
what was not. And then not leave the impression that accused was so intent in
pursuit of easy money that he could think of nothing else, and hence carried
only false moustaches, flashlights or glass cutters.

As to what constitutes admissible evidence, I cannot do any
better than to refer to R. v. Wray[13]

II—Miscarriage of justice

It is common ground that exhibit 5

(a) was not mentioned at all during the preliminary enquiry;

(b) was not disclosed to the defence prior to the

(c) beginning of the trial;

was mentioned for the first time during the

second day of the trial.

It is, of course, now settled law that the sole Purpose of the
preliminary enquiry is to satisfy the

[Page 810]

magistrate that there is sufficient evidence to put the accused
on trial and that, therefore, the Crown has the discretion to present only that
evidence which makes out a prima facie case. Patterson v. The Queen[14];
R. v. Epping[15].

However, counsel for the accused has put to us the following
question:

Was the prosecution under a duty prior to the start of the
trial to inform the defence of the existence of exhibit 5 and of its intention
to introduce into evidence that exhibit?

In my opinion, the answer to that question must be in the
negative.

The basic rule is that expressed in Lemay v. The King,[16]
where it was held

that counsel acting for the prosecution has full discre­tion
as to what witnesses should be called for the prosecution and the Court will
not interfere with the exercise of that discretion unless it can be shown that
the prosecutor has been influenced by some oblique motive (of which there is
here no suggestion). This is not to be regarded as lessening the duty of the
prosecutor to bring forward evidence of every material fact known to the
prosecution whether favourable to the accused or otherwise. The appeal should
be dismissed since there was no obligation on the Crown to call either Powell
or Lowes at the trial.

It is within the framework of the adversary system, under which
our criminal law is administered, that the accused must be guaranteed a fair
trial.

In that light, if the introduction of new evidence at the trial
takes the accused by surprise, obviously he is entitled to a postponement. Here
this post­ponement was accorded to the accused to the point that when the trial
did proceed, he was in a position to adduce the evidence of his own expert as
to the import of exhibit 5, namely Professor Chandler.

Appellant, however, submits that he has been prejudiced on two
counts:

 [Page 811]

(1) his cross-examination of Detective Turner would have been
conducted in a different light;

(2) it is possible that, had he known of the existence of exhibit
5 and of the intention of the Crown to use it, he would have maintained bis
option to be heard by a judge and jury.

As to the first point, we have been referred to the following
questions and answers at the begin­ning of Detective Turner's
cross-examination:

Q. Now, Detective Turner, just to recap, you said that you
arrived at about 5:50 p.m. on August 1st at the Caccamo home?

A. 5:50, yes, sir.

Q. Right. And your purpose in going there was to conduct a
search?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. In accordance with the warrant which has been introduced
as an exhibit? A. Yes, sir.

Q. And that was to search for firearms? 

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Now, was the presence of counterfeit money con­templated
at all in the mind of the people execut­ing the warrant?

A. Not in my mind, no, sir.

Q. Have you any previous knowledge before execut­ing that
warrant of Mr. Caccamo? A. None that I know of, no, sir.

Q. Or Mrs. Caccamo? 

A. No, sir.

Q. Are you aware whether or not there are any records or if
there is any information on file about him in the Police Department?

A. Not to my knowledge, sir.

Q. Did you check that before such time as you execu­ted the
warrant?

A. No, sir.

I fail to see what prejudice has been suffered by the appellant
as a result of this cross-examination. His character was not put into question
by any of the answers given by Detective Turner and it is difficult to imagine
that any harm has been done. It is true that in a general way the character of
the appellant was at stake but until exhibit 5 was offered in evidence on the
second day of the trial, nothing had taken place that, in my view, would

[Page 812]

have given another direction to the examination or
cross-examination of the witnesses heard till that time.

The second consideration, namely the option, we are told by
counsel, has never been examined by any court. The right to the proper forum is
indeed a major one belonging to the accused. That forum is determined by
statute and, in the cases spelled out in the Criminal Code , the accused
had a choice. Of course, the Code does not state that in a case like the one at
bar, the choice is vitiated if made before the accused learns at least the
substance of all the evidence to be adduced against him. We are asked here to
decide that such is the result of the Crown's failure to supply the accused
with at least a summary of the substance of the evidence before the expiry of
the delays governing the option.

To help us in reaching a decision, we have to keep in mind what
has been underlined above, namely

(1) that the Crown does not have the obligation to show all of
its evidence at the preliminary enquiry;

(2) that, in conducting its case, the Crown has the discretion
defined in the Lemay case above;

(3) that, over the years, the sole effect of the introduction of
new evidence at trial has been to allow the accused to obtain a postponement of
the trial.

Against this background, it becomes obvious that when the accused
makes its option to be tried by a judge alone or by a judge and jury, the law
does not expect him to make that decision in the light of the evidence but
rather in the light of the charge.

Of course, I do not deny that there could be cases where the
option made could be set aside if in fact there has been a miscarriage of
justice. Such was not the case here.

On this point, I adopt the reasons of Gale, C.J.O., at p. 252,
who, although he was then speaking of count 1, expressed comments equally
applicable to count 2:

[Page 813]

It was also argued, with respect to count 1, that the
introduction of ex. 5, which is apparently one of the rare statements or codes
of the Mafia organization, without prior disclosure by the Crown to defence
counsel, ren­dered the trial abortive, particularly when counsel had already
re-elected for a trial by Judge alone, without knowledge that this evidence
existed and would be ten­dered by the Crown. We do not agree that such non-dis­closure
gave a right to the accused to have the trial declared abortive and to re-elect
for a trial by Judge and jury. Nor did it detract from or prejudice the action
of defence counsel in re-electing trial by Judge alone. It does not seem to us
to be right to say that a trial becomes abortive because evidence in the
possession of the Crown is not disclosed to the defence prior to the opening of
the trial. In this case, the Crown might have revealed its possession of the
document, although I do not think this Court is able to pass on that. However,
the failure to do so did not produce a mistrial, particularly because the
defence, after the disclosure of the docu­ment, was given ample opportunity—indeed,
as much opportunity as they wished—to see the document, exam­ine it and take
whatever position they wished in that regard. In my opinion, there was no
prejudice to the accused, because really what the claim to a right of re-election
amounts to is an assertion that there was some prejudice, or that it was a
miscarriage of justice, to allow the trial to proceed before the County Court
Judge without a jury. We do not agree that amounts to prejudice in any sense of
the word.

I might add that in reaching a conclusion as to whether or not a miscarrage
of justice exists, the courts are entitled to take into account the fact that
the accused did not testify, which is the situation in the case at bar. I would
refer on this point to R. v. Boucher et al.[17]. a
decision of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia; R. v. Cipolla[18],
a decision of the Court of Appeal of Ontario; R. v. Greenlaw (No.
1)[19],
a decision of the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick.

For all these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO

Criminal law — Evidence — Admissibility—Self-in­crimination—Identification—Admissibility
of evi­dence of refusal of identification line-up.

At the trial of the accused before judge and jury on
the charge of breaking and entering and theft the iden­tification of Marcoux
was the critical issue. After the arrest of the accused, Marcoux had been asked
whether he would participate in a line-up. He had refused. Later that morning
the alleged victim was shown two men walking down a hallway and identified one
of them, Marcoux, as the person he had seen earlier in his hotel bedroom. The
trial judge admitted evidence that Mar­coux had refused to participate in a
line-up and the appellants were convicted. The case went to appeal on the
grounds that the evidence that Marcoux refused to participate in the line-up
was inadmissible and that the trial judge should have instructed the jury that
they could draw no adverse inference from such refusal. The Court of Appeal was
of the opinion that the appeal should fail.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

The exhibition of the person of an accused at a police
line-up for observation by an alleged victim is not itself a violation of the
privilege against self incrimination. It should not be overlooked that the use
of force to compel participation in a line-up may raise a question as to the
powers of the police in relation to detained persons. Reasonable compulsion to
this end is an incident to the police power to arrest and investigate. The
evidence of Marcoux's refusal to take part in a line-up was admis­sible in the
present case, not for the purpose of proving guilt, but to explain the failure
to hold an identification parade and the necessity, as a result, to have the
witness confront Marcoux. The trial judge did not err in men­tioning to the
jury the accused's refusal to participate in

[Page 764]

a line-up.

Evidence of the offer and refusal of a line-up will
not, however, be relevant and admissible in every case in which the
identification of an accused is in issue. Admissibility depends on the
circumstances of the case. If at trial, the Crown has to explain the omission
of a line-up or accept the possibility of the jury drawing an adverse inference
then it would seem that evidence of refusal is both relevant and admissible. In
other circum­stances such evidence should not normally be tendered as it might
impinge upon the presumption of innocence and leave the jury with the
impression. that there is a duty on the accused to prove his innocence.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1]
dismissing an appeal by the accused from their convictions by Graburn Co. Ct.
J. sitting with a jury on a charge of breaking and entering and theft. Appeal
dismissed.

R. Carter, for the appellants.

C. Scullion, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON J.—An important pre-trial step in many criminal
prosecutions is the identification of the accused by the alleged victim. Apart
from identification with the aid of a photograph or

[Page 765]

photographs, the identification procedure adopted by the police
officers will normally be one of two types: (i) the showup—of a single suspect;
(ii) the line-up-presentation of the suspect as part of a group. In this case
the accused Marcoux refused a line-up and a showup followed.

The question is whether there was error on the part of the trial
judge in admitting evidence of the refusal. The question also arises whether,
the evi­dence having been admitted, there was error in failing to instruct the
jury that Marcoux had a legal right to refuse to participate in a line-up and
no adverse inference could be drawn from refusal. The two accused were tried
and convicted before a judge and jury at the City of Toronto on the charge of
breaking and entering and theft of a wallet. The theory of the Crown was that Marcoux
in early morning had entered a hotel room occupied by Gerard Fleskes and his
wife, that Fleskes had awakened and had spoken, whereupon Marcoux fled, taking Fleskes'
wallet, and escaped in a car in which the co-accused Solomon was waiting. A
bellman at the hotel recorded the licence number of the departing car. The
critical issue at trial was the identification of Marcoux by Fleskes. The two
accused were arrested shortly after the theft and escorted to the police
station where one of the investigating officers, Detective Starrett, asked Marcoux
whether he would partici­pate in a line-up. Marcoux's refusal was emphatic and
unambiguous. Later in the morning Fleskes was shown two men walking down a
hallway, one of whom, Marcoux, he identified as the person he had seen earlier
in his hotel bedroom. Five minutes later Fleskes was taken to a room occupied
by Marcoux and a police constable, and there confronted Marcoux, and gave the
classic response, ""Yes, sir, that is him.""

At the conclusion of the examination in chief of Fleskes, the
trial took an unusual turn. Counsel for

[Page 766]

the accused Solomon, who was not counsel before this Court, moved
that the case be then taken from the jury on the ground the evidence of
identifica­tion was insufficient in law to justify continuance. Counsel
questioned the probative value of Fleskes' evidence. He emphasized that the
identification had taken place in response to a question by a police officer,
""Is that the man?"" and while Mar­coux was in custody. The motion was
denied as premature, and the trial continued. During his evidence in chief
Detective Starrett told the jury he had asked Marcoux whether he would partici­pate
in a line-up, and Marcoux had refused. Detective Starrett was subjected to
vigorous and lengthy cross-examination; in particular counsel faulted him for
failure to conduct a line-up or identification parade in accordance with the regu­lations
and procedure of the Metropolitan Toronto Police. It was suggested that Starrett
had broken ""every rule that is in the book"" in parading Mar­coux,
that it was not ""a proper line-up at all in any manner, shape or
form"", that Marcoux should have been allowed to have a lawyer present to
see that the line-up was conducted fairly, that twelve people are supposed to
be in the line-up and not just one. At the conclusion of the Crown evidence,
the motion for a directed verdict of acquittal was renewed. Counsel for Marcoux
maintained that the instructions and pamphlets of the Metropolitan Toronto
Police respecting identification parades had been ""spat upon"" and
what had occurred at the police station was a ""mockery"". It was in
the light of this unequivocal, if somewhat intemperate and, in the
circumstances, unwarranted, attack on police procedures that the trial judge in
the course of his charge to the jury said:

I have one other matter of law that I wish to refer to
before reviewing the evidence with you. There is no statutory authority to
force an accused person or a suspect or a person at a police station into a
line-up. It will be for you to decide on the totality of the evidence what
significance you will attach to Mr. Marcoux's refusal to participate in a
suggested line-up.

[Page 767]

As I have said, the appellants were convicted. The case went to
appeal on the grounds that the evidence that Marcoux refused to participate in
the police line-up was inadmissible, and the trial judge should have instructed
the jury they could draw no adverse inference from such refusal. A majority in
the Court of Appeal for Ontario (Schroeder J.A., Jessup J.A. concurring) were
of opinion the appeals must fail. Schroeder J.A. said police line-ups were a
regular part of police routine when a crime was being investigated in which
identification was an issue, that the invitation was extended to Marcoux for no
improper purpose and failure to make a line-up or identification parade
available might well have been a matter of adverse comment on the part of
counsel for the accused. The majority of the Court did not regard the evidence
in question to be inadmissible; it was but a circumstance which, together with
all other cir­cumstances, the jury were entitled to take into consideration in
determining the guilt or innocence of the accused. Brooke J.A. did not agree.
The rationale of his dissent is, I think, encapsulated in the following passage
of his judgment:

The privilege against self-incrimination vested in the
appellant the right to refuse to participate in the line-up. To allow a
negative inference to be drawn from the exercise of that right would amount to
a partial denial of the right itself.

In my opinion (i) an accused's privilege against
self-incrimination is not violated if, while in cus­tody and under pretrial
investigation, he is placed in a police line-up; (ii) an issue of police power
in respect of detained persons may, however, arise if physical compulsion is
necessary; (iii) evidence of refusal to take part in the police line-up was
admissible in the circumstances of this case; (iv) this evidence formed part of
the totality of the evidence from which the jury was required to draw an
inference of innocence or of guilt.

[Page 768]

I

The limit of the privilege against self-incrimina­tion is clear.
The privilege is the privilege of a witness not to answer a question which may
incriminate him. That is all that is meant by the Latin maxim nemo tenetur seipsum
accusare, often incorrectly advanced in support of a much broader proposition.
The extent of the maxim is stated in Broom's Legal Maxims (10th ed.) as
follows, pp. 660-661:

It may be stated as a general rule that a witness in any
proceeding is privileged from answering, not merely where his answer will
criminate him directly but also where it may have a tendency to criminate him.

(Italics added)

See R. v. Judge of the General Sessions of the Peace for the
County of York, ex parte Corning Glass Works of Canada[2].
This Court in Curr v. The Queen[3], held
that the ""history of the privilege as a Canadian derivative from the
English common law is accurately reflected in the way it is expressed in s.
2(d)"" of the Canadian Bill of Rights. Section 2 of the Bill
of Rights provides that no law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as
to:

(d) authorize a court.. . to compel a person to give
evidence if he is denied ... protection against self-crimi­nation or other
constitutional safeguards .. .

Laskin J., as he then was, said at p. 912:

.. I cannot read s. 2(d) as going any farther than to
render inoperative any statutory or non-statutory rule of federal law that
would compel a person to criminate himself before a court or like tribunal
through the giving of evidence, without concurrently protecting him against its
use against him.

The privilege, historically and comprehensively analyzed in 8 Wigmore
on Evidence (McNaughton revision 1961) art. 2250, pp. 284 et
seq., devel­oped in revulsion from the system of interrogation practised in
the old ecclesiastical courts and the Star Chamber, i.e. summoning a
person, without

[Page 769]

giving him warning of the charge against him, and examining him
on oath. The general rule evolved that no one was bound to answer any question
if the answer would tend to expose him to a criminal charge. As applied to
witnesses generally, the privilege must be expressly claimed by the witness
when the question is put to him in the witness box, Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. E-10, s. 5. As applied to an accused, the privilege is the right to
stand mute. An accused cannot be asked, much less compelled, to enter the
witness box or to answer incriminating questions. If he chooses to testify, the
protective shield, of course, disappears. In short, the privilege extends to
the accused qua witness and not qua accused, it is concerned with
testimonial compulsion specifically and not with compulsion generally: Attorney-General
of Quebec v. Begin[4]; In
re Validity of Section 92(4) of the Vehicles Act 1957 (Sask.)[5];
see also the helpful article ""Is there a right against self-incrimination
in Canada"" by Professor Ed. Ratushny, (1973) 19 McGill Law Journal 1.

American jurisprudence on the Fifth Amendment, which protects a
person against being com­pelled ""to be a witness against himself"",
and Canadian jurisprudence on the privilege against self-incrimination, have
followed parallel courses, limiting the application of the privilege to its his­toric
reach, i.e. protection against testimonial com­pulsion. Such a
limitation gives rise to a distinction between coerced oral or documentary
disclosures which fall within the privilege, and what has been termed
""real or physical"" evidence, i.e. physical evidence taken from
a person without his consent, which, broadly speaking, falls outside the
privilege.

The leading American case in which this distinc­tion first
appears is Holt v. United States[6]. There
the question was whether evidence was admissible that the accused, prior to
trial and over his protest,

[Page 770]

put on a blouse that fitted him. It was contended that compelling
the accused to submit to the demand that he model the blouse violated the
privilege against self-incrimination. Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the
Court, rejected the argu­ment as ""based upon an extravagant extension of
the Fifth Amendment,"" and went on to say, pp. 252-253:

(T)he prohibition of compelling a man in a criminal court to
be witness against himself is a prohibition of the use of physical or moral
compulsion to extort communi­cations from him, not an exclusion of his body as
evidence when it may be material. The objection in principle would forbid a
jury to look at a prisoner and compare his features with a photograph in proof.

The Supreme Court of the United States in Schmerber v.
California[7] held
that, p. 761;

...the privilege protects an accused only from being
compelled to testify against himself, or otherwise provide the State with
evidence of a testimonial or com­municative nature

and in the more recent case of United States v. Wade[8],
considered whether a suspect's privilege against self-incrimination had
been violated when he was forced to stand in a line-up, wear stripes on his
face and speak certain words. The majority of the court held that neither the
line-up itself nor anything shown by the record that Wade was required to do in
the line-up violated his privilege against self-incrimination.

An accused cannot be forced to disclose any knowledge he may have
about an alleged offence and thereby supply proof against himself but (i) bodily
condition, such as features, exhibited in a courtroom or in a police
line-up, clothing, fingerprints, photographs, measurements (see the Iden­tification
of Criminals Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-1), and (ii) conduct which the
accused cannot control, such as compulsion to submit to a search of his

[Page 771]

clothing for concealed articles or his person for body markings
or taking shoe impressions or com­pulsion to appear in Court do not violate the
principle. As Wigmore, supra has observed, Art. 2265, p. 386: ""When
the person's body, its marks and traits, itself is in issue, there is
ordinarily no other or better evidence available for the prosecu­tor.""
Difficult questions have arison when pretrial police procedures went beyond
mere physical examination to the taking of blood and other bodily fluids for
the purpose of analysis and use in evidence (see R. v. Burns[9],
and s. 237(2)  of the Criminal Code )—or when considering the right of
the police to require performance of physical tests to determine whether a
person is impaired (R. v. Shaw[10]) or
in extracting physical evidence from a person's body without his consent (Rochin
v. California[11]. See
also ""Self-Incrimination by the Accused in English Law"" by
Professor G.D. Nokes, 2 U.B.C. Law Review 316.) But those cases are not this
case. I am in no doubt that the exhibition of the person of an accused at a
line-up for observation by an alleged victim is not itself a violation of the
privilege against self-incrimination.

II

Apart altogether from the concept of the privi­lege against
self-incrimination, it should not be overlooked that the application of force
to compel an accused or a suspect to take part in a line-up may raise a
question as to the limits on the powers of the police in relation to detained
persons. Reasonable compulsion to this end is in my opinion an incident to the
police power to arrest and investigate, and no more subject to objection than
compelling the accused to exhibit his person for observation by a prosecution
witness during a trial,

[Page 772]

The powers of peace officers with respect to persons under arrest
were dealt with by the Court of Appeal in England in Dallison v. Caffery[12]
where Denning M.R. stated at p. 367:

When a constable has taken into custody a person reasonably
suspected of felony, he can do what is reasonable to investigate the matter,
and to see whether the suspicions are supported or not by further evidence. ...
The constable can put the suspect up on an identifi­cation parade to see if he
is picked out by witnesses. So long as such measures are taken reasonably, they
are an important adjunct to the administration of justice.

The extent of the right of the police to force a suspect to take
part in a line-up against his will does not, of course, squarely arise in this
case, as the police accepted Marcoux's refusal, and indeed the question will
usually be of very little practical importance, as the introduction of a
struggling suspect into a line-up might make a farce of any line-up procedure.
Additionally, as Professor Glan­ville Williams has observed in 1963 Criminal
Law Review, pp. 479, 480:

... if the suspect objects the police will merely have him
""identified"" by showing him to the witness and asking the witness
whether he is the man. Since this is obvious­ly far more dangerous to the
accused than taking part in a parade, the choice of a parade is almost always
accepted.

In Attorney-General for Quebec v. Begin, supra, Fauteux J.
said that to his knowledge there has never been exclusion as inadmissible from
the evidence at trial of the report of facts definitively incriminating the
accused and which he supplies involuntarily as for example, inter alia,
his iden­tification when for this purpose he is lined up with other
persons. His words were, p. 602:

Also to my knowledge there has never been, for these
reasons, exclusion, as inadmissible, from the evidence at the trial, of the
report of facts definitely incriminating

[Page 773]

the accused and which he supplies involuntarily, as for
example:— his bearing, his walk, his clothing, his manner of speaking, his
state of sobriety or intoxication; his calmness, his nervousness or hesitation,
his marks of identity, his identification when for this purpose he is lined up
with other persons; the presence on him of stolen objects or objects the
possession of which, being forbidden to the public, constitutes a breach of the
law and affords ground for criminal prosecution, such as narcotics, spirituous
liquors unlawfully manufactured or imported, and others. Without doubt, the
method used for obtaining this kind of evidence may, in certain cases, be
illegal and may even give occasion for recourse to civil or even criminal
action against those who have used it, but there is no longer any discussion of
the proposi­tion declaring that in such cases the illegality affecting the
method of obtaining the evidence does not affect, per se, the
admissibility of this evidence at the trial.

III

As to the admissibility of evidence of refusal by Marcoux to
participate in a line-up, it is only necessary to observe that the trial
tactics of defence counsel made this evidence admissible beyond any question;
admissible, not for the purpose of proving guilt, but to explain the failure to
hold an identification parade and the necessity, as a result, to have Fleskes
confront Marcoux, a procedure which counsel for Marcoux so roundly criticized.
See R. v. Brager[13]
at p. 511.

As Professor Williams notes in the article to which I have
referred, p. 481:

The Courts have come to expect that evidence of iden­tification
should be subjected to the test of a parade, especially where mere confrontation
of a witness with the suspect during investigations might not produce reliable
results, either because the witness had only a fleeting glimpse of the culprit
or because his memory seems not sufficiently definite about the culprit's
appearance.

New York cases since People v. Ballot'[14]
have found the failure to employ a line-up by the police, absent imperative
circumstances, violative of due process—see ""Pretrial
Identification"", (1971) 55 Minnesota Law Review 779, at p. 791.

[Page 774]

The Court of Criminal Appeal of England has commented adversely
on the absence of an identification parade and failure to explain the omission
to hold one: R. v. Seiga[15].
In R. v. John (unreported, abridged in (1973) Crim. L.R. 113) evidence
was given by a detective constable that the accused had refused an
identification parade. On appeal from conviction, it was urged, unsuccessfully,
that the trial judge had wrongly allowed one of the wit­nesses to identify the
accused in the dock when she had not identified him before the trial. Lord Jus­tice
Cairns, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said:

This method of identification ought to have been avoided if
possible. It might have been possible in this case if the Appellant had been
willing to submit to an identification parade. Leaving out altogether the ques­tion
of whether or not it was reasonable for him to refuse an identification parade,
the fact was that the Prosecution did not have that very much better method of
identification available and, that being so, it does not appear to this Court
to be wrong to allow that method of identification to be used by that witness,
Miriam Baker.

I should make it clear, however, that I do not think evidence of
the offer and refusal of a line-up will be relevant and admissible in every
case in which identification of an accused is in issue. Admissibility will
depend upon the circumstances of the case. If, at trial, it unfolds that the
Crown must explain the omission of a line-up or accept the possibility of the
jury drawing an adverse inference, then in those circumstances it would seem
that evidence of refusal is both relevant and admissible. In other
circumstances I do not think such evidence should normally be tendered. The
danger, as I see it, is that it may impinge on the presumption of innocence,
the jury may gain the impression there is a duty on the accused to prove he is
innocent. However, on the facts of the present case, I have no doubt whatever
that evidence of Marcoux's refusal to take part in the line-up was admissible,
coming as it did after the issue was

[Page 775]

opened by defence counsel following upon the evidence in chief of
Fleskes.

IV

I find nothing wrong with the judge's charge to the jury. He told
the jury there was no statutory authority to force an accused person or a
suspect or a person at a police station into a line-up. That is a correct
statement; if it is subject to any criticism, it is that it is too favourable
to the accused. The judge then told the jury it was up to them to decide on the
totality of the evidence what significance they would attach to Marcoux's
refusal to participate in a suggested line-up. I do not think the judge erred
in so instructing the jury. The evidence of the refusal was simply one more
piece of evidence bearing upon the single issue, identification. It explained
the failure to hold a line-up. The jury could take it into account. It was
relevant and admissible and an inference could be drawn from it—if it was not
open to any inference it was not relevant and not admissible. Even in such a
matter as the failure of an accused to testify, although neither judge nor
counsel can comment upon the failure, a jury is free to draw, and I have no
doubt frequently does draw from the failure, an inference adverse to the
accused.

I would dismiss the appeals. 

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Non-capital murder—Proof of “mens
rea”—Defences of insanity, provocation and drunkenness—Mental state of
accused—Charge to jury—Relevancy of mental condition to defence of
drunkenness—Criminal Code , s. 212 (a).

Appellant was charged with the murder of his
wife. Throughout the trial much evidence was given by crown witnesses as to
appellant’s consumption of alcohol and, until five months prior to the
homicide, of “speed”. Appellant did not give evidence on his own behalf. The
only witness called by the defence was a psychiatrist who testified that the
appellant was in a dissociated state of reaction at the time of the stabbing.
The psychiatrist attributed this condition to a reaction resulting from a
threat by appellant’s wife, the victim, to abort herself; he also stated that
alcohol had been a factor, but not the major factor. It was the opinion of the
witness that appellant was unable to appreciate the nature and consequence of
his actions and that such dissociative state constituted a disease of the mind.
The trial judge in his charge made a detailed review of the evidence given by
the psychiatrist and then proceeded to deal separately with each of the
specific defences but did not relate the evidence of the dissociative state
specifically to the issue of drunkenness. Appellant was convicted of
non-capital murder and his appeal unanimously dismissed by the Court of Appeal.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ., dissenting): The appeal should be
dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: The trial judge made it
clear that only in the event the jury decided appellant had not proved the
defence of insanity would they need to go on to consider the defence of
drunkenness, i.e. that drunkenness would only require consideration if
the psychiatrist’s thesis of dissociative reaction was rejected. If that thesis
were

[Page 613]

accepted by the jury the defence of insanity
would have been established. The case was not one in which, because of a
pre-existing condition, appellant was more likely to become incapable as a
result of consuming alcohol. Had that been the case the evidence would have had
significance. There was, in the circumstances, no error of law on the part of
the trial judge.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ., dissenting: The task of the jury in
reference to the defence of drunkenness was to determine whether appellant was
able to and did form the intent of killing the deceased or of administering to
her such bodily harm as he knew was likely to cause her death. To determine
this the jury had to consider all of the relevant evidence which included not
only evidence as to the quantity of alcohol consumed prior to the deed and its
observed effect but also the psychiatric evidence as to his personality,
external stress, and the effect of alcohol on such a person under such stress.
Because of the judge’s charge, the jury might well have come to the conclusion
that they should arrive at their decision by reference to only part of that
evidence and exclude other evidence.

Per Dickson
J., dissenting: In such a serious charge as that of non-capital murder,
the establishment of mens rea is a pre-requisite to ascribing guilt.
Section 212 of the Code makes specific provision for this in the
use of the words “means to clause his death”. The intention of the accused is
central to the determination of the charge. When deciding whether an accused
can rely on the defence of drunkenness to negative capacity to form the intent
to kill, it is necessary to consider the effect of the alcohol alleged to have
been consumed, on the particular accused, at the particular time and in his
then mental state. A rigid categorization of defences keeping mental evidence
of insanity entirely separate from evidence of drunkenness is not only
unrealistic but a departure from all that the concept of mens rea stands
for. It was essential to relate the evidence of drunkenness to the evidence of
the mental state of the accused. The jury was confused as evidenced by a
request for a recharge on provocation, insanity and intent. Although not easy
matters to explain to a jury, the attempt must be made to explain all factors
bearing on capacity and intent and to consider them jointly and severally as
part of an overall picture.

[Page 614]

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] dismissing an
appeal from a conviction for non-capital murder.

M.A. Wadsworth, for the appellant.

C. Scullion, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence J., in
which Dickson J. also concurred, was delivered by

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on April 25, 1974. By that judgment, the said Court of
Appeal dismissed an appeal from the conviction of the appellant by a jury in a
trial presided over by Mr. Justice O’Driscoll, the conviction having been
pronounced on May 16, 1973.

Leave to appeal to this Court was granted upon
the following question of law:

Did the Court of Appeal err in law in
failing to hold that the trial Judge erred in law in failing to put to the jury
on the issue of drunkenness the medical evidence as to the accused’s
dissociative state of mind as having a bearing on the issue of intent arising
out of the defence of drunkenness?

The judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario
has been reported in (1974), 18 C.C.C. (2d) 270, and Martin J.A. in giving the
unanimous judgment of the Court made a very considerable reference to the facts
and to the grounds of appeal before that Court so that it will be necessary to
add in these reasons but little reference to the evidence.

The issue which concerned this Court was the
alleged failure of the learned trial judge to put to the jury on the issue of
drunkenness the medical evidence as to the accused’s dissociative state of mind
as having a bearing on the issue of intent arising out of the defence of
drunkenness.

Throughout the trial, there was a very
considerable body of evidence given by many witnesses as to the accused’s
consumption of alcohol and also his consumption, until a date some five months

[Page 615]

prior to the homicide, of the drug known as
“speed”. There was a well evidence given by lay witnesses, the associates of
the accused, during the evening in question and also police officers as to the
accused’s over wrought state following the homicide and what was described,
both in questions and in answers during the evidence, as his “distraught
condition”. The only witness called for the defence was a Dr. Pieter Ormonde
Gordeon Butler, an expert psychiatrist whose qualifications were proved to the
Court and to whose expertise no objection was made by the Crown.

There were three defences urged by counsel for
the defence. Firstly, insanity; secondly, the defence known as drunkenness; and
thirdly, the defence known as provocation.

It was quite evident upon reading the
examination-in-chief of Dr. Butler that the purpose of adducing his evidence
was to support the defence of insanity and Dr. Butler gave evidence expressing
strongly the opinion that the appellant, at the moment the offence was
committed, suffered from a dissociative state. Dr. Butler based that opinion
upon an interview lasting one and a half hours which he had with the accused on
May 3, 1973, which was almost six months after the commission of the offence,
on the evidence which was outlined to him by counsel for both the defence and
the Crown, on evidence which he heard during the trial, and, as he said, upon his
expert knowledge in psychiatry.

The jury, by its verdict of guilty as charged,
certainly rejected the defence of insanity and no issue is taken by the defence
as to the judge’s charge on either the defence of insanity or the defence of
provocation, so that those two defences need no further consideration at this
time.

The learned trial judge gave a long, detailed
and in nearly every respect a most meticulously correct charge to the jury.
That charge, after commencing with the usual formal parts and the submission to
the jury of the indictment, continued with a very lengthy recital of the
evidence witness by witness which occupied thirty-four printed pages in the
record and which included in detail a recital of the

[Page 616]

evidence of associates of the appellant and of
the police officers as to his drinking, as to his personality, as to his
apparent over-wrought or disturbed condition, and also detailed reference to
the evidence of Dr. Butler. This latter reference, as one would expect in view
of the examination-in-chief of Dr. Butler by defence counsel, seems to be very
largely concerned with the expert witness’ opinion as to the sanity of the
appellant but it did include a reference to Dr. Butler’s opinion that a drug
user would be more susceptible to the effects of alcohol than another person.

The learned trial judge then turned to the issue
of intent, and I quote a page of his charge upon that topic:

Let us go back. Has the Crown proved to you
beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused caused the death of his wife by
means of an unlawful act? That is stabbing her to death with exhibit 28A and B.
I would not think there would be much doubt on that. That is for you to say.
Has the Crown proved to you beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused meant to
cause her death or meant to cause her bodily harm that he knew was likely to
cause death and was reckless whether or not death ensued?

How do you determine whether someone meant
or intended to do something assuming that you have someone who is sane,
assuming you have someone who is sober. There is a reasonable inference that a
man intends the natural consequences of his act. When a man points a gun at
another and fires it, the jury may reasonably infer he meant to either cause
death or to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death and was
reckless whether or not death ensued. The stabbing of a person the number of
times and in the places here found, I think one may infer the person intended
to cause death or intended to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to
cause death and was reckless whether or not death ensued. Has the Crown proved
either one of these beyond a reasonable doubt? If so, the verdict would be
guilty as charged.

It will be seen that that reference is chiefly
to the course of proving intent by reference to the acts of an accused person
and the inference, not the presumption, that he intended the natural
consequences of his act.

[Page 617]

The learned trial judge then turned to submit to
the jury the evidence of insanity and therein referred to the evidence of Dr.
Butler which, as I have said, he had previously outlined. The reference to Dr.
Butler’s evidence at that time was not extensive but that evidence the learned
trial judge had outlined in detail earlier in his charge and the reference to
it at this point in the charge brought out to the jury that in considering the
issue of insanity the evidence of Dr. Butler was, of course, crucial.

The learned trial judge continued:

If you come to the conclusion beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of murder and has not proved on a
balance of probabilities the defence of insanity, then you must also consider
this, the defence of drunkenness. There is evidence of the accused man’s
drinking in this case and the law as to the effect of consumption of alcohol is
this.

The learned trial judge then continued to
outline the law in reference to the defence of drunkenness and may be said to
have simply adopted Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard[2]. He then continued by referring to
the evidence previously outlined of the witnesses upon the appellant’s
consumption of alcohol. The learned trial judge, however, during this part of
his charge, did not refer, or perhaps I should use the words refer back, to the
evidence of Dr. Butler which he had previously outlined, and then continued his
charge with reference to the defence of provocation. Counsel for the accused at
the trial, who was not the counsel for the appellant in this Court, objected to
the charge upon this specific issue submitting:

First of all, with respect to the issue of
intent. On the issue of intent, your lordship put it to the jury that this is
really related to the defence of drunkenness. As I understand the evidence,
particularly that of Dr. Butler when he was asked whether or not in his opinion
the accused had the capacity to form the necessary intent, he made it quite
clear that in his view the element of alcohol, the intake of alcohol, was only
one of several factors. He stressed for example the importance of external
pressure, the threat of the deceased to abort herself. It is my respectful view
that in putting the matter of intent to the

[Page 618]

jury, although I appreciate in many cases
they talk only about the issue of drunkenness, I haven’t been able to find
anywhere a law which states that in determining whether or not they are
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had the capacity to form
the necessary intent that they need not only just take into consideration the
evidence of drunkenness when there is evidence of drunkenness, but the evidence
of his external pressure or threat or provocation.

I am deliberately avoiding using
provocation in that context. I don’t want the jury to be confused between
provocation in its broadest sense and the legal sense, but it is my submission
that the intake of alcohol is only one element the jury must consider with
respect to whether or [not] the accused was able to form the necessary intent.
The jury should be asked to consider Dr. Butler’s evidence in that respect as
to whether or not with the combination of alcohol, the accused’s personality
and external threat in his view combined to create this dissociative state
which made it impossible for the accused to form the necessary intent.

That is quite apart from whether or not the
jury is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused is insane.
The jury may not be satisfied the accused or the defence has satisfied them on
the balance of probabilities that he was insane. I wouldn’t like them to do that
although your lordship put it to the jury that it is open to the jury to find
that he wasn’t insane on the evidence of Dr. Butler.

The learned trial judge determined that he would
not recharge the jury but later the jury returned with a question framed by the
foreman as follows:

THE FOREMAN: Yes, sir. I have a statement
here to read which we have agreed on and it says we the jury request a
redefinition of the law regarding the possible verdicts in this case.

And the foreman then replied to the learned trial
judge’s query:

THE FOREMAN: No, sir, we require something
considerably further than that. As an example, we would like you to repeat your
remarks regarding provocation, regarding insanity and regarding intent. In
short, what we are asking you to do is to repeat your remarks in the last ten
minutes or so of your address to us.

The learned trial judge then recharged the jury.
Again, he referred to the evidence of Dr. Butler

[Page 619]

upon the insanity issue but in his one paragraph
he refers to the issue of drunkenness and made no reference to any of the
evidence.

It is the submission of counsel for the
appellant, and I am inclined to agree with that statement, that this course of
the charge is very close to directing the jury that on the issue of insanity
they should consider particularly the evidence of Dr. Butler as to dissociative
state but that when the jury turned to consider the defence of drunkenness they
should not consider that evidence and confine themselves to the evidence of the
associates of the appellant and the police officers chiefly concerned with the
quantity of alcohol which it was alleged by those very associates the appellant
had consumed and with his display of or failure to display signs of
intoxication.

Dr. Butler had dealt to a considerable extent in
his evidence with alcohol and its effects. He had referred to the appellant’s
addiction to the drug known as “speed” and to the appellant’s addiction to
alcohol from the time he was sixteen years old and that he had undergone a
course of treatment in an institution for alcoholism. Dr. Butler stated that
some alcoholics become disturbed or deranged on a relatively small amount of
alcohol. He had further stated in cross-examination:

A. It is frequently a blackout, it is
frequently similar to a blackout. You can confuse the two. I don’t know if you
had a chance to read the book overnight. You probably noticed they say it is
difficult to distinguish an acute dissociative reaction from an alcoholic
blackout and they may take place at the same time.

Q. Did that happen in this instance? A. I
believe so.

And further in the cross-examination he had
stated:

A. I may have given you the wrong
impression. What I said was that he had an acute dissociative reaction and
alcohol had been a factor. I didn’t say it had been a major factor.

[Page 620]

Q. What was the major factor?

A. The major factor was the personality
structure, impulsive, rigid, together with this overwhelming stress of finding
his wife about to do something that was an anathema to him.

At the close of the examination of Dr. Butler by
counsel for the appellant and cross-examination by counsel for the Crown, the
learned trial judge addressed to him further questions, and for the present
purpose those questions and answers are most enlightening. The first of which
is this:

HIS LORDSHIP: Q. Doctor, you say this man
was in a dissociative state which he went into at about the time when he found
out he couldn’t dissuade his wife from using the coat hanger. Is this what
triggered the dissociative state or was it alcohol or a combination of both?

A. A combination of both.

I also quote the following:

Q. Is that terminology applicable here?

A. Yes. Throughout I have tried to stress
there are both factors, the alcohol and the psychological stress.

Q. Then let me ask you this. From the
evidence that has been recounted to you by Mr. Kielb and Mr. McMurtry
and from what you have been told by the accused, is it your view that the
accused was intoxicated from the consumption of alcoholic beverages to such a
degree that he was incapable of forming the intent at that time, forgetting
about the dissociative state?

A. No, I don’t think so. He had been
functioning fairly well up to the point where he was faced with this emotional
crisis. He apparently functioned fairly well after that. I have seen people
playing the piano when they were drunk who would pass out and stay put for a
few minutes and then continue on. They would have no memory for the time they
had passed out and there was nothing else involved.

Q. Like a man who drives a car home, puts
it in the garage, closes the door and has no recollection of doing it?

A. That is right.

Q. Then from your analysis and opinion, the
accused was not intoxicated, that he was incapable of forming the intent to
kill as a result of the con-

[Page 621]

sumption of alcohol? You say it is this
dissociative state?

A. I think it is a combination of the two.

Q. If one leaves aside the dissociative
situation, you say he was intoxicated?

A. Yes, I think he was intoxicated.

The task of the jury in reference to the defence
of drunkenness was to determine whether that particular accused person at about
2:30 a.m. on November 11, 1972, was able to and did form the intent of killing
the deceased or of administering to her such bodily harm which he knew was
likely to cause her death and was reckless whether death ensued or not. For the
jury to determine this, they had to consider all of the evidence relevant to
the subject. That evidence included not only evidence as to the quantity of
alcohol which the appellant had consumed prior to the deed and its observed
effect upon his actions and appearance, but the evidence as to his personality,
the evidence of what Dr. Butler referred to as external stress, and Dr.
Butler’s skilled evidence of the effect of alcohol upon such person under such
stress. If the jury, due to the course of the charge which I have outlined,
could come to the conclusion that they should arrive at their decision by
reference to only part of that evidence and exclude other evidence, and
particularly the important evidence which I have cited above, then the jury did
not receive a proper outline of their duties. I am of the opinion that under
the particular circumstances in this case such an unfortunate result may well
have occurred.

I, therefore, am of the opinion that there
should be a new trial.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario,
which unanimously dismissed an appeal by the appellant from his conviction at
trial by a jury on a charge of non-capital murder. The present appeal is
brought by leave of this Court on the following question of law:

[Page 622]

Did the Court of Appeal err in law in failing
to hold that the trial Judge erred in law in failing to put to the jury on the
issue of drunkenness the medical evidence as to the accused’s dissociative
state of mind as having a bearing on the issue of intent arising out of the
defence of drunkenness?

The facts of the case are related in the
judgment of Martin J.A., who delivered the reasons of the Court of Appeal,
which are reported in (1974), 18 C.C.C. (2d) 270. It is unnecessary to repeat
them in full.

The appellant was charged with the murder of his
wife to whom he had been married for approximately one week at the time of her
death on November 11, 1972. She
was killed at the apartment of a friend, Miss Giselle Clouthier, and her
brother, where the appellant and his wife were to spend the night. Her death
resulted from stab wounds.

During the previous evening and in the early
hours of the morning of November 11 the appellant consumed a substantial amount
of beer and some whiskey. At about 2:30 a.m. Miss Clouthier was awakened by the
deceased, who said “Billy stabbed me” and then fell across Miss Clouthier’s
bed. She was removed from the apartment by ambulance, but died before she
reached the hospital.

The appellant made two statements to the police,
one oral and one written, which were admitted in evidence, in which he said
that he did not mean to kill the deceased; that he went “berserk” when she
attempted to induce a miscarriage with a wire coat-hanger and that he got the
knife to scare her. There was some evidence tending to confirm the appellant’s
statement that the deceased had expressed an intention to induce a miscarriage
by the use of a wire coat-hanger. Miss Clouthier testified that during the
previous evening the deceased had told her that she thought she was pregnant
and that she was going to abort herself with a coat‑hanger. A length of
metal wire which appeared to be an untwisted coat-hanger was found in the hall
outside the bedroom where the handle part of a broken knife and most of the
blood were found. On the other hand, the patholo-

[Page 623]

gist who performed the autopsy upon the deceased
testified that she was not pregnant. Both the ambulance driver who arrived at
the apartment at 2:40 a.m. and
the police officer who arrived at 2:49 a.m. in response to a call, observed the
deceased lying on the bed and noticed that she was fully dressed and that she
was wearing black slacks. The autopsy did not reveal any evidence of injury to
the vagina or uterus.

The appellant did not give evidence on his own
behalf at the trial. The only evidence presented by the defence was that of Dr.
Butler, a psychiatrist, who had interviewed the appellant for about an hour and
a half on May 3, 1973, almost
six months after the appellant’s wife’s death. His opinion, based upon his
interview with the appellant, the details of the evidence in the case given to
him by counsel, and the statements made by the appellant to the police, was
that the appellant was in dissociated state of reaction at the time of the
stabbing which lasted from about 2:30 a.m. to 8 a.m. He stated that this
reaction is a reaction to particular circumstances and particular stresses in a
certain environment. It represented a gross personality disorganization. There
would be an acute breakdown. He attributed the dissociated state to the reaction
resulting from the threat made by the appellant’s wife to abort herself. He
also stated that alcohol had been a factor, but not the major factor.

In reply to a question as to whether or not the
appellant had the capacity to form the intention to either kill or seriously
injure his wife at the time she apparently received the wounds that have been
described, Dr. Butler answered as follows:

I don’t believe—to answer your question
directly no, I don’t think he could. I don’t think he could form the intent satisfactorily…

The witness subsequently amplified his answer to
indicate that in his view the accused was unable to appreciate the nature and
consequence of his actions in the sense of being “sensitively” aware of the
nature and consequence of his actions. In response to a number of questions put
to the witness by the learned trial judge after counsel for the Crown and the
defence had completed their

[Page 624]

examinations, he stated that in his opinion the
dissociative state was caused by a combination of psychological stress and
alcohol and constituted a disease of the mind which rendered the appellant
incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of the act.

The learned trial judge, in his charge to the
jury, before dealing with the defences of insanity, drunkenness and
provocation, raised by the defence, made a detailed review of Dr. Butler’s
evidence. He then proceeded to instruct the jury with respect to each of these
specific defences. We are not concerned with the defences of insanity and
provocation. The only issue before this Court is as to whether the learned
trial judge, as a matter of law, should, when dealing with the issue of
drunkenness, have put to the jury the medical evidence of Dr. Butler
respecting the dissociative state of mind from which Dr. Butler said that he
was suffering. In my opinion there was no error of law on the part of the trial
judge in respect of this matter.

In his charge to the jury on the issue of
drunkenness the learned trial judge made the following statements:

There is evidence of the accused man’s
drinking in this case and the law as to the effect of consumption of alcohol is
this. Drunkenness does not excuse the accused. The evidence of drunkenness
which at the time of the alleged offence renders the accused incapable of
forming the specific intent to constitute the crime charged should be taken
into consideration by you with other facts proved in order to decide whether or
not he had that intent…

The accused man’s capacity with regard to
alcohol, capacity to form the necessary intent to kill in this case is a
question of fact for you. The onus is not on the accused to establish that he
was not drunk. It is sufficient if the evidence raises a reasonable doubt in
your mind as to his mental capacity to form the necessary intent. But I should
tell you this, that evidence of intoxication falling short of incapacity in the
accused to form the necessary intent and merely showing his mind was affected
by drink, that he more readily gave way to some violent urge or passion or more
inclined to fight or do some other act while under the influence of alcohol,
but not drunk in the legal sense, that does not constitute drunkenness in law.

.     .     .

[Page 625]

Has the Crown satisfied you on this part of
the matter that despite the evidence of drinking by the accused, he had the
capacity to mean to cause death? If your answer is no, then the verdict should
be manslaughter. Has the Crown satisfied you that the accused was not so drunk
as to be incapable of having the intent or reckless disregard for the
consequences to cause bodily harm which he would appreciate would cause death?
If your answer is no, the verdict should be manslaughter. If you have any real
doubt as to whether or not accused has the necessary capacity to form the intent
to murder, your verdict should be manslaughter.

As previously mentioned, the learned trial judge
had already reviewed the evidence of Dr. Butler at some length. In the
course of that review he said:

The doctor said it is hard to distinguish
acute dissociative reaction from an alcohol blackout. They may take place at
the same time. He said, “To the best of my knowledge and in all probability, he
had a dissociative reaction”. In the doctor’s view, what the accused suffered
from at the time was what he described to us when he says it is a disease of
the mind.

This passage accurately summarizes the doctor’s
evidence on this point. When referring to the part played by alcohol he said:

I may have given you the wrong impression.
What I said was that he had had an acute dissociative reaction and alcohol had
been a factor. I didn’t say it had been a major factor.

Dr. Butler said that this reaction began at 2:30
a.m.; i.e., at the time of or immediately prior to the commission of the
offence. This is not, therefore, a case in which, because of a pre‑existing
condition, the appellant was more likely to become incapable as a result of
consuming alcohol. If that had been the case, Dr. Butler’s evidence would have
significance in relation to the defence of drunkenness. His thesis was,
however, that at the time of the commission of the offence the appellant was
suffering from dissociative reaction, a disease of the mind, brought on by his
wife’s threat to abort herself, in which alcohol was a factor, but not the
major factor.

[Page 626]

The evidence of Dr. Butler, as appears clearly
from his examination in chief, was directed to the issue of insanity. He gave
the opinion that the appellant, by reason of disease of the mind, did not
appreciate the nature and consequences of his action.

The learned trial judge, in sequence, dealt with
the defences of insanity, drunkenness and provocation. There is no complaint
about his charge in respect of the first defence. The success of that defence
depended entirely upon whether or not the jury accepted Dr. Butler’s evidence
about dissociative reaction as the cause of the appellant’s conduct. Having
charged the jury on that issue, and having referred to the evidence, the
learned judge then instructed the jury as follows:

If you come to the conclusion beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of murder and has not proved on a
balance of probabilities the defence of insanity, then you must also consider
this, the defence of drunkenness.

He thus made it clear that it was only if the
jury decided that the appellant had not proved the defence of insanity that
they would need to go on to consider the defence of drunkenness. In substance
this means that if Dr. Butler’s thesis of dissociative reaction was rejected,
the defence of drunkenness would then require to be considered, because it is
clear that, if that evidence were accepted by the jury, the defence of insanity
would have been established. The jury, by its verdict, has made it clear that
that evidence was not accepted.

In these circumstances, in my opinion, the
learned trial judge was under no obligation to instruct the jury specifically
to consider again, when dealing with the defence of drunkenness, Dr. Butler’s
evidence concerning dissociative reaction.

I would dismiss the appeal.

DICKSON J. (dissenting)—I am in agreement
with the reasons prepared for delivery by Mr. Justice Spence in this
appeal but wish to add the following comment.

[Page 627]

In a serious charge of the nature of that which
the accused appellant faced in the present case the criminal law very properly
fastens on the requirement of mens rea before ascribing guilt.
Section 212  of the Criminal Code  makes specific provision for this
in the words “means to cause his death.” Central to this determination is
intention of the accused. Did the accused intend to commit the act with which
he is charged? Full accountability depends upon an affirmative answer to that
question. Did he have the necessary capacity to form the intent to kill? Did
the accused intend to kill? These are the questions.

When deciding whether an accused can rely on the
defence of drunkenness to negative capacity to form the intent to kill, one
must consider the effect of the alcohol alleged to have been consumed, upon the
particular accused, at the particular time, and in his then mental state.
Mental condition is a relevant, indeed essential, consideration to a
determination of mens rea if, in conjunction with alcohol, it affects
capacity to form an intention. Mental condition as well as the effect of
alcohol are relevant to the critical question, not placed before the jury in
this case, of whether the accused had the necessary intent.

The predominant question is intent. A rigid
categorization of defences, keeping medical evidence of insanity entirely
separate from evidence of drunkenness is not only unrealistic but a departure
from all that is embraced in the phrase ‘mens rea.’ The concern is with
the particular accused and with his capacity to form the intent to kill when as
here, for example, the defence contends the accused was in a dissociative state
of mind, drunk and provoked. It was necessary for the jury to weigh and assess
each of these elements separately; it was imperative also, in my view, to
relate the evidence of drunkenness to the evidence of the mental state of the
accused. These are not easy matters to explain to a jury. Obviously, the jury
was confused here, as evidenced by the request for a recharge on provocation,
insanity and intent. The attempt must, however, be made. If intent and capacity
are to be anything more than catchwords, then all factors bearing upon capacity
and intent,

[Page 628]

such as dissociative state, stress and
drunkenness, must be considered jointly and severally as part of an overall
picture and their respective influences, each upon the other, assessed.

I would allow the appeal and direct a new trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE FEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL

Extradition — Affidavit of co-conspirator — Suffic­iency of
evidence — Application of rules of criminal law in the extradition judge's
exercise of discretion — Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21, ss. 10(1), 13,
18 — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 475(1).

Appellant requested that a warrant be issued under
the Extradition Act  for the apprehension of respondent in respect of
extradition crimes committed in the United States and Canada in violation of
the narcotic drug laws of the United States. The only evidence produced con­sisted
of the affidavit of one Herrmann, a co-conspira­tor. Hugessen J., sitting as an
extradition judge, refused the extradition: according to him, he had to apply
the test to the effect that the judge can and should intervene to
""withdraw the case from the hands of the jurors"" when the evidence is
""so manifestly unreliable"". The Federal Court of Appeal dismissed an
application made pursuant to s. 28  of the Federal Court Act  for the
review of this decision. Hence the appeal to this Court.

Held (Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson and
Beetz JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon and de
Grandpré JJ.: It was admitted that under s. 18 of the Extradi­tion Act the
trial judge properly relied on the test which is applied in jury trials when
there is a motion to obtain a directed verdict. When the evidence is direct and
inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the accused is the
guilty person, it is not the judge but the jury which is seized with the duty
to weigh the evidence for the purpose of determining whether or not it is
credible. If the function of an extradition judge is equivalent to that of a
judge in a similar case, it follows that credibility is not within his sphere.
In the present case, there was overwhelming evidence in the Herrmann affidavit
to support the charge of conspiracy.

Per Laskin C.J. and Spence, Judson and Beetz
JJ., dissenting: An extradition judge is in the same situation

[Page 1068]

as a judge who must decide whether there is evidence
upon which a reasonable jury, properly charged, could bring in a verdict of
guilty. His discretion is not confined only to those cases where the evidence
is wholly circum­stantial: his discretion extends to consideration of whether
the evidence is of such a dubious nature as to be dangerous. In the present
case, it is so because it was given by a witness who was acting in hope of a
reward.

There is cast upon the extradition judge an extra
burden of caution, since his decision might have the effect of putting the
accused under the jurisdiction of the courts of another country. Even the
procedures by which the evidence on which the application was based may not be
revealed to the extradition judge.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal[1]
affirming a decision of Hugessen A.C.J. of the Superior Court of Quebec, sitting
as an extradition judge.[2] Appeal
allowed.

L. P. Landry, Q.C., for the appellant.

David Linetsky and Sidney Leithman, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz B. was
delivered by

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal from the judgment of the
Federal Court of Appeal pronounced on September 25, 1974.

The Federal Court of Appeal considered an application to review
and set aside the decision of Hugessen A.C.J. pronounced as a Commissioner
under the provisions of the Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. É-21.

[Page 1069]

The respondent had been arrested on the infor­mation and
complaint of Guy David, an R.C.M.P. officer, that the said respondent was a
fugitive criminal of the United States of America and had been accused of
crimes committed within the jurisdiction of the Eastern District of Wisconsin.
The indictment issued by the grand jury in Wisconsin and which was part of the
warrant for the respond­ent's arrest, accused him of conspiracy, with others
both co-accused and co-conspirators not accused, to commit acts in violation of
the laws of the United States which may be briefly described as the importation
and distribution of narcotic drugs.

In accordance with the provisions of s. 13 of the said Extradition
Act , which reads:

13. The fugitive shall be brought before a judge, who shall,
subject to this Part, hear the case, in the same manner, as nearly as may be,
as if the fugitive was brought before a justice of the peace, charged with an
indictable offence committed in Canada.

the respondent was brought before Hugessen A.C.J. for a hearing.
The said s. 13 provides that the judge shall hear the case in the same manner
as nearly as may be as if the fugitive was brought before a justice of the
peace charged with an indictable offence committed in Canada. Section 18  of the
Extradition Act  gives much more explicit directions and provides:

18. (1) The judge shall issue his warrant for the committal
of the fugitive to the nearest convenient prison, there to remain until
surrendered to the foreign state, or discharged according to law,

(a) in the case of a fugitive alleged to have been convicted
of an extradition crime, if such evidence is produced as would, according to
the law of Canada, subject to this Part, prove that he was so convicted, and

(b) in the case of a fugitive accused of an extradition
crime, if such evidence is produced as would, accord­ing to the law of Canada,
subject to this Part, justify his committal for trial, if the crime had been
commit­ted in Canada.

(2) If such evidence is not produced, the judge shall order
him to be discharged.

The only evidence produced before Hugessen A.C.J. in support of
the application for an order for the extradition of the respondent was an
affidavit

[Page 1070]

purporting to be sworn by one Albert E. Herr­mann which in thirty
long paragraphs outlined the alleged conspiracy in very considerable detail. In
the first paragraph of that affidavit, however, the said Herrmann deposed as
follows:

1. I am a citizen of Germany, and last arrived in the United
States of America in May, 1973, at Milwaukee, Wisconsin. On June 6, 1973, I was
arrested by agents of the Drug Abuse Law Enforcement office, and I have been
indicated [sic] for narcotics offenses in the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Wiscon­sin. An attorney has been appointed to represent
me, and I am presently free on bond. I make this affidavit freely and
voluntarily with full knowledge of my legal rights after the United States
Attorney's office promised to dismiss all but one of the narcotics charges
against me, which would be held open until after I had testified before the
Grand Jury, and in any subsequent criminal prosecutions arising out of my Grand
Jury testimony. The final narcotic charge against me would be dismissed upon my
completion of all of my court appearances and testimony in criminal
prosecutions against my co-conspirators.

so that the application to Hugessen A.C.J. was to order the
extradition of the respondent on the sole basis of an affidavit made by a
person who alleged he was a co-conspirator and who volunteered that he had been
indicted for these offences, that an attorney had been appointed to represent
him, that he was free on bond and that the United States Attorney's office had
promised to dismiss all charges but one against him after his testimony before
the Grand Jury, and the last charge after he had completed his court appearance
in the crimi­nal prosecution against his co-conspirators. To put it briefly,
Herrmann was not only an accomplice but was an accomplice who was testifying,
admit­tedly for reward, for his own freedom.

Hugessen A.C.J. stated the test in s. 18(1) (b) of the Extradition
Act , which I have cited above, saying that evidence should be adduced which
would justify the committal of the respondent for trial if the alleged crime
had been committed in Canada. To determine what evidence would justify

[Page 1071]

a justice upon a preliminary hearing committing an accused person
for trial, Hugessen A.C.J. turned to s. 475  of the Criminal Code  which
provides:

475. (1) When all the evidence has been taken by the justice
he shall,

(a) if in his opinion the evidence is sufficient to put the
accused on trial,

(i) commit the accused for trial,

…

(b) discharge the accused, if in his opinion upon the whole
of the evidence no sufficient case is made out to put the accused on trial.

It should be noted that the important words are ""if in his
opinion upon the whole of the evidence no sufficient case is made out to put
the accused on trial"". Those words have been interpreted in at least three
different fashions by different courts. The first test and probably that
requiring a little weaker case is that if the magistrate believes the accused
is probably guilty of the crime, he should commit the accused for trial. The
second and third tests, and I agree with Hugessen A.C.J. that they are to all
intents and purposes the same, are that the accused should not be committed for
trial if no jury properly charged and acting judicially could convict. the
accused upon the evidence adduced, or that the trial judge upon the production
of that evidence before the jury would be under a duty of directing the jury to
bring in a verdict of acquittal. The latter would be the proper form of
procedure, although it is often spoken of as ""taking the case from the
jury"".

Hugessen A.C.J. then stated:

Put in another way, my function is not to weigh the evidence
to decide whether or not I believe it, but rather to determine whether there is
evidence upon which a reasonable jury, properly instructed in law, could bring
in a verdict of guilty, and this, of course, means that if it is the sort of
case where, as a trial judge, I would feel obliged to direct a verdict of
acquittal, then, as an extradition judge, I should refuse to commit.

[Page 1072]

The learned extradition commissioner then expressed the view that
there is a considerable body of jurisprudential authority upholding the right
of the trial judge to intervene and withdraw the case from the jury when the
Crown's evidence is so manifestly unreliable or so doubtful or tainted in
nature as to make it dangerous and unjust to put the accused to his defence on
the basis thereof. Hugessen A.C.J. cited as an authority for that proposition
R. v. Comba[3], where
Duff C.J. said at p. 397:

We agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal, whose
reasons for their judgment we find convincing and conclusive, that the learned
trial judge ought, on the application made by counsel for the prisoner at the
close of the evidence for the Crown, to have told the jury that, in view of the
dubious nature of the evidence, it would be unsafe to find the prisoner guilty,
and to have directed them to return a verdict of acquittal according­ly. It is not,
and could not, with any plausibility, be suggested that the case for the Crown
was in any way strengthened or improved by the evidence put before the jury on
behalf of the defence.

R. v. Comba was an unusual case. The charge was murder of
a young girl and the evidence was altogether circumstantial. At the close of
the Crown's case, the defence had moved for a directed verdict which motion the
learned trial judge had refused. The trial then proceeded with address of
counsel, no evidence being adduced on behalf of the defence. The jury's verdict
was guilty. Upon the matter being considered by the Court of Appeal for Ontario[4],
it was demonstrated that during the course of the trial the jury, despite the
trial judge's careful instructions, had been permit­ted to separate and all
members of the court were of the opinion that at least a new trial should be
ordered. The relief sought by the appellant in his notice of appeal was only
that such new trial be granted but upon counsel for the appellant opening his
appeal he took the position that the conviction should be quashed and the
appellant released and applied for leave to amend the notice of appeal to so
provide. Such leave was granted by the Court of Appeal with Latchford C.J. most
vigorously dissenting.

[Page 1073]

Each member of the majority gave reasons for judgment but the
reasons of Middleton J.A. were much the most extensive and were con­curred in
by the other members of the majority. Middleton J.A. said at p. 203,
""There was no direct evidence indicating the criminal. The only evidence
that can be adduced is purely circumstan­tial."" He then proceeded to
examine such circum­stantial evidence and applying the well-known test in Hodge's
Case[5],
demonstrated that such evi­dence was as consistent with the innocence of
the accused as with his guilt. At p. 210, the learned justice on appeal said:

In the next place, it must be borne in mind that counsel for
Comba moved to have the case withdrawn from the jury. If I am right in the
opinion that this motion should have been granted, then it could not at that
time have been known whether Comba would testify or not.

It is this statement that Duff C.J. referred to in the concluding
paragraph of his reasons which I have quoted above.

Counsel for the appellant has submitted that R. v. Comba must
be confined to the cases where circumstantial evidence alone is adduced against
the accused, and that only in such cases is a judge justified in directing a
verdict or, to put it otherwise, withdrawing the case from the jury. He submits
that if there is direct and not merely circumstantial evidence, then no matter
how disreputable that evidence be it is the duty of the jury and not the judge
to weigh that evidence and determine whether or not it is credible and wheth­er
the jury should base its verdict upon it.

It is true that in Comba the evidence was wholly
circumstantial. I am, however, of the opinion that evidence of a ""dubious
nature"" which would make it unsafe for the jury to register a conviction
may be of such dubious nature because it is circumstan­tial and as consistent
with the innocence of the accused as with his guilt, or because it is
""tainted and unreliable"" as Hugessen A.C.J. described the evidence in
the present case. There is but little authority in reference to the task of an
extradition commissioner in applying s. 18(1)(b) of the Extra­dition
Act but one case where a very similar problem was canvassed is Re
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and Hernandez[6].

[Page 1074]

There an applica­tion for an extradition order came before
Honeywell, County Court Judge, who went over the evidence most carefully and
particularly that which dealt with identification of the accused man whose
extradition was sought. The attack made upon that evidence was not as to the
truthfulness of the witness who testified viva voce and was
cross-examined on his evidence, but whether his identification was so slim that
it stood no chance of convincing a jury beyond reasonable doubt. Honeywell,
Co.Ct.J., refused to order the extradi­tion of the accused man.

An application to review was made by the Com­monwealth of Puerto
Rico to the Federal Court of Appeal and that court first held that s. 28  of the
Federal Court Act  did not give it power to carry out the review
in the circumstances. This Court, reversing the Federal Court of Appeal, held
that that Court did have jurisdiction and referred the matter back to the
Federal Court of Appeal for hearing on the merits. Thurlow J. gave the judg­ment
for the Court dismissing the application to review and set aside the decision
of the extradition commissioner. After citing the various tests which I have
referred to above, Thurlow J. said at p. 1211:

Each of these tests or ways of putting a test may, as I see
it, be more or less useful to a justice or an extradi­tion Judge, depending on
the kind of a case presented but it must, I think, be remembered that whichever
way the test is put it can serve only as an aid to the justice or Judge in
forming an opinion on the evidence, which the statute directs him to apply, as
to the sufficiency of that evidence to put the accused person on trial. For
this purpose I should have thought that the minimum requirement would be
evidence upon which, if unan­swered at the trial, a jury acting reasonably
might convict but the statute does not prescribe a standard. It leaves the
standard of sufficiency to the judgment of the justice or Judge and it appears
to me that so long as his conclusion is supportable as being a reasonable
conclu­sion on the evidence before him, it is not essential that it should
appear that he has applied any particular or defined standard. In particular, I
do not think there is any cause for complaint that a particular standard has
not been applied if the standard actually applied is a lower or less demanding
one and the justice or Judge has

[Page 1075]

nevertheless concluded that the evidence was sufficient.

He then proceeded to review the evidence and said at pp. 1214:

After having read and reread the evidence of the witnesses
Atilano and Ortiz, and after hearing the very able argument of counsel for the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico I am not persuaded that the evidence was reasonably
sufficient to warrant putting the respondent on trial. Indeed, I find it
inconceivable that a person should be put on trial on such flimsy evidence as a
purported identification made a year after the event by a person who did not
previously know the accused and whose only opportunity to observe him was a
fleeting one from a distance of some 60 ft., if indeed he ever got that close.
The evidence of the witness having selected the respondent's identification
card is not in itself evidence implicat­ing the respondent, and in the
circumstances as described it tends to weaken rather than to strengthen the
identification made by Atilano at the hearing since it is the person shown in the
picture which the witness had ample opportunity to examine, rather than the
fleeting view of the gunman that the witness would thereafter tend to remember.
Nor was there anything else to implicate the respondent or corroborate such
identification.

This conclusion is sufficient to dispose of the application
for if the Court is not itself persuaded that the evidence warranted committal still
less is it persuaded that it was not open to the learned extradition Judge in
exercising his discretion to regard the evidence as insufficient.

(The underlining is my own.) Thurlow J. said at p. 1215:

It was also urged that the learned Judge erred in law in
having weighed the testimony and thus usurped the function of the jury to
determine the credibility of the witnesses and the value of their testimony. I
do not regard it as possible, however, for an extradition Judge to perform his
function without having some regard for the obvious weight or lack of weight of
testimony put before him. He must, I think, weigh it in a rough scale to
determine its usefulness at a trial and what conclu­sions the whole or parts of
it would support. Here the learned Judge on more than one occasion mentioned
that it was not his function to weigh the evidence but simply to determine its
sufficiency and I do not think his conclusion can be regarded as having
proceeded from

[Page 1076]

any misdirection or error of law as to the function he was
performing. He applied the ""probably guilty"" test and concluded that
the evidence did not show that the respondent was probably guilty, a conclusion
which, with respect, I share, and as that is the lowest of the several
standards which I discussed earlier in these reasons it can scarcely be said
that the conclusion could have been anything but the same had any of the more
stringent standards of sufficiency been applied.

It is my view that Hugessen A.C.J. purported to act exactly in
accordance with the above statement of Thurlow J. in giving reasons in the
present appeal when he said:

A finding that evidence is ""manifestly unreliable""
or ""dubious"" does, of course, necessarily involve some sort of
weighing process, not, however, for the purpose of determining whether such
evidence ""proves"" the charge but rather for the purpose of
determining whether it has any weight at all which could prove the charge. As
stated by Thurlow J. in the case of HERNANDEZ (above cited), the extradition
judge must weigh the evidence ""in a rough scale, to determine its
usefulness at a trial and what conclusions the whole or parts of it would
support"".

With respect, I am in complete agreement with the statement of
Thurlow J. and I am ready to approve Hugessen A.C.J. having followed that
principle. I am of the opinion that the trial judge, upon considering whether
he should direct a ver­dict at the close of the Crown's case, has a discre­tion
to direct a verdict not confined only to those cases where the evidence was
wholly circumstan­tial. Rather, his discretion is, in the words of Chief
Justice Duff, ""whether the evidence is of such a dubious nature as to be
dangerous"". In Puerto Rico v. Hernandez, supra, the evidence was
dubi­ous and dangerous to use as a basis for conviction because the witness
purported to make observa­tions which the learned trial judge believed were
impossible. In the present case, the evidence is dangerous and dubious because
it was given by a witness who was quite evidently acting in hope of a reward
which had been promised to him in detail. I use Thurlow J.'s words in Hernandez,
""I find it inconceivable that a person should be put on trial on such
flimsy evidence ..."".

[Page 1077]

Counsel for the appellant has cited various cases in which
appellate courts have reviewed and reversed the decisions of trial court judges
to direct verdicts but an examination of each of those cases would indicate
that the trial court judges in such cases were weighing the evidence for the
purpose of determining the credibility. So, in R. v. Robichaud[7],
the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick reversed the
trial judge when he had directed a verdict on the basis that the evidence did
not show beyond reasonable doubt that the accused man had used more than suffi­cient
force to repel an assault and did now show beyond a reasonable doubt the cause
of death. There was no question of credibility whatsoever. The evidence was
given by two young boys whose credibility was not doubted. It was simply a ques­tion
of whether that evidence showed beyond a reasonable doubt the factors necessary
to establish the ingredients of the offence of manslaughter. With respect, I am
of the opinion that the Appeal Division was quite correct in its view that the
weight of that evidence was certainly a matter for the jury and no directed
verdict should have been issued. The case, in my opinion, is not applicable to
the present situation and I am of the opinion that Puerto Rico v. Hernandez
is.

There is another factor. The magistrate consid­ering whether he
should commit an accused person for trial knows that if he does commit that
accused then he will be tried in accordance with the provi­sions of the
Canadian Criminal Code, Canadian Bill of Rights and, in a
procedure where the accused's interests will be accorded all proper pro­tection.
An extradition commissioner, and this has no particular application to the
present case, may, on the other hand, consider whether he should order the
extradition of the arrested person to a jurisdiction of which he has no
knowledge of the prosecution procedures or doctrines or traditions. Moreover,
the extradition commissioner has no knowledge of the procedures which were
involved in obtaining the evidence which is adduced before him and upon which
he is asked to base his order for extradition. There is, therefore, in my view,

[Page 1078]

cast upon the extradition commissioner an extra burden of
caution.

In Auger v. Dubeau[8], at
p. 397, Brossard J. said:

It matters little whether the accused that the Judge has
before him is or is not a Canadian citizen, the foreigner being entitled to the
benefit of the same protection in a criminal matter as the citizens of the
country.

The Judge must also take into account the fact that his
decision might have the effect of taking the accused away from the jurisdiction
of the Courts of the country where he is and putting him again under the
jurisdiction of the Courts of another country and consequently, in conformity
with the requirements of s. 13 of the Act, he must take into account the fact
that his decision may, in a foreign country even if it be a friend, be
interpreted and used against the accused by proceeding in a manner different
from what it might be in Canada. So too, the Judge to whom a petition for
extradition is presented should grant it only on legal and certain evidence
that satisfies him that it is a matter for trial.

For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal and confirm the
decision of the Federal Court of Appeal.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon and de Grandpré
JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought with leave of this Court
from a judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal dismissing an application made
pursuant to s. 28  of the Federal Court Act  for the review of a decision
of Hugessen A.C.J. of the Superior Court of Quebec sitting as an extradition
judge under The Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21 whereby he
held that there was no evidence before him to justify him in issuing the
warrant applied for under The Extradition Act  for the apprehension of
the respondent in respect of extra­dition crimes committed in the United States
and Canada in violation of the narcotic drug laws of the United States.

The relevant provisions of The Extradition Act  read as
follows:

10. (1) Wherever this part applies, a Judge may issue a
warrant for the apprehension of a fugitive on a

[Page 1079]

foreign warrant of arrest, or an information or com­plaint
laid before him, and on such evidence or after such proceedings as in his
opinion would, subject to this Part justify the issue of his warrant if the
crime of which the fugitive is accused, or of which he is alleged to have been
convicted had been committed in Canada.

18. (1) The judge shall issue his warrant for the committal
of the fugitive to the nearest convenient prison, there to remain until
surrendered to the foreign state, or discharged according to law .. .

(b) in the case of a fugitive accused of an
extradition crime, if such evidence is produced as would, accord­ing to the law
of Canada, subject to this Part, justify his committal for trial, if the
crime had been commit­ted in Canada.

Section 13 of the Act which establishes the proce­dure to be
followed at the extradition hearing provides that:

The fugitive shall be brought before a Judge who shall,
subject to this Part, hear his case in the same manner as nearly as may be, as
if the fugitive was brought before a justice of the peace, charged with an
indictable offence committed in Canada.

(The underlining throughout is my own.)

These sections of the Act must, I think, be read in conjunction
with s. 475  of the Criminal Code  which defines the duty of a ""justice""
in deciding whether or not an accused should be committed for trial. The
section provides:

475. (1) When all the evidence has been taken by the justice
he shall,

(a) if in his opinion the evidence is sufficient to put the
accused on trial,

(i) commit the accused for trial, or .. .

(b) discharge the accused, if in his opinion upon the whole
of the evidence no sufficient case is made out to put the accused on trial,
(The italics are my own.)

In applying these sections to the case before him, the learned
judge sitting as an extradition judge, adopted the following test:

The test laid down by section 18(1)(b) of the Extradi­tion
Act is whether the evidence is such as would justify the committal of Mr.
Shephard for trial if the alleged

[Page 1080]

crime had been committed in Canada. In my view, this is the
same test as that which is applied at trial, when, at the conclusion of the
Crown's case, a motion is made for a directed verdict.

This test was recognized in the unanimous judg­ment of the
Federal Court of Appeal in The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico v. Hernandez[9].
Mr. Justice Hugessen also made reference to the view expressed by the Chief
Justice of the North-west Territories (Sifton C.J.) sitting as an extradi­tion
judge in the case of re Lattimer[10] where
he said at p. 247:

The duty that is laid upon me is to consider as to whether
the evidence that has been adduced in the absence of contradiction would be
such as to justify a magistrate in a similar case under our law committing him
for the purpose of standing his trial; practically it amounts to the same thing
as if in a trial with a judge and jury, there was such evidence that the judge
would not be justified in withdrawing the case from the jury.

I agree that the duty imposed upon a ""justice"" under s.
475(1) is the same as that which governs a trial judge sitting with a jury in
deciding whether the evidence is ""sufficient"" to justify him in
withdrawing the case from the jury and this is to be determined according to
whether or not there is any evidence upon which a reasonable jury proper­ly
instructed could return a verdict of guilty. The ""justice"", in
accordance with this principle, is, in my opinion, required to commit an
accused person for trial in any case in which there is admissible evidence
which could, if it were believed, result in a conviction.

In the present case, the evidence before the learned extradition
judge was an affidavit of one Albert E. Herrmann made in the State of Wiscon­sin
which disclosed that the respondent had been actively engaged in the drug trade
in that State. The affidavit not only disclosed that the deponent had been an
accomplice of the respondent in the alleged illegal operations of the
respondent, but also that he had been indicted for narcotics offences in
Wisconsin, and it then continues as follows:

[Page 1081]

An attorney has been appointed to represent me, and 1 am
presently free on bond. I make this affidavit freely and voluntarily with full
knowledge of my legal rights after the United States Attorney's office promised
to dismiss all but one of the narcotics charges against me, which would be held
open until after I had testified before the Grand Jury, and in any subsequent
criminal prosecutions arising out of my Grand Jury testimony. The final
narcotic charge against me would be dismissed upon my completion of all of my
court appearances and testimony in criminal prosecutions against my
co-conspirators.

In dealing with the grounds upon which the judge sitting at a
trial should withdraw the case from the jury, the learned trial judge had
occasion to say:

... it seems to me that there is now a considerable body
of jurisprudence and authority to the effect that the trial judge can and
should intervene to withdraw the case from the hands of the jurors where the
Crown's evidence is so manifestly unreliable or of so doubtful or tainted a
nature as to make it dangerous and unjust to put the accused to his defence on
the basis thereof, (The italics are my own.)

For this proposition the authority cited is a passage from the
judgment of Sir Lyman Duff in this Court in R. v. Comba[11],
where he said at p. 397:

... the learned trial judge ought, on the application made
by counsel for the prisoner at the close of the evidence for the Crown, to have
told the jury that, in view of the dubious nature of the evidence, it would be
unsafe to find the prisoner guilty, and to have directed them to return a
verdict of acquittal accordingly.

It is to be observed that there was no suggestion in the Comba
case that any of the evidence called by the Crown was either tainted or
unreliable. It came from witnesses whose integrity was at no time put in
question and who testified as to a variety of circumstances which had excited
enough suspicion against the accused to occasion his arrest and trial but which
taken together did not estab­lish his guilt in accordance with the accepted

[Page 1082]

standards of proof in such cases which are described by Duff C.J.
in the following passage:

It is admitted by the Crown, as the fact is, that the
verdict rests solely upon a basis of circumstantial evi­dence. In such cases,
by the long settled rule of the common law, which is the rule of law in Canada,
the jury, before finding a prisoner guilty upon such evi­dence, must be
satisfied not only that the circumstances are consistent with a conclusion that
the criminal act was committed by the accused, but also that the facts are such
as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the accused is
the guilty person.

In the present case the Herrmann affidavit con­tained direct
evidence which was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that
Shephard had personally committed a criminal act, but the trial judge rejected
his evidence as unworthy of belief whereas in the Comba case the
evidence in question which was accepted as true was entirely circumstantial and
did not meet the test required to support a guilty verdict. In my opinion there
is no analogy between the two cases.

The trial judge did not find it necessary to make express
reference to any of the cases constituting ""a considerable body of
jurisprudence and authori­ty"" to which he refers but was content with the
statement that ""a full review of the authorities may be found in the
judgment of my brother Ouimet in the case of Dimaulo Ciamarro and Tozzi""
an unreported judgment concerning the position of a judge in considering a
motion to withdraw the case from the jury at the close of the prosecution
evidence.

The judgment in the Dimaulo case is conven­iently
reproduced as an appendix to the respond­ent's factum and a consideration of
the jurispru­dence and authority there cited discloses that the learned judge
relied in great measure on certain statements contained in an article by Mr.
Glanville Williams in the Criminal Law Review (1965) and also some
remarks made by Mr. Popple in his

[Page 1083]

work on evidence. The Canadian authorities which are cited, (i.e.
R. v. Knox[12],
R. v. Gaudet[13],
R. v. Pearce[14] and
R. v. Sawrenko[15]) are
all cases in which the learned judge found that the evidence which was entirely
circumstantial did not satisfy the rule in Hodge's Case[16],
as reiterated by Chief Justice Duff in the Comba case. All these
cases are clearly distinguishable from the present one on the same ground as R.
v. Comba and in my opinion they do not constitute ""a ... body of
jurisprudence and authority"" affecting the problem in the present case,
nor do I regard the observations of the text writers to which reference is made
as justifying any conclusion to the effect that the trustworthiness or
credibility of the tendered evi­dence is a matter for the judge rather than the
jury.

In his judgment in Dimaulo, Mr. Justice Ouimet also refers
to but does not appear to follow, the case of Girvin v. The King[17],
where the then Chief Justice of this Court in my opinion correctly stated
the general rule governing the decision of a judge to withdraw a case from the
jury at the close of the prosecution evidence. The chief Justice there said:

I have always understood the rule to be that the Crown, in a
criminal case, is not required to do more than produce evidence which, if
unanswered, and believed, is sufficient to raise a prima facie case
upon which the jury might be justified in finding a verdict.

Mr. Justice Hugessen, in the course of his reasons for judgment,
appears to adopt some lan­guage found in a practice direction given by Lord
Parker, L.C.J., in 1962 Criminal L.R. at p. 160 where he says that:

A submission that there is no case to answer may properly be
made and upheld ... when the evidence adduced by the prosecution has been so
discredited as the result of cross-examination or is so manifestly unreliable
that no reasonable tribunal could safely con­vict upon it.

[Page 1084]

The learned trial judge appears to treat the words
""manifestly unreliable"" as synonymous with the word
""dubious"" as it is used in the Comba judg­ment, and he also
relies on an extract from the judgment of Mr. Justice Thurlow in the Her­nandez
case, supra, where he said of the duty of an extradition judge:

I do not regard it as possible, however, for an extradition
judge to perform his function without having some regard for the obvious weight
or lack of weight of testimony put before him. He must, I think, weigh it in a
rough scale to determine its usefulness at a trial and what conclusions the
whole or parts of it would support.

To the extent that the quotation from Parker L.C.J. could have
any bearing on the present inquiry, I think it should be observed that it is in
no way binding on this or any other Canadian Court, and I am bound to say that
I disagree with the remarks of Thurlow J., if they are intended to mean that
the extradition judge is seized with the duty to weigh the evidence for the
purpose of determining whether or not it is credible. Credibil­ity in my view
must always be a question for the jury and if the function of an extradition
judge is equivalent to that of a judge in determining wheth­er or not a case
should be left to the jury, it follows that credibility is not within his
sphere.

The governing principle was stated by Buller J., as long ago as
1788 when he said in R. v. Atwood and Robbins[18],
at pp. 465-6 that if the ground for objection goes only to the credit of
the witness

... his testimony must be received and left with the jury
under such directions and observations from the Court as the circumstances of
the case may require, to say whether they think it sufficiently credible to
guide their decision.

In the present case, Herrmann was, of course, an accomplice and
the rule as to ""directions and observations"" which the Court should
give under such circumstances was correctly stated in the judgment of the
learned trial judge where he says:

What can I say about this evidence? First of all, it is
evidence of an accomplice, and I would, therefore, were I presiding the trial
of Shephard, have to instruct the

[Page 1085]

jury that it would be dangerous for them to convict upon
such evidence alone, since there is no shred of corrobora­tion tending to show
the commission of an offence. This fact alone would not, of course, be enough to
justify a refusal to commit at preliminary enquiry since an instruction that it
would be dangerous to convict without corroboration necessarily implies that it
would still be possible to do so.

Mr. Justice Hugessen, however, went on to hold in effect that the
Herrmann evidence was so mani­festly unreliable as to justify him in treating
it as ""not being sufficient"" within the meaning of s. 475(1)  of the Criminal
Code . In support of this conclusion, the trial judge quoted a passage from
a judgment of Parker L.C.J. in the case of R. v. Pipe[19],
at p. 21, where that learned judge was careful to limit his observations to
the circum­stances of the particular case before him. The trial judge appears
to interpret the passage which he cites from that case as meaning that where a
man is not only an accomplice but also one against whom proceedings have been
brought and not concluded, his evidence may be so suspect as to warrant a judge
in withdrawing the case from the jury, but it appears to me to be unnecessary
to consider the Pipe case in any detail because of the concession made
by Mr. Justice Hugessen, rightly in my view, where he said:

I am prepared to concede that the case of PIPE goes further
than the Canadian practice and that, in this country, the mere fact that an
accomplice has charges pending against him does not render bad a conviction
based upon the testimony of such accomplice.

The learned trial judge, however, went on to cite the unreported
judgment of his brother Shorteno in the case of R. v. Coe as establishing
that evidence such as that of Herrmann ""is tainted beyond redemption and
cannot in a legal sense be weighed by the jury because the witness is no longer
a free agent and there is no standard by which his veracity may be
tested or estimated.""

These observations, made by a single judge in withdrawing the
case from the jury, appear to me to constitute the only Canadian authority for
Mr. Justice Hugessen's conclusion and it is to be

[Page 1086]

observed that he reached this conclusion notwith­standing the
judgment of the Court of Appeal of Alberta in R. v. Caulfield[20],
where Mr. Justice Cairns observed:

The fact that ... a co-accused, gave evidence under the
protection of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10, before
being sentenced, but after pleading guilty, does not render the conviction bad.
We agree that it is not a practice that should be followed but should be
discouraged, but provided the tribunal, if a jury, is warned of the dangers of
this, or a Judge sitting alone realizes them, as he did in this case where he
warned himself specifically of the dangers of accepting this evidence, it is
not fatal to the conviction.

Of even greater significance is the judgment of the Court Martial
Appeal Court of Canada in R. v. Williams[21], a
case in which leave to appeal to this Court was refused last December. In
that case, McIntyre J., speaking for the majority of the Court, cited the
last-quoted passage from Mr. Justice Cairns' judgment and endorsed it in the
clearest terms saying: ""I accept this as a correct statement of the
law"". McIntyre J., had already stated that, at p. 11:

While the practice of calling an accomplice against whom
unresolved legal proceedings are outstanding is to be frowned upon and even
condemned involving as it does grave dangers in that a witness may be provided
with a strong motive to colour his evidence or give false evidence I cannot say
that such evidence is inadmissible nor that its reception will void a
conviction. The effect of the Canadian decisions is to indicate that while such
a step may affect the weight of evidence offered in this fashion it does not go
to the question of admissibility.

In the same case, Mr. Justice Cattanach, speak­ing for himself,
pointed out that Parker L.C.J. had stated in the Pipe case that an accomplice
who admitted his guilt and testified under promise of immunity was nevertheless
""a competent witness"". As I have indicated, I think it must be
accepted that Herrmann was a competent witness and that his evidence was
admissible. The only remaining ground for the learned trial judge disregarding
it must therefore be based on his view as to the

[Page 1087]

credibility of the witness, and, as I have said, in my opinion
that was a matter for the jury or for the trial judge sitting alone if there
were no jury.

In endorsing the opinion of the extradition judge, Chief Justice
Jackett rendered the judg­ment of the Court of Appeal, saying, in part:

I agree with the extradition judge that one type of case
where an extradition judge should refuse to grant such a warrant is where a
trial judge would feel obliged to direct a jury to bring in a verdict of
acquittal and I agree, also, that 'where the Crown's evidence is so manifestly
unreliable or of so doubtful or tainted a nature as to make it dangerous or
unjust to put the accused to his defence on the basis thereof' is such a case.
I do not accept the submission that the latter proposition is restricted to a
case of circumstantial evidence.

... I am also of opinion that there is no fair distinc­tion
in principle between this case and Puerto Rico v. Hernandez; but I must
not be taken as expressing any general opinion or enunciating any new principle
con­cerning affidavits such as the one that was under con­sideration by the
extradition judge.

With the greatest respect I cannot accept the proposition that a
trial judge is ever entitled to take a case from the jury and direct an
acquittal on the ground that, in his opinion, the evidence is
""manifestly unreliable"". If this were the law it would deprive the
members of the jury of their function to act as the sole judges of the truth or
falsity of the evidence and would thus, in my opinion, be contrary to the
accepted role of the jury in our legal system.

I also differ from the learned Chief Justice of the Federal Court
in that I consider there to be a clear distinction in principle between this
case and that of Hernandez. In the latter case Mr. Justice Thurlow
characterized the evidence which the extradition judge had found to be
insufficient to justify the issuing of a warrant for extradition, in the
following paragraph:

After having read and re-read the evidence of the witnesses,
Atilano and Ortiz and after hearing the very able argument of counsel for the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico I am not persuaded that the evidence was

[Page 1088]

reasonably sufficient to warrant putting the respondent on
trial. Indeed, I find it inconceivable that a person should be put on trial on
such flimsy evidence as a purported identification made a year after the event
by a person who did not previously know the accused and whose only opportunity
to observe him was a fleeting one from a distance of some sixty feet, if indeed
he ever got that close. The evidence of the witness having selected the
respondent's identification card is not in itself evidence implicating the
respondent, and in the circum­stances as described it tends to weaken rather
than strengthen the identification made by Atilano at the hearing ... Nor was
there anything else to implicate the respondent or corroborate such identification.

It thus appears to me clear that in that case it was held that
there was not enough evidence to support a prima facie case
against the accused and in fact that it was ""inconceivable that a person
should be put on trial on such flimsy evidence"". It was upon this ground
that the extradition judge in that case based his opinion as to insufficiency.
In the present case, on the other hand, there was overwhelming evidence in the
Herrmann affidavit to support the charge of conspiracy in the ""distri­bution,
dispensation and possession with intent to distribute of heroin"" and
""cocaine"" contrary to the laws of the United States, so that the
extradition judge's failure to issue an extradition warrant can have had
nothing to do with the lack of enough evidence and must have been based
entirely on his finding that any evidence given by a witness testi­fying under
the inducements held out to Herrmann was ""tainted beyond redemption""
and could not in a legal sense be weighed by the jury at all. Such a finding
overlooks the well-settled rule that the weighing of evidence is always a
matter for the jury under proper instructions from the judge, and it forms no
part of the function of a ""justice"" acting under s. 475  of the Criminal
Code  or that of an extradition judge in exercising his powers under The
Extradition Act .

Having regard to all the above, it will be seen that I am of
opinion that the extradition judge erred in principle in the manner in which he
purported to exercise the discretion entrusted to him under sections 10(1)  and
18(1) (b) of The Extradition Act . I would accordingly allow this appeal
and order that the decision of the Federal

[Page 1089]

Court of Appeal, as well as that of the extradition commissioner,
be quashed and that the case be referred back to the extradition commissioner
for a new consideration of the evidence in the light of the above.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Defence of insanity on charges
of non-capital murder—Person insane under Criminal Code  provision if suffering
from disease of the mind rendering him incapable of knowing act is
wrong—Interpretation of the word “wrong”—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34,
s. 16(2)—Applicability of s. 613(1)(b)(iii).

On charges of non-capital murder, the
appellant was convicted in a trial by judge and jury and his conviction was affirmed
by the British Columbia Court of Appeal. Apart from the general issue, the
appellant’s main defence was insanity at the time of the alleged offences.
Leave to appeal to this Court was granted in respect of the following question
of law: Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that there had been no error in
law in the direction given to the jury as to the meaning of the word “wrong”,
as used in s. 16(2)  of the Criminal Code , in defining insanity? In
his charge to the jury the trial judge said that the defence of insanity rested
inter alia on the accused’s incapacity to know that his actions were
wrong and that “wrong” meant “forbidden by law”.

The appellant’s submission was that the word
“wrong” as used in s. 16(2)  means contrary to the ordinary standard of
reasonable men. It was argued that, even if an accused person, relying upon the
defence of insanity, knew that his act was legally wrong, he would still be
within the definition of insanity if he believed his action to be right
according to the ordinary standard of reasonable men.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be
dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon and de Grandpré JJ.: There was no evidence relating to
the issue as to whether, at the time the offences were committed, the

[Page 674]

appellant, owing to disease of the mind,
though appreciating the nature and quality of his acts, did not know that what
he was doing was morally, or legally, wrong. There was no evidence to meet the
onus imposed on the appellant by s. 16(4) to establish his insanity within
the latter part of the definition in s. 16(2)  no matter how the word
“wrong” be interpreted. This being so, the portion of the charge to which
objection is taken was irrelevant, and, therefore, even if it were erroneous,
this would be a case in which the provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
should be applied.

However, the judge’s charge upon the meaning
of the word “wrong” in s. 16(2)  was not erroneous. Section 16(2)  only
becomes operative if, previously, it has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt
that the accused person has committed a crime; i.e., has been guilty of
some criminal act with the requisite criminal intent. It is at that point that
he may seek the protection against conviction afforded by s. 16(1) on the
ground that the offence was committed while he was insane. But mere proof of
insanity alone is not enough. He is only to be considered insane for the
purpose of that subsection if he has a disease of the mind to an extent
that renders him incapable of: (a) appreciating the nature and quality of his
act; or (b) knowing that such act was wrong. The words “nature and quality”
deal with the physical character of the act. If, therefore, a person who has
committed a crime did not, by reason of disease of the mind, know what he was
doing, he is not to be convicted, because it really was not his act. The second
and alternative portion of the definition deals not with the criminal act, but
with the criminal intent. Although he has committed a crime, and understood
what he was doing, the accused is still protected from conviction if, because
of mental disease, he did not know that by his act he was committing a crime.
The test as to whether the accused knew that his act was wrong according to the
ordinary principles of resonable men does not really differ from the test as to
whether he knew he was committing a crime. Surely, according to the ordinary
principles of reasonable men, it is wrong to commit a crime. This must be so in
relation to the crime of murder. If there is a difference between these tests,
and it could be contended that the commission of a particular crime, though
known to be illegal, was considered to be morally justifiable in the opinion of
ordinary men, there is no reason why a person who committed a crime in such
circumstances should be protected from conviction if suffering from disease of
the mind, and not protected if he committed the crime when sane.

[Page 675]

The test provided in s. 16(2)  is not as
to whether the accused, by reason of mental disease, could or could not calmly
consider whether or not the crime which he committed was morally wrong. He is
not to be considered as insane within s. 16(2)  if he knew what he was
doing and also knew that he was committing a criminal act.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz JJ., dissenting: It is the thinking
process of the accused, as opposed to his actual knowledge of wrongness, that
should be the focus of inquiry in the defence of insanity. The question is not
whether the accused knew that the act was wrong but whether he was capable of
knowing it was wrong. Was he capable of comprehending that which militated to
make the act wrong? In applying s. 16(2) , one must delve into the thought
process of the accused, coherence, logic, rationality, rather than merely his
knowledge of the wrongness of the particular act. Has disease of the mind so
affected the capacity of the accused to make a moral choice that he is unable
to discern between what is right and what is wrong? Attention must then be
directed to the last word of s. 16(2) , the word “wrong”. The inquiry must
be as to whether Parliament intended the word to be construed in what one might
call the popular sense of “wrong” or in the sense of “contrary to law” or
“illegal”.

Accepted legal authorities respecting
statutory construction confirm the validity of construing one part of a statute
by reference to another part of the same statute. If Parliament had intended
“wrong” to mean “contrary to law”, one might expect use of the word “unlawful”,
which is used in other sections of the Code. In s. 13, which
deals with the criminal responsibility of children, one finds a provision the
structure of which parallels s. 16(2) . The effect of s. 13 is to
relieve certain children of criminal responsibility because they, like the
insane, do not have the capacity to comprehend the moral implications of their
harmful acts.

The M’Naghten formulation focuses only
on the cognitive element of the personality, i.e., the ability to know
right from wrong. The question is “Did the accused know it was wrong?” One is
confined to the choice of legal wrong or moral wrong. Section 16(2) , however,
does not speak in simplistic terms based solely upon a person’s ability to know
right from wrong. It speaks of “capacity” and the question then is “Was he
capable of knowing that it was wrong?” Section 16(2)  must be read in toto. One
looks at capacity to reason and to reach rational decisions as to whether the
act is morally wrong. If wrong simply means “illegal” this virtually

[Page 676]

forecloses any inquiry as to capacity. The
question for the jury is whether mental illness so obstructed the thought
processes of the accused as to make him incapable of knowing that his acts were
morally wrong.

APPEAL, with leave, from a unanimous judgment
of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1],
dismissing the appellant’s appeal from his conviction for the non-capital
murder of two persons. Appeal dismissed, Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson and
Beetz JJ. dissenting.

J.B. Clarke, for the appellant.

G.S. Cumming, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson
and Beetz JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J. (dissenting)—This is a
non-capital murder case in which a rather narrow point of interpretation
arises. The appellant was indicted for the murders of Barbara Jean Blum and
Edward Julius Mernickle on January 7, 1973. He was convicted in a trial by
judge and jury on November 1, 1973 and his conviction was affirmed by the British Columbia Court of
Appeal. Leave to appeal to this Court was granted June 26, 1975. Apart from the
general issue, the appellant’s main defence was insanity at the time of the
alleged offences. Evidence was led by the Crown including

[Page 677]

psychiatric evidence and police testimony of the
violent and frenzied state of the accused on the night of the arrest. In his
charge to the jury, Hinkson J. said that the defence of insanity rested inter
alia on the accused’s incapacity to know that his actions were wrong and
that “wrong” meant “forbidden by law”.

There is no occasion to review the evidence.
Counsel for the appellant advised the Court that he had prepared his factum and
would present oral argument relying upon the concession made by counsel for the
Crown that the accused was entitled to a new trial if this Court should hold
there was error in charging the jury on the basis that “wrong” meant “contrary
to law.” Counsel for the Crown confirmed he had made such concession.

As the consequence of a successful insanity
defence is not freedom but an indeterminate detention in a mental hospital,
this defence is unlikely to be raised if any less threatening alternative is
available. Thus the defence is raised infrequently and usually when the death
sentence or life imprisonment is in the offing. The infrequency of the defence
does not, however, serve to diminish the importance of mental disorder as it
affects criminal responsibility.

The word “wrong” is ambiguous. It may mean
either “illegal” or “morally wrong”. The extended debate over whether “wrong”
means legally or morally wrong has given rise to two conflicting lines of
authority. The present English authorities, at odds with many earlier cases,
hold the view that wrong means contrary to law. Australian, and a number of
American cases, hold the opposite view. Canadian cases go in both directions: R.
v. Riel

[Page 678]

(No. 2)[2]; R. v. Cardinal[3]; R. v. Jessamine[4]; R. v. Mathews[5]; R. v. Cracknell[6]; R. v. Harrop[7]; R. v. O.[8]

Just as there is a lack of unanimity on the
meaning to be ascribed to the word “wrong”, so is there variance of opinion on
whether the insanity defence is extended or narrowed by departing from the view
that “wrong” means contrary to law. In most cases, it will make little
difference, for in serious crime the legal standard and society’s moral
judgment are not likely to differ. It would be a rare occasion on which an
accused would consider that, in killing, his act was legally wrong but right according
to the ordinary standards of reasonable men. “Moral wrong” is not to be judged
by the personal standards of the offender but by his awareness that society
regards the act as wrong. Society’s moral judgment may well be identical with
the legal standard, but such is not inevitably the case. An offender may know
that it is legally wrong to kill but do so in the belief that it is in response
to a divine order and therefore not morally wrong. The legal and the moral do
not always coincide.

The law of insanity, as it relates to criminal
responsibility at the time of committing an offence, is derived from rules laid
down by the English judges in 1843 following the acquittal, on the grounds of
insanity, of one M’Naghten, charged with murdering the Secretary to Sir Robert
Peel (M’Naghten’s Case[9]). Although
our law is now statutory it rests heavily upon what has come to be referred to
as the M’Naghten rules. The M’Naghten rules speak of not knowing
“he was doing what was wrong”; our Criminal Code  s. 16(2)  speaks of
being incapable of “knowing that

[Page 679]

an act or omission is wrong.” The concern then
is with the interpretation to be given to s. 16(2)  of the Criminal Code 
and specifically the meaning of “wrong” therein. Section 16(1)  provides
that no person shall be convicted of an offence in respect to an act or
omission on his part while he was insane. Section 16(2)  then goes on to say:

(2) For the purposes of this section a
person is insane when he is in a state of natural imbecility or has disease of
the mind to an extent that renders him incapable of appreciating the nature and
quality of an act or omission or of knowing that an act or omission is wrong.

Although our immediate concern is with the word
wrong, the wording of s. 16(2)  makes it clear that the section is
primarily concerned with mental disease and incapacity resulting therefrom. It
is the thinking process of the accused, as opposed to his actual knowledge of
wrongness, that should be the focus of inquiry in the defence of insanity. The
question is not whether the accused knew that the act was wrong but whether he
was capable of knowing it was wrong. Was he capable of comprehending that which
militated to make the act wrong? Mr. Justice Stephen in History of the
Criminal Law of England, vol. 2 (1883) at p. 163 poses this question:
“Was he deprived by disease affecting the mind of the power of passing a
rational judgment on the moral character of the act which he meant to do?” In
applying s. 16(2) , one must delve into the thought process of the accused,
coherence, logic, rationality, rather than merely his knowledge of the
wrongness of the particular act. Has disease of the mind so affected the
capacity of the accused to make a moral choice that he is unable to discern
between what is right and what is wrong? Attention must then be directed to the
last word of s. 16(2) , the word “wrong”. The inquiry must be as to whether
Parliament intended the word to be construed in what one might call the popular
sense of “wrong” or in the sense of “contrary to law” or “illegal”. Is there
any compelling reason for giving the word “wrong” other than the common and
ordinary meaning of the word?

[Page 680]

Before considering the authorities it would be
well, I think, to have regard to the internal structure of the Criminal
Code . Accepted legal authorities respecting statutory construction confirm
the validity of construing one part of a statute by reference to another part
of the same statute. If Parliament had intended “wrong” to mean “contrary to
law”, one might expect use of the word “unlawful”, which is used in
sections of the Code dealing with assembly (s. 64 ), riots (s. 65 ),
drilling (s. 71 ), and solemnization of marriage (s. 258 ) or, possibly the word
“illegal”, which is used in s. 215(4) of the Code dealing with
arrests.

The French version of s. 16(2)  uses the
word “mauvais” for the word “wrong” appearing in the English version. Harrap’s
New Shorter French and English Dictionary contains a rather lengthy
definition of “mauvais” which commences with “evil, ill (thought, omen, etc.);
bad, wicked (person)” and continues through many uses of the word, none of
which suggest the sense of “contrary to law”.

If one turns then to s. 13 of the Code dealing
with the criminal responsibility of children between the ages of seven years
and 13 years, one finds a provision the structure of which parallels
s. 16(2) . It reads:

13. No
person shall be convicted of an offence in respect of an act or omission on his
part while he was seven years of age or more, but under the age of fourteen
years, unless he was competent to know the nature and consequences of his
conduct and to appreciate that it was wrong.

A child of seven years of age might know the
difference between “right” and “wrong” in a moral sense but it seems highly
unlikely that a child of tender years would think in terms of “contrary to
law”. The effect of s. 13 is to relieve certain children of criminal
responsibility because they, like the insane, do not have the capacity to
comprehend the moral implications of their harmful acts. Anthony Platt and
Bernard L. Diamond, in a scholarly and helpful article entitled, “The Origins
of the ‘Right and Wrong’ Test of Criminal Responsibility and Its Subsequent
Development in

[Page 681]

the United States: An Historical Survey”,
(1966), 54 Calif. L. Rev. 1227, observe that the criminal law generally
perceived the insane person as resembling a young child in terms of his moral
development and cognitive abilities and that as long ago as the year 1581, an
Elizabethan writer, Lambard, wrote (p. 1234):

“If a mad man or a naturall foole, or a
lunatike in the time of his lunacie, or a childe y apparantly hath no
knowledge of good nor evil, do kil a ma, this is no felonious acte, nor any
thing forfeited by it… for they cannot be said to have any understanding wil.”

(Emphasis added.)

In 1728 Wood, An Institute of the Laws of
England, wrote, p. 339:

“But those that are to be esteemed guilty
of any offences must have the use of their reason, and be at their own disposal
or liberty. For those that want reason to distinguish betwixt good and evil (as
infants under the age of discretion (viz.), under the age of fourteen years,
ideots, lunaticks etc.) ought not to be prosecuted for any crime.”

Four years earlier, in R. v. Arnold[10], at p. 765, the jury was instructed
that the defendant was not to be held insane if he “was able to distinguish
whether he was doing good or evil”. The authors of the article to which I have
referred, after citing R. v. Arnold, continue (p. 1236):

The same test was used in Rex v. Ferrer (1760),
Parker’s Case (1812), Bellingham’s Case (1812), Rex v. Bowler (1812),
Martins Case (1829), Offord’s Case (1831), and Oxford’s Case (1840).
The “good and evil” test was momentarily abandoned in Hadfïeld’s Case (1800)
as a result of the brilliance and oratory of the defense counsel, Thomas
Erskine, but this decision had no lasting effect on the rules of criminal
responsibility for the insane. By the time M’Naghten was tried for the murder
of Edward Drummond in 1843, the earlier test of responsibility had been
re-established.

[Page 682]

In Bellingham’s Case[11], a murder case, Sir James Mansfield
C.J. instructed the jury that “the single question was, whether, at the time
this act was committed, (the defendant) …possessed a sufficient understanding to
distinguish good from evil, right from wrong”. The interrelationship of the
rules affecting criminal responsibility of children and of insane persons, the
historical development of the “right and wrong” test, and the M’Naghten Rules
are canvassed in detail by the authors who conclude their article with these
two paragraphs (p. 1258):

The evolution of the “right and wrong” test
of criminal responsibility can be traced from Hebrew law, Greek moral
philosophy, Roman law, the literature of the Church in the Middle Ages, and
English common law to its final elaboration in American case law. There is
substantial evidence to suggest that the role of the child, as a prospective
member of adult society, was an expedient and ideologically meaningful
reference for rules of criminal responsibility for the insane criminal
offender. The “right and wrong” test was used in England to determine the
criminal capacity of children as early as the fourteenth century and of the
insane probably by the seventeenth century. It has been used widely in the
United States for both children and the insane since 1800.

It is clear that the “right and wrong” test
of criminal responsibility did not arise in 1843, either in England or in the
United States. The “knowledge of right and wrong” test, in the form of its
earlier synonym (“knowledge of good and evil”), is traceable to the Book of
Genesis. The famous M’Naghten trial of 1843 and the subsequent opinion of
the judges provided only the name, “M’Naghten Rule.” The essential concept and
phraseology of the rule were already ancient and thoroughly embedded in the
law.

Goldstein, The Insanity Defence (1967),
writes to the same effect (p. 10):

By the end of the eighteenth century, the
insane were viewed by the criminal law much as they are today. The formula then
prevalent described them as persons who lacked the capacity to choose between
good and evil.

[Page 683]

It was within this background that the judges in
M’Naghten’s Case gave answer to the prolix questions which were asked as
to the extent to which a person accused of crime would be relieved of criminal
responsibility by virtue of mental disease, and the answer was, in substance,
that he is accountable if he knew what he was doing when he committed the
crime. The language of M’Naghten tells jurors (p. 210 (Cl. & F.);
p. 722 (E.R.)):

…that every man is to be presumed to be
sane, and… that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be
clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party
accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind,
as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did
know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.

M’Naghten emphasizes
knowledge, exempting from criminal consequences those suffering from serious
cognitive impairment as a result of disease of the mind. The M’Naghten judges
said that a person is punishable “if he knew at the time of committing such
crime that he was acting contrary to law; by which expression we understand
Your Lordships to mean the law of the land.” (p. 210 (Cl. & F.);
p. 722 (E.R.)).

If the judges had stopped there, we would at
least know their attitude to the question whether “wrong” meant moral or legal
wrong. The second paragraph in the opinion reads, however (p. 10 (Cl.
& F.); p. 723 (E.R.)):

If the question were to be put as to the
knowledge of the accused solely and exclusively with reference to the law of
the land, it might tend to confound the jury, by inducing them to believe that
an actual knowledge of the law of the land was essential in order to lead to a
conviction; whereas the law is administered on the principle that every one
must be taken conclusively to know it, without proof that he does know it. If
the accused was conscious that the act was at the same time contrary to the law
of the land, he is punishable…

The concluding sentence draws a clear
distinction between (i) knowledge that the act was contrary to the law of the
land and (ii) knowledge that the act was one which the accused knew he ought
not to do.

[Page 684]

The leading authorities cited in support of the
position that “wrong” means “wrong in law” are R. v. Codere[12] and R. v. Windle[13] which purported to follow Codere’s case.
In Codere, a young Canadian officer committed a brutal and senseless
murder, the plans for which he had openly discussed with other soldiers. It was
conceded by counsel for the accused that Codere must have known that the act he
committed was punishable by law, but it was contended that that in itself was
not enough to show that he was not insane. Codere, it was argued, should be
judged “by the standard which he believes is that of the majority of reasonable
men …it would probably be sufficient to render him punishable if he knew …that
the act would be condemned and regarded as wrong by his fellow-creatures.” Lord
Reading, in dismissing the application for leave to appeal, stated that “the
standard to be applied is whether according to the ordinary standard adopted by
reasonable men the act was right or wrong.” These words seem to leave no room
for doubt that, in the opinion of Lord Reading as so expressed, “wrong” meant
wrong according to generally accepted societal standards and not wrong
according to law. He observed however, without elaborating, that “the question
of the distinction between morally and legally wrong opens wide doors” and went
on to say (p. 27):

In a case of this kind, namely, killing, it
does not seem debateable [sic] that the appellant could have thought that the
act was not morally wrong, judged by the ordinary standards, when the act is
punishable by law, and is known by him to be punishable by law.

In the cited passage, his Lordship used the
words “in a case of this kind” and in a later passage prefaced his remarks with
“in this case”, viz. (pp. 27-28):

…in this case there can be no room for
doubt; once it is clear that the appellant knew that the act was wrong in law,
then he was doing an act which he was conscious he ought not to do, and as it
was against the law, it was punishable by law.

[Page 685]

The judgment might be said to lack something in
clarity. If his Lordship is saying that on the facts of the particular case
before him there was no distinction possible between morally wrong and legally
wrong, then the judgment is understandable. If some broader enunciation of the
law was intended, then difficulties appear. One is told that the standard to be
applied is whether according to the ordinary standard adopted by reasonable men
the act was right or wrong and that the distinction between morally wrong and
legally wrong opens wide doors. These statements acknowledge that “wrong” in
the M’Naghten rules can mean more than “contrary to law.” In the other
passages cited, his Lordship holds that if Codere knew his act was wrong in law
then he was doing an act which he was conscious he ought not to do. This would
seem to equate legally wrong with morally wrong, which is not readily
reconciled with the reference to wide doors. If it were intended to convey that
the greater will always embrace the lesser, and knowledge of legal wrong will
always connote knowledge of moral wrong, then, with the greatest respect, I
would disagree. As I have earlier indicated, such will usually be true but it
is not difficult to envisage a child or an insane person who, by reason of
infancy or disease of the mind, is without knowledge of law and legal
proscriptions but is aware that killing is morally wrong “according to ordinary
accepted standards of reasonable men.”

In R. v. Windle, supra, the accused was
charged with poisoning his wife with an overdose of aspirin. The medical
evidence on behalf of the accused was slight. The accused had told the police
that he supposed he would be hanged for his act. He was therefore aware that
his act was contrary to law. The trial judge, Devlin J., withdrew the issue of
insanity from the jury. On the appeal, counsel took the point that the mere
fact that the accused knew that what he was doing was forbidden by law was not
conclusive on the issue of insanity. Counsel contented, relying upon Lord
Reading’s statement in Codere that “wrong” meant “morally wrong
according to the ordinary accepted standards of reasonable men.” The appeal was
dismissed. It was

[Page 686]

held that knowledge of illegality concluded the
matter. Lord Goddard went beyond what was required for the purposes of the
judgment in stating that (p. 3):

…there is no doubt that the word “wrong” in
the M’Naghten rules means contrary to law and does not have some vague meaning
which may vary according to the opinion of different persons whether a
particular act might or might not be justified.

and at p. 2:

Courts of law, however, can only
distinguish between that which is in accordance with law and that which is
contrary to law. …The test must be whether an act is contrary to law.

With the greatest respect for those of contrary
view, I do not think that Windle’s case should be taken as authority for
several reasons. The remarks of Lord Goddard were obiter: they seem to
me, with deference, to proceed from a misreading of the M’Naghten rules
and they entirely ignore the great body of earlier law which the High Court of
Australia examined in rejecting Windle in Stapleton v. The Queen[14]. The law in 1843 dealt with
insanity in terms of “rightness” and “wrongness” and good and evil. As Cardozo,
J. stated in People v. Schmidt[15], at
p. 334:

There is nothing to justify the belief that
the words right and wrong, when they became limited by M’Naghten’s case
to the right and wrong of the particular act, cast off their meaning as terms of
morals, and became terms of pure legality.

This conclusion is approved by N. Morris in
“‘Wrong’ in the M’Naghten Rules”, (1953), 16 Mod. L. Rev. at p. 436. See
also J.L. Montrose in (1954), 17 Mod. L. Rev. 383.

With the utmost respect, I have come to the conclusion,
as did the High Court of Australia, that Windle was wrongly decided. The
English law antedating Windle would suggest that if an accused believes
his act to be right according to the ordinary standards of reasonable men he is
entitled to be acquitted, even though he knew it to

[Page 687]

be legally wrong. As stated in Glanville
Williams, Criminal Law, 2d ed., p. 492: “The earlier authorities
had gone on moral wrong.”

It is, I think, of utmost importance, as I have
earlier indicated, to observe that the M’Naghten formulation focuses
only on the cognitive element of the personality, i.e., the ability to
know right from wrong. The question is “Did the accused know it was wrong?” One
is confined to the choice of legal wrong or moral wrong. Section 16(2) of our Criminal
Code , however, does not speak in simplistic terms based solely upon a
person’s ability to know right from wrong. It speaks of “capacity” and the
question then is “Was he capable of knowing that it was wrong?” It was the
opinion of Stephens J. that a man cannot be said to know an act is wrong if
through mental disorder he cannot think rationally of the reasons that to the
sane person make the act wrong. This view was adopted by the High Court of
Australia in Stapleton, supra, at p. 367, adopting as a correct
statement of the law the following passage from Dixon J.’s jury charge in R.
v. Porter[16], at
pp. 189-90:

“The question is whether he was able to
appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular
time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if
through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind he could not think
rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or
wrong? If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason
about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said
that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong.”

The same conclusion was reached by The Supreme
Court of Ireland in Doyle v. Council of the County of Wicklow[17]. Strong and reasoned support for
such approach will be found in Pope’s Law & Practice of Lunacy, 2d
ed., (1890), p. 385:

[Page 688]

Accordingly, in a reasonable system of law,
that person only will be criminally responsible who, at the moment of
committing a criminal act, is capable of remembering that the act is wrong,
contrary to duty, and such as in any well-ordered society would subject the
offender to punishment.

It is by a reference, such as this, to
principles of general morality rather than to the enactments of positive law
that the courts of this country have been content to test criminal
responsibility in individual cases. That ignorance of the positive law cannot
be pleaded as an excuse for crime, is a maxim necessary to the safety of
society, and sufficiently near the truth for practical purpose. It would,
therefore, be misleading to raise the issue of capacity or incapacity to know
that a particular act is contrary to the law of the land. But a judge may,
without fear of misleading, direct the jury that the accused is not responsible
for his criminal acts if he has not the mental capacity to know that the
particular act is wrong, or, in other words, if he cannot distinguish between
right and wrong in regard to the particular act; and this is accordingly the
form commonly adopted in practice.

The Stapleton formulation would properly
exempt a mother who, though aware that killing is contrary to the law of the
land, in religious ecstasy kills her child in the insane belief the voice of
God has called upon her to offer a sacrifice and atonement; or a man like
Hadfield (Hadfield’s Trial[18]) who
suffered from the delusion that the world was coming to an end and that he had
been commissioned by God to save mankind by the sacrifice of himself. He knew
the act of killing was contrary to law, indeed that he could be hanged for it.
He therefore decided in response to his delusion to shoot the King in order to
be hanged. Knowledge of the illegality of his act was the reason for doing it.
In R. v. Davis[19], a
very mild, peaceable man, on friendly terms with his sister-in-law, attempted
to cut her throat with a knife, later explaining to the police, “The
man-in-the-moon told me to do it. I will have to commit murder, as I must be
hanged.”

The distinction between the statute law of
Canada and the common law of England appears in the following passage from the Report
of the

[Page 689]

Royal Commission on the Law of Insanity as a
Defence in Criminal Cases (1956), (The McRuer
Report), p. 13:

The word “wrong” as used in section 16 
of the Criminal Code  has not yet been interpreted by the Supreme Court of
Canada. The Ontario Court of Appeal ordered a new trial where the court was of
the opinion that no reasonable jury could find that the accused was by reason
of disease of the mind incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of the
act and on the evidence has admitted that he knew the act was against the law
but the court was of the view that the evidence of the psychiatrist, which
tended to show that, although the accused knew the act was against the law,
nevertheless by reason of disease of the mind he believed it was the right
thing to do, was not properly put before the jury (R. v. Laycock, 104 Can. C.C.
274). The Alberta Court of Appeal would appear to restrict the word “wrong” to
legally wrong, but it is clear from the judgment that it did not consider the
effect of the statute law of Canada but was considering only the common law of
England and applying the English law (R. v. Cardinal, (1953) 10 W.W.R. N.S.
403).

The Report also contains the following passage,
p. 13:

Applying the provisions of the
Interpretation Act, the word “wrong” must be given a broad meaning. We think it
means wrong not only in the legal sense but something that would be condemned
in the eyes of mankind.

Section 16(2)  must be read in toto. One
looks at capacity to reason and to reach rational decisions as to whether the
act is morally wrong. If wrong simply means “illegal” this virtually forecloses
any inquiry as to capacity. The question for the jury is whether mental illness
so obstructed the thought processes of the accused as to make him incapable of
knowing that his acts were morally wrong. The argument is sometimes advanced
that a moral test favours the amoral offender and that the most favoured will
be he who had rid himself of all moral compunction. This argument overlooks the
factor of disease of the mind. If, as a result of disease of the mind, the
offender has lost completely the ability to make moral distinctions and acts
under an insane delusion, it can well be said that he should not be criminally
accountable. Cardozo J. in People v. Schmidt, supra, dealt with the

[Page 690]

problem of those who know an act is illegal and
yet do not find it wrong, in these words, p. 343:

It is not enough, to relieve from criminal
liability, that the prisoner is morally depraved… It is not enough that he has
views of right of wrong in variance with those that find expression in the law.
The variance must have its origin in some disease of the mind.

For the foregoing reasons, I would hold that
there was error in law in the direction given to the jury as to the meaning of
the word “wrong” as used in s. 16(2)  of the Criminal Code , in
defining insanity and accordingly allow the appeal, quash the conviction, and
direct a new trial.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Pigeon and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—This is an appeal, by leave, from
the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia which had
dismissed the appellant’s appeal from his conviction for the non-capital murder
of two persons. Leave to appeal was granted in respect of the following
question of law:

Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that
there had been no error in law in the direction given to the jury as to the
meaning of the word “wrong”, as used in s. 16 , subs. (2), of the Criminal
Code , in defining insanity?

The portions of s. 16  of the Criminal
Code  which are relevant to this appeal are as follows:

16. (1) No
person shall be convicted of an offence in respect to an act or omission on his
part while he was insane.

(2) For the purposes of this section a
person is insane when he is in a state of natural imbecility or has disease of
the mind to an extent that renders him incapable of appreciating the nature and
quality of an act or omission or of knowing that an act or omission is wrong.

[Page 691]

…

(4) Every one shall, until the contrary is
proved, be presumed to be and to have been sane.

When instructing the jury in respect of the defence
of insanity, the learned trial judge said:

Now, the test of insanity which you must
apply in this case is twofold. You first ask yourselves whether at the time of
the offence the Accused knew the nature and the quality of the acts he was
doing and if as a result of disease of the mind, he did not, that establishes
insanity for the purpose of this trial. If, however, you find that the Accused
did in fact cause the deaths of Barbara Jean Blum and Edward Julius Mernickle
by unlawful acts and that he knew the nature and quality of his acts, you must
then go further and you must decide whether he knew what he was doing was
wrong; and, if you find that as a result of a disease of the mind he did not
know he was doing wrong, then that establishes insanity.

When I use the word “wrong” that means
wrong according to law, wrong in the sense the act was forbidden by law.

It is the contention of the appellant that the
learned trial judge was in error in saying that “wrong” means wrong according
to law, wrong in the sense that the act was forbidden by law. The submission is
that the word “wrong” as used in s. 16(2)  means contrary to the ordinary
standard of reasonable men. It is argued that, even if an accused person,
relying upon the defence of insanity, knew that his act was legally wrong, he
would still be within the definition of insanity if he believed his action to
be right according to the ordinary standard of reasonable men.

Although leave to appeal was granted on this
question, a consideration of the relevant testimony discloses that there was no
evidence adduced at trial which would show that if the appellant was capable of
appreciating the nature and quality of his acts he nonetheless had a disease of
the mind to an extent which rendered him incapable of knowing that his acts
were wrong, whether that word be construed as meaning contrary to law, or as
meaning contrary to the ordinary standards of reasonable men.

[Page 692]

It is clear from the learned trial judge’s
address to the jury that the only contention made by counsel for the appellant
was as to whether the appellant was capable of appreciating the nature and
quality of his acts. After summarizing the submissions of defence counsel that
on the evidence the jury should not be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
the accused was the killer, he went on to say:

If you do reach that conclusion, then
Defence counsel submitted on the evidence you should conclude the Accused was
suffering from a disease of the mind at the time and as a result did not
appreciate the nature and consequences of his acts.

Consider the evidence of Dr. Klassen
and Dr. Borschneck. They saw him shortly after he was apprehended. They
examined him. He was not reacting to external stimuli. He appeared to be
disoriented. They both concluded he was suffering from psychosis, that he had a
disease of the mind, as a result of which he was not aware of the nature and
consequences of his acts.

The appellant did not give evidence at the
trial, and no medical witnesses were called on behalf of the defence. On the
issue of insanity the appellant relied upon the evidence of two general
practitioners called by the Crown. They had attended at the city gaol at the
request of the police shortly after the appellant had been arrested because of
the appellant’s condition and conduct at that time.

The first of these, Dr. Borschneck, said,
in direct examination, after describing his observation of the appellant and
his conduct:

My, I felt that this patient was suffering
from a severe form of mental illness. I believe that he was psychotic and,
however, the basis of the psychosis I couldn’t determine at that time. I felt
that the psychosis could be caused by possibly a chemical, some drug or just a
severe psychotic breakdown of fairly recent onset.

Q. You’ve, Doctor, you’ve used the word
“psychosis” and “psychotic breakdown”, could you define these two terms?

[Page 693]

A. A patient with psychosis, that is who is
psychotic, is one who has lost touch with reality. He has no, he may, he may be
disorientated as to time, place, person and, and he may be suffering from a
large spectrum of different types of delusions.

Q. From your observations, did you form any
opinion as to what, as to the onset of this psychosis as you called it?

A. I felt, having examined the man at this
point, that it was of recent onset.

Q. And having formed this conclusion what
did you do?

A. I signed a committal form.

On cross-examination he was asked the following
questions and gave the following answers:

Q. Yes, and would you also say, Doctor, a person
who was completely psychotic would be a person who would be incapable of
appreciating the nature and quality of—of his surroundings?

A. Would you repeat that?

Q. All right. Would you say that a person
who was completely psychotic would be a person who would be incapable—being out
of touch with reality, being a person who was probably disorientated as to time
and place—would he be a person who would be incapable of appreciating the
nature and the quality of any acts that he might perform in that condition?

A. Yes.

Q. And that again would apply to Schwartz
as you observed him at seven o’clock that evening?

A. Yes.

The second doctor, Dr. Klassen, also
observed the appellant and formed the conclusion that he was psychotic. On
cross-examination he gave the following answers to the following questions:

Q. Would it also be part of this term
psychotic—psychosis, that a person in that condition would be incapable of
appreciating the consequence of his actions?

A. Yes, that’s true.

Q. I see, and I believe that the diagnosis
which you made in this particular case was that Mr. Schwartz was
completely psychotic, would that not be correct?

A. Yes, that’s what I stated.

[Page 694]

The Crown called two expert witnesses, both
practising psychiatrists. Dr. Choi had the appellant as his patient for
two months following his committal to hospital. His opinion, based primarily
upon his own observations, was that the appellant was suffering from psycho‑neurosis,
which is not considered as psychotic and is not considered as a disease of the
mind, but is transient. This opinion was supported by Dr. Whitman.

In the result, the jury had before it the expert
evidence of two psychiatrists, one of whom had observed the appellant over a
period of two months, whose opinion was that the appellant did not have a
disease of the mind, and that of two general practitioners based upon what they
observed shortly after the appellant’s arrest, and, thus, shortly after he had
committed two murders, that he was psychotic and therefore would not appreciate
the nature and quality of his acts. The jury was properly told by the trial
judge that if, as a result of disease of the mind, the appellant, at the time
he committed the offences, did not know the nature and quality of the acts he
was doing, that would establish insanity for the purpose of the trial. The
jury’s verdict establishes that it did not accept the opinion of the general
practitioners as against that of the psychiatrists.

There is no evidence in the case which relates
to the issue as to whether, at the time the offences were committed, the
appellant, owing to disease of the mind, though appreciating the nature and
quality of his acts, did not know that what he was doing was morally, or
legally, wrong. That issue never arose on the facts of this case. There was no
evidence to meet the onus imposed on the appellant by s. 16(4) to
establish his insanity within the latter part of the definition in
s. 16(2)  no matter how the word “wrong” be interpreted. This being so, the
portion of the charge to which objection is taken was irrelevant, and,
therefore, even if it were erroneous, this would be a case in which the
provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) should be applied.

In my opinion the judge’s charge upon the
meaning of the word “wrong” in s. 16(2)  was not erroneous. I propose to
deal with this issue only

[Page 695]

because the matter was fully argued before us,
and it would be desirable that an expression of opinion on this point by this
Court should be made.

The origin of the provisions found in s. 16(2) 
of the Criminal Code  is found in the answers of the judges to the
questions of law propounded by the House of Lords following the acquittal of
Daniel M’Naghten on a charge of murder, on the ground of insanity[20]. The first three questions and answers were
as follows:

The first question proposed by your
Lordships is this: “What is the law respecting alleged crimes committed by
persons afflicted with insane delusion in respect of one or more particular
subjects or persons: as, for instance, where at the time of the commission of
the alleged crime the accused knew he was acting contrary to law, but did the
act complained of with a view, under the influence of insane delusion, of
redressing or revenging some supposed grievance or injury, or of producing some
supposed public benefit?”

In answer to which question, assuming that
your Lordships’ inquiries are confined to those persons who labour under such
partial delusions only, and are not in other respects insane, we are of opinion
that, notwithstanding the party accused did the act complained of with a view,
under the influence of insane delusion, of redressing or revenging some
supposed grievance or injury, or of producing some public benefit, he is
nevertheless punishable according to the nature of the crime committed, if he
knew at the time of committing such crime that he was acting contrary to law;
by which expression we understand your Lordships to mean the law of the land.

Your Lordships are pleased to inquire of
us, secondly, “What are the proper questions to be submitted to the jury, where
a person alleged to be afflicted with insane delusion respecting one or more
particular subjects or persons, is charged with the commission of a crime
(murder, for example), and insanity is set up as a defence?” And, thirdly, “In
what terms ought the question to be left to the jury as to the prisoner’s state
of mind at the time when the act was committed?” And as these two questions
appear to us to be more conveniently answered together, we have to submit our
opinion to be, that the jurors ought to be told in all cases that every man is
to be presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be
responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction;

[Page 696]

and that to establish a defence on the
ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the
committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of
reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the
act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what
was wrong. The mode of putting the latter part of the question to the jury on
these occasions has generally been, whether the accused at the time of doing
the act knew the difference between right and wrong: which mode, though rarely,
if ever, leading to any mistake with the jury, is not, as we conceive, so
accurate when put generally and in the abstract, as when put with refrence to
the party’s knowledge of right and wrong in respect to the very act with which
he is charged. If the question were to be put as to the knowledge of the
accused solely and exclusively with reference to the law of the land, it might
tend to confound the jury, by inducing them to believe that an actual knowledge
of the law of the land was essential in order to lead to a conviction; whereas
the law is administered upon the principle that every one must be taken
conclusively to know it, without proof that he does know it. If the accused was
conscious that the act was one which he ought not to do, and if that act was at
the same time contrary to the law of the land, he is punishable; and the usual
course therefore has been to leave the question to the jury, whether the party
accused had a sufficient degree of reason to know that he was doing an act that
was wrong: and his course we think is correct, accompanied with such
observations and explanations as the circumstances of each particular case may
require.

The application of the M’Naghten rules
was considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R. v. Codere[21]. Reading L.C.J. dealt with the
meaning of the words “nature and quality of the act” in the following passage
from his judgment, at p. 27:

The Court is of opinion that in using the
language “nature and quality” the judges were only dealing with the physical
character of the act, and were not intending to distinguish between the
physical and moral aspects of the act. That is the law as it has been laid down
by judges in many directions to juries, and as the Court understands it to be
at the present time.

With respect to the meaning of the word “wrong”
counsel for the accused contended that it was not sufficient to preclude the
defence of

[Page 697]

insanity that the accused knew that his act
would be punishable by law. He contended that “wrong” meant an act which would
be regarded as wrong by his fellow creatures. On this point, the Lord Chief
Justice, at p. 27, said this:

It was suggested at one time in the course
of the argument that the question should be judged by the standard of the
accused, but it is obvious that this proposition is wholly untenable, and would
tend to excuse crimes without number, and to weaken the law to an alarming
degree. It is conceded now that the standard to be applied is whether according
to the ordinary standard adopted by reasonable men the act was right or wrong.
There may be cases where it is difficult to decide that question, but that is
not the case here. The judges in M’Naghten’s case, in answering the
second and third questions put to them, said, “If the accused was conscious
that the act was one which he ought not to do, and if that act was at the same
time contrary to the law of the land, he is punishable; and the usual course,
therefore, has been to leave the question to the jury, whether the party
accused had a sufficient degree of reason to know that he was doing an act that
was wrong.” That is the accepted test, and applying it in this case there can
be no room for doubt; once it is clear that the appellant knew that the act was
wrong in law, then he was doing an act which he was conscious he ought not to
do, and as it was against the law, it was punishable by law; assuming,
therefore, that he knew the nature and quality of the act, he was guilty of
murder, and was properly convicted.

The difficulty no doubt arises over the
words “conscious that the act was one which he ought not to do,” but, looking
at all the answers in M’Naghten’s case, it seems that if it is
punishable by law it is an act which he ought not to do, and that is the
meaning in which the phrase is used in that case.

The meaning of the word “wrong” was considered
by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R. v. Windle[22]. In that case the accused was
charged with the murder of his wife. She was eighteen years older than he was,
appeared, on the evidence, to have been certifiable, and talked constantly
about committing suicide. The accused gave her a hundred aspirin tablets, a
fatal dose. The defence raised at trial was that of insanity. There was some

[Page 698]

evidence that the accused suffered some defect
of reason because of disease of the mind. The two doctors who testified, one
for the accused, and one for the Crown, both agreed that when he was
administering the drugs to his wife the accused knew that he was doing an act
which the law forbade. The trial judge ruled that there was no evidence of
insanity to be left to the jury.

The appeal was dismissed. Goddard L.C.J. said,
at p. 832:

As I endeavoured to point out in giving the
judgment of the court in Rex v. Rivett, 34 Cr. App. R. 87, in all
cases of this kind, the real test is responsibility. A man may be suffering
from a defect of reason, but if he knows that what he is doing is “wrong,” and
by “wrong” is meant contrary to law, he is responsible. Mr. Shawcross, in
the course of his very careful argument, suggested that the word “wrong,” as it
was used in the M’Naghten rules, did not mean contrary to law but had some kind
of qualified meaning, such as morally wrong, and that if a person was in such a
state of mind through a defect of reason that, although he knew that what he
was doing was wrong in law, he thought that it was beneficial or kind or
praiseworthy, that would excuse him.

Courts of law can only distinguish between
that which is in accordance with law and that which is contrary to law.… The
law cannot embark on the question, and it would be an unfortunate thing if it
were left to juries to consider whether some particular act was morally right
or wrong. The test must be whether it is contrary to law.

and at p. 834:

In the opinion of the court there is no
doubt that in the M’Naghten rules “wrong” means contrary to law and not “wrong”
according to the opinion of one man or of a number of people on the question
whether a parties lar act might or might not be justified.

The proposition stated in the Windle case
was reiterated in R. v. Holmes[23]. That
case was followed by the Alberta Appellate Division in R. v. Cardinal[24].

The High Court of Australia refused to follow
the Windle case in Stapleton v. The Queen[25], and

[Page 699]

held that, in applying the second branch of the
legal test of insanity, as defined in M’Naghten’s case, the question is
whether the accused knew that his act was wrong according to the ordinary
principles of reasonable men, and not whether he knew it was wrong as being
contrary to law. This view of the law, which is stated in the reasons of Dixon
C.J., for the Court, is the same as the view which he had expressed, as a trial
judge, in his charge to the jury, almost twenty years earlier, in R. v.
Porter[26]. In
the course of that charge he said, at p. 189:

The other head is of quite a different
character, namely, that his disease or disorder or disturbance of mind was of
such a character that he was unable to appreciate that the act he was doing was
wrong.… We are dealing with one particular thing, the act of killing, the act
of killing at a particular time a particular individual. We are not dealing
with right or wrong in the abstract. The question is whether he was able to
appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular
time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if
through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind he could not think
rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or
wrong? If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason
about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said
that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by
“wrong”? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday
standards of reasonable people.

McRuer C.J.H.C., in R. v. O.[27], at p. 153, instructed a jury
respecting the defence of insanity in a manner similar to the charge in the Porter
case when he said:

…if on a mere preponderance of probability,
based on the evidence taken as a whole, you come to the conclusion that the
accused was labouring under disease of the mind to such an extent that she was
incapable of knowing that the act was wrong—and by that I do not mean merely
legally wrong, but wrong in the sense that it was something that she ought not
to do and for which she would be condemned in the eyes of her right-thinking
fellow men—you should find her not guilty on account of insanity.

[Page 700]

Counsel for the appellant referred us to other
Canadian cases dealing with the defence of insanity, but none of them deals
specifically with the issue now under consideration. Some of them are reviewed
in the judgment of Branca J.A. in the Court of Appeal.

The defence of insanity was considered by this
Court in R. v. Borg[28]. That
case was not, however, concerned with the interpretation of s. 16  of the Criminal
Code , but dealt with the adequacy of the review of the defence evidence in
the charge to the jury on the question of insanity in the light of the
particular circumstances of the case.

In determining the meaning of the word “wrong”
in s. 16(2)  it is important to remember that this subsection only
becomes operative if, previously, it has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt
that the accused person has committed a crime; i.e., has been guilty of
some criminal act with the requisite criminal intent. It is at that point that
he may seek the protection against conviction afforded by s. 16(1) on the
ground that the offence was committed while he was insane. But mere proof of
insanity alone is not enough. He is only to be considered insane for the
purposes of that subsection if he has a disease of the mind to an extent
that renders him incapable of:

(a) appreciating the nature and quality of his
act; or

(b) knowing that such act was wrong.

The Codere case, in my opinion correctly,
decided that “nature and quality” dealt with the physical character of the act.
If, therefore, a person who has committed a crime did not, by reason of disease
of the mind, know what he was doing, he is not to be convicted, because it
really was not his act.

The second and alternative portion of the
definition is dealing not with the criminal act, but with the criminal intent.
Although he has committed a crime, and understood what he was doing, the
accused is still protected from conviction if,

[Page 701]

because of mental disease, he did not know that
by his act he was committing a crime.

In brief, it is my opinion that the effect of
s. 16(2)  is to provide protection to a person suffering from disease of
the mind who has committed a crime if, in committing the crime, he did not
appreciate what he was doing, or, if he did have that appreciation, he did not
know that he was committing a crime.

The test as to knowledge of “wrong” which is
stated by Dixon C.J. in the Stapleton case is as to whether the accused
knew that his act was wrong according to the ordinary principles of reasonable
men. I find it difficult to see how this test really differs from the test as
to whether he knew he was committing a crime. Surely, according to the ordinary
principles of reasonable men, it is wrong to commit a crime. This must be so in
relation to the crime of murder. If there is a difference between these tests,
and it could be contended that the commission of a particular crime, though
known to be illegal, was considered to be morally justifiable in the opinion of
ordinary men, I do not see why a person who committed a crime in such
circumstances should be protected from conviction if suffering from disease of
the mind, and not protected if he committed the crime when sane.

In Porter and in Stapleton, Dixon
C.J. went further than testing “wrong” by the application of the principles of
ordinary men, and held that, given a disease of the mind, it is enough if it so
governed the faculties at the time of the commission of the act that the
accused was incapable of reasoning with some moderate degree of calmness as to
the wrongness of the act or of comprehending the nature or significance of the
act of killing. In my opinion this is not a test of insanity contemplated by
s. 16(2) . It is, essentially, a subjective test. In my opinion the test
provided in s. 16(2)  is not as to whether the accused, by reason of mental
disease, could or could not calmly consider whether or not the crime which he
committed was morally wrong. He is not to be considered as insane within
s. 16(2)  if he knew what he was doing and also knew that he was committing
a

[Page 702]

criminal act.

For the foregoing reasons I would dismiss the
appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT MARTIAL APPEAL COURT

Criminal law—Trial—Proof of criminal intent—Defences—Lack of
intent—Psychiatric evidence as to lack of ability to form intent—Conviction
without reasons—Failure of trial judge to give reasons—Criminal Code , ss. 295 
and 303 —National Defence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑4, ss. 55 and 120
(as amended).

Appellant, the sixteen year old son of a member of the armed
forces, held up and attempted to obtain money from a guardhouse on an armed forces
base in W. Germany. On being told that the keys to the cash boxes were not
available he offered to return the revolver taken from one of the three persons
there but eventually left without taking any money. Five minutes later he
returned, indicating that he had come to surrender. Later that morning
appellant gave a statement indicating that he was in a depressed mood and
wanted to die and subsequently gave a handwritten statement to the investigator
setting out in detail what had occurred. He had written a suicide note prior to
the guardhouse incident and there had been tension between him and his father
for some eighteen months previously as a result of his falling academic
standing and truancy and his leaving school. He was charged with robbery and joy-ride
under the Code of Service Discipline of the National Defence Act , s. 120
of which makes the Criminal Code  applicable in determining whether acts
or omissions outside of Canada are offences in terms of the Code of Service
Discipline. Psychiatric evidence was given at trial indicating that the
appellant had marked “adjustment reaction of adolescence … manifested by low
self esteem and marked dependency needs” which resulted in pseudo-independent
behaviour and rebelliousness, a tendency toward serious suicide and low
frustration tolerance with a tendency to act anti-socially. He understood the
nature of the proceedings against him but in the opinion of the psychiatrist
suffered at the time of the offence from sufficient mental confusion as to
impair his ability to form or entertain the specific intent to commit

[Page 666]

the offence. The trial judge at the Special General Court
Martial convicted appellant but gave no reasons for the conviction. The
majority in the Court Martial Appeal Court took the view that the issue of
intent was so obvious that the trial judge could not have failed to consider it
and the appeal was dismissed.

Held (Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be
dismissed.

Per Laskin C.J. and Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon,
Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: The mere failure of a trial judge to give
reasons, in the absence of any statutory or common law obligation to give them,
does not raise a question of law. There is no such statutory obligation under
either the National Defence Act  or under the Criminal Code  and
there is no common law rule applicable to all criminal trials. It is desirable
that a trial judge give reasons but the volume of criminal work makes the
indiscriminate requirement of reasons impractical and the discretion of trial
judges should not be fettered. However, the failure of a trial judge to give
reasons, though not challengeable per se, will be challengeable if the
record discloses a rational basis for concluding that the judge erred in
appreciation of a relevant issue or of evidence that would affect the propriety
of his verdict. In the present case there was only one issue, the question of
intent, and on the record there could be no doubt of the trial judge’s
appreciation of the issue of intent and the evidence touching that issue. There
was therefore no question of law to justify interference by the Supreme Court.

Per Spence J., dissenting: While the mere
failure of a trial judge to give reasons in the absence of a statutory or
common law obligation to give them does not raise a question of law and while
such an obligation would be most fettering, in the present case it was more
than regrettable that the presiding judge at the Special General Court Martial
did not give reasons. Although there is the presumption, in the absence of
anything in the record indicating the contrary, that the trial judge did apply
the proper and relevant principles, the record in this case discloses in the
statement of the prosecutor that it was for the defence to establish lack of
specific intend. This was a clear error which, with the failure to give reasons
for judgment, raised considerable doubt as to

[Page 667]

whether the judge had not misdirected himself and so rendered
inapplicable the said presumption.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court Martial Appeal Court[1]
dismissing an appeal from a conviction for robbery and taking a vehicle without
the owner’s consent, contrary to ss. 303  and 295  of the Criminal Code , under
the Code of Service Discipline and ss. 55  and 120  of the National Defence
Act . Appeal dismissed, Spence J. dissenting.

Donald B. Bayne, for the appellant.

M.A. Bisal, and P.D. Chénier, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court
Martial Appeal Court of Canada affirming, Heald J. dissenting, a judgment of
Deniset J. sitting as a Special General Court Martial designated by the
Minister of National Defence pursuant to s. 155 of the National Defence
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N-4. The Special General Court Martial convicted
the appellant, then 16 years of age, of robbery and of joy-riding, under the
Code of Service Discipline of the National Defence Act , and especially
ss. 55 and 120 of the Act. By s. 55, the appellant, as a dependant outside
of Canada of a member of the armed forces serving beyond Canada, was subject to
the Code of Service Discipline; and s. 120  makes the Criminal Code  applicable
in determining whether acts or omissions outside of Canada are offences for the
purposes of the Code of Service Discipline. It is accepted that the two
offences of which the

[Page 668]

appellant was convicted properly come within s. 120 .

Although, formally, the appeal to the Court Martial Appeal Court
of Canada and to this Court was in respect of both convictions, only the
propriety of the conviction of robbery was argued both there and here. In the
Court Martial Appeal Court, it was open to the appellant to impugn the
conviction of robbery on any ground of law alone or on any ground of mixed law
and fact, as provided by ss. 195  and 197  of the National Defence Act . The
provision in the Act, s. 208(1), for a further appeal to the Supreme Court
of Canada gives an appeal as of right only on a question of law on which a
Judge of the Court Martial Appeal Court dissents, and permits an appeal by
leave on any other question of law. In the present case only an appeal as of
right is asserted, based on the dissent of Heald J. The ground of that dissent
is not stated in the formal judgment of the Court Martial Appeal Court, and we
are left to discern it from the reasons of the dissenting Judge. There does not
appear to be a requirement, either expressly or referentially, in the National
Defence Act  such as is found in s. 606  of the Criminal Code  which
directs that where a Judge of a Court of Appeal dissents the formal judgment
shall specify any grounds in law upon which the dissent, in whole or in part,
is based.

The charge of robbery laid against the accused was under the
specification of an assault with intent to steal, as defined in s. 302  (c)
of the Criminal Code . The incident occurred in Lahr, West Germany,
on February 9, 1974 shortly after midnight and after the accused and two
friends (one his girl friend) had spent part of the early evening of February 8
at a tavern and two discothèques where they had some beer. When they were at
the second discothèque the accused asked his male friend to dance with the
girl, and when they returned from the dance floor he was gone. Shortly after midnight he entered a guardhouse on the Canadian Forces Base at Lahr and asked to use the
washroom. Within 30 seconds he emerged from the washroom with a cocked revolver
in his right hand and asked the three other persons who

[Page 669]

were there to raise their hands and empty their holsters. Only
one of them, one Gebhart, had a gun, a service revolver. The accused asked for
money but was told the keys to the cash boxes were not available, and thereupon
the accused offered Gebhart’s revolver back to him but Gebhart did not take it.
After directing the three men to the floor, the accused fired three shots, not
at them but at the radio and telephone in the room and left without taking any
money. The entire incident took five minutes. After five more minutes he
returned, shouting that he had come to surrender. He was without the revolver
that he had previously. Gebhart and another subdued the accused who offered no
resistance.

Later that morning the accused gave a verbal statement to an
investigator, indicating to him that he was in a depressed mood and wanted to
die. The next day the accused gave a handwritten statement to the investigator
setting out in detail what had occurred. The accused had written a suicide note
prior to the incident at he guardhouse, and it was turned over to the police by
his father. There had been tension between him and his father (an adoptive
father) for some eighteen months as a result of the accused’s falling academic
standing and ensuing truancy. He had quit school at the end of January, 1974,
and had been faced with a parental ultimatum to get a job by the end of
February 1974, failing which he would be sent back to Canada alone.

Psychiatric evidence was given at the accused’s trial in his
defence, designed to show that he was incapable of forming or having the intent
required to support the charge of robbery. A report of an examining
psychiatrist and oral evidence by that psychiatrist were received by the
Special General Court Martial. This witness was accepted by the Court as a
qualified expert in psychiatry. The accused’s statement was put in after a voir
dire, but he himself did not testify. Deniset J. at the conclusion of the
trial, which lasted five days, found the accused guilty of robbery (and of
joyriding) but gave no reasons for his finding. The failure to give any reasons
at all is at the base of the appeal to this Court as it was at the base of the
appeal to the Court Martial Appeal Court.

[Page 670]

Insanity was not offered as a defence nor was drunkenness raised
as an issue going to intent but what defence counsel strenuously argued before
the Special General Court Martial was that there was no proper proof of
criminal intent as a required ingredient of robbery, and reliance was placed
upon the judgment of this Court in R. v. George,[2].
This submission was based on the sequence of events that led to the charge
of robbery and particularly on the evidence of the psychiatrist. That evidence
showed that he had seen the accused three times on March 7, 14 and 29
respectively spending one hour, two hours and again one hour with the accused
in the three interviews. In addition, the psychiatrist examined the previous
medical records of the accused, including previous psychiatric records. His
diagnosis in his report was that the accused had marked “adjustment reaction of
adolescence … manifested by low self esteem and marked dependency needs which
are defended against by pseudo‑independent behaviour and rebelliousness
and a tendency toward serious suicide, low frustration tolerance with a
tendency to act out antisocially …” In his oral evidence, the witness said (and
I quote from notes that he made and that he was allowed to use at the trial):

… the accused at the time of the alleged offense was so far
free from mental disease, defect or derangement as to be able concerning the
particular act charged to adhere to the right … the accused does possess
sufficient mental capacity to understand the nature of the proceedings against
him and to intelligently conduct or cooperate in his defence. And, … the
accused at the time of the alleged offense was not so far free from mental
defect, disease, derangement or any other mental impairment as to be able,
concerning the particular acts charged to form or entertain the specific intent
or other mental state required. Regarding specific intent to commit armed
robbery it is the opinion of this examiner that at the time of the commission
of the alleged offense a state of sufficient mental confusion existed in the
accused as to impair his ability to form or entertain the specific intent or
other mental state required to commit the alleged offense.

[Page 671]

With the consent of the prosecution, a statutory declaration
dated April 5, 1974 by another psychiatrist, who interviewed the accused on two
occasions on February 11, 1974, was admitted in evidence. His evaluation was
that the accused had a “pathological type of personality development”, and had
he been an adult he would most likely be diagnosed as “a sociopathic personality”.
However, at his age where “adolescent turmoil can produce protean reactions” a
more complete psychiatric evaluation should be obtained with a view to suitable
treatment. He did say that the accused was not committable.

It was the view of the majority of the Court Martial Appeal Court
that the issue of intent was so obvious that the Special General Court Martial
could not have failed to consider it. He was entitled to weigh the psychiatric
evidence along with the other evidence offered, and to decide on the whole of
the evidence whether guilt was established. In short, the majority view was
that the Special General Court Martial could not be said, merely because no
reasons were given, to have misdirected himself as to the issues he had to
decide or to have failed to appreciate and weigh all the evidence adduced
before him.

In his dissent Heald J. was of the opinion that the psychiatric
evidence, if accepted, offered a complete answer to the charge, and the trial
judge’s failure to give any reasons made it impossible to decide whether he
instructed himself as to the effect of that evidence if accepted. Since no
reasons were given for not accepting it, Heald J. concluded that he had
considerable “reason to doubt” that the trial judge had properly instructed himself.
(The quoted words came from the reasons of Estey J. in Ungaro v. R.[3],
at p. 438, and I shall return to that case later). The learned
dissenting Judge concluded that there should be a new trial on the robbery
charge because he was not satisfied that the trial judge had properly
instructed

[Page 672]

himself.

The appeal to this Court was on the footing that Heald J.’s
dissent raised a question of law by reason of the failure of the trial judge,
absent any reasons for finding the accused guilty, to show that he had directed
himself correctly in rejecting the uncontradicted psychiatric evidence which
raised a reasonable doubt of the accused’s capacity to form and have the intent
necessary to support the charge of robbery. As I have already indicated, the
Court Martial Appeal Court was empowered to set aside the conviction on any
question of mixed law and fact as well as on any question of law alone, but
this latitude is not open to this Court. Mere failure of a trial judge to give
reasons, in the absence of any statutory or common law obligation to give them,
does not raise a question of law. There is no such statutory obligation under
the National Defence Act  nor under the Criminal Code , nor can I
find, or be justified in fashioning, a common law rule applicable to all
criminal trials. The desirability of giving reasons is unquestionable. As was
said in a Note in (1970), 48 Can. Bar Rev. 584 by Professor Hooper,

The arguments in favour of reasoned judgments are obvious.
The process of publicly formulating his reasons may lead the judge to a
conclusion other than that reached upon the basis of “intuition”. The parties
to the case, both the Crown and the defence, will want to assure themselves
that the judge properly understood the issues before him and will want to know
whether he reached any conclusions of law or fact that could be challenged at
the appellate level. The general public, or at least the victim if there was
one, may have an interest in knowing why a certain verdict was reached.

These considerations and others that could be mustered go to show
what is the preferable practice, but the volume of criminal work makes an
indiscriminate requirement of reasons impractical, especially in provincial
criminal courts, and the risk of ending up with a ritual formula makes it
undesirable to fetter the discretion of trial judges.

[Page 673]

There are instances in statute law in this country where reasons
are obligatory, as, for example, under the Immigration Appeal Board Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. I-3, s. 7(3) if demanded by the parties, and under the Ontario
Energy Board Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 312, s. 17.

It does not follow, however, that failure of a trial judge to
give reasons, not challengeable per se as an error of law, will be
equally unchallengeable if, having regard to the record, there is a rational
basis for concluding that the trial judge erred in appreciation of a relevant
issue or in appreciation of evidence that would affect the propriety of his
verdict. Where some reasons are given and there is an omission to deal with a
relevant issue or to indicate an awareness of evidence that could affect the
verdict, it may be easier for an appellate Court or for this Court to conclude
that reversible error was committed: see R. v. Bush[4],
at p. 44; Ungaro v. R.[5]; Horsburgh
v. R.[6]; Kolnberger
v. R.[7]

The more intractable situation is where, as here, no reasons at
all are given. Ungaro v. R., supra, Rinfret C.J. said this (at
p. 432):

I do not mean that a trial judge is obliged in his judgment
to give all the reasons which lead him to the conclusion that an accused is
guilty. Undoubtedly if he finds one valid reason why he should reach that
conclusion it is not necessary that he should also give other reasons. It is
imperative, however, that he should give a decision upon all the points raised
by the defence which might be of a nature to bring about the acquittal of the
accused.

It cannot be taken from this passage that the Chief Justice was
saying that reasons must be given but only that, if they are given, they should
reflect consideration of telling points in the case. To the same effect is what
Estey J. said (at p. 438) as follows:

[Page 674]

In his reasons, with great respect, the learned trial judge
discloses that he had misdirected himself with respect to the relevancy of the
denial and given to it an importance in relation to the main issue not
justified upon the authorities. Moreover, a reading of the reasons as a whole
suggests that he did not direct himself as to the explanation of the source of
the goods in relation to the evidence as required in Richler v. The
King … There is at least “reason to doubt that he properly charged himself
when forming his conclusions upon the evidence” as stated by Chief Justice Moss
in Rex v. Frank ((1910) 16 C.C.C. 237), which, with respect would appear
to be an accurate statement of the limitation in respect to the presumption
upon which Rex v. Bush … was decided.

Reasons were given by the trial judge in the Ungaro case,
but it is not evident that any were given by the trial judge in R. v. Bush[8],
The British Columbia Court of Appeal in the Bush case (which dealt
with a conviction on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice) said that
“there is no obligation upon a trial judge to exemplify his legal
qualifications respecting the rules of evidence in trying a case, because his
requisite knowledge of the law pertaining to the proper discharge of the duties
of his office must be assumed …”. This statement was contrary to that expressed
by the Alberta Appellate Division in R. v. Ambler[9],
where it was held that a trial judge who would convict on the
uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice must provide an accompanying statement
showing that he appreciates the danger of so convicting. To the extent to which
Ungaro and other cases in this Court, such as Kolnberger v. The
Queen, supra, have dealt with the issue raised by the Bush and Ambler
cases, they have done so in situations where some reasons were given, and
thus the Court had some basis upon which to decide if there was a reversible
error committed by the trial judge.

[Page 675]

I would observe also that Bush and Ambler, and like
cases where accomplice evidence is involved, are cases where a particular
direction must be given to the jury on the danger of convicting on such
evidence if uncorroborated, and hence the concern about self-misdirection when
a trial judge is sitting alone. The present case is not in that category. The
most that can be taken from previous decisions of this Court, in their
application to a situation where no reasons are given by the trial judge, is
that there is no preclusion from looking at the case as a whole, the issues,
the defences, the record of the proceedings, as a basis for coming to a
conclusion whether there is, as I have already said, a rational basis for
concluding that the trial judge erred in a matter that could reasonably have
affected his verdict.

In the present case, there was only one debatable issue on the
charge of robbery and that was the question of intent to which counsel for the
prosecution and for the defence directed their summations, as appears from the
record. Neither insanity nor drunkenness was germane in this case to the
question of guilt, and it is impossible to conclude that the trial judge was
unaware of the centrality of intent to which the evidence of the psychiatrist
was addressed. What he had to decide was whether that evidence and the evidence
of other witnesses, both as to the actus reus and as to
the behaviour of the accused, should lead him to acquit. That he did not do so
cannot in this case, and on the record in the case, lead to any doubt about the
trial judge’s appreciation of the legal issue before him and of the evidence
touching that issue. Heald J.’s dissent in the Court Martial Appeal Court is at
bottom a disagreement with the trial judge on the weight of the evidence. The
fact that he or I would have come to a different conclusion is, so far as the
jurisdiction of this Court is concerned, immaterial.

Being satisfied as I am that there could be no doubt about the
trial Judge’s apprehension of the legal issue before him (despite the absence
of any

[Page 676]

reasons), I do not find any question of law that would justify
interference by this Court because of the way in which the evidence was
assessed. The psychiatrist, on the record, had been accepted as a qualified
expert so it was only the weight, the cogency of his evidence and not his
credibility as a witness that was under consideration by the trial judge.

I would dismiss the appeal.

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—I have had the opportunity of
perusing and considering the reasons for judgment written by the Chief Justice.
With respect, I must differ with the conclusion expressed therein.

It is apparent that the whole difficulty in the consideration of
the appeal arises from the failure of the Special General Court Martial to give
any reasons whatsoever for his decision. I am in agreement with the statement
of the Chief Justice that the mere failure of a trial judge to give reasons in
the absence of any statutory or common law obligation to give them does not
raise a question of law and that such a statutory obligation would be most
fettering especially when one considers the enormous number of trials which
must be handled by provincial court judges in the ordinary carriage of their
official duties.

I think it is relevant, however, to point out that in this
particular case Deniset J. was not acting as a provincial court judge nor even
as a judge sitting in assize but was a Special General Court Martial appointed
by the Minister of National Defence for the purpose of carrying out the trial
of this accused youth. The trial lasted five days and it is more than
regrettable that Deniset J., presiding as such Special General Court Martial
did not devote the few minutes necessary to dictate reasons for judgment.

The Chief Justice has outlined in considerable detail the
circumstances and I need elaborate on them very little.

The only question is whether the Crown had produced evidence
which proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had the intent
necessary for the commission of the offence. The

[Page 677]

charge, under the provisions of the National Defence Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. N-4, was the commission of the offence of robbery outlined in
s. 302 (c) of the Criminal Code . That section provides:

302. Everyone commits robbery who,

. . .

(c) assaults any person with intent to steal from
him;

It was, therefore, the Crown’s duty to prove the specific intent
to steal from Master Corporal Gebhart. This specific intent and the ability of
the accused to possess such specific intent was practically the only matter at
issue during the trial. The evidence given by the witnesses for the
prosecution, so far as it dealt with the factual situation, was uncontradicted
and unquestioned. The defence called only the evidence of another young man, a
friend of the appellant, and a sixteen-year-old girl who described herself as
the “girl friend” of the appellant, and then called Lieutenant-Colonel Isom, a
commissioned officer of the United States Army, a medical doctor, and a skilled
practising psychiatrist. All of the defence evidence was evidence concerned
solely with the mental condition and capacity of the appellant and particularly
with his ability to form the specific intent required before there could be
conviction on the charge which the court martial was considering. No reply
evidence was called by the prosecution. I quote only one sentence from
Lieutenant-Colonel Isom’s evidence:

Regarding specific intent to commit armed robbery it is the
opinion of this examiner that at the time of the commission of the alleged
offence a state of sufficient mental confusion existed in the accused as to
impair his ability to form or entertain the specific intent or other mental
state required to commit the alleged offence.

After the evidence as outlined by the Chief Justice in his
reasons and after this evidence by Lieutenant-Colonel Isom, counsel addressed
the court. The counsel for the prosecution ended his address in the following
fashion:

The defence, to succeed, should either show to this court
that the accused was insane, which is not the case, or that the accused did not
have the specific intent to steal from Master Corporal Gebhart.

[Page 678]

That’s all, Your Honour.

It is, in my view, significant that although the prosecution
counsel did say that the next step for the prosecution to prove was the
specific intent and it was his contention that the evidence had proved that
specific intent. He had just previously said that the defence to succeed should
either show that the accused was innocent or that the accused did not have the
specific intent to steal from Master Corporal Gebhart. This initial statement
was, in my opinion, plainly incorrect. It was not the duty of the appellant or
of his counsel to prove anything. It was the duty of the prosecution to prove
each essential element of its case including specific intent beyond reasonable
doubt. Indeed, all the defence had to do to be entitled to an acquittal was to
raise such reasonable doubt.

Speaking personally, I cannot see how the evidence both factual
and that of Lieutenant-Colonel Isom, the psychiatrist, could fail to raise such
reasonable doubt.

In the light of this statement by the counsel for the prosecution
and the presiding judge’s failure to give any reasons whatsoever, I have a
considerable doubt as to whether the presiding judge was not misled by the
statement of the prosecution counsel into believing that once the defence of
insanity had been disposed of there remained a duty on the defence to prove the
lack of specific intent. I can see no other explanation for the learned
presiding judge’s failure to carefully dispose of that exact issue.

In Ungaro v. R.[10], this
Court was considering a case where a County Court Judge sitting without a jury
had convicted the accused on a charge of receiving stolen goods. The County
Court Judge did give reasons but did not refer to the explanation of possession
offered by the accused. Therefore, although the situation differs from that in
the present appeal in which no reasons whatsoever were given by the judge
presiding at the Special General Court Martial, there are statements of some
interest. Estey J. said at p. 438:

[Page 679]

There is at least “reason to doubt that he properly charged
himself when forming his conclusions upon the evidence” as stated by Chief
Justice Moss in Rex v. Frank (1910), 16 C.C.C. 237, which, with respect
would appear to be an accurate statement of the limitation in respect to the
presumption upon which Rex v. Bush was decided.

The presumption in R. v. Bush[11],
was, that in the absence of anything appearing on the record to indicate
otherwise, the learned trial judge did apply the proper and relevant
principles. In my view, for the reasons which I have outlined, there is in the
present record an indication otherwise and, therefore, as I said, I have a
doubt as to whether the judge presiding at the Special General Court Martial
did not misdirect himself.

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal.

The trial took place in April 1974. The appellant was sentenced
to a term of eighteen months in prison. The record does not indicate whether
the appellant has been at liberty between that date and the present time
pending the consideration of his appeal to the Court Martial Appeal Court of
Canada and then to this Court. If not, of course, the service of his sentence
would have been completed long before this and I would have quashed the
conviction and directed that the appellant be released. If, however, the
appellant has been at liberty, I am of the opinion that the appeal should be
allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Employee of Crown
corporation—Payments from person dealing with corporation—Offences part of the
same transaction—Conviction on several counts—Multiplicity—Right of accused to
be heard prior to sentencing—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 11,
102(1)(a)(ii), 102(1)(c) and 103—Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.),
c. 44.

Appellant was employed by the CBC as Director
of Youth Programs and was responsible for supervising certain broadcasts. He
screened films which producers offered to the Corporation and rejected them or
recommended that they be accepted by the Corporation. Two firms had a number of
their films accepted, the scripts of some of which had been prepared by
appellant who received several sums of money from these firms on various
occasions. Some of the payments were made in cash without a receipt being
required and others were made through a company registered in the name of a
Miss Laberge, who sent all the moneys that she received to appellant. Appellant
was acquitted in the Court of Sessions of the various offences with which he
was charged, but the Quebec Court of Appeal convicted him of six offences under
ss. 102(1) (a)(ii), 102(1) (c) and 103  of the Criminal Code , and
sentenced him to two years of imprisonment without his having an opportunity to
be heard on the matter of sentence, either personally or through counsel.
Appellant appealed to this Court alleging that he was not an “official” within
the meaning of the Criminal Code  by virtue of the Broadcasting Act  and
also on the grounds of multiplicity of convictions for the same act and the
failure of the Court of Appeal to hear him before imposing sentence.

[Page 757]

Held: The
appeal should be allowed in part.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Martland, Judson, Spence, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.
(after re-hearing): The appeal should be allowed on the ground that multiple
convictions were entered against appellant for the same matters, contrary to
the principle in Kienapple v. The Queen, and the case should be remitted
to the Quebec Court of Appeal to pass sentence on the accused in respect of the
two counts on which he stands convicted but only after hearing submissions on
his behalf.

Per Ritchie J.
(after re-hearing): Having regard to the concession made by counsel for the
respondent to the effect that this case was governed by Kienapple v. The
Queen, the matter should be disposed of in the manner proposed by Laskin
C.J.

Per Fauteux
C.J. and Abbott and Ritchie JJ. (after the first hearing): This Court has not
established as a principle that an individual is punished more than once for
the same offence when, as here, he is convicted of more than one offence
committed upon the same act. The provisions of s. 11  of the Criminal
Code  refer to an act or omission which is an offence under more than one
Act, and not a transaction which constitutes several offences.

Every judgment must be read as applicable to
the particular facts, proved, or assumed to be proved, since the generality of
the expressions which may be found there are not intended to be expositions of
the whole law, but governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case
in which such expressions are to be found. A case is only an authority for what
it actually decides. The decision arrived at in Kienapple cannot have
any bearing on the question of law that arises in the case at bar.

In the particular circumstances of the case
it is only where there is only one offence that there be any question of pleas
of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict, of res judicata or
of maxims used to limit multiplication of convictions, when the acts complained
of, constituting but one offence, cannot result in more than one conviction.

Appellant’s contention that, in convicting
him, the Court of Appeal imposed sentence on him without affording him an opportunity
to be heard on the matter, personally or through his counsel, is a valid

[Page 758]

one, as this Court found in Lowry and
Lepper v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 195 that such a right existed, in light
of s. 2(e) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c.
44.

Per Martland
J. (after the first hearing): In the light of the decision in Kienapple, the
present appeal should be disposed of in the manner proposed by Pigeon J.

Per Pigeon J.
(after the first hearing): Appellant argues that under the statute governing
the CBC, that is s. 26 of c. 22 of the Broadcasting Act , 1958, he
is not an “official”. Though in the French version of ss. 102  and 103  of the Criminal
Code , the word used is «fonctionnaire», as in the indictment, in the
English version the word “official” is used, while in the English version of
the Broadcasting Act  the expression used is “officers and employees”.
Since this expression is not defined therein, it must be taken in its ordinary
meaning. The exception found at the beginning of s. 27 , certainly does not
extend the scope of s. 26 , to which it refers. In the Criminal Code , on
the other hand, the word “official” (fonctionnaire) is given a special
definition which is complemented by those of “office” and “public department”,
in para (e) and (d) s. 99 , and subs. (15) of s. 2 . From
these definitions it is clear that the CBC is a public department under the Criminal
Code , though it is not under various administrative statutes. The wording
of the Broadcasting Act  accordingly does not prevent appellant from
being an official within the meaning of the Criminal Code , because at
the time in question he had employment in a “public department”.

It is not necessary to consider in what
circumstances an official may accept payment for work done for someone other
than the public department which employs him. Under para. (c) of
subs. (1) of s. 102  of the Criminal Code , it is sufficient for an
offence to be committed that the official accepts a benefit from anyone having
business dealings with the government, “unless he has the consent in writing of
the head of the branch of government that employs him or of which he is an
official, the proof of which lies upon him”.

Even admitting that the accused received from
the persons named in the indictment only the true value of the services
rendered outside his working hours, he committed an offence under
s. 102(1) (c) of the Criminal Code  because he received the
benefit with-

[Page 759]

out the written consent of the head of the
branch of government which employed him. A salary received for manual or
intellectual labour is a benefit within the meaning of the Income Tax Act, and
it is no different under the Criminal Code . So far as exercise of
influence is concerned, the clandestine nature of the transaction is clear proof
of the guilty intent of appellant.

The three counts dealing with the sums
received from Artek Film Productions, Paul Legault and André Legault, like the
three other counts, are based on the same act viewed in different ways, and the
principle stated in s. 11  of the Criminal Code  must be applied. In Kienapple
v. The Queen, a case on which all members of this Court sat, the majority
judgment follows the principle of R. v. Siggins, [1960] O.R. 284, to the
effect that conviction is a bar to all further proceedings for the same
offence. This Court cannot uphold more than one conviction against appellant
for what is in substance the same matter, namely the unlawful taking of sums of
money from persons having dealings with the government of which he was an official.
As the Court trying the case accepted the sincerity of the deposition given by
the accused, the sum mentioned in the indictment should be reduced to the
amount admitted by him i.e. $12,000.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of
Queen’s Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec[1],
reversing a judgment of acquittal handed down by the Court of Sessions. Appeal
allowed in part and record returned to the Court of Queen’s Bench for
sentencing after appellant has been heard.

Bruno J. Pateras, for the respondent.

[Page 760]

On the hearing the judgment of Fauteux C.J. and
Abbott and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

CHIEF JUSTICE FAUTEUX—Appellant was arraigned on
an indictment containing several counts, only six of which relate to this
appeal. These counts may be briefly summarized as follows.

On the first three counts he was charged with
having, in Montreal and elsewhere, at various times between September 1, 1960
and June 30, 1963, being or in his capacity as an official of the Government of
Canada employed by the CBC, accepted from Artek Film Productions and its agents
Paul Legault and André Legault, who had business dealings with the Government
of Canada, various sums of money amounting to a total of $27,318, (i) some as
commissions, rewards, advantages or benefits, without having obtained the
consent in writing of the head of the branch of government, contrary to the
provisions of s. 102(1) (c)—now s. 110(1)(c)—of the Criminal
Code , (ii) the remainder as loans, rewards, advantages or benefits, as
consideration for cooperation, assistance and exercise of influence in
connection with the transaction of business, the granting of contracts,
contrary to the provisions of s. 102(1) (a)(ii)—now s. 110(1) (a)(ii)—of
the Criminal Code ; and finally, of having, by accepting the sums of
money paid as consideration for cooperation, assistance and exercise of
influence in connection with the transaction of business with the Government,
committed a breach of trust contrary to the provisions of s. 103  of the Criminal
Code —now s. 111 .

On the three other counts he was charged with
the same offences, with, however, some differences as to: (i) the total amount
of the various sums accepted, i.e. $7,200, (ii) the persons from whom he
accepted them, i.e. Armand Serge Roy and Serge Roy Productions Ltée, and
(iii) the period in which the offences were committed, i.e. between 1959
and 1962.

[Page 761]

At the conclusion of the trial appellant was
acquitted on all counts by Judge Lagarde of the Court of Sessions of the Peace.

The Attorney-General of Canada appealed against this verdict of acquittal, as permitted on a
question of law by the combined provisions of ss. 584 and 601—now ss. 605 and
624. This appeal was however limited to the six counts based on the
aforementioned sections.

The Court of Appeal, then composed of Tremblay
C.J. and Hyde and Rivard JJ., allowed this appeal, convicted the accused on the
counts covered by the appeal and, proceeding to impose sentence, sentenced the
accused to two years’ imprisonment on each count, all terms to be served
concurrently.

Appellant appeals against this unanimous
judgment.

In an opinion well-founded both on the facts and
in law, and concurred in by all his colleagues, Rivard J.A. stated the reasons
for the decision of the Court of Appeal.

On the facts: I do not propose to restate all
the facts revealed by the evidence, and more specifically, the admissions and
explanations of the accused whose version, accepted by Judge Lagarde, has, on
the different interpretation given by the trial court and the Court of Appeal
to the legal consequences arising from that evidence, served as the basis for an
acquittal in the Court of Sessions and a conviction in the Court of Appeal.
Limiting myself to the detailed analysis of the evidence by Rivard J.A. and
adopting the conclusions reached by his colleagues and himself, I shall be
content to give a broad outline of the essential and incontrovertible facts in
the record, so far as required for the consideration and disposition of those
grounds of appeal which it is proper to consider.

[Page 762]

During the periods mentioned in the counts of
the indictment appellant was employed by the CBC and was responsible for
supervising “youth” broadcasts in the Montreal area. He had to screen films offered to the CBC for such broadcasts
by producers. On the basis of the opinion which he formed about those films,
Doré was required to reject them or recommend that they be accepted by the CBC,
which by his own admission trusted him completely. Acceptance of the films thus
virtually depended on his opinion and his recommendation. During these periods
also, Artek Film Productions and Serge Roy Productions Ltée, firms engaged in
the production of films, had business dealings with the Government of Canada,
offering films to the CBC for, among other things, the “youth” broadcasts.
Incontrovertible proof resulting from the admissions of the accused, or
corroborated by those admissions, established that these two firms managed to
get numerous films accepted; that the scripts for some of the films produced by
Serge Roy Productions Ltée had been prepared by Doré, who as part of his duties
had to pass judgment on them; that the latter had received several sums of
money from these firms on various occasions, either as gifts without having
obtained written consent from his superiors, or as loans, rewards, advantages
or benefits as consideration for his cooperation, assistance and exercise of
influence; that there was definite clandestinity in the methods used to
transfer these sums to Doré, some payments being made to him in cash at his
residence without a receipt being required or given in exchange, and others
being made through a company he decided to form under the name of Scripto
Productions, which he registered in the name of one Miss Laberge, who sent him
all the moneys she received; that Doré’s name did not appear in the books of
either Artek Film Productions or Serge Roy Productions Ltée to justify these
disbursements, which were only referred to as gratuities; and that by his own
admission Doré lied deliberately to the R.C.M.P. officers who went to question
him regarding certain large sums paid to him by Artek Film Productions when he
was in Paris.

[Page 763]

Concluding his review of the facts Rivard J.A.
stated, in reference to the testimony of the accused:

[TRANSLATION] “This testimony shows beyond
any doubt that the accused is guilty on the counts covered by ss. 102(1) (a),
102(1) (c) and 103 ”.

That statement has in no way been shown to be
erroneous.

On the law: I have nothing to add to the reasons
which Rivard J.A., relying on well‑established authorities, stated on
behalf of the Court of Appeal in disposing of the relevant questions of law in
this case. Indeed, of all the grounds of law argued against the judgment of the
Court of Appeal in this Court only two, in my opinion, require further
consideration. According to appellant the Court of Appeal erred (i) in
convicting the accused on an indictment which rendered him liable to be
punished more than once for the same act, and (ii) in proceeding to impose
sentence without affording him an opportunity to be heard on the matter, either
personally or through counsel.

In support of the first ground appellant relies
on s. 11  of the Criminal Code  and on the judgment of this Court in The
King v. Peter Quon[2]. I
should say at once, with all due respect for the contrary opinion, that in my
view, and for the following reasons, the decision of this Court in the Quon case
is of no assistance to appellant. Quon was charged in the same indictment with
(i) having, while armed with a revolver, robbed a certain Sam Lun, and (ii)
carrying a firearm that can be concealed on the person while in the process of
committing an offence. It was admitted that these two charges related to one
and the same act, and that the firearm referred to in both counts was the
same. Quon pleaded guilty on the first count and not guilty on the second. He
was sentenced to two years on the first and,

[Page 764]

having been convicted on the second, sentenced
to a further term of two years. The Ontario Court of Appeal quashed the
conviction on the second count[3], and
the appeal brought to this Court by the Crown against this judgment was
dismissed. The ratio of the decision in the Court of Appeal and in this Court
related solely to interpretation of the words “any criminal offence” or “acte
criminel” in the context of s. 122(1), both versions of which are worth
citing:


 
  
  122. (1) Quiconque a
  sur soi une carabine, un fusil de chasse, un pistolet, un revolver ou quelque
  arme à feu qui peut être dissimulée sur la personne pendant qu’il commet un acte
  criminel est coupable d’une infraction au présent article et passible
  d’emprisonnement pendant au moins deux ans en sus de toute peine à laquelle
  il peut être condamné pour l’infraction en premier lieu mentionnée; et une
  infraction au présent article est punissable, soit sur mise en accusation, soit
  sur déclaration sommaire de culpabilité, de la même manière que pour
  l’infraction en premier lieu mentionnée.
  
  
  122. (1) Every
  one who has upon his person a rifle, shotgun, pistol, revolver or any firearm
  capable of being concealed upon the person while committing any criminal
  offence is guilty of an offence against this section and liable to
  imprisonment for a term not less than two years in addition to any penalty to
  which he may be sentenced for the first mentioned offence, and an offence
  against this section shall be punishable either on indictment or summary
  conviction in the same manner as the first mentioned offence.
  
 


All that was decided by the two Courts was that
the words “any criminal offence” or “acte criminel”, in the context of that
particular section, had a limited meaning, and did not include a criminal
offence an essential element of which was the possession of a firearm that may
be concealed on the person. I do not see how it can be deduced from the
interpretation given to that section that the Court established as a
principle that an individual is punished more than once

[Page 765]

for the same offence when he is convicted of
more than one offence committed upon the same act, as occurred in the case at
bar.

Neither is appellant’s case better advanced by
the provisions of s. 11  of the Criminal Code . That section, the
wording of which has not been altered, prescribes:

11. Where an
act or omission is an offence under more than one Act of the Parliament of
Canada, whether punishable by indictment or on summary conviction, a person who
does the act or makes the omission is, unless a contrary intention appears,
subject to proceedings under any of those Acts, but is not liable to be
punished more than once for the same offence.

One must well note at the outset that the
section refers to an act or omission which is an offence under more
than one Act, and not, which is quite different, to an act which constitutes
several offences. The provisions of this section were recently considered
by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Lavoie[4]. In that case the accused was convicted on
two counts of an indictment under the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952,
c. 148. The first of these counts charged him with making false or
deceptive statements in his tax return, contrary to the provisions of
s. 132(1)(a), and the other with having wilfully attempted to evade
compliance with the statute and avoid payment of a tax imposed under it,
contrary to the provisions of s. 132(1)(b). Lavoie appealed, and in
support of his appeal pleaded, as was done in the case at bar, the provisions
of s. 11  and the decision of this Court in Quon. That appeal was
rejected by a unanimous decision of the Court. Culliton C.J., delivering the
judgment of the Court, referred inter alia to the provisions of
s. 11  and said:

[Page 766]

The foregoing section, apart from some
differences in wording, is similar to s. 33 of the Interpretation Act, 1889
(U.K.), c. 63, which reads:

When an act or omission constitutes an
offence under two or more Acts, or both under an Act and at common law… the
offender shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be liable to be
prosecuted and punished under either or any of those Acts or at common law, but
shall not be liable to be punished twice for the same offence.

In interpreting the effect of this
section of the English Interpretation Act, Humphreys J., in R. v.
Thomas (1949) 33 Cr. App. R. 200 at p. 204 said:

Mr. Paget has argued that we ought so
to read the section that the last word “offence” should be read as meaning
“act”, and it was submitted that “act”, “cause” and “offence” all mean the same
thing.

In our view that is not correct. It is not
the law that a person shall not be liable to be punished twice for the same
act; no one has ever said so in any case, and the Interpretation Act does
not say so. What the Act says is that a person “shall not be liable to be
punished twice for the same offence”. Not only is it not the law, but it never
has been the law, and that it is not the law was expressly decided in the highest
criminal Court in the land then existing, the Court for the Consideration of
Crown Cases Reserved, as far back as 1867, in Morris (1867) L.R. 1, C.C.R. 90;
10 Cox C.C. 480.

It was correctly held that the mere fact that
two offences resulted from the same act or acts, and that Lavoie was found
guilty of both offences, did not mean that he was being punished twice for the
same offence. I would therefore reject appellant’s first ground.

The second ground appears to me to be
well-founded. In Lowry and Lepper v. The Queen[5], the question of the right of an accused
who has

[Page 767]

been acquitted at first instance and convicted
in the Court of Appeal to be heard prior to sentencing, either personally or by
counsel, was for the first time considered by this Court in the light of the
provisions of s. 2(e) of the Canadian Bill of Rights 1960
(Can.), c. 44. This Court concluded that such a right existed and,
although it dismissed the appeal on the merits, ordered that the case be
remitted to the Court of Appeal for it to pass sentence after appellants would
have been afforded an opportunity to make submissions, either personally or by
counsel.

Since writing the foregoing I have seen the
addition made into the reasons of our brother Pigeon to the effect that the decision
to be rendered in John Edward Kienapple v. Her Majesty the Queen concurrently
with the decision in this case has by itself the effect of binding and
requiring this Court to invalidate some of the convictions entered in the case
at bar by the Court of Appeal. The reason given for this view is that the five
majority judges in Kienapple approved an extract from the opinion of
Kellock J. in The King v. Quon[6], at pp.
519-20, an extract which MacKay J. cited in extenso in Regina v.
Siggins[7], at pp.
285-6, and which is cited in part by our brother in his reasons in the present
case. With all due respect for the contrary opinion, I must state that I am
completely unable to agree with this view.

At the very outset of the comments which follow
on this view, it seems appropriate to reproduce here the text of the two
observations of the Earl of Halsbury L.C. in Quinn v. Leathem[8]:

Now, before discussing the case of Allen
v. Flood (1898) A.C. 1 and what was decided therein, there are two
observations of a general character which I wish to make, and one is to repeat
what I have very often said before, that every judgment must be read as
applicable to the particular facts proved, or assumed

[Page 768]

to be proved, since the generality of the
expressions which may be found there are not intended to be expositions of the
whole law, but governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case in
which such expressions are to be found. The other is that a case is only an
authority for what it actually decides. I entirely deny that it can be quoted
for a proposition that may seem to follow logically from it.

Let us now contrast the particular facts of the Kienapple
and the Doré cases, and define the question of law to be decided in
each on the basis of such particular facts.

Kienapple

Following his trial on an indictment consisting
of two counts, one of having had sexual intercourse with a girl under the age
of fourteen years, contrary to s. 146(1)  of the Criminal Code , and
the other of having, in the circumstance, raped the girl, contrary to
s. 143  of the Criminal Code , Kienapple was convicted of these two
offences by a jury, whose verdict was unanimously upheld by a decision of the
Court of Appeal of Ontario. Hence the appeal to this Court, solely on the
question of law stated as follows in the judgment granting leave to appeal:

Whether the accused, having been convicted
of rape, should in respect to the same single act have been convicted of sexual
intercourse with a female under the age of 14 not being his wife?

Doré

As indicated at the beginning of these reasons,
the case concerned numerous transactions, conducted in different cities at
various times over a period of about three years, implicating two different
groups of persons and involving the payment of various sums of money given
either as rewards or as remunerations or loans for totals of $27,318, paid to
appellant by one group, and $7,200, paid by the other. The question of law
raised by these particular facts is simply whether the Court of Appeal erred in
convicting appellant on all the

[Page 769]

counts which had been covered by the appeal to
the Court of Appeal and which charged appellant with the non-interchangeable
offences described in ss. 102(1) (a)(ii), 102(1) (c) and 103  of the
Criminal Code .

Hence it can be seen that the question of law
raised by each of these appeals, on the basis of the particular facts of each
case, is strikingly different; and this, in my view, lends singular relevance
to the first observation of the Lord Chancellor in Quinn v. Leathern, supra.
The same is true of his second observation. Indeed, all that is decided by
the judgment to be rendered in Kienapple, and consequently the only
question of law as to which that judgment can be authority on the aspect which
concerns us, is that a case in which the accused is tried concurrently for
having had sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of fourteen years, and
having also, in the circumstance, raped the girl, will fall, if all these facts
are established, under s. 143  and not under s. 146(1)  of the Criminal
Code , which would then not be applicable. The fundamental premise of such a
decision lies essentially in the interpretation given to the intent of
Parliament with respect to these provisions of the Code the effect of which, in
the circumstances stated, is to wholly merge the offence specified in
s. 146(1)  with that of rape. This may be seen from the following extracts
taken, first, from the early part, and second, from the conclusion itself, of
the decision:

From the beginning:

It is plain, of course, that Parliament has
defined two offences in sections 143  and 146(1)  but there is an overlap in
the sense that one embraces the other when the sexual intercourse has been with
a girl under age 14 without her consent.

From the conclusion:

In the circumstances of the present case,
the superadded element of age in section 146(1)  does not operate to
distinguish unlawful carnal knowledge from rape. Age under 14 is certainly
material where consent to the sexual intercourse is present; but once that is

[Page 770]

ruled out, as it is in the present case, it
becomes meaningless as a distinguished feature of the offence of rape and
unlawful carnal knowledge.

Accordingly, I cannot see how that decision
could have any bearing on the question of law in Doré considering the
particular facts of the latter case.

Nor do I see how the complete quotation from the
reasons of Kellock J. in Quon, supra, as well as the approval of this
quotation by the judges of the majority in Kienapple, can bind and
oblige this Court, in the instant case, to put aside from the convictions
entered in the Court of Appeal those which relate to the offences stated in
ss. 102(1) (a)(ii)—reward for the exercise of influence—and
103—breach of trust—so as to maintain only those involving the offence stated
in s. 102(1) (c)—accepting advantages without the written consent of
superiors—without, be it noted in passing, furnishing at the same time reasons
for so choosing among such non-interchangeable offences.

The fact that there may be nothing exceptionable
in the remarks of Kellock J. does not decide the question. First, it should be
noted that they were made obiter, and moreover concerned a point which
the three other judges who with Kellock J. composed the majority did not feel
it necessary or even appropriate to deal with and which, what is more, was
disposed of by Roach J.A. as follows in concluding his judgment on behalf of
the Court of Appeal in the Quon case:

The words “any criminal offence” must be
given the modified meaning which I earlier stated. To do so avoids repugnancy
and inconsistencies and results in an “harmonious whole”. That interpretation
is “consonant to reason” and in my firm opinion gives to the section the
full effect which Parliament intended.

I am quite aware that this decision is in
conflict with the decision of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba in R. v.
Maskiew, (1946) 1 D.L.R. 378, 85 Can. C.C. 138, 53 Man. R. 281, [1945] 3
W.W.R. 529. Counsel for the Crown in this Court cited that decision. Counsel
for the appellant faced it, and pointed out that the

[Page 771]

Court there simply rejected the argument of
autrefois convict and that the defense of res judicata was not
argued. He cited such cases as Wemyss v. Hopkins (1875), L.R. 10 Q.B.
378; Reg. v. King, (1897) 1 Q.B. 214, and in our own Courts R. v.
Quinn (1905), 10 Can. C.C. 412, 11 O.L.R. 242, and R. v. Sweetman, (1939),
2 D.L.R. 70, O.R. 131, 71 Can. C.C. 171. On my interpretation of s. 122
neither the defense of autrefois convict nor that of res
judicata has any application. The admitted facts do not bring the
accused within that section.

On the basis of the interpretation given to ss.
143  and 146(1)  by the majority judges in Kienapple—according to which in
the circumstances under consideration the offence stated in s. 143 
embraces that stated in s. 146(1) —I do not see why the conclusion reached
by Roach J.A. in Quon would not also apply to that Kienapple case.

Whether it was, as he pointed out, in light of
the general principles of the criminal law that Kellock J. approached the
interpretation of s. 122 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927,
c. 36, it does not follow that he did not, in common with his colleagues
of the majority, base his opinion specifically on the rule of interpretation
that the grammatical and ordinary sense of a word must yield if absurdity would
result.

In my opinion, and with deference, it is going
beyond what was intended by Kellock J. to apply what he said about the case of
an individual who, having already been the subject of criminal proceedings, is subsequently
prosecuted again on another aspect of the same matter, to the case of an
accused who is tried once on several counts simultaneously—for the
latter is clearly the situation in Kienapple and Doré. In the two
decisions which were cited by the learned judge in support of his view, the
proceedings were clearly subsequent, and not simultaneous, as may
be seen from the accurate summary contained in the headnote in each case.

[Page 772]

In Wemyss v. Hopkins[9]:

The appellant was summarily convicted under
s. 78 of 5 & 6 Wm. 4, c. 50, for that he, being driver of a carriage
on a highway, by negligence and wilful misconduct, to wit, by striking a horse
ridden by the respondent, caused hurt and damage to the respondent; he was
afterwards convicted, on the same facts, under s. 42 of 24 & 25 Vict.
c. 100, for unlawfully assaulting the respondent:

Held, that the first conviction was a bar
to the second.

In The Queen v. R.J. Elrington et al.[10]:

Where, under 9 G. 4, c. 31, ss. 27-29, a
complaint of assault or battery has been made to two justices of the peace, who
dismiss the complaint and give the party a certificate accordingly, the
certificate may be pleaded in bar to an indictment, founded on the same facts,
charging assault and battery accompanied by malicious cutting and wounding so
as to cause grievous or actual bodily harm.

I note that the dismissal of the subsequent
prosecution was based, (i) in the Wemyss case, supra, on the
principle which we have incorporated in our Code in s. 11 , supra—formerly
s. 15—, a principle which Lord Blackburn mentions in the case by ascribing
to it the meaning and effect given to s. 11  in the Lavoie case, supra,
and (ii), in the Elrington case, supra, on the provisions of
the Imperial statute 9 Geo. IV, c. 31, ss. 27-29, the tenor of which was
reproduced substantially in our Criminal Code  in ss. 733  and 734 , as
they stood when the Quon decision was rendered.

733. If the
justice, upon the hearing of any case of assault or battery upon the merits
where the information is laid by or on behalf of the person aggrieved, under
the last preceding section, deems the offence not to be proved, or finds the
assault or battery to have been justified, or so trifling as not to merit any
punishment, he shall dismiss the complaint and shall forthwith make out a
certificate under his hand stating the fact of such dismissal, and shall
deliver such

[Page 773]

certificate to the person against whom the
complaint was preferred. R.S., c. 146, s. 733.

734. If the
person against whom any such information has been laid, by or on behalf of the
person aggrieved, obtains such certificate, or, having been convicted, pays the
whole amount adjudged to be paid or suffers the imprisonment, or imprisonment
with hard labor, awarded, he shall be released from all further or other
proceedings, civil or criminal, for the same cause. S.R., c. 146, s. 734.

It should also be noted that at the conclusion
of his remarks Kellock J. hastened to add:

It is obvious of course that Parliament
may, if it sees fit, constitute two separate offences out of the same act or
omission or make part of an act or omission or one or more of a series of acts
or omissions a separate offence additional to that constituted by the complete
act or omission or the whole series.

Siggins

In that case, supra, the Court of Appeal
of Ontario, composed of Porter
C.J.A. and MacKay and Morden JJ.A., had to determine whether a person stealing
an article, who has had it in his possession continuously since the theft, can
be charged and convicted of both theft and unlawful possession. The members of
the Court held that he could not, but were divided on the limits of the
decision and the reasons supporting it. On the one hand, MacKay J.A., in whose
opinion Porter C.J.A. concurred, said first at p. 285:

I am of the opinion that in the
circumstances of this case, the convictions for both theft and possession
cannot stand…

and after citing the foregoing observations of
Kellock J., said the following, at p. 286, concerning the decision
rendered by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Van Dorn:

Counsel for the Crown referred us to R.
v. Van Dorn (1956), 116 C.C.C. 325, in which it was held that convictions
for both offences, i.e. theft and possession, could stand where the possession
charged is not

[Page 774]

so intimately identified in time and place
as to form part of the theft itself. It may be that in certain circumstances
this might be so. But in a case such as the present where the
appellant was the actual thief and had had continuous possession of the motor
vehicle from the time it was stolen by him, I think the two offences arise from
the one act. The same act that constituted the theft constituted the offence of
having unlawful possession. To apply the principles of the Quon case it is
of course necessary to treat the unlawful possession, whether, it be for a
matter of minutes or months, as one continuing offence. In my opinion this is
so.

Morden J.A., on the other hand, in contrast with
his two colleagues, made no mention of Quon, supra, rejected the
principle in Van Dorn, supra, and, basing himself on decisions rendered
by this Court prior to substitution of s. 296—unlawful possession—for
s. 399—receiving and retaining stolen goods—, concluded as follows, at
p. 289:

Having regard to the views expressed by the
majority of the Judges in the Clay case as to the effect to be given to former
s. 399, I cannot accept the argument that parliament in enacting the
present s. 296 to replace the former s. 399, intended that a person
could be convicted of the offence of theft as well as guilty possession of the
thing stolen.

Accordingly, what emerges from the reasons
stated by MacKay J.A., and concurred in by Porter C.J.A., is that in the
particular circumstances of the case there was only one offence, and
that only in such circumstances would the Quon, supra, principle apply.
So, and I say it in all deference, I cannot really see why in such
circumstances there can be question of pleas of autrefois acquit or autrefois
convict, of res judicata or of maxims used to limit multiplication
of convictions, when the acts complained of, constituting but one offence,
cannot result in more than one conviction.

For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal on
the merits and order that the case be remitted to the Court of Appeal for it to
impose the sentences after giving appellant an opportunity,

[Page 775]

personally or through counsel, to make
representations on the subject.

MARTLAND J.—Had it not been for the judgment of
the full Court in the case of John Edward Kienapple v. Her Majesty The
Queen, to be rendered concurrently with the judgment in the present appeal,
I would have agreed with Chief Justice Fauteux in holding that the appellant’s
appeal against his convictions should be dismissed. However, in the light of
the decision in the Kienapple case, I feel obligated to agree with my
brother Pigeon in holding that the present appeal should be disposed of in the
manner which he has proposed.

PIGEON J.—This appeal is against a decision of
the Court of Appeal of Quebec, quashing the acquittal ordered by the Court of
Sessions, and convicting appellant of offences under ss. 102  and 103  (now
ss. 110 and 111) of the Criminal Code . The first three counts of the
indictment against appellant read as follows:

[TRANSLATION] (1) In the city and district
of Montreal, and elsewhere, between September 1, 1960 and June 30, 1963,
FERNAND DORE, being an official of the Federal Government of Canada, to wit:
Director of Youth Programmes for the Montreal district of the CBC, a federal
Crown corporation, did unlawfully accept from Artek Film Productions, Paul
Legault and André Legault, loans, rewards, advantages or benefits, and more
particularly sums of money totalling $27,318.00, as consideration for
cooperation, assistance and the exercise of influence in connection with the
transaction of business with the Government, and more particularly the granting
of contracts by the CBC to the said ARTEK FILM PRODUCTIONS, committing thereby
an offence contrary to the provisions of section 102(1) (a)(ii) of
the Criminal Code .

(2) In the city and district of Montreal,
and elsewhere, between September 1, 1960 and June 30, 1963, FERNAND DORE, being an official of the Federal
Government of Canada, to wit: Director of Youth Programmes for the Montreal district of the CBC, a federal
Crown corporation, did accept from persons having dealings with the Government,

[Page 776]

namely: ARTEK FILM PRODUCTIONS, PAUL
LEGAULT and ANDRE LEGAULT, commissions, rewards, advantages or benefits, and
more particularly sums of money totalling $27,318.00, without having the
consent in writing of the head of the branch of government that employs him,
committing thereby an offence contrary to the provisions of
section 102(1) (c) of the Criminal Code .

(3) In the city and district of Montreal,
and elsewhere, between September 1, 1960 and June 30, 1963 FERNAND DORE, being
an official of the Federal Government of Canada, to wit: Director of Youth
Programmes for the Montreal district of the CBC, a federal Crown corporation,
did commit a breach of trust in connection with the duties of his office, by
accepting from ARTEK FILM PRODUCTIONS, PAUL LEGAULT and ANDRE LEGAULT loans,
rewards, advantages or benefits, and more particularly sums of money totalling
$27,318.00, as consideration for cooperation, assistance and exercise of
influence in connection with the transaction of business with the Government,
and more particularly the granting of contracts by the CBC to the said ARTEK
FILM PRODUCTIONS, committing thereby an indictable offence contrary to the
provisions of section 103  of the Criminal Code .

The three other counts on which conviction was
pronounced are similar in every respect, except that they concern sums of
money, totalling $7,200, received from Serge Roy Productions Ltée and from
Armand Serge Roy, between 1959 and 1962.

It should be noted at the outset that, in
finding appellant guilty, Rivard J.A. who wrote the unanimous opinion of the
Court of Appeal, relied essentially on the deposition of the accused, which was
accepted as sincere by the trial judge. There is thus no disagreement as to the
facts, which is as it should be since an appeal against an acquittal may only
be made on a point of law.

The first ground put forward before us was that
under the statute governing the CBC, appellant was not an “official”. The
enactment in force at the time was subs. (1) of s. 26  of the Broadcasting
Act  (1958 (Can.), c. 22, now replaced by R.S.C., c. B-11, s. 38(2)).
It reads as follows:

[Page 777]

26. (1) The
Corporation may on its own behalf employ such officers and employees as it
considers necessary for the conduct of its business, at such remuneration and
upon such other terms as it deems fit, but the officers and employees so
employed are not officers or servants of Her Majesty.

Though it is true that, in the French version of
ss. 102  and 103  of the Criminal Code , the word used is “fonctionnaire”,
as in the indictment, it must be noted that the word “official” is used in the
English version, while in the English version of the Broadcasting Act  the
expression used is “officers and employees”. Furthermore, this expression is
not defined therein, and must accordingly be taken in its ordinary meaning.

In the Criminal Code , on the other hand,
the word “official” (fonctionnaire) is given, for the purposes of the Part with
which we are concerned, a special definition which is complemented by those of
“office” and “public department”. These provisions are para. (e)
and (d) of s. 99  (now s. 107 ), and subs. (34) of s. 2 :

(e) “official” means a person who

(i) holds an office, or

(ii) is appointed to discharge a public
duty;

(d) “office” includes

(i) an office or appointment under the
government;

(ii) a civil or military commission, and

(iii) a position or employment in a public
department;

(34) “public department” means a department
of the Government of Canada or a branch thereof or a board, commission,
corporation or other body that is an agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada.

From these definitions it is clear that the CBC
is a public department under the Criminal Code , though it is not under
various administrative statutes. Indeed, subs. (1) of s. 27 of the Broad-

[Page 778]

casting Act (now
replaced by R.S.C., c. B-11, s. 40(1)) provides:

27. (1)
Except as provided in subsection (1) of section 26 , the Corporation
is, for all purposes of this Act, an agent of Her Majesty, and its powers under
this Act may be exercised only as an agent of Her Majesty.

The exception found at the beginning of this
provision certainly does not extend the scope of the section to which it
refers. The latter does not contain any special definition, and so must be
taken in the ordinary meaning of the words used. As to this ordinary meaning,
the following observation was made in the reasons issued in Jones and Maheux
v. Gamache[11], at
p. 132:

[TRANSLATION]… it must be pointed out that
the word “fonctionnaire” does not necessarily mean “civil servant”, although
this is indeed the meaning ordinarily given to it at the present time.

This remark was made in connection with the
meaning of the word “fonctionnaire” in para. (c) of s. 29  of
the Exchequer Court Act . It may well be that the effect of the wording
of the Broadcasting Act  is to exclude the employees of the CBC from the
scope of this provision, as well as from subs. (1) of s. 3 of the Crown
Liability Act. It is reasonable to suppose that, corporate status being
conferred upon their employer, the intention was that the latter should be
answerable for them, not the government.

It is quite a different thing to assume that
Parliament wished to grant them immunity from the Part of the Criminal Code  entitled
“Offences against the Administration of Law and Justice”. This assumption is
even less justified as the word “official” is there given a meaning which goes
considerably beyond the ordinary meaning. It need only be noted that in The
Queen v. Sheets[12] this
Court held that a member of a municipal council is an official within the
meaning of this provision, though an elected representative, not an employee of
the

[Page 779]

municipality. Identical decisions were given in Martineau
v. The Queen[13] in
respect of a member of a Legislative Council, and in Sommers v. The Queen[14] regarding a Minister of the Crown. I
conclude, therefore, that the wording of the Broadcasting Act  did not
prevent the appellant from being an official within the meaning of the Criminal
Code , because at the time in question he had employment in a “public
department”.

Secondly, it was argued that as the trial judge
accepted the version of the facts given by the accused, it must be admitted that
the sums received by the accused were paid, not in consideration of exercise of
influence in connection with the transaction of business with the government,
but in payment for work done. On this point, Mr. Justice Rivard correctly
observed:

[TRANSLATION] There is no doubt that an
employee is entitled to work for other persons outside his normal working
hours, provided that it is not for persons who do business with the government,
and provided that the work done has no direct influence on decisions and recommendations
to be made by him in his official capacity.

In the case at bar, I do not feel it is
necessary to consider in what circumstances an official may accept payment for
work done for someone other than the public department which employs him. Under
para. (c) of subs. (1) of s. 102  Crim. Code (second and
eighth counts of the indictment), it is sufficient for an offence to be
committed that the official accepts a benefit from anyone having business
dealings with the government, “unless he has the consent in writing of the head
of the branch of government that employs him or of which he is an official, the
proof of which lies upon him”. Only the offence under para. (a)
(first and seventh counts of the indictment) requires that the benefit be
received “as consideration for cooperation, assistance, exercise of influence
or…”

[Page 780]

As concerns the second and eighth counts of the
indictment, therefore, even admitting that the accused received from the
persons named in the indictment only the true value of services rendered
outside his working hours, he committed the offence because he received the
benefit without the written consent of the head of the branch of government
which employed him.

Clearly, the fact that a sum of money or other
value represents only the equivalent of the benefits conferred does not prevent
it from being “a commission, reward, advantage or benefit”. The words
“commission” and “reward” suggest the idea of compensation for services
rendered. A salary received for manual or intellectual labour is undoubtedly a
benefit within the meaning of the Income Tax Act, and there is no reason
why it should be otherwise under the Criminal Code . Only a loan, which
requires the return of the sum received, may be regarded differently, and it is
worth noting that it is not mentioned in para. (c), where the word
“commission” is used instead of the word “loan” in para. (a). This
difference is significant.

Under para. (a) it is proper to
consider whether the sum paid exceeds the equivalent of the value given,
because this may be important in deciding whether it is in consideration of an
exercise of influence. This point does not arise under para. (c),
because only an authorization from the head of the branch of government
prevents the official from being regarded as putting himself in a conflict of
interest situation by accepting compensation of any kind from a person dealing
with the government.

In the case at bar it is unnecessary to consider
whether the evidence has to show guilty intent on the part of the official who
is in breach of para. (c). Here the clandestine nature of the
transaction is clear proof of such guilty intent. It would be a gross
misinterpretation of the standards of honesty required in public life to accept

[Page 781]

as an explanation the accused’s contention that
such clandestinity was prompted by the desire to defraud the tax collector.

Having found that the accused was properly
convicted on the two counts based on para. (c) of subs. (1) of
s. 102 , it does not appear to me necessary to consider whether the facts
supported his conviction on the other counts. The offences in question are all
equally serious, they carry exactly the same penalty. There is thus no need to
consider whether the most serious offence has been established. In my view this
is a case for application of the principle stated in s. 11  of the Criminal
Code , in the following terms:

11. Where an
act or omission is an offence under more than one Act of the Parliament of
Canada, whether punishable by indictment or on summary conviction, a person who
does the act or makes the omission is, unless a contrary intention appears,
subject to proceedings under any of those Acts, but is not liable to be
punished more than once for the same offence.

The three counts dealing with the sums received
from Artek Film Productions, Paul Legault and André Legault are, like the three
other counts, based on the same act viewed in different ways. This act
consisted of having, while an official, accepted this reward from these
persons. In the first count of the indictment the act is characterized as a
crime because the consideration for it was an alleged exercise of influence in
connection with the transaction of business with the Government. In the second
count the same act is characterized as a crime because it was done without the
consent in writing of the head of the branch, and involved persons having
dealings with the Government. Finally, in the third count this act is
characterized as a crime on the same basis as in the first, but with the
further allegation that it constituted a breach of trust.

In The King v. Quon[15], which upheld a deci-

[Page 782]

sion quashing a conviction for unlawful
possession of a firearm, on the ground that such conviction had been pronounced
concurrently with a conviction for armed robbery involving possession of the
same weapon at the same time, Kellock J. said (at pp. 519-520):

In approaching the question as to the
proper view to be taken of the meaning of the statute, I think there are well
settled principles to be kept in mind. The first is illustrated by Wemyss v.
Hopkins (1875) L.R. 10 Q.B. 378. In that case a complaint was preferred
against the appellant under 5 and 6 Wm. IV, c. 50 (1), s. 78, for that
being the driver of a carriage on a highway, by negligence or wilful
misbehaviour, viz., by striking a certain horse ridden by the respondent,
caused her hurt and damage. The appellant was convicted on this charge and
fined. Subsequently a complaint was preferred against him under 24 and 25
Vict., c. 100, s. 42, for that he did on the same date as that in question
on the first complaint and by reason of the same conduct, unlawfully assault,
strike, and otherwise abuse the respondent. On this charge he was also
convicted and fined. The question for the court was whether, the appellant
having been convicted on the first, could also be convicted on the second
complaint. It was held he could not, Blackburn, J., at p. 381 said:

The defence does not arise on a plea of
autrefois convict, but on the well established rule at common law, that when a
person has been convicted and punished for an offence by a court of competent
jurisdiction, transit in rem judicatam, that is, the conviction shall be
a bar to all further proceedings for the same offence, and he shall not be punished
again for the same matter; otherwise there might be two different punishments
for the same offence… It is necessary in the present case to have it proved…
that on a former occasion the appellant was charged with the same assault,
although not in the same words, yet in terms the same, and that he was then
convicted and punished.

The above principle is embodied in
section 14 of the Code. The common law principle is as applicable,
in my opinion, in the case of two sections of the same statute as in the case
of separate statutes.

[Page 783]

There is also to be borne in mind the
second principle, as stated by Cockburn, C.J., in Queen v. Elrington (1861)
1 B.&.S. 688 at 696, viz.: “the well established principle of our criminal
law that a series of charges shall not be preferred and, whether a party
accused of a minor offence is acquitted or convicted, he shall not be charged
again on the same facts in a more aggravated form”. Section 907 embodies this
latter principle.

What was at that time s. 907  of the Criminal
Code  is now s. 537 , which deals with the defence of autrefois
acquit or autrefois convict. This provision applies to a case where,
provided it can be made identical by amendment, “the matter… is the same, in
whole or in part”.

Relying essentially on the aforementioned
opinion of Kellock J., the Court of Appeal of Ontario held in Regina v.
Siggins[16] that
it should quash a conviction for unlawful possession of certain goods,
pronounced concurrently with a conviction for theft of the same goods. MacKay, J.A.,
said (at p. 285):

The offence of theft where the person
charged is the actual thief, necessarily involves the taking of possession by
him of the article stolen, and the person found in possession of goods which he
himself has stolen has also committed the offence of having in his possession
goods knowing them to have been stolen.

The Crown is entitled to lay both charges
against him, but at the trial, if the jury convict of theft they should not
convict on the charge of unlawful possession. If they acquit on the charge of
theft they may then consider and, if they see fit to do so, convict on the
charge of unlawful possession.

After referring to the opinion of Kellock J., he
also noted that subs. (2) (now subs. (3)) of s. 7  of the Criminal Code  recognizes
defences at common law, even when they are not expressly enshrined in an
enactment.

[Page 784]

In Kienapple v. The Queen, a case on
which all members of this Court sat, the majority judgment rendered today
follows the principle of the Siggins case and Kellock’s opinion above
quoted.

On that basis I fail to see how we could uphold
more than one conviction against appellant for what is in substance the same
matter namely the unlawful taking of sums of money from persons having dealings
with the government of which he was an official.

Accordingly, only the conviction on the second
and eighth counts should be allowed to stand. Further, as the Court trying the
case accepted the sincerity of the deposition given by the accused, the sum
mentioned in the second count should be reduced to the amount admitted by him,
that is to $12,000 (Lake v. The Queen)[17].

Finally, appellant complains that, the Court of
Appeal having found him guilty, sentenced him without giving him an opportunity
to make submissions on sentence. This complaint is well‑founded, in the
light of our later decision in Lowry and Lepper v. The Queen[18].

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and
quash the conviction on the first, third, seventh and ninth counts, vary the
conviction on the second count by reducing the sum mentioned to $12,000, and
remit the case to the Court of Appeal of the Province of Quebec for it to pass
sentence on the second and eighth counts of the indictment, after hearing the
accused.

On the rehearing the judgment of Laskin C.J. and
Martland, Judson, Spence, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was
delivered by

CHIEF JUSTICE LASKIN—The rehearing ordered in
this case pursuant to Rule 61 was limited to the question whether multiple
convic-

[Page 785]

tions for the same matters had been entered
against the appellant, contrary to the principle in Kienapple v. The Queen[19].

I am of the opinion that the appeal should be
allowed on this ground, and that, accordingly, the convictions on counts two
and eight only should stand, and that the convictions on counts one, three,
seven and nine should be set aside. The case should be remitted to the Court of
Appeal of Quebec to pass sentence on the accused in respect of the two counts
on which he stands convicted but only after hearing submissions on his behalf,
in accordance with the principle of Lowry and Lepper v. The Queen[20].

RITCHIE J.—I have not changed the view which I
expressed at the original hearing of this appeal, but having regard to the
concession made by counsel appearing on behalf of the Attorney General of
Canada at the re-hearing to the effect that this case was governed by the
judgment of this Court in Kienapple v. The Queen, I agree that the
matter should be disposed of in the manner proposed by the Chief Justice.

Appeal allowed in part.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Two convictions for same
act—Whether second conviction proper—Charges to be treated as
alternatives—Whether unlawful sexual intercourse included offence of
rape—Criminal Code , ss. 7(2) , 11 , 140 , 143 , 144 , 146 , 147 , 535 , 536 , 537 ,
743(2) .

The appellant was indicted jointly with
another male person on two counts involving a thirteen year old girl, namely,
rape contrary to s. 143  and unlawful carnal knowledge of a female under
fourteen years of age contrary to s. 146(1)  of the Criminal Code . Following
the direction of the trial judge the jury brought in a verdict of guilty on
both counts and the accused was sentenced to two concurrent terms of ten years.
The Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissed the accused’s appeal without written
or recorded reasons and leave to appeal to this Court was given on the question
whether the accused, having been convicted of rape, should in respect of the
same single act have also been convicted of sexual intercourse with a female
under the age of fourteen, not being his wife, an issue which had not been
raised in the Courts below.

Held (Fauteux
C.J., Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Judson,
Spence, Pigeon, Laskin and Dickson JJ: Although there have been cases where
multiple convictions were registered, when in substance only one “crime” has
been committed, refusal to interfere on appeal was justified because only one
sentence was imposed. The better practice, however, is to avoid multiple
convictions and in relation to potentially multiple convictions, it is
important to know the verdict on the first count since if that verdict is
guilty

[Page 730]

and the same or substantially the same
elements make up the second count charged the situation invites the application
of the rule against multiple convictions. While in the present case there is
the superadded element of age in s. 146(1)  this does not operate to distinguish
unlawful carnal knowledge from rape. Age under fourteen is material where
consent to the sexual intercourse is present but once that is ruled out it
becomes meaningless as a distinguishing feature of the offence of rape and
unlawful carnal knowledge.

Per Fauteux C.J.
and Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting: The appellant was not
convicted twice in respect of the same offence. The cases dealing with double
punishment are not relevant to the issue of law which is before us and which is
the legal power to convict an accused of two separate offences in respect of
the same act.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, dismissing,
without written reasons, an appeal from the appellant’s convictions for (1)
rape contrary to s. 143  of the Criminal Code  and (2) unlawful carnal
knowledge of a female under fourteen years of age. Appeal allowed, conviction
for unlawful carnal knowledge quashed, Fauteux C.J. and Abbott, Martland and
Ritchie JJ. dissenting.

[Page 731]

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—For the
reasons given by Mr. Justice Ritchie and the comments relevant to this
case which I made in Doré v. The Attorney General of Canada[1] I would dismiss the appeal.

MARTLAND J. (dissenting)—I agree with the
reasons of my brother Ritchie. I would like to add the following comment. The
point which is in issue in the present appeal was never raised at trial, or
before the Court of Appeal.

Presumably, when leave to appeal to this Court
was granted it was felt that the outcome of the appeal, if successful, would
have some practical favourable consequences for the appellant. However, in the
course of his argument, counsel for the appellant conceded that if the appeal
succeeded the appellant would not be entitled to obtain a new trial in respect
of both the charges against him. He was still subject to the sentence on the
charge of rape, which sentence was exactly the same as, and concurrent with,
the sentence on the other charge.

In the result, therefore, the appeal to this
Court constituted an academic exercise, the only result of which, if
successful, will be to prevent the addition to the appellant’s already lengthy
criminal record of a conviction for the crime of sexual intercourse with a
female under the age of fourteen, not being his wife, which crime it is clear
that he committed.

The Chief Justice and Abbott and Martland JJ.
concurred with the judgment delivered by

RITCHIE J. (dissenting)—I have had the
advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of my brother Laskin in which he
has recounted the circumstances giving rise to this appeal.

The appeal came on for hearing pursuant to an
order of this Court granting leave to appeal in accordance with the provisions
of s. 618(1) (b) of the Criminal Code . The jurisdiction conferred
by that section is, of course, confined to ques-

[Page 732]

tions of law in the strict sense and the order
which was granted in the present case reads as follows:

IT IS ORDERED that leave to appeal be and
the same is hereby granted limited to the question whether the accused,
having been convicted of rape, should in respect of the same single act have
also been convicted of sexual intercourse with a female under the age of
fourteen, not being his wife.

(The italics are my own).

In my understanding it has been the general
practice of this Court when hearing an appeal pursuant to an order granting
leave to confine itself exclusively to the question or questions posed in such
an order, and even if the order here in question had not contained express
words of limitation, I think it would be contrary to this practice to entertain
the appeal on any ground other than the one which is expressly specified.

It is, therefore, important in my view to
determine at the outset the exact limits of the question with which this appeal
is concerned.

It will at once be apparent that the issue
before us is confined to the validity of the second conviction. No
question is raised as to the propriety of the judge’s action in sentencing the
appellant as he did on both counts if the second conviction is valid, and
indeed, while that was a matter over which the Court of Appeal had
jurisdiction, this Court is not clothed with the same authority.

The appellant was charged, together with one
Wayne Ronald Constable, that he raped one Jacqueline Mary Chafe contrary to the
Criminal Code , and second, that he had sexual intercourse with the same
girl, she being a female under the age of fourteen years who was not his wife,
contrary to the Criminal Code . The two accused were arraigned separately
on each of the two charges and the appellant pleaded “not guilty” to both. The
two offences with which the appellant was charged are defined in the

[Page 733]

following terms in ss. 143  and 146(1)  of the Criminal
Code  as amended by 1972 (Can.), c. 13,s.70 :

143. A male person commits rape when he has
sexual intercourse with a female person who is not his wife,

(a) without her consent, or

(b) with her consent if the
consent

(i) is extorted by threats or fear of
bodily harm,

(ii) is obtained by personating her
husband, or

(iii) is obtained by false and fraudulent
representations as to the nature and quality of the act.

146. (1) Every male person who has sexual
intercourse with a female person who

(a) is not his wife, and

(b) is under the age of
fourteen years,

whether or not he believes that she is
fourteen years of age or more, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable
to imprisonment for life.

Every one who commits the indictable offence of
rape is also liable to imprisonment for life.

I think it of first importance to recognize that
the offences created by ss. 143  and 146(1)  are separate and distinct offences
and it appears to be common ground that the latter offence is not included in
the former. The fundamental difference between the two offences is that a
conviction under s. 146(1)  can only be sustained if the victim is under
fourteen years of age, whereas the age of the victim forms no part of the
offence described in s. 143 . The provisions of s. 140  also make it clear that
consent is no defence to a charge under s. 146(1) , whereas, of course, lack of
consent is an essential ingredient of rape.

[Page 734]

It was contended on behalf of the appellant that
as a conviction for rape negatives consent, it also precludes a conviction
under s. 146(1)  in respect of the same act because where a lack of consent has
been proved, age ceases to be a distinguishing factor between the two offences.
This reasoning appears to me to be predicated on the assumption that the only
difference between the two offences is that consent is excluded as a defence to
s. 146(1)  by the provisions of s. 140  and to overlook the fact that an accused
charged under s. 146(1)  would be equally guilty under that section whether
his victim had consented or not provided that she was under 14 years of age and
not his wife. Consent or lack of consent form no part of the offence described
in s. 146(1) , but it contains an ingredient which is not included in a
conviction for rape, namely, the age of the child victim.

The situation in the present case is that the
act for which the appellant was convicted of rape also constituted the
additional offence of having sexual intercourse with a female person under the
age of fourteen years who was not his wife. The purpose and effect of s. 146(1) 
is in my view to protect female children under the age of fourteen years from
sexual advances leading to intercourse by male persons over that age, (see s.
147 ) and I cannot subscribe to a result which relieves an assailant from the
consequences of violating a child on the ground that his act also constitutes
the crime of rape.

Under these circumstances I am unable to see how
it can be said that the appellant did not commit both offences.

It is contended, however, that, because it is an
accepted principle of our law that no one shall be punished twice for the same
offence, it must follow, according to the same principle, that nobody can be
convicted more than once in

[Page 735]

respect of the same act. The chief authority to
which we were referred in support of this contention was the unanimous judgment
of this Court in Cox and Paton v. The Queen[2], where the accused had been
convicted on two counts, each of which was found to be referrable to the same
conspiracy and Cartwright J. (as he then was) held that both convictions could
not stand on the ground that “It is the same conspiracy which is alleged in
both counts and it would be contrary to the law that the accused should be
punished more than once for the same offence.”, (page 516).

In that case the accused, having been charged
with conspiracy, the essence of the offence was the illegal agreement. (See Belyea
v. the King[3],
Paradis v. The King[4], and
particularly McDonald v. The Queen[5]
at p. 195). There was but one agreement alleged and the fact that the
conspirators were shown to have had more than one breach of the law in
contemplation in forming that agreement did not convert the conspiracy into two
offences so as to justify separate convictions in respect of each.

With the greatest respect for those who may
entertain a different opinion, I do not view the judgment in Cox and Paton v.
The Queen as authority for the proposition that an accused cannot be
charged and convicted on two separate offences when both those offences had
been committed by means of a single act.

It appears to me that in enacting s. 11  of the Criminal
Code  Parliament recognized that more than one offence may be committed as a
result of a single act. Section 11  reads as follows:

Where an act or omission is an offence
under more than one Act of the Parliament of Canada, whether punishable by
indictment or on summary conviction, a person who does the act or makes the
omission is,

[Page 736]

unless a contrary intention appears,
subject to proceedings under any of those Acts, but is not liable to be
punished more than once for the same offence.

A similar section appears as s. 33 of the Interpretation
Act 1889 (U.K.) c. 63 which
reads:

Where an act or omission constituted an
offence under two or more Acts, or both under an Act or at common law,… the
offender shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be liable to be
prosecuted and punished under either or any of those Acts or at common law, but
shall not be liable to be punished twice for the same offence.

In interpreting the effect of this section,
Humphreys J. in Rex v. Thomas[6], said
at p. 204:

It is not the law that a person shall not
be liable to be punished twice for the same act; no one has ever said so in any
case, and the Interpretation Act does not say so. What the Act says is that a
person ‘shall not be liable to be punished twice for the same offence’. Not
only is it not the law, but it never has been the law, and that it is not the
law was expressly decided in the highest criminal Court in the land then
existing the Court for the Consideration of Crown Cases Reserved, as far back
as 1867, in Morris (1867), 10 Cox C.C. 480.

In the Thomas case the accused had been
convicted of assault and was thereafter tried again for manslaughter arising
out of the same facts, his victim having died after his first conviction as a
result of the assault, but the observations of Humphreys J. are by no means
limited to such a case as can be seen from the reasons for judgment of Lord
Reading in R. v. Barron[7], where
the accused, having been convicted of sodomy, was also charged with an act of
gross indecency with another male person and Lord Reading took occasion to
comment on

[Page 737]

the observations of Hawkins J. in R. v. King[8], where that judge had said:

It is against the very first principles of
the criminal law that a man should be placed twice in jeopardy upon the same
facts: the offences are practically the same, though not their legal operation.

As to this Lord Reading said, at p. 575:

It is quite plain that the learned judge
did not intend to lay down and did not lay down as a general principle of law
that a man cannot be placed twice in jeopardy upon the same facts if the
offences are different. The statement obviously refers to a case where the
offences are the same…

Being satisfied that the first and second counts
of this indictment charge separate offences and that the second is not included
in the first, I think it must follow that the defence of autrefois convict is
not available to the appellant, but it was strongly contended that the plea of res
judicata or issue estoppel was available in this case to preclude a
conviction being entered on the second count after a finding of guilty on the
first. In regard to this last argument I have been greatly assisted by a
textbook entitled Res Judicata prepared by Spencer-Bower and Turner 2nd
Ed. (1969) where it is said at p. 391, para. 479:

As has been pointed out in a previous
chapter, the plea of autrefois convict is the process by which the
doctrine of merger in judgment becomes effective in criminal jurisdiction. Once
the accused has been tried for an offence, and convicted of it, that is an end
to his criminal liability, and his conduct cannot serve as the basis of a
second accusation of the same crime. As in civil, so in criminal law—transit
in rem judicatam: the criminal liability of the prisoner for the offence
which he has committed is merged in his

[Page 738]

conviction for that offence, once it has
been obtained, and his liability to be punished is discharged by the punishment
(if any) which has been inflicted in respect thereof.

It is particularly to be noticed, however,
that while the maxim nemo debet bis puniri pro uno delicto forbids a
second verdict of guilty for the same crime, it does not forbid a second
prosecution for the same conduct, in cases in which such conduct may
amount to two separate crimes. Whether it is just to prosecute an accused again
after one conviction, may be debated on the facts of the particular case; but
the maxim will not forbid it. Neither will an exemption from criminal liability
on the second charge follow from the application of the maxim transit in rem
judicatam. What has passed into res judicata is the offence of
which he was convicted, together with those other offences of which he could
have been convicted on the same facts on the same indictment.

I think it is clear that the words “same
indictment” as employed in the last sentence of this quotation are, for the
purpose of this case, synonymous with “second count”. (See s. 520 (2) of the Criminal
Code .)

The comment made by Lord Morris in the course of
his very comprehensive judgment in Connelly v. The Director of Public
Prosecutions[9], at pp.
1307 and 1308, also appears to me to be of assistance in determining the
validity of a second conviction arising out of the same facts. Lord Morris
there said:

The principle seems clearly to have been
recognised that if someone had been either convicted or acquitted of an offence
he could not later be charged with the same offence or with what was in effect
the same offence. In determining whether or not he was being so charged the
court was not confined to an examination of the record. The reality of the
matter was to be ascertained. That, however, did not mean that if two separate
offences were committed at the same time a conviction or an acquittal in
respect of one would be any bar to a subsequent prosecution in respect of the
other. It was the offence or offences that had to be considered. Was there in
substance one

[Page 739]

offence—or had someone committed two or
more offences?

In considering the question posed by the last
sentence in this passage, I think it desirable to make reference to the case of
The King v. Quon[10], and
R. v. Siggins[11].

In the Quon case the accused had been
charged on two counts. The first laid under s. 446(c) of the Code alleged
robbery while armed; the second laid under s. 122 of the Code alleged
possession of a firearm capable of being concealed upon the person while
committing “any criminal offence”. At his trial Quon pleaded guilty to the
first charge and he was also found guilty of the second offence and sentenced
to two years on each count. The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction on the
second count and this decision was affirmed on appeal to this Court. In the
course of his reasons for judgment, Mr. Justice Kellock made it clear that
his reason for affirming the dismissal on the second count was that he regarded
the offence there charged, not as a separate offence, but as an essential part
of the offence charged in the first count. In the course of these reasons he
said, at p. 525:

Coming to section 446(c),
Parliament has by this provision, declared that for that offence, involving as
one of its main elements, the presence on the offender of an offensive weapon,
the penalty may be imprisonment for life and whipping. That is expressly the
penalty for the totality of that conduct. I do not think therefore, that there
is to be attributed to Parliament the intention that one part of that conduct
(where the weapon in question is a firearm) may be made the subject of a
separate charge under section 122,…

In reaching this conclusion, Mr. Justice
Kellock had occasion to quote from the judgment of

[Page 740]

Blackburn J. in Wemyss v. Hopkins[12], the passage to which reference has
been made in the reasons for judgment of my brother Laskin, the most relevant
part of which reads as follows:

The defence does not arise on a plea of
autrefois convict, but on the well established rule at common law, that when a
person has been convicted and punished for an offence by a court of competent
jurisdiction, transit in rem judicatam, that is, the conviction shall be
a bar to all further proceedings for the same offence, and he shall not be
punished again for the same matter;…

At the conclusion of this quotation,
Mr. Justice Kellock observed:

The above principle is embodied in
section 14 of the Code. The common law principle is as applicable,
in my opinion, in the case of two sections of the same statute as in the
case of separate statutes.

Reference to the Criminal Code  as it
existed in 1948 makes it plain that Mr. Justice Kellock was referring to
s. 15  rather than s. 14  in making the last-quoted comment. Section 14  of
the Criminal Code  as it then read abolished the distinction between
felony and misdemeanour, but s. 15  was the precursor of the present s. 11 , and
I am in any event in agreement that the provisions of that section, viewed in
the light of what Humphreys J. said in R. v. Thomas, supra, respecting
the equivalent English section, are just as applicable in the case of two
sections of the Criminal Code  as they are in the case of two
statutes. One act may thus be the subject of convictions under two sections of
the Criminal Code , but only one punishment can be imposed for the same
offence.

The clear distinction between the Quon case
and the case at bar is that the age of the victim is not one of the essential
elements in the offence of rape and the same distinction applies to the case of
Rex v. Siggins, supra, in which the reasons for judgment delivered by
MacKay J.A.

[Page 741]

on behalf of the majority of the Court were
clearly predicated on the assumption that:

The offence of theft where the person
charged is the actual thief, necessarily involves the taking of possession by
him of the article stolen, and the person found in the possession of goods
which he himself has stolen has also committed the offence of having in his
possession goods knowing them to have been stolen.

I do not purport to either approve or disapprove
this assumption, but I mention it simply to indicate that the counts charging
unlawful possession in that case were quashed because the Court took the view
that theft “necessarily involves the taking of possession” whereas, as I have
said, rape does not necessarily involve an offence under s. 146(1) .

In summary, the position in the present case is
this. The appellant has been charged with two separate and distinct offences
under the Criminal Code . He was tried in respect of both charges. He was
guilty of both offences. In those circumstances, on what basis can it be said
that he cannot be convicted of both? There is nothing in the Criminal Code  to
preclude it. He was not being convicted twice in respect of the same offence.
The cases dealing with double punishment are not relevant to the issue of law
which is before us, which is concerned with the legal power to convict in
respect of two offences, and not with the question of sentence.

For all these reasons I would dismiss this
appeal.

The judgment of Judson, Spence, Pigeon, Laskin
and Dickson JJ. was delivered by

LASKIN J.—There are no facts in dispute in this
appeal and only the barest narration is necessary for its disposition. The
appellant accused was indicted jointly with another male person on two counts
of sexual offences against a girl admittedly thirteen years of age at the time.
The offences charged were (1) rape, con-

[Page 742]

trary to s. 143  of the Criminal Code , and
(2) unlawful carnal knowledge of a female under fourteen years of age, contrary
to s. 146(1) .

The relevant portion of the trial judge’s charge
to the jury in respect of these two counts was as follows:

As to Kienapple, your possible verdicts are
guilty or not guilty on Count 1, rape; if you find him guilty on Count 1, then
you need not consider any of the included offences that I am about to mention
and mentioned previously and you may also proceed at once to find him guilty on
Count 2, because a conviction for rape also includes a finding of intercourse
with a girl. It is admitted that she is under fourteen. So that you may find
him guilty on Counts 1 and 2, but if you find him not guilty on Count 1, that
is of rape, then you should consider whether it has been proven that he is
guilty in Count 2, that is of having had sexual intercourse with a girl under
fourteen. If you find him guilty of rape, then you stop right there because
that takes care of the other count. If you find him not guilty of rape, go on
to consider whether there was intercourse in Count 2.

The jury, on this direction, brought in a
verdict of guilty on both counts, and the accused was subsequently sentenced to
two concurrent terms of imprisonment of ten years. The Court of Appeal of Ontario dismissed the accused’s appeal
without written or recorded reasons. Leave to appeal to this Court was given on
the following question:

Whether the accused, having been convicted
of rape, should in respect of the same single act have also been convicted of
sexual intercourse with a female under the age of fourteen, not being his wife.

I should say that the issue raised by this
question was not raised in the Courts below.

[Page 743]

Sections 143  and 146(1) , as amended by 1972
(Can.), c. 13, s. 70, reads as
follows:

143. A male person commits rape when he has
sexual intercourse with a female person who is not his wife,

(a) without her consent, or

(b) with her consent if the
consent

(i) is extorted by threats or fear of
bodily harm,

(ii) is obtained by personating her husband,
or

(iii) is obtained by false and fraudulent
representations as to the nature and quality of the act.

146. (1) Every male person who has sexual
intercourse with a female person who

(a) is not his wife, and

(b) is under the age of
fourteen years,

whether or not he believes that she is
fourteen years of age or more, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable
to imprisonment for life.

The punishment for rape is prescribed by s. 144 
which, as also amended by 1972 (Can.), c. 13, s. 70, reads now as follows:

Every one who commits rape is guilty of an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.

At the material time, so far as the charges
against the accused were concerned, the punishments provisions for the two
offences also included liability to be whipped. Section 140  is material to
the definition of the offence under s. 146(1)  in providing that the fact that
there was consent to the commission of the offence is not a defence.

It is common ground that unlawful carnal
knowledge under s. 146(1)  is not an included offence on a charge of rape.
Indeed, it could not be because s. 146(1)  embraces two situations, one of which
has all the ingredients of rape but is in respect of a female under age
fourteen, and the second is inconsistent with rape in that there is consent. In
a case therefore where there has

[Page 744]

been sexual intercourse with a girl under age
fourteen and the question of consent is in issue (the burden being on the Crown
on a charge of rape to negative it beyond a reasonable doubt), it is entirely
understandable that the Crown would seek to indict an accused on two counts, as
in the present case. Where the jury brings in a verdict of guilty on the first
count of rape, there being only one act of sexual intercourse involved with the
same girl, it has perforce found that the sexual intercourse was without
consent and there can be no finding of guilt on the second count on the basis
of consent, albeit this is not a defence. It is said, however, that there is no
inconsistency in finding the accused guilty under s. 146(1)  simply on the basis
of the verdict of guilty of rape; such a finding, it is contended, merely
fastens on that aspect of s. 146(1)  which I described as paralleling all the
ingredients of rape but in respect of a female under age fourteen.

It is plain, of course, that Parliament has
defined two offences in ss. 143  and 146(1) , but there is an overlap in the
sense that one embraces the other when the sexual intercourse has been with a
girl under age fourteen without her consent. It is my view that in such a case,
if the accused has been charged, first, with rape and, secondly, with a s.
146(1)  offence, and there is a verdict of guilty of rape, the second charge
falls as an alternative charge and the jury should be so directed.
Correlatively, however, the jury should also be directed that if they find the
accused not guilty of rape they may still find him guilty under s. 146(1)  where
sexual intercourse with a girl under age fourteen has been proved.

The rationale of my conclusion that the charges
must be treated as alternative if there is

[Page 745]

a verdict of guilty of rape on the first count,
that there should not be multiple convictions for the same delict against the
same girl, has a long history in the common law. A convenient beginning is with
the maxim expressed in Hudson v. Lee[13],
at p. 990, “nemo debet bis puniri pro uno delicto”, which although framed
in terms of double punishment, has come to be understood as directed also
against double or multiple convictions; in short, nemo bis vexari as
well as nemo bis puniri. This was exemplified in the unanimous judgment
of this Court in Cox and Paton v. The Queen[14], which involved, inter alia, convictions
of the accused on two counts, numbered (1) and (3), for conspiracy to steal and
conspiracy to defraud, both relating to the same money and securities.
Cartwright J., as he then was, speaking for this Court, held that the Manitoba
Court of Appeal had properly quashed one of the convictions. He put the matter
in these words (at p. 516):

The reason that the convictions on counts 1
and 3 cannot both be supported is not that they are “mutually destructive”, as
was said of the counts in R. v. Mills [1959] Cr.L.Rev. 662, but rather
that if both were allowed to stand the accused would in reality be convicted
twice of the same offence. It is the same conspiracy which is alleged in the
two counts and it would be contrary to law that the accused should be punished
more than once for the same offence.

Of course, in a strict sense, Cox and Paton was
no more a case of multiple convictions for the same offence than is the present
case. Rather it was a case, as is the present one, of multiple convictions for
the same matter. It is clear to me that in the context of the decision in Cox
and Paton the word “offence” was used in

[Page 746]

the sense attributed to it by Pollock B. in The
Queen v. Miles[15] at
p. 436, where he said:

At the trial it was proved on behalf of the
prisoner, and admitted by counsel for the prosecution, that the first four
counts of the indictment referred to the same matter as the offence mentioned
in the record. In substance, therefore, the plea and the evidence establish
that there was but one offence, and that the acts done by the defendant in
respect of which he was convicted, by whatever legal name they might be called,
were the same as those to which the indictment referred, and therefore the rule
of law Nemo debet bis puniri pro uno delicto applies, and if the prisoner were
guilty of the modified crime only he could not be guilty of the same acts with
the addition of malice and design.

That case involved a charge of wounding laid
under a statute. There had been a previous conviction for assault at common
law, and although the offences were different it was held that the accused
could not be convicted again for the same matter. Reference was made to The
Queen v. Miles by Humphreys J. in Rex v. Thomas[16], at p. 30 as follows:

The accused entered a plea in bar in which
he alleged that the assault of which he had been convicted previously and the
wounding and battery in the first four counts of the indictment, were one and
the same assault and battery and not other and different. The Court for the
Consideration of Crown Cases Reserved upheld the appellant’s plea, which they
regarded as an informal plea of autrefois convict, and it is important to
examine the reasons why they so held. All the judges considered that the plea
and the evidence established that there was one offence only committed by the
accused. It was one and the same assault, although in three of the counts that
assault was alleged to have been accompanied by circumstances of aggravation.

Blackburn J. had earlier expressed a similar

[Page 747]

view in his judgment in Wemyss v. Hopkins[17] at p. 381 when he said (in respect
of a case where there were successive prosecutions under different statutes):

I think the fact that the appellant had
been convicted by justices under one Act of Parliament for what amounted to an
assault is a bar to a conviction under another Act of Parliament for the same
assault. The defence does not arise on a plea of autrefois convict, but on the
well-established rule at common law, that where a person has been convicted and
punished for an offence by a Court of competent jurisdiction, transit in rem judicatam,
that is, the conviction shall be a bar to all further proceedings for the same
offence, and he shall not be punished again for the same matter; otherwise
there might be two different punishments for the same offence.

This statement was quoted with approval by
Kellock J. in The King v. Quon[18], at
p. 519. In Connelly v. Director of Public Prosecutions[19], Lord Pearce, at p. 1362 referred
to Wemyss v. Hopkins and like cases for the proposition that “the court
in its criminal jurisdiction retained a power to prevent a repetition of
prosecutions even when it did not fall within the exact limits of the pleas in
bar”.

The pleas in bar are dealt with in ss. 535  to
537  and s. 743(2)  of the Criminal Code . So far as autrefois convict is
concerned, the relevant provisions, for present purposes, are ss. 536  and 537(1) (a)
which speak, respectively, of “the identity of the charges” and, in that
connection, “that the matter on which the accused was given in charge on the
former trial is the same in whole or in part”. This last quoted provision in s.
537(1) (a) suggests that, so far at least as successive prosecutions are
involved, the plea of autrefois convict goes beyond strict identity of
offences and is akin to res judicata. But even if the pleas of autrefois
be narrowly construed,

[Page 748]

res judicata as a
common law defence to a charge is preserved by s. 7(2)  of the Criminal Code .

In my view, the term res judicata best
expresses the theory of precluding multiple convictions for the same delict,
although the matter is the basis of two separate offences. In Studies in
Criminal Law (1964) by Morris and Howard, the authors in an essay entitled Res
Judicata in the Criminal Law, at p. 252, say that “res judicata as a
general principle concerns itself only with the question whether an issue has
been decided not with the question in whose favour the decision went”. Although
transit in rem judicatam, as used by Blackburn J. in Wemyss v.
Hopkins, supra, is more appropriate to a plea of autrefois acquit or
issue estoppel, it is clear that he was concerned with a matter more akin to
double jeopardy and autrefois convict, as was Cartwright J. in the Cox
and Paton case. Where there has been a previous conviction of an accused,
whether in a former trial or on one count of a multicount indictment, issue
estoppel is obviously an inappropriate term to urge against a further
conviction of another offence. So too would be autrefois convict in its
strict connotation; hence, the utility of res judicata.

On this view, nothing is added or subtracted by
s. 11  of the Criminal Code  which reads as follows:

Where an act or omission is an offence
under more than one Act of the Parliament of Canada, whether punishable by
indictment or on summary conviction, a person who does the act or makes the omission
is,

[Page 749]

unless a contrary intention appears,
subject to proceedings under any of those Acts, but is not liable to be
punished more than once for the same offence.

This provision had its origin, as a general
provision, in An Act respecting Punishments, Pardons and the Commutation of
Sentences, R.S.C. 1886, c. 181, s. 3 where it was as follows:

Whenever any offender is punishable under
two or more Acts or two or more sections of the same Act, he may be tried
and punished under any of such Acts or sections, but no person shall be twice
punished for the same offence.

The above-quoted s. 3 was an amalgam of earlier
legislation having a particular application and found in The Offences
against the Person Act, 1869 (Can.), c. 20, ss. 40 and 41, The Wreck and
Salvage Act, 1873 (Can.), c. 55, s. 33, and The Breaches of Contract
Act, 1877 (Can.), c. 35, s. 6. It was carried literally into the first Criminal
Code , 1892 (Can.), c. 29, s. 933, but in the 1906 revision it
underwent a change to conform with s. 33 of the United Kingdom Interpretation
Act, 1889 (U.K.), c. 63. The present s. 11 of the Criminal Code  is
in substance a reenactment of the United Kingdom s. 33, but with a slight alteration in language. In its material
terms, it conforms to the comparable United Kingdom section. I find it a curious provision because in its opening words
(“where an act or omission is an offence under more than one Act…”) it appears
to reflect the maxim nemo bis vexari, and yet in its concluding words
(“not liable to be punished more than once for the same offence”) it reflects
the maxim nemo debet bis puniri pro uno delicto’.

Humphreys J. in Rex v. Thomas, supra, insisted
on a literal application of those concluding words, rejecting a text-book gloss
on them as embracing “act” and “cause” as well as “offence” in the strict
sense. I do not think that his illustration of successive successful prosecu-

[Page 750]

tions for assault and for manslaughter (after
the assault victim dies), as shown in Regina v. Morris[20], is a convincing support for
reading s. 33 with literal emphasis on its concluding words and no emphasis on
its opening words. That situation and the one that was presented in Rex v.
Thomas itself (conviction of wounding with intent to murder, followed by an
indictment for murder when the victim dies) can stand on their own without
warranting a restrictive reading of the English s. 33 and our s. 11 . The
ensuing death brings into view a new relevant element not present when the
first conviction occurred. That is not so in the case at bar. I would note,
further, that if manslaughter and assault were charged in the same indictment
the accused could not be convicted of both because of the included offence
rule.

I cannot view s. 11  as modifying the scope of res
judicata, let alone the scope of the pleas of autrefois as defined
in ss. 535  to 537  of the Criminal Code . The relevant inquiry so far as res
judicata is concerned is whether the same cause or matter (rather than the
same offence) is comprehended by two or more offences. Moreover, it cannot be
the case that if an accused is tried on several counts charging different
offences, he is liable to be convicted and sentenced on each count, and yet if
he was tried and convicted on one only he would be entitled to set up the defence
of res judicata as a defence to other charges arising out of the same
cause or matter.

Although there have been cases where multiple
convictions were registered, when in substance only one “crime” has been
committed, refusal to interfere on appeal was justified on

[Page 751]

the “no substantial wrong” basis because only
one sentence was imposed: see Rex v. Lockett[21], Kelly v. The King[22]. The better practice, however, is
to avoid multiple convictions, as was done in the Cox and Paton case,
and earlier by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Regina v. Siggins[23], which relied on the opinion of
Kellock J. in The King v. Quon, supra. Siggins was a not uncommon case
of charging an alleged thief, found in possession of stolen goods, with both
theft and unlawful possession. It was there said (at p. 285) that

The Crown is entitled to lay both charges
against him, but at the trial, if the jury convict of theft they should not
convict on the charge of unlawful possession. If they acquit on the charge of
theft they may then consider and, if they see fit to do so, convict on the
charge of unlawful possession.

In short, in relation to potentially multiple
convictions, it is important to know the verdict on the first count, just as in
the case of successive prosecutions it is important to know the result of the
first trial: see Friedland, Double Jeopardy (1969), at p. 94.

If there is a verdict of guilty on the first
count and the same or substantially the same elements make up the offence
charged in a second count, the situation invites application of a rule against
multiple convictions: see Connelly v. Director of Public Prosecutions[24], at pp. 1305 and 1308, per Lord
Morris of Borth-y-Gest; cf. Rex v. Kendrick and Smith[25].

I test the matter in two other ways. If an
accused may be charged on two counts, as in the present case, and may properly
be found guilty on each for the one act of sexual intercourse with the same
girl, it should be open to the Crown to charge him successively in the

[Page 752]

same way. If it obtains a verdict of guilty of
rape it should be entitled to prefer another charge under s. 146(1)  in order to
obtain another verdict of guilty and seek a further consecutive sentence. Yet
it seems clear enough that on the second charge, res judicata would be a
complete defence since all the elements and facts supporting the conviction of
rape would necessarily be the same under s. 146(1) . Moreover, since the
occurrence involved a proved negation of consent, there could be no conviction
under the second aspect of s. 146(1)  when there has been a conviction of rape.

In saying that res judicata (as an
expression broader than autrefois convict) would be a complete defence,
I am applying the bis vexari principle against successive prosecutions,
a principle that, according to Morris and Howard, in the essay mentioned
earlier, is grounded on the Court’s power to protect an individual from an
undue exercise by the Crown of its power to prosecute and punish.

The second test is to reverse the order of the
counts in the present case. If on the first charge of an offence under s.
146(1)  the jury brings in a verdict of guilty, it would be inconsistent to find
an accused guilty on a second count of rape because there may have been
consent; and even if not, the considerations underlying res judicata would
preclude a verdict of guilty of rape. Of course, if on a first count under s.
146(1)  the accused was found not guilty, there could obviously be no finding of
guilty of rape unless on the basis that the girl involved was over age
fourteen; apart from that, there has been either no sexual intercourse proved
even if there was no consent, or there has been no sexual intercourse proved
albeit there was consent.

[Page 753]

Parliament’s power to constitute two separate
offences out of the same matter is not in question, but unless there is a clear
indication that multiple prosecutions and, indeed, multiple convictions are
envisaged, the common law principle expressed in the Cox and Paton case
should be followed. Neither the definitions of the respective offences nor
their history gives any support to the view that that common law principle has
been ousted. The limits of punishment are the same, and I have already spoken
of the ingredients of the respective offences. As a matter of history, the
present s. 146(1)  has its origin in s. 269 of the original Criminal Code  1892
(Can.), c. 29, which used the phrase “carnally knows” instead of “sexual
intercourse” both for that offence and for rape. Section 269  was taken
from s. 39 of the Offences against the Person Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 162
which, as amended by 1890 (Can.), c. 37, s. 12 raised the age ingredient
from ten years to fourteen and added whipping to the prescribed punishment of a
term for life or for not less than five years. When the Offences against the
Person Act was first enacted in Canada by 1869, c. 20, carnal knowledge of
a girl under ten was a capital offence under s. 51, as was rape; but, unlike
rape, which remained a capital offence until the enactment of 1953-1954 (Can.),
c. 51, s. 136 (although whipping was added in 1921 to the alternative maximum
punishment of life imprisonment), the maximum punishment for unlawful carnal
knowledge was changed to a life term by 1877 (Can.), c. 28, s. 2.

If any conclusion can be drawn from this short
history, it is that carnal knowledge of a victim under age ten, and later under
age fourteen, with its lesser punishment after 1877 (and until that for rape
was changed), was regarded

[Page 754]

as an alternative charge to rape, unnecessary
where there was no consent (since age was not and is not a necessary averment
in rape) but available where proof of want of consent could not be made or was
doubtful. As a practical matter, this situation invited statutory reform to
make it possible for a jury to return a verdict of guilty of unlawful carnal
knowledge on a charge of rape of a girl under fourteen. In England, this situation was met by the Criminal
Law Amendment Act, 1885 (U.K.), c. 69, s. 9, and similar enactments were made in the Australian
States: see Howard, Australian Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1970), pp. 172-3.
The English provision was continued under s. 37 of the Sexual Offences Act, 1956
(U.K.), c. 69, but was repealed by s. 10 and Schedule 3, s. 13(1)(d)(i) of the Criminal
Law Act, 1967 (U.K.), c. 58; and see Regina v. Hodgson[26].

We have never had legislation of that kind in Canada, and hence we continue to be
governed by the law as to included offences, which excludes a conviction under
s. 146(1)  on a charge of rape. Rex v. Marcus and Richmond[27], a judgment of the Ontario
Appellate Division, is particularly illustrative. The accused was charged with
rape the victim being a girl under age fourteen. There was some question at the
trial whether the Crown proved want of consent, and the trial judge charged the
jury, wrongly, that it was open to them to bring in a verdict of guilty of
unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under age fourteen. In setting aside the
verdict and ordering a new trial on the charge of rape the Court added (at p.
166) that “it is probable that the Crown will see fit to lay a further charge
based upon the provisions of sec.

[Page 755]

301 [now s. 146(1) ]”.

In the circumstances of the present case, the
superadded element of age in s. 146(1)  does not operate to distinguish unlawful
carnal knowledge from rape. Age under fourteen is certainly material where
consent to the sexual intercourse is present; but once that is ruled out, as it
is in the present case, it becomes meaningless as a distinguishing feature of
the offences of rape and unlawful carnal knowledge. No doubt, it can be taken
into account on sentence under s. 146(1) , but, equally, it can be considered
under s. 143 ; and I can see no basis for departing from the principle under
discussion if the age of the victim happens to be thirteen instead of fifteen
when the maximum punishment is the same under both s. 143  and s. 146(1) .

In the result, I would allow the appeal and
quash the conviction for unlawful carnal knowledge under s. 146(1) , and, of
course, the concurrent sentence of ten years imposed in consequence of that
conviction must also fall.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Driver of motor vehicle
submitting to breathalyzer test—Charge laid under s. 236  of Criminal
Code —No evidence adduced that arresting officer had reasonable grounds for
believing accused driving while impaired—Admissibility of certificate of
analysis—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 234, 235, 236, 237.

The appellant was charged with unlawfully
driving a motor vehicle, having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the
proportion thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100
millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 236  of the Criminal Code . Although
there was no evidence adduced that the arresting constable had any reasonable
or probable grounds for believing that an offence under s. 234 of the Code
had been committed, the appellant submitted to a breathalyzer test and a
certificate of analysis was admitted in evidence. The Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Alberta dismissed an appeal by way of stated case from the
conviction of the accused and an appeal with leave was then brought to this
Court.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be
dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: As held by the Appellate Division,
the absence of reasonable and probable grounds for belief of impairment may
afford a defence to a charge of refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test laid
under s. 235(2) of the Code, but it does not render inadmissible
certificate evidence in the case of a charge under s. 236 .

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ., dissenting: The requirement in
both s. 237(1)(c) and s. 237(1)(f) that the
breath test should have been made pursuant to the demand under s. 235(1)
was inserted by Parliament with the intention of limiting those cases where the
analysis could be proved by a certificate of a

[Page 184]

qualified technician and then that such
analysis would provide prima facie proof of the proportion of alcohol in
the blood of the accused only to those cases where the peace officer had, on
reasonable and probable grounds, believed that the accused was or had been
driving while impaired. This was only a proper requirement when the test was
one which the citizen was required to submit to on penalty of committing an
offence if he refused.

Accordingly, there having been no evidence
adduced that the arresting officer had reasonable grounds for believing the
appellant to have been driving while impaired, the Crown could not prove its
case by the production of the certificate of the “qualified technician” since
it was not the result of a test taken “pursuant to a demand under
subsection 235(1)” as required by s. 237(1)(f).

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of Alberta, Appellate Division[1],
dismissing an appeal by way of stated case from the conviction of the appellant
by Saks Prov. Ct. J. on a charge under s. 236  of the Criminal
Code . Appeal dismissed, Laskin C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ. dissenting.

J.C. Prowse, for the appellant.

Y. Roslak, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence and
Dickson JJ. was delivered by

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta
pronounced on Febru-

[Page 185]

ary 9, 1973. By that judgment, the Appellate
Division dismissed an appeal by way of stated case from the conviction of the
appellant by a Provincial Judge on a charge under s. 236  of the Criminal
Code .

The stated case follows:

CASE STATED by Dean Saks, Provincial Judge,
sitting at the City of Edmonton,
in the Province of Alberta,
under the provisions of Section 762  of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

1. The Appellant, Ronald Joseph Rilling,
was charged that on or about the 21st day of January, A.D. 1972 at the City of
Edmonton, in the Province of Alberta, he did unlawfully drive a motor vehicle,
having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the proportion thereof in his
blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary
to Section 236  of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

2. The hearing of the said charge was
commenced before me on the 29th day of May, A.D. 1972 in the presence of the
accused. The accused was represented by Counsel at the hearing.

3. Evidence for the Crown was given by the
arresting officer, Constable William Hargarten of the Edmonton City Police, who
stated inter alia that the accused blew into the breathalyzer machine and that
he did not recall who was the operator of the machine.

4. The Crown applied to introduce as
exhibits three Certificates, one of which was the Certificate of Analysis
showing the alcohol content in the blood as provided by the provisions of the
Criminal Code .

5. The appellants counsel admitted service
of the Certificates upon the accused, but objected to the Certificate of
Analysis pertaining to the alcohol content in the blood being admitted as
evidence on the grounds that there was no evidence before the Court that the
arresting Constable had any reasonable or probable grounds for believing that
an offence under Section 234  of the Criminal Code  as required by Section 235(1) 
of the Criminal Code , had been committed.

6. In my opinion there was no evidence
adduced before the Court to show that the arresting Constable had any reasonable
or probable grounds for believing that an offence under Section 234  of the
Criminal Code  had been committed.

7. Following the decision of
Mr. Justice Neil Primrose of the Supreme Court of Alberta in the case of
Regina vs. Joseph William McHarg, (unreported, a copy of

[Page 186]

which is attached) I allowed the said
Certificate to be admitted as evidence.

8. One of the arguments set forth by
counsel in his summation was that there was no evidence identifying the accused
as being the person referred to in the said Certificate. This question was not
brought up during the trial.

9. The said Certificate of Analysis showed
that the result of the chemical analysis was 160 milligrams of alcohol per 100
millilitres of blood and as a result, I found the accused guilty as charged.

The appellant Ronald Joseph Rilling desires
to question the validity of the conviction on the grounds that it was erroneous
in law.

The questions submitted for the judgment of
this Honourable Court are as follows:

(a) Did I err in permitting the Certificate
of Analysis pertaining to the alcohol content of the blood to be entered when
there was, in my opinion, no evidence before the court that the arresting
Constable had any reasonable or probable grounds for believing that an offence
under Section 234  of the Criminal Code  had been committed?

(b) Did I err in ruling that there was
evidence identifying the accused as being the person referred to in the said
Certificate?

The issue as to identification was dropped in
the Appellate Division so that Court was and this Court is concerned solely
with the question in para. (a) supra.

It is necessary to consider the provisions of
ss. 234  to 237  inclusive of the Criminal Code  which are as follows:

234. Every
one who, while his ability to drive a motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol or a
drug, drives a motor vehicle or has the care or control of a motor vehicle,
whether it is in motion or not, is guilty of an indictable offence or an
offence punishable on summary conviction and is liable

(a) for a first offence, to a
fine of not more than five hundred dollars and not less than fifty dollars or
to imprisonment for three months or to both;

(b) for a second offence, to
imprisonment for not more than three months and not less than fourteen days;
and

[Page 187]

(c) for each subsequent
offence, to imprisonment for not more than one year and not less than three
months.

235. (1)
Where a peace officer on reasonable and probable grounds believes that a person
is committing, or at any time within the preceding two hours has committed, an
offence under section 234 , he may, by demand made to that person forthwith
or as soon as practicable, require him to provide then or as soon thereafter as
is practicable a sample of his breath suitable to enable an analysis to be made
in order to determine the proportion, if any, of alcohol in his blood, and to
accompany the peace officer for the purpose of enabling such a sample to be
taken.

(2) Every one who, without reasonable
excuse, fails or refuses to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer
under subsection (1) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary
conviction and is liable to a fine of not less than fifty dollars and not more
than one thousand dollars or to imprisonment for not more than six months, or
both.

236. Every
one who drives a motor vehicle or has the care or control of a motor vehicle,
whether it is in motion or not, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that
the proportion thereof in his blood exceeds 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100
millilitres of blood, is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction
and is liable to a fine of not less than fifty dollars and not more than one
thousand dollars or to imprisonment for not more than six months, or both.

237. (1) In
any proceedings under section 234  or 236 ,

(a) where it is proved that the
accused occupied the seat ordinarily occupied by the driver of a motor vehicle,
he shall be deemed to have had the care or control of the vehicle unless he
establishes that he did not enter or mount the vehicle for the purpose of
setting it in motion;

(b) the result of a chemical
analysis of a sample of the breath of the accused (other than a sample taken
pursuant to a demand made under subsection 235(1) ) or of the blood, urine
or other bodily substance of the accused may be admitted in evidence
notwithstanding that, before he gave the sample, he was not warned that he need
not give the sample or that the result of the analysis of the sample might be
used in evidence;

[Page 188]

(c) where a sample of the breath of
the accused has been taken pursuant to a demand made under
subsection 235(1) , if

(i) at the time the sample was taken, the
person taking the sample offered to provide to the accused a specimen of the
breath of the accused in an approved container for his own use, and, at the
request of the accused made at that time, such a specimen was thereupon
provided to him,

(ii) the sample was taken as soon as
practicable after the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed
and in any event not later than two hours after that time,

(iii) the sample was received from the
accused directly into an approved container or into an approved instrument
operated by a qualified technician, and

(iv) a chemical analysis of the sample was
made by means of an approved instrument operated by a qualified technician,

evidence of the result of the chemical
analysis so made is, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, proof of
the proportion of alcohol in the blood of the accused at the time when the
offence was alleged to have been committed;

(d) a certificate of an
analyst stating that he has made a chemical analysis of a sample of the blood,
urine, breath or other bodily substance of the accused and stating the result
of his analysis is evidence of the statements contained in the certificate
without proof of the signature or the official character of the person
appearing to have signed the certificate;

(e) a certificate of an
analyst stating that he has made an analysis of a sample of any substance or
solution intended for use in an approved instrument and identified in the
certificate and that the sample analyzed by him was found to be suitable for
use in an approved instrument, is evidence that the substance or solution so
identified is suitable for use in an approved instrument, without proof of the
signature or the official character of the person appearing to have signed the
certificate; and

(f) where a sample of the breath of
the accused has been taken pursuant to a demand made under
subsection 235(1) , a certificate of a qualified technician stating

(i) that a chemical analysis of the sample
has been made by means of an approved instrument operated

[Page 189]

by him in which a substance or solution
suitable for use in that approved instrument and identified in the certificate
was used,

(ii) the result of the chemical analysis so
made, and

(iii) if the sample was taken by him,

(A) that at the time the sample was taken
he offered to provide to the accused a specimen of the breath of the accused in
an approved container for his own use and, at the request of the accused made
at that time, such a specimen was thereupon provided to him,

(B) the time when and place where the
sample and any specimen described in clause (A) was taken, and

(C) that the sample was received from the
accused directly into an approved container or into an approved instrument
operated by him,

is evidence of the statements contained in
the certificate without proof of the signature or the official character of the
person appearing to have signed the certificate.

(2) No person is required to give a sample
of blood, urine or other bodily substance for chemical analysis for the
purposes of this section except breath as required under section 235,
and evidence that a person failed or refused to give such a sample or that such
a sample was not taken is not admissible nor shall such a failure or refusal or
the fact that a sample was not taken be the subject of comment by any person in
the proceedings.

(3) In any proceedings under
section 234 , evidence that the accused, without reasonable excuse, failed
or refused to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer under
subsection 235(1)  is admissible and the court may draw an inference
therefrom adverse to the accused.

(4) An accused against whom a certificate
described in paragraph (1)(d), (e) or (f) is produced may,
with leave of the court, require the attendance of the analyst or of the
qualified technician, as the case may be, for the purposes of
cross-examination.

(5) No certificate shall be received in
evidence pursuant to paragraph (1)(d), (e) or (f)
unless the party intending to produce it has, before the trial, given to the
accused reasonable notice of his intention together with a copy of the
certificate.

(6) In this section

[Page 190]

“analyst” means a person designated by the
Attorney General as an analyst for the purposes of this section;

“approved container” means a container of a
kind designed to receive a sample of the breath of a person for chemical
analysis and that is approved as suitable for the purposes of this
section by order of the Attorney General of Canada;

“approved instrument” means an instrument
of a kind that is designed to receive and make a chemical analysis of a sample
of the breath of a person in order to measure the proportion of alcohol in the
blood of that person and that is approved as suitable for the purposes of this
section by order of the Attorney General of Canada;

“qualified technician” means a person
designated by the Attorney General as being qualified to operate an approved
instrument.

It must be realized that to answer the question
put in the stated case we are concerned solely with the admissibility of the
certificate of the technician produced at the trial of the appellant as Ex. 3.
No viva voce evidence was adduced at trial as to the analysis and in
fact the only witness who testified at the trial was the arresting constable.
Counsel for the Crown had given notice to the appellant of the intention to
produce the certificate in accordance with the provisions of s. 237(5) of
the Code.

The admissibility of this certificate is
governed solely by the provisions of s. 237(1)(f) of the Code which
I now repeat:

237. (1) In
any proceedings under section 234  or 236 ,

(f) where a sample of the breath of
the accused has been taken pursuant to a demand made under subsection 235(1) , a
certificate of a qualified technician stating

(i) that a chemical analysis of the sample
has been made by means of an approved instrument operated by him in which a
substance or solution suitable for use in that approved instrument and
identified in the certificate was used,

(ii) the result of the chemical analysis so
made, and

(iii) if the sample was taken by him,

(A) that at the time the sample was taken
he offered to provide to the accused a specimen of

[Page 191]

the breath of the accused in an approved
container for his own use and, at the request of the accused made at that time,
such a specimen was thereupon provided to him,

(B) the time when and place where the
sample and any specimen described in clause (A) was taken, and

(C) that the sample was received from the
accused directly into an approved container or into an approved instrument
operated by him,

is evidence of the statements contained in
the certificate without proof of the signature or the official character of the
person appearing to have signed the certificate.

It will be seen that if the certificate is
admissible then it alone is evidence of the statements contained therein and
was sufficient to prove the Crown’s case. Apart from the provisions of this
paragraph of the subsection, the certificate of course would not have been
admissible and the Crown would have had to adduce the viva voce evidence
of the technician. There is no issue here whether such viva voce evidence
would have been admissible and its effect is provided in s. 237(1)(c).
That issue is not before the Court and cases which deal with the admissibility
of viva voce evidence as to the analysis are irrelevant. The simple
problem here is whether the Crown in the exact circumstances of this case may
prove the guilt of the appellant by the mere production and filing of the
technician’s certificate.

Prior to the amendments wrought by 1968-69
(Can.), c. 38, the Code dealt with the offences of driving when
intoxicated or under the influence of drugs and impaired driving. Section 224
then provided for the admission of evidence of chemical analysis of blood and
the form of proof in subsections (3) to (7) inclusive, as follows:

(3) In any proceedings under
section 222 or 223, the result of a chemical analysis of a sample of the
blood, urine, breath or other bodily substance of a person may be admitted in
evidence on the issue whether that person was intoxicated or under the
influence of a narcotic drug or whether his ability to drive was impaired by
alcohol or a drug, notwithstanding that he was not, before he gave the sample,
warned that he need not give the

[Page 192]

sample or that the results of the analysis
of the sample might be used in evidence.

(4) No person is required to give a sample
of blood, urine, breath or other bodily substance for chemical analysis for the
purposes of this section and evidence that a person refused to give such a
sample or that such a sample was not taken is not admissible nor shall such a refusal
or the fact that a sample was not taken be the subject of comment by any person
in the proceedings.

(5) In any proceedings under
section 222 or 223, a certificate purporting to be signed by an analyst
stating that he has performed a chemical analysis on the blood, urine, breath
or other bodily substances of a person and stating the results of his analysis
or examination is prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the
certificate without proof of the signature or the official character of the
person by whom it purports to be signed.

(6) In this section “analyst” means a
person designated by the Attorney General as an analyst for the purposes of
this section.

(7) Subsection (5) does not apply in
any proceedings unless at least seven days’ notice in writing is given to the
accused that it is intended to tender the certificate of the analyst in
evidence.

I note that by subs. (3) the evidence of
chemical analysis by an analyst was permitted and by subs. (5) the proof of
that evidence by a certificate was permitted and such certificate was to
provide prima facie evidence. But s. 224(4) clearly provided that
no person was required to give a sample of his, inter alia, breath so
that any sample taken and analyzed and then made subject to a certificate was
provided voluntarily by the person.

Parliament made most important amendments by
s. 16 of 1968-69 (Can.), c. 38. By that section, ss. 222 to 224 of
the Code were repealed and replaced by ss. 222, 223, 224 and 224A. Those
replacing sections now appear in the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, as ss. 234  to 237  which I have set out in these reasons.
Hereafter, I shall refer to the sections as now numbered. One of the most
drastic amendments is that appearing in the present s. 235. As I have
said, under the Code as it had provided before, no one could be required

[Page 193]

to provide a sample of his blood, urine, breath
or other bodily substance. Under the present s. 235(1) , where a peace
officer, on reasonable and probable grounds, believes that a person is driving
while impaired or has done so within the preceding two hours, he may demand
that such person provide a sample of his breath. By s. 235(2), a person
who refuses to comply with such a demand commits an offence.

When Parliament thus diametrically reversed the provisions
of the Code as to the provision of breath samples, it provided in the
series of sections quoted a number of protective provisions for the
citizen. So s.235(2) permits the defence of reasonable excuse for refusal to
provide the sample of breath. By s. 237(1)(c)(i), the person taking
the sample was required to offer to the person from who it was taken a specimen
of his breath in an approved container and by the provisions of s. 237(1)(f)(iii)(A)
to so certify in the certificate. The provision as to evidence of the analysis
of the breath sample given in compliance with the demand and the proof of the
analysis by certificate both commence with the words, “Where a sample of the
breath of the accused has been taken pursuant to a demand made under subsection 235(1) ”.
These are specific provisions only applicable to cases where the police officer
has made such a demand. Parliament, in express words, made proof by the filing
of a certificate in such case possible only when the test was made pursuant
to a demand under subsection 235(1) . (The italics are my own.)

Because of technical difficulties preventing the
production of an “approved container” referred to in s. 237(1)(c)(i),
the Governor in Council, using the provisions of s. 120 of 1968-69 (Can.),
c. 38, declared in effect the whole of what are now ss. 234  to 237 
inclusive, except the said s. 237(1)(c)(i), 237(1)(f)(iii)(A)
and the definition

[Page 194]

of “approved container” in s. 237(6). This
piecemeal proclamation of the statute was approved by a five to four majority
of this Court in a judgment upon a reference, Re Proclamation of Section 16
of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968-69[2].
As a result, the protections inserted in the procedure by Parliament have
been effectively removed. The provisions, however, of s. 237(1)(c),
and s. 237(1)(f) except the reference to “approved container” have
been declared in effect.

The result of the judgment of the Appellate
Division from which this appeal is taken as well as some of the decisions in
other Provinces cited therein is to effectively remove another protection of
the accused. I am of the opinion that the requirement in both s. 237(1)(c)
and s. 237(1)(f) that the test should have been made pursuant to
the demand under s. 235(1)  was inserted by Parliament with the intention
of limiting those cases where the analysis could be proved by a certificate of
a qualified technician and then that such analysis would provide prima facie
proof of the proportion of alcohol in the blood of the accused only to
those cases where the peace officer had, on reasonable and probable grounds,
believed that the accused was or had been driving while impaired. This was only
a proper requirement when the test was one which the citizen was required to
submit to on penalty of committing an offence if he refused. It is also noted
that the person who makes the analysis was changed from an “analyst” in the old
s. 224 to a “qualified technician” in the present s. 237.

An “analyst” was not defined in the previous
provisions of the Code. Now, the “analyst” makes the analysis of the
chemical used in the breathalizer and then a “qualified technician” makes the
analysis of the specimen of breath expelled into the breathalizer. Section
237(6) defines an “analyst” merely as a person so designated by the Attorney
General and a “qualified technician” as being a

[Page 195]

person designated by the Attorney General “as
being qualified to operate an approved instrument”, quite plainly someone,
probably a police officer, merely trained to operate a device with no skill in
chemistry. Therefore, the lower degree of technical qualification required for
the tester and issuer of the certificate would be another reason for Parliament
only to authorize the use of such evidence, and its proof of mere filing of a certificate,
to those cases which had commenced with a peace officer believing, on
reasonable and probable grounds, that the accused was or had been driving while
impaired.

Allen J.A., in his reasons for judgment for the
Appellate Division, stated that he did not think it fair to assume that members
of the public who were not showing visible signs of impairment would be
harassed. That issue is, in my opinion, irrelevant. The appellant here was
charged with an offence solely statutory in its creation, that is, driving an
automobile with more than 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of his
blood, contrary to s. 236 of the Code. The Crown seeks to prove
that offence by first requiring him to submit to a breath test and then prove
his guilt by the mere production and filing of a certificate of the result of
that test made by a “qualified technician”. Yet all the Courts below are
agreed, and the stated case so stipulates, that there was no evidence whatever
adduced to show that the arresting officer had any reasonable grounds for
believing that the accused was driving while impaired. It is difficult to
understand how such a test could have been taken and such a certificate issued
“pursuant to a demand under subsection 235(1) ”. It is, in fact, exactly contrary
to a demand made pursuant to that section.

In my consideration of the appeal, I have found
most informative the very careful analysis of the

[Page 196]

whole question of the use of the breathalizer by
the learned authors of Breathalizer Law in Canada, McLeod and Takach.

In the result, there having been no evidence
adduced that the arresting officer had reasonable grounds for believing the
appellant to have been driving while impaired, I would rule that the Crown
could not prove its case by the production of the certificate of the “qualified
technician” since it was not the result of a test taken “pursuant to a demand
under subsection 235(1) ” as required by s. 237(1)(f).

I would allow the appeal and direct the
acquittal of the appellant.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Pigeon, Beetz
and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

JUDSON J.—We are concerned here with a charge
under s. 236  of the Criminal Code  which deals with driving with
more than 80 mgs. of alcohol in the blood. The accused was convicted at trial.
His conviction was affirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of
Alberta. In my opinion his appeal to this Court should be dismissed.

The provincial judge stated the case in the
following terms:

Did I err in permitting the Certificate of
Analysis pertaining to the alcohol content of the blood to be entered when
there was, in my opinion, no evidence before the court that the arresting
Constable had any reasonable or probable grounds for believing that an offence
under Section 234  of the Criminal Code  had been committed?

The decision of the provincial judge and the
Appellate Division was that s. 236  of the Criminal Code  does not
make the existence, in the mind of the arresting officer, of reasonable and
probable grounds for believing that an offence under s. 234  of the Criminal
Code  had been committed, an element in proof of a charge under s. 236 
when the accused has acceded to the demand of the arrest-

[Page 197]

ing officer to provide a breath sample. Sections
234 , 235  and 236  read as follows:

234. Everyone
who, while his ability to drive a motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol or a
drug, drives a motor vehicle or has the care or control of a motor vehicle,
whether it is in motion or not, is guilty of an indictable offence or an
offence punishable on summary conviction and is liable

(a) for a first offence, to a
fine of not more than five hundred dollars and not less than fifty dollars or
to imprisonment for three months or to both;

(b) for a second offence, to
imprisonment for not more than three months and not less than fourteen days;
and

(c) for each subsequent offence, to
imprisonment for not more than one year and not less than three months.

235. (1)
Where a peace officer on reasonable and probable grounds believes that a person
is committing, or at any time within the preceding two hours has committed, an
offence under section 234 , he may, by demand made to that person forthwith
or as soon as practicable, require him to provide then or as soon thereafter as
is practicable a sample of his breath suitable to enable an analysis to be made
in order to determine the proportion, if any, of alcohol in his blood, and to
accompany the peace officer for the purpose of enabling such a sample to be
taken.

(2) Every one who, without reasonable
excuse, fails or refuses to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer
under subsection (1) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary
conviction and is liable to a fine of not less than fifty dollars and not more
than one thousand dollars or to imprisonment for not more than six months, or
both.

236. Every
one who drives a motor vehicle or has the care or control of a motor vehicle,
whether it is in motion or not, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that
the proportion thereof in his blood exceeds 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100
millilitres of blood, is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction
and is liable to a fine of not less than fifty dollars and not more

[Page 198]

than one thousand dollars or to
imprisonment for not more than six months, or both.

There has been some diversity of opinion on this
subject. R. v. Wirsta[3]; R.
v. Manchester[4], and
Reference Re Sections 222, 224 and 224A of the Criminal Code[5], at p. 248, are to the effect
that proof of the belief of the peace officer based on reasonable and probable
grounds that the accused had committed an offence under s. 234 , when the
demand for a breath sample was made, is a condition precedent to the admission
of certificate evidence of the analysis of the breath sample furnished by the
accused. The strong weight of authority is, however, the other way. It is
illustrated in the following cases and in the judgment under appeal: R. v.
Showell[6], at
p. 256; R. v. Orchard[7], at
p. 537; appeal dismissed[8]; R.
v. Strain[9]; R.
v. Flegel[10], particularly
at p. 158; R. v. Verischagin[11].

The cases are all reviewed in the judgment under
appeal and I have nothing to add to this review. I agree with the conclusion of
the Appellate Division expressed in the following terms:

It is my opinion that this Court should accept
and adopt the views expressed in the Orchard, Showell and Flegel cases,
supra, and hold that while absence of reasonable and probable grounds
for belief of impairment may afford a defence to a charge of refusal to submit
to a breathalyzer test laid under subs. (2) of s. 235 of the Code, it does
not render inadmissible certificate evidence in the case of a charge under
s. 236 of the Code. The motive which actuates a peace officer in making a
demand under s. 235(1)  is not a relevant consideration when the demand has
been acceded to.

I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Charge of trafficking in
LSD—Court of Appeal adopting view that although accused in fact sold LSD he
intended to sell and thought he was selling mescaline—Whether Court of Appeal
right in holding mens rea not proved—Food and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. F-27.

While at a table in a beer parlour, the
accused was calling out “speed, acid, MDA or hash” to passers-by. An undercover
policeman asked for hash or acid, to which the accused replied that he was all
sold out. He then offered to sell mescaline at two dollars. The policeman
accepted the offer and paid the accused four dollars for two “hits”. The
accused left, returned in five minutes, and handed the policeman two capsules.
In fact, these capsules contained LSD. The accused was convicted on a charge of
trafficking in a restricted drug, namely lysergic acid dythalamide (LSD),
contrary to the Food and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. F-27. On
appeal, the Court of Appeal set aside the conviction on the ground that the
prosecution had failed to establish the necessary mens rea for the
offence charged. The Court of Appeal took the reasons of the trial judge as
involving a finding that although the accused in fact sold LSD he intended to
sell and thought he was selling mescaline and the policeman thought he was
buying mescaline. With leave of this Court, the Crown appealed from the
unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the conviction
restored.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: On the facts of
the case, a rebuttable presumption arose that the accused intended to traffic
in LSD and that he was guilty of the offence charged. No evidence having been
tendered by the accused, it was not possible to find that he had an honest

[Page 273]

belief amounting to a non-existence of mens
rea. The Court of Appeal was in error in its conclusion that the necessary mens
rea had not been proved.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence J., dissenting: Even if it be proper to describe
trafficking in controlled drugs, whatever be the drug, or trafficking in
restricted drugs, whatever be the drug, as being, in each case, a description
of the same crime, it is impossible to bring mescaline within either category
when it stands entirely outside the group of controlled or restricted drugs and
is governed by other statutory provisions than those governing controlled or
restricted drugs. It could not be accepted that where mens rea is an
element of an offence, as it is here, it can be satisfied by proof of its
existence in relation to another offence unless, of course, the situation
involves an included offence of which the accused may be found guilty on his
trial of the offence charged. The actus reus and the mens rea must relate to
the same crime.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1]
setting aside the conviction of the respondent by Schultz Co. Ct. J. on a
charge of trafficking in LSD contrary to the Food and Drugs Act . Appeal
allowed and conviction restored, Laskin C.J. and Spence J. dissenting.

A.A. Sarchuk, Q.C., and G. Pinos, for the
appellant.

P.C. Ritchie, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence J. was
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—The issue
in this appeal, brought by the Crown with leave of

[Page 274]

this Court, is whether the British Columbia
Court of Appeal was right in concluding that the prosecution had failed to
establish the necessary mens rea on a charge of trafficking in a
restricted drug, namely lysergic acid dythalamide (LSD), contrary to the Food
and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. F-27.I take the factual considerations
to be those narrated and found by the trial judge (who had convicted the
accused) and which were accepted by the British Columbia Court of Appeal.

Briefly, they are as follows, based on the
evidence of the undercover policeman who was involved in the transaction with
the accused. The latter was at a table in a beer parlour calling out “speed,
acid, MDA or hash” to passers-by. The policeman asked for hash or acid, to
which the accused replied that he was all sold out. He then offered to sell
mescaline at two dollars. The policeman accepted the offer and paid the accused
four dollars for two “hits”. The accused left, returned in five minutes, and
handed the policeman two capsules. In fact, these capsules contained LSD. The
British Columbia Court of Appeal took the reasons of the trial judge as
involving a finding that although the accused in fact sold LSD he intended to
sell and thought he was selling mescaline and the policeman thought that he was
buying mescaline. The record in this Court does not admit of any other view.

It was not contended by the Crown, and, indeed,
could not be under the applicable legislation, that proof of the actus reus involved
in the charge was alone enough to support the conviction; proof of mens rea also
rested upon the Crown: see Beaver v. The Queen[2]. The conviction can, of course, be
easily supported if it be enough to establish that the accused intended to
traffic in drugs and that it is immaterial, save as a matter of description in
the charge, what particular drug or class of drug was the subject of the
trafficking. Such a view overlooks the legislative scheme governing various
drugs and the applicable penal provisions. On that view, the accused would have
to risk the range of penalties applicable to the trafficking in the drug which
was in fact sold, albeit he thought that he

[Page 275]

was selling one with respect to which a much
lighter scale of penalties was prescribed.

The scheme of the Food and Drugs Act  is
of considerable relevance in this case. Sections 40  and 42 , on which the
prosecution was based, are in Part IV of the Act dealing with “restricted
drugs”, which are those included in Schedule H, and LSD is one of those
mentioned. Part III of the Act deals with “controlled drugs” which are those
included in Schedule G, and among them are amphetamine and methamphetamine.
Sections 33  and 34  are provisions in Part III (relating to controlled drugs)
which are to the same effect as ss. 40  and 42  relating to restricted drugs
under Part IV. Sections 40  and 42  read as follows:

40. In this
Part,

“possession” means possession as defined in
the Criminal Code ;

“regulations” means regulations made as
provided for by or under section 45;

“restricted drug” means any drug or other
substance included in Schedule H;

“traffic” means to manufacture, sell,
export from or import into Canada, transport or deliver, otherwise than under the authority of this
Part or the regulations.

42. (1) No
person shall traffic in a restricted drug or any substance represented or held
out by him to be a restricted drug.

(2) No person shall have in his possession
any restricted drug for the purpose of trafficking.

(3) Every person who violates
subsection (1) or (2) is guilty of an offence and is liable

(a) upon summary conviction, to
imprisonment for eighteen months; or

(b) upon conviction on
indictment, to imprisonment for ten years.

Mescaline is neither a controlled drug nor a
restricted drug, but is a drug within Schedule F, included thereunder by virtue
of s. 15 of the Act (“no person shall sell any drug described in Schedule
F”) and governed by regulations made pursuant to s. 25 of the Act. Section
15 of the Act is in Part I which deals with adulterated food, drugs and
cosmetics, with deceptive advertising

[Page 276]

and labelling, with control of standards of
manufacturing and with the sanitary condition of premises. Part II of the Act
deals with administration and enforcement of the Act by inspectors and includes
very wide regulation-making powers set out in s. 25. Penalties for
violation of the Act or of the regulations are prescribed by s. 26 which
reads as follows:

26. Every
person who violates any of the provisions of this Act or the regulations is
guilty of an offence and is liable

(a) on summary conviction for
a first offence to a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars or to imprisonment
for a term not exceeding three months, or to both, and for a subsequent offence
to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars or to imprisonment for a term not
exceeding six months, or to both; and

(b) on conviction upon
indictment to a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars or to imprisonment for
a term not exceeding three years, or to both.

It is common ground that any offence under the
Act or regulations relating to the sale of mescaline would be punishable under
s. 26. On the other hand, this provision would have no application to
controlled or restricted drugs in the face of the penalty provisions of ss. 34
and 42 which alone govern illegal dealing in them. A comparison of the
respective penalty provisions governing mescaline and LSD shows how much
heavier the penalty is in respect of illegal dealing in the latter than in the
former, both where the prosecution is on summary conviction and on indictment.

The regulation respecting mescaline is
Regulation C.01.041 which prohibits the sale of any substance containing a drug
listed or described in Schedule F unless on written or verbal prescription, and
the regulation goes on to elaborate on these types of prescriptions. I may
observe here that it is not an offence to possess mescaline but it is an
offence to possess a controlled or a restricted drug for the purpose of
“trafficking”, defined (as

[Page 277]

already noted) to include, inter alia, selling,
transporting and delivering.

Mescaline has been a Schedule F drug since 1958
(see SOR/58-115 (P.C. 1958-450); SOR/ 59-274 (P.C. 1959-956)). The statutory
history of its position in Schedule F is somewhat involved, as witness the fact
that by SOR/63-269 (P.C. 1963-1119) mescaline was included in a Schedule F
which was added to the Regulations under the Food and Drugs Act , operating
apparently as supplementary to Schedule F to the Act proper. (SOR/63-269 was
replaced by SOR/65-548). In view of this history, I may note that there was
error in the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Custeau[3] in the statement therein that
mescaline was a controlled drug. In that case, the accused was charged and
convicted on appeal of trafficking in LSD although he thought he was selling
mescaline. The Court of Appeal in entering the conviction gave as one of its
reasons that it is an offence to traffic in either a controlled drug or a
restricted drug and, although there were separate penalties prescribed, the
maximum penalty was the same in either case. In fact, however, mescaline was
not then nor ever was a controlled drug or a restricted drug.

It was the contention of the appellant Crown
that the required proof of mens rea was furnished by evidence showing
what Crown counsel called a general intention to traffic in drugs; and, this
being shown, it was immaterial that the accused did not intend to traffic in
the specific drug which was named in the charge but thought (as did his
purchaser) that he was trafficking in another drug. Crown counsel thus takes
the position to which I referred earlier in these reasons, and he stated in
this connection that the accused could meet the case against him only by
relying on mistake of fact which must be an honest mistake on reasonable
grounds that the facts believed by him to be true would not attract culpability
of any drug offence. That, according to Crown counsel, was not this case.

There are, in my opinion, three issues that stem
from this submission. The first is whether mistake

[Page 278]

of fact arises at all as a separate defence for
the accused in the face of the burden on the Crown to prove mens rea as
an element of the offence charged. The offence charged was trafficking in a
restricted drug, namely LSD; and although I would agree that proof of knowledge
by the accused that he was trafficking in a drug of that class might be enough,
even if it be not LSD, the question that must be faced is whether it is enough
for the Crown to offer proof of trafficking in any drug or, as here, in a drug
that is in a lower scale of prohibition and regulation.

Having regard to the evidence adduced at the
trial, and to the findings of fact on that evidence, I do not think it
necessary in the present case to consider the relationship between the Crown’s
burden of proof, where mens rea is an element of the offence charged,
and mistake of fact as an affirmative defence. Clearly enough, mistake of fact
in that sense does not arise where proof of mens rea is an element of
proof of the offence charged and the evidence adduced by the Crown does not
establish it. If mistake is put forward in this context by evidence offered by
or on behalf of the accused, it is only by way of meeting an evidentiary burden
and raising a reasonable doubt that the Crown has met the persuasive burden of
proof resting upon it. What we are concerned with here, on the record, is
whether evidence by the Crown going to show that the accused intended to commit
a lesser offence than that charged is enough to support the conviction entered
after trial.

The second issue which arises on the Crown’s
submissions is whether the mistake of fact must be objectively reasonable or
whether it is enough that it be based upon an honest belief. Leaving to one
side cases of strict criminal liability (on which the judgment of Dixon J. in Proudman
v. Dayman[4], at
pp. 539-41, is specially instructive), where serious criminal charges are
involved this Court put the matter as follows in Beaver v. The Queen, supra,
where Cartwright J. said this (at p. 538):

[Page 279]

… the essential question is whether the
belief entertained by the accused is an honest one and … the existence or
non-existence of reasonable grounds for such belief is merely relevant evidence
to be weighed by the tribunal of fact in determining that essential question.

See also Director of Public Prosecutions v.
Morgan, Law Report in The London Times, May 1, 1975.

The third issue, which is tied in with the
first, is whether mistake of fact is shown on proof that, on the facts as the
accused honestly believed them to be, he was innocent of the offence charged,
albeit guilty of another offence, or whether he must show that he was innocent
of any offence. This last matter invites consideration of a proposition
advanced in R. v. Prince[5] by
the one dissenting judge of the sixteen who heard the case in the Court of
Crown Cases Reserved. The majority of that Court held that mens rea was
not an essential ingredient of the offence charged, which was unlawfully taking
any unmarried girl under age sixteen out of the possession and against the will
of her father or mother. (The word “knowingly” was not in the charge). The
accused reasonably believed that the girl he had abducted was over age sixteen.
One of the points made by Brett J., who dissented on the ground that mens
rea was an ingredient of the offence as it related to age, was that where mens
rea must be proved it would suffice to show, if the facts were as the
accused believed them to be, that he would still be guilty of a crime albeit
one of a lesser degree than that charged as a result of the actus reus.

I do not think that this view is any longer
sustainable. The requirement that where the actus reus of
an offence is proved there must also be proof of the mens rea of the
same crime is now basic in our criminal law. Williams, Criminal Law, 2nd
ed. (1961), p. 129, makes the point when dealing with the question of
“transferred malice” as follows:

The accused can be convicted where he both
has the mens rea and commits the actus reus specified
in the rule of law creating the crime, though they exist in

[Page 280]

respect of different objects. He cannot be
convicted if his mens rea relates to one crime and his actus reus to
a different crime, because that would be to disregard the requirement of an
appropriate mens rea.

And again, at p. 131:

What are different crimes for the purpose
of the rule depends primarily upon the arrangement of the statute; each
section presumptively creates a different crime or group of crimes. It is
possible for a single sentence of a section to create a number of
different crimes, as is shown by the decisions on duplicity in pleading. If a
section is thus held to create different crimes, it would not be possible
to transfer the malice from one crime to another even-within the same section.

See also, Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law, 3rd
ed. (1973), pp. 49-51.

This is apt for the statutory situation which
exists here and to which I have referred earlier in these reasons. Even if it
be proper to describe trafficking in controlled drugs, whatever be the drug, or
trafficking in restricted drugs, whatever be the drug, as being, in each case,
a description of the same crime, I think it is impossible to bring mescaline
within either category when it stands entirely outside the group of controlled
or restricted drugs and is governed by other statutory provisions than those
governing controlled or restricted drugs. I am unable to agree that where mens
rea is an element of an offence, as it is here, it can be satisfied by
proof of its existence in relation to another offence unless, of course, the
situation involves an included offence of which the accused may be found guilty
on his trial of the offence charged. A number of authors who have examined this
problem in depth and, particularly in relation to the “lesser crime” doctrine,
have come to this very conclusion: see Williams, op. cit., at pp. 185
ff., Howard, Australian Criminal Law, 2nd ed. (1970), at pp. 375 ff.,
and Smith, “The Guilty Mind in the Criminal Law”, (1960), 76 Law Q. Rev. 78, at
pp. 91 ff. If judges are to be faced with a choice of policy in this area, it
should be one consonant with fundamental principle, namely, that the actus reus and
the mens rea must relate to

[Page 281]

the same crime: see Smith, “The Guilty Mind in
the Criminal Law”, (1960), 76 Law Q. Rev. 78.

This view has been the subject of consideration
and some application in a number of decisions of appellate courts in Canada, some of which were considered and
distinguished by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in the present case. I
begin my reference to them by taking up first those cases that dealt with drug
offences. The Custeau case, already mentioned, and R. v. Burgess[6], may be considered together as being
cases where (on the assumption in Custeau that mescaline was a
controlled drug) offences of the same quality were involved if the facts had
been as the accused believed them to be. In Custeau, the offence charged
was trafficking in a restricted drug; the accused would have it that there was
trafficking in a controlled drug. Although it may well be proper to treat
trafficking in a restricted drug as being essentially the same offence as
trafficking in a controlled drug, the conviction is not sustainable on a wider
principle of liability that the honest belief of the accused is of no avail
unless it would result in his act being entirely innocent. In Burgess, the
charge was unlawful possession of a narcotic, to wit opium and the defence was
that the accused believed he had hashish which was a narcotic whose possession
was similarly prohibited. This was simply a case of the actual and intended act
constituting the same crime, both drugs being in the class of narcotics and
caught by the same penal provision, namely s. 3 of the Narcotic Control
Act.

R. v. Blondin[7], a judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal (of which
McFarlane J.A., who delivered the reasons in the present case, was a member),
also concerned an offence involving a narcotic which proved to be cannabis resin
or hashish. The charge was unlawfully importing a narcotic, namely cannabis resin.
The trial judge had charged the jury that the Crown was obliged to prove that
the accused knew that the narcotic was that alleged in the indictment. This was
held

[Page 282]

to be misdirection, the appellate Court being of
the opinion, in the light of Burgess and other cases cited, that it was
a proper direction to the jury that it was enough if the accused knew that some
kind of narcotic was involved. This view of the matter was affirmed by this
Court on appeal: see Blondin v. The Queen[8].
I may note here that under the Narcotic Control Act the importation of
all narcotics is caught by a single proscription, namely s. 4 of the Act,
so that the same offence is involved regardless of the narcotic. The
British Columbia Court of Appeal also held that it was not a proper instruction
that the accused might be found guilty of unlawfully importing a narcotic if he
knew that it was illegal to import the substance that was found although he did
not know it was a narcotic. In short, there was a marked difference
between the offence of importing a narcotic and that of smuggling goods in
breach of the Customs Act ; mens rea in the latter respect was not enough
to support a conviction of the former. This point was not passed upon by this
Court, but it was referred to by McFarlane J.A., in delivering the judgment of
the British Columbia Court of Appeal in the present case, to distinguish Blondin.

A second group of cases which considered “the
lesser crime” doctrine is illustrated by R. v. McLeod[9], which involved a charge of
assaulting a peace officer in the execution of his duty, contrary to what is
now s. 246(2) (a) of the Criminal Code . The question at issue
was whether proof must be made that the accused knew that the victim was a
peace officer. The British Columbia Court of Appeal held that this was an
esential element of the offence charged and, notwithstanding that there was an
assault, the requirement of mens rea was not satisfied by proof of a
lesser crime, that is, common assault. A different view in the same situation
was taken by the High Court of Australia in a majority judgment in R. v.
Reynhoudt[10], which
held that it was enough for the Crown to establish the intentional assault,
without being

[Page 283]

required to prove that the accused knew that the
person assaulted was a peace officer acting in the execution of his duty. The
dissenting judgment of Dixon C.J. was to the effect that intent must go to all
the elements of the whole offence, an opinion shared by Kitto J. The South
African Supreme Court, Appellate Division in R. v. Wallendorf[11], took a similar majority view to
that in the Reynhoudt case in holding that it was not essential to prove
that the accused knew that the victim of the assault was a constable.

A different class of case, raising the question
of mens rea referable to a more serious crime than that charged, is R.
v. Ladue[12], a
judgment of the Yukon Territory Court of Appeal which is staffed by members of
the British Columbia Court of Appeal. The charge was indecently interfering
with a dead human body, and the evidence showed copulation or attempted copulation
with a woman who was then dead, albeit the accused testified that by reason of
his intoxication he did not know that she was dead. The Court held that
knowledge that the woman was dead was not an ingredient of the offence, and
hence, I take it, not an element requiring proof by the Crown. The Court also
appears to have held, somewhat inconsistently, that proof that he did not know
the woman was dead could be offered in defence by the accused, but it added
that here he would be in the dilemma of admitting to rape (there being no
question of consent), a more serious offence than that charged. It does occur
to me, however, that the facts being what they were, the proper charge ought to
have been attempted rape.

Is any general principle deductible from the foregoing
catalogue of instances? Certainly, it cannot be said that, in general, where mens
rea is an ingredient of an offence and the actus reus is proved it
is enough if an intent is shown that would support a conviction of another
crime, whether more or less serious than the offence actually committed. Coming
to the particular, to the case before this Court, where proof is made of an actus
reus that, in a general sense, is common to a range or variety of offences
which require mens rea but

[Page 284]

those offences differ as to gravity by reason of
different classifications and different penalties, is a charge of a more
serious offence established by proof only that the accused intended to commit
and could have been found guilty of a less serious, a lesser offence? The
matter, in terms of principle, depends on how strict an observance there should
be of the requirement of mens rea. If there is to be a relaxation of the
requirement, should it not come from Parliament, which could provide for the
substitution of a conviction of the lesser offence, in the same way as
provision now exists in our criminal law for entering a conviction on an
included offence?

This position is the one taken by the Model
Penal Code of the American Law Institute (1962) which provides as follows in
s. 2.04(2):

Although ignorance or mistake would
otherwise afford a defense to the offense charged, the defense is not available
if the defendant would be guilty of another offense had the situation been as
he supposed. In such case, however, the ignorance or mistake of the defendant
shall reduce the grade and degree of the offense of which he may be convicted
to those of the offense of which he would be guilty had the situation been as
he supposed.

In the present case, and under present Canadian
law, this sensible solution to a difficult problem is not open to this Court.

There may be some regret on the part of a court
to free a person who appears to be guilty of an offence with which he has not
been charged. That regret, if any there be, cannot be a vehicle for making a
particular charge which cannot be proved serve as a foundation for imposing
culpability of another, which is not an included offence. If there is to be a
modification of principle in a situation like the present one, it must come
from Parliament.

I return in this connection to the judgment of
this Court in Beaver v. The Queen, which also involved a
conviction of selling a narcotic drug as well as a conviction of possession. In
respect of both charges the appellant’s position was that he believed that a
harmless substance, sugar of milk, was contained in the package sold to an
undercover policeman and did not know that the package

[Page 285]

contained a narcotic. There was this
difference in the formulation of the two offences: the possession offence was
one simply of forbidden possession of a narcotic without lawful authority,
while the selling offence related to sale of any substance represented or held
out to be a drug. Because there was evidence of such a representation or holding
out, the conviction of selling was affirmed. Parliament, in short, had made a
distinction in the applicability of mens rea to each of the two
offences.

There is another consideration which should be
brought into account in this case. The Crown’s case was built on evidence of an
undercover policeman which must have been as well known to the prosecuting
authorities before the trial as it was as a result of the trial. I can
appreciate that there could have been some difficulty in determining what
charge should be laid on the facts disclosed by the chief Crown witness.
Although the Crown may have felt that it could support the charge actually
laid, it could also, as a matter of precaution, have laid a charge of
attempting to traffic in mescaline. Such a charge is supportable under
s. 24  of the Criminal Code  which makes it immaterial whether it was
possible or not to commit the intended offence: see 10 Halsbury, 3rd ed.,
p. 306; R. v. Scott[13]. I
have already indicated the view of the facts that the record compels. If there
should be any doubt on the evidence whether the accused offered and intended to
sell mescaline, that doubt cannot be translated into an affirmative finding,
certainly not in this Court, that he offered and intended to sell LSD. At the
worst, it would require a new trial.

I see no such doubt and, on the considerations I
have canvassed, I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

DE GRANDPRÉ J.—With leave of this Court, the
Crown appeals the unanimous judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal[14] setting aside the conviction of
respondent. In the words of the

[Page 286]

indictment, Kundeus was charged that he did

on the 24th day of August A.D. 1972,
unlawfully traffic in a restricted drug, to wit: Lysergic Acid Diethylamide
(LSD), contrary to the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act .

The facts are stated in the reasons for judgment
of the trial judge:

Police Constable MacKay-Dunn testified
that, on August 24, 1972, at about 10:15 P.M., the Constable, acting undercover
in the Gas Town area, and the Accused were at a table in the Travellers Hotel,
57 West Cordova in the City of Vancouver. The police Constable testified the
Accused was calling out, “Speed, acid, MDA or hash”, to passers by in the beer
parlor. The police constable asked for hash or acid. The Accused said they were
all sold out. The Accused offered mescaline at two dollars. The police
constable accepted the offer, requested two “hits” and paid four dollars, to
the Accused for same. The Accused left, returned in about five minutes, and
handed two capsules, Exhibit 1, to the police constable. Exhibit 1 was, in
fact, two capsules of LSD (See exhibit 2).

The trial judge adds that

the accused elected not to adduce any
evidence in defence.

After having stated that the sole issue was mens
rea, the trial judge examined the relevant parts of the Food and Drugs
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. F-27, and of the regulations thereunder, as well
as the cases of R. v. Blondin[15]
(confirmed by this Court[16]); R.
v. Burgess[17], and
R. v. Custeau[18] and
concluded:

The Court has considered the evidence in
this trial and the able submissions of respective Counsel.

The Court concludes that the prosecution
has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, the guilt of the Accused…

Respondent inscribed an appeal alleging an error
involving a question of law upon the following ground:

The learned trial judge misdirected himself
in law in holding that if he was satisfied beyond a reasonable

[Page 287]

doubt that the accused knew it was illegal
to sell the drug mescaline, although said drug is not a restricted drug as
defined in the Food and Drugs Act , and in fact intended to sell the drug
mescaline, he should convict the accused of trafficking in L.S.D., a restricted
drug under the Food and Drugs Act , when the substance sold as mescaline
analyzed to be L.S.D., even if the accused did not know that the substance was
in fact the restricted drug L.S.D.

The Court of Appeal disagreed with the
conclusion reached by the trial judge and specifically refused to follow R.
v. Custeau. The conviction was consequently set aside.

Mens rea cannot,
of course, be examined without reference to Beaver v. The Queen[19]. In that case, there was evidence
on which the jury might have found that Beaver had no knowledge that the
substance was a drug but believed it to be sugar of milk. It is in that context
that the following excerpt from the reasons of Cartwright J., as he then was,
must be read (p. 538):

…the essential question is whether the
belief entertained by the accused is an honest one and that the existence or
non-existence of reasonable grounds for such belief is merely relevant evidence
to be weighed by the tribunal of fact in determining that essential question.

The question to which Cartwright J. was
directing his attention is made very clear in the illustration he uses at
p. 536:

It may be of assistance in examining the
problem to use a simple illustration. Suppose X goes to the shop of Y, a
druggist, and asks Y to sell him some baking-soda. Y hands him a sealed packet
which he tells him contains baking-soda and charges him a few cents. X honestly
believes that the packet contains baking-soda but in fact it contains heroin. X
puts the package in his pocket, takes it home and later puts it in a cupboard
in his bathroom. There would seem to be no doubt that X has had actual manual
and physical possession of the package and that he continues to have possession
of the package while it is in his cupboard. The main question raised on this
appeal is whether, in the supposed circumstances, X would be guilty of the
crime of having heroin in his possession?

[Page 288]

It will be observed at once that we are not
concerned with the incidence of the burden of proof or of the obligation of adducing
evidence. The judgment of the Court of Appeal states the law to be that X must
be convicted although he proves to the point of demonstration that he honestly
believed the package to contain baking-soda.

Our facts are different. They are very simple and
not contradicted. One reading of them is that Kundeus was offering LSD for
sale, actually sold LSD and received payment therefor. On that reading, it is
obvious that the conviction should have been affirmed.

Another reading is that adopted by the Court of
Appeal and expressed by McFarlane J.A., speaking for the Court (p. 345):

The evidence disclosed, and the trial Judge
found, that the appellant offered to sell mescaline at two dollars to a police
constable acting undercover. The constable accepted the offer and paid the
appellant four dollars for two “hits”. The appellant left, returned in about
five minutes and handed the constable two capsules which were found, on
analysis, to contain LSD.

I think I must interpret the reasons for
judgment of the trial Judge as a finding that although the appellant did in
fact sell LSD he thought he was selling, and intended to sell, mescaline and
that the constable also thought he was purchasing Mescaline.

Assuming that this reading of the trial judgment
is the proper one, was the Court of Appeal right in holding that the necessary mens
rea had not been proved? I do not believe so.

In R. v. Blondin, supra, a case dealing
with the importation of narcotics, the Crown succeeded on the following ground
of its appeal:

“(e) That the learned trial judge
misdirected the jury in instructing it that the Crown was obliged to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew that the contents of the scuba
diving tank (Exhibit 1) was a narcotic drug as alleged in the Indictment herein,
namely, Cannabis Resin.”

After a full review of the authorities,
Robertson J.A. concluded (p. 13):

[Page 289]

Basing my opinion upon what I understand to
be the principle enunciated in the several passages I have quoted, I am of the
respectful opinion that the learned trial Judge erred when he instructed the
jury that, in order to find Blondin guilty, they must find that he knew that
the substance in the tank was cannabis resin. It would be sufficient to find,
in relation to a narcotic, mens rea in its widest sense.

An appeal to this Court by the accused was
dismissed by the full bench in the following terms:

We agree that the Court of Appeal rightly
allowed the appeal and directed a new trial on ground (e) of the Notice of
Appeal to that Court.

That judgment must be read with another decision
of this Court, namely The Queen v. King[20],
where the facts, the question submitted to this Court and the holding are
expressed in the headnote:

The accused went to his dentist by
appointment to have two teeth extracted. He was injected with a drug known as
sodium pentothal, a quick-acting anaesthetic. Earlier, he had been
required to sign a printed form containing a warning not to drive after the
anaesthetic until his head had cleared. After he regained consciousness, the
nurse in attendance, to whom he appeared to be normal, warned him not to drive
until his head was “perfectly clear”. He replied that he intended to walk. The
accused said that he heard no such warning and did not remember signing any
form containing a warning. He remembered getting into his car and that while
driving he became unconscious. His car ran into the rear of a parked vehicle.
Medical evidence was given that his mental and physical condition (he was
staggering and his co-ordination was poor) was consistent with the
after-effects of the drug in question which may induce a state of amnesia
accompanied by a period during which the subject may feel competent to drive a
car and in the next second be in a condition in which he would not know what was
happening. The accused stated that he did not know anything about this drug.

He was charged and convicted of the offence
of driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by a drug,
contrary to s. 223  of the Criminal Code . After a trial de novo before
a County Court judge under s. 720 of the Code, his conviction was
affirmed. The Court of Appeal granted him leave to appeal and

[Page 290]

quashed the conviction. The Crown was
granted leave to appeal to this Court on the question as to whether mens rea
relating to both the act of driving and to the state of being impaired was
an essential element of the offence.

I refer particularly to a paragraph of the
reasons of Ritchie J., speaking also for the Chief Justice and for Martland J.,
at p. 763:

The existence of mens rea as an
essential ingredient of an offence and the method of proving the existence of
that ingredient are two different things, and I am of the opinion that when it
has been proved that a driver was driving a motor vehicle while his ability to
do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug, then a rebuttable presumption arises
that his condition was voluntarily induced and that he is guilty of the offence
created by s. 223  and must be convicted unless other evidence is adduced which
raises a reasonable doubt as to whether he was, through no fault of his own,
disabled when he undertook to drive and drove, from being able to appreciate
and know that he was or might become impaired.

In the case at bar, such a rebuttable
presumption has arisen. No evidence having been tendered by the accused, it is
not possible to find that he had an honest belief amounting to a non-existence
of mens rea and the Court of Appeal was in error in its conclusion.

The quality of respondent’s conduct is not to be
determined by the existence or non-existence of a binding civil agreement as to
the purchase of LSD between him and the constable. That is not the test. In Poitras
v. The Queen[21], where
the question was to determine the exact meaning of “trafficking” under the Narcotic
Control Act, Dickson J., speaking for the majority, wrote at p. 653:

It was argued on behalf of the appellant
that the words “to buy” do not appear in the definition of “trafficking” under
the Narcotic Control Act; therefore, a mere purchaser does not
traffic and an agent for the purchaser comes under the same protective
umbrella. I do not agree. One cannot apply the civil law of “agency” in this
context. “Agency” does not serve to make non-criminal an act which would
otherwise be attended by criminal consequences. Even if the appellant could be
said to be the “agent” of Constable Arsenault for the purposes of civil
responsibility, his acts may, none the less, amount to trafficking in narcotics
or aiding in such trafficking.

[Page 291]

If, as the trial judge would seem to have
found, the evidence was consistent with the accused delivering or selling or
trading in drugs or offering to do so, the fact that he may have been acting as
an agent for Arsenault would not exculpate him.

In my view, the result in R. v. Custeau was
the proper one and this notwithstanding the error committed by the Court of
Appeal of Ontario and underlined by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in
the case at bar, mescaline having been described as a controlled drug when it
is a drug mentioned in the Regulations under the Act which cannot be sold
without a prescription.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the Order of
the Court of Appeal of British Columbia and restore the judgment at trial
together with the sentence imposed thereat.

student—Court of Appeal allowing preliminary objection to legal sufficiency of
form of notice—Jurisdiction of Supreme Court of Canada to entertain
appeal—Application for leave remitted to Court of Appeal—Supreme Court Act,

APPEAL by the Crown from the refusal by the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia to consider an application for leave to appeal from a
sentence imposed upon the accused following his conviction of an indictable
offence. Appeal allowed.

No one appearing for the appellant.

R.A. Easton, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This appeal by the Crown,
which comes here by leave of this Court, arises out of a refusal by the British
Columbia Court of Appeal to enter upon a consideration of the Crown’s
application for leave to appeal a sentence imposed upon the accused following
his conviction of an indictable offence. The British Columbia Court of Appeal
allowed a preliminary objection by counsel for the accused to the legal
sufficiency of the form of the notice of the application for leave to appeal.

[Page 784]

The notice purported to be signed with the name
of a qualified barrister and solicitor, followed by the words “Crown Counsel,
Agent for and on behalf of the Attorney-General”, and to the left of the
signature was the following, in quotation marks: “per J.M.E.”. The record shows
that the Crown counsel’s name was signed, apparently on his instructions, by his
law student on his behalf.

Counsel for the respondent accused did not
contest the legal sufficiency, under s. 605(1) (b) of the Criminal
Code , of the notice of application for leave to appeal, apparently because
of the judgment of this Court in R. v. Badall[1], which had not been handed down when the
matter was before the British Columbia Court of Appeal. He did, however, urge
very strongly that this Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the Crown’s
appeal because, first, the issue related to sentence and was foreclosed by Goldhar
v. The Queen[2]; and,
second, what was involved was a refusal by the British Columbia Court of Appeal
to give leave to appeal and this was a matter outside this Court’s jurisdiction
under its decisions in Paul v. The Queen[3],
and Hind v. The Queen[4].

Neither of these contentions is tenable here. Goldhar,
Paul and Hind do not touch this case. No question of sentence,
whether as to its legality or otherwise, is directly before this Court, nor is
this a case where this Court is being asked to review a considered refusal by
the provincial Court of Appeal to grant leave. The present case is simply one
where the provincial Court of Appeal said there was no proper application for
leave before it and hence nothing to require it to act. It is distinguishable
from the three cases above mentioned, and, in my opinion, it is properly before
this Court under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. S-19.

In the result, the appeal should be allowed and
the application for leave remitted to the British Columbia Court of Appeal for
consideration on the merits.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Murder—Accessory after the
fact—Plea of guilty by principal—Admissible evidence against the
accessory—Guilty knowledge—Circumstantial evidence.

Respondent was indicted on a charge of having
been an accessory after the fact to the unlawful killing of a girl by one
Vincent, who had pleaded guilty of manslaughter. Respondent assisted Vincent in
throwing the girl’s corpse to the bottom of a flooded quarry in a weighted
trunk and testified that he had done so under duress. He was found guilty by
the jury. The Court of Appeal, Rinfret J.A. dissenting, quashed the conviction
on the ground that the plea of guilty made by Vincent was inadmissible as
evidence against his accessory. The appeal by appellant to this Court was based
on the dissenting opinion of Rinfret J.A.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Beetz J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Judson,
Pigeon and de Grandpré JJ.: Respondent was not charged jointly with Vincent.
The indictable offence with which he was charged was not that of being an
accomplice in the homicide, but that of being an accessory after the fact, for
having received, comforted or assisted the said Vincent after the manslaughter
was committed. The cases cited to the effect that if a prisoner pleads guilty
it does not affect his co-prisoner thus do not apply to the circumstances
before this Court. The principal and the accessory were not charged with the
same offence, the charge against the accessory being that of having assisted
the other party to escape justice. This offence is therefore subsequent to the
principal crime and by its very nature it is subject to special rules.

A plea of guilty is admissible evidence
against the person who made it. It may therefore be admitted against an
accessory after the fact for the purpose of proving the principal crime, once
the rule is accepted that, in such a case, evidence admissible against the
principal is equally admissible against an accessory

[Page 223]

after the fact. The majority of the Court of
Appeal erred in regarding this evidence as evidence of a confession made in
other proceedings. Here the principal himself testified that he had admitted
his guilt. If the defence had any reason to question the validity of this confession
it had only to cross-examine Vincent or to call witnesses, which it did not do.

The manner in which the corpse was disposed
of was enough in itself to apprise the accused that he was dealing with the
victim of a homicide. What was obvious to him must equally have been so to the
jury. His defence consisted not of denying that he committed the act but of
invoking grounds of excuse which the jury rejected by finding him guilty.

So far as lack of evidence of an autopsy is
concerned, this ground could not be accepted once it was admitted that the
commission of the principal crime may be proved by the confession of the
principal.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Beetz J., dissenting: Vincent’s plea of guilty was admissible
as evidence against respondent even if its probative value may have been
lessened by the want of an autopsy report and by Vincent’s non-recollection of
the events.

As for respondent’s knowledge of Vincent’s
responsibility for the girl’s death at the time he helped him to dispose of the
body, s. 23(1)  of the Criminal Code  requires proof that respondent
knew at the material time, not that he should have known. Of course, such
knowledge may be established circumstantially, but neither the reprehensibility
of respondent’s act nor any notion of presumptiveness, from either the act or
the conversation of which testimony was given, can avail to support an
inference to prove the required guilty knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt.

side, for sentence to be pronounced; Laskin C.J.
and Beetz J. dissenting.

G. Girouard, for the appellant.

J. Bellemare, Q.C., and F.
Rainville-Laporte, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Beetz J. was
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—There
are two points in this appeal by the Crown from the judgment of the Quebec
Court of Appeal, Rinfret J.A. alone dissenting in a five judge Court, setting
aside a jury verdict of guilty and quashing the conviction of the respondent of
being an accessory after the fact to the unlawful killing of a girl by one
Vincent, who had pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of manslaughter in respect
of her death. The first point concerns the admissibility against the respondent
of Vincent’s plea of guilty to the reduced charge of manslaughter to establish
the unlawful killing of the girl. Whatever may be said of the desirability of
an autopsy report to establish the cause of death, especially in the light of
the fact that Vincent (who testified on the respondent’s trial) remembered
nothing, I am of the opinion that Vincent’s plea of guilty to manslaughter was
admissible against the respondent. The fact that its probative value may have
been lessened by the want of an autopsy report, and by Vincent’s
non-recollection of the events in the light of an allegation that the girl died
of an overdose of drugs, does not affect its admissibility. The jury was
entitled to act on it as proof of the unlawful killing.

The second point concerns the respondent’s
knowledge of Vincent’s responsibility for the girl’s death at the time he helped
him to dispose of the body. Section 23(1)  of the Criminal Code  defines
an accessory after the fact to an offence as one who “knowing that a person has
been a party to the offence, receives, comforts or

[Page 225]

assists him for the purpose of enabling him to
escape”. The only evidence of guilty knowledge adduced by the Crown was the
evidence of a witness who testified that Vincent remarked to a questioner, who
asked where they had been, «qu’il venait de capoter un gars dans le bout qui
barbait tout le monde» and, when the questioner doubted the explanation, the
respondent «a repondu c’était vrai». This conversation took place some
hours after Vincent and the respondent dumped the girl’s body into a quarry
pit, the respondent having testified that he had assisted Vincent under duress
following a threat with a weapon and after being forced to drink beer laced
with a drug. The girl’s body was discovered and identified fifteen days later.
The Quebec Court of Appeal, Montgomery J.A. speaking for four members of the
Court, was of the view that this evidence could not establish that the
respondent knew of the unlawful killing at the time he helped to dispose of the
body. I agree with this view.

The Criminal Code  requires proof that the
respondent accused knew at the material time, not that he should have known. Of
course, such knowledge may be established circumstantially, but neither the
reprehensibility of the respondent’s act nor any notion of presumptiveness,
from either the act or the conversation of which testimony was given, can avail
to support an inference to prove the required guilty knowledge beyond a
reasonable doubt. As Montgomery J.A. noted in his reasons, “there is nothing to
suggest that Vincent’s statement was the literal truth. If he had killed anyone
it was a girl with whom he had been on friendly terms, not ‘un gars… qui
barbait tout le monde’.” He went on to say that there was evidence that both
Vincent and the respondent were under the influence of drugs, they were trying
to explain their failure to return the automobile which the respondent had
borrowed in helping Vincent to dispose of the body and they were probably
trying to impress their listeners. Montgomery J.A. added that even if the
respondent knew by

[Page 226]

that time that Vincent had killed the girl, some
hours had elapsed since the body had been dumped.

The issue of guilty knowledge is not concluded
by the submission that it was for the jury to find that as a fact. I do not
think that the conversation to which the witness testified can be regarded as
probative of the fact. There was no other evidence that would go to establish
it.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Judson, Pigeon and de Grandpré
JJ. was delivered by

PIGEON J.—This appeal by the Crown is against a
judgment of the Court of Appeal of Quebec setting aside the verdict of guilty
returned against respondent by a jury on a charge of having been an accessory
after the fact to a homicide committed on the person of Lucie Beaudoin by one
Henri Vincent. Vincent and the accused both testified at the trial. The former
admitted having pleaded guilty of manslaughter and having accordingly been
sentenced to nine years imprisonment. The latter did not deny having assisted
in disposing of the corpse by throwing it to the bottom of a flooded quarry in
a weighted trunk. His defence rested on the contention that he had been forced
to do so and was under the influence of a drug.

The verdict was quashed on the ground that the
plea of guilty made by Vincent was inadmissible as evidence against his
accessory, the accused. The appeal to this Court is based on the dissenting
opinion of Rinfret J.A., who said, inter alia:

[TRANSLATION] Appellant cites the two cases
of R. v. Moore[1] and
R. v. Berry[2].

In the first case the Court said (I am quoting
the passage relied on by appellant): “If a prisoner pleads guilty, it does not
affect his co-prisoner”.

[Page 227]

In the second, Berry and Knight were charged jointly with murder; the Ontario
Court of Appeal quashed the conviction of Berry, holding that proof of a plea of guilty by Knight was inadmissible
against Berry.

In this last case Roach J.A., speaking for
the Court, expressed the following opinion, already reproduced in the reasons
of my colleague, Mr. Justice Montgomery, but which I take the liberty of
quoting again:

“The law is stated in Phipson on
Evidence 9th Ed., at p. 272, to this effect that a prisoner can only
be affected by the confession of himself, and not by those of, among others,
his accomplices and cases are there stated to support that
proposition.” (Italics in the three places are mine.)

Both cases involved co-accused, accomplices
in the same crime. The Court in such circumstances correctly held that the plea
of guilty by one of the accused or accomplices was inadmissible to incriminate
the other.

In the case at bar, however, the facts are
wholly different: appellant is not charged jointly with Vincent, he is not
charged with the same crime as Vincent: the indictable offence with which he is
charged is not that of being an accomplice in the murder, but that of being an
accessory after the fact, for having [TRANSLATION] “received, comforted or
assisted the said Vincent” after the murder was committed by the latter.

The cases cited thus do not apply to the
circumstances before this Court.

In my view this reasoning is wholly correct. A
distinction must be made between one who is termed an accomplice because he is
charged with having participated in the offence, and one who is described as an
accessory after the fact, not because he participated in the offence, but
because he aided the guilty party in his attempts to escape justice. As Rinfret
J.A. points out, the two cases relied on by the majority in the Court of Appeal
do in fact deal with co‑accused.

In Berry the evidence for the prosecution tended
to show that, while one of the accused, Berry, held the victim, the other, Knight, dealt

[Page 228]

him the blows which resulted in his death. The
judge granted separate trials and Knight was tried first. Without awaiting the
outcome of this trial, counsel for Knight offered a plea of guilty of
manslaughter and this was accepted. At Berry’s trial the judge allowed evidence of this plea of guilt to be
presented, which was done through the testimony of a police officer, not of
Knight. It was correctly held that such evidence was inadmissible because it
was not relevant and, with respect to the other accused, was only hearsay.

The Moore case involved a burglary. There was no
direct evidence. The other accused, one Rynn, had confessed and submitted a
plea of guilty the day before the trial. The only evidence against Moore was that he had been seen in Rynn’s
company before and after the time when the latter commited the offence. It was
quite properly held that the plea of guilty by Rynn could not be relied on to
convict Moore, without other evidence of his participation in the act. In his
reasons Lord Goddard L.C.J. said (at p. 54):

…the fact that he has pleaded Guilty is no
evidence against his co-prisoner. That was laid down by both Hale (Pleas of
the Crown, Vol. I, p. 585n.) and Hawkins (Pleas of the Crown, Book
2, c. 46, s. 34) and also in TONGE (1662) 6 St.Tr. 225), the accepted
principle being that a man’s confession is evidence only against himself and
not against his accomplices. If a prisoner pleads Guilty, it does not affect
his co-prisoner…

Examination of the references shows that in each
case co-prisoners only were involved, not accessories after the fact. Thus the
note on the Tonge case states:

…such confession so proved is only evidence
against the party himself who made the confession, but cannot be made use of as
evidence against any others whom on his examination he confessed to be in the
Treason.

The situation is quite different when a charge
of having been an accessory after the fact is involved. In such a case the
principal and the accessory are not charged with the same offence, the charge
against the accessory being

[Page 229]

that of having assisted the other party to
escape justice. This offence is therefore subsequent to the principal crime. By
its very nature it is subject to special rules. Whereas in the case of several
persons accused of the same offence, each may be tried before or after the
others, plead guilty before or after any of the others, or be convicted
regardless of the decision against any of the others, an accessory after the
fact may not be tried or tender a valid plea of guilty until the principal is
convicted, so that if the latter is acquitted the accessory must of necessity
be discharged.

In the Eli Rowley case[3], Humphreys J., delivering the unanimous
opinion of the English Court of Appeal, said (pp. 149, 150 and 151):

It being a matter which had to be decided
by the jury whether Stanley and Gall were or were not guilty of felony, it was
quite wrong to allow the appellant to plead guilty to having done something in
the shape of assisting and comforting those two persons well knowing that they
had committed a felony. That was a matter which had to be tried, and if it had
been tried and Stanley and Gall had been acquitted, the prosecution would have
been bound to offer no evidence on this indictment against the appellant, on
the ground that it would be absurd to say that he had assisted and comforted
persons whom he knew had committed a felony when they had not in fact committed
a felony…

…Where a prisoner is charged with the
offence of being an accessory after the fact, which involves knowledge on his
part that the person whom he has received and comforted had committed a felony,
it is always improper to accept a plea of guilty from him until the issue has
been tried by a jury, whether the other person has committed the felony or not,
unless, of course, the other person pleads guilty to the felony.

In the United States, it appears to be settled
law that any evidence admissible against the principal is admissible against an
accessory after the fact. In Barone v. United States[4], the United States Court of Appeals
stated (at p. 914):

[Page 230]

…On the trial of defendant as an accessory
after the fact any evidence admissible to prove the principal crime was
admissible against him and the evidence objected to as hearsay was not hearsay
when offered as proof of the burglary and the transportation. Neal v. United
States, 8 Cir., 102 F. 2d 643.

Similarly, in Colosacco v. United States[5], it is stated (at p. 167), a
number of authorities being cited in support:

Conviction of the principal is prima facie
evidence of the principal’s guilt on the trial of the aider and abettor. Other
evidence which would have been admissible against the principal may be admitted
in evidence to prove the guilt of the principal on the trial of the aider and
abettor.

A plea of guilty is obviously admissible
evidence against the person who made it. It must therefore be admitted against
an accessory after the fact for the purpose of proving the principal crime,
once the rule is accepted that, in such a case, evidence admissible against the
principal is equally admissible against an accessory after the fact, in view of
the nature of the offence and the particular rules applicable to it. Moreover,
in the case at bar I do not think the majority of the Court of Appeal was
correct in regarding the evidence in question herein as evidence of a
confession made in other proceedings. The testimony in question was not that of
a third party, but that of Henri Vincent, the principal himself. Called as a
witness, he said:

[TRANSLATION] I pleaded guilty to the
charge of manslaughter.

In my view this clearly meant that Vincent
admitted his guilt. One who says “I have confessed” ipso facto admits
guilt, because confessions are not presumed to have been made in error.
Authorities were cited to establish that a plea of guilty is not necessarily
decisive, and that an accused may be allowed to withdraw it. This is true, but does
not mean that such a confession is worthless. In the present case, there is
proof that it was a true confession because Vincent went on to say that he had

[Page 231]

been sentenced to nine years imprisonment. If
the defence had any reason to question the validity of the confession made by
Vincent, it could have cross-examined him or called witnesses to dispute his
statement. This it did not attempt to do.

Also, it should be noted that, quite apart from
the incriminating conversation in which reference was made to having “done in”,
or killed, someone, the circumstances did clearly show that a homicide had been
committed. One does not dispose of a corpse as was done in the case at bar
except for the purpose of avoiding criminal prosecution. While it is true that
in criminal proceedings the evidence must go beyond all reasonable doubt, this
does not mean that the evidence must exclude any hypothesis, however
improbable, that might clear the accused. Thus, against a person charged with
unlawful possession, proof that the goods were recently obtained by the
commission of a crime is a sufficient indication of guilt. This does not result
from any express provision of the law, but from the basic importance of
circumstantial evidence. The principle is of general application, as can be
seen from the note on R. v. Exall[6],
where a verdict of murder rendered on that basis is reported.

In the case at bar the manner in which the
corpse was disposed of was enough in itself to apprise the accused that he was
dealing with the victim of a homicide. What was obvious to him must equally
have been so to the jury. Moreover, the accused chose to testify, and I see no
basis for hypotheses in his favour which he did not dare suggest himself. His
defence consisted not of denying that he committed the act with which he was
charged, but of invoking grounds of excuse which the jury rejected by finding
him guilty.

So far as lack of evidence of an autopsy is
concerned, it is clear that this ground cannot be accepted once it is admitted
that the commission of the principal crime may be proved by

[Page 232]

the confession of the principal. Furthermore,
the rule applicable to an alleged omission by the Crown to tender all possible
evidence is settled by the decision of this Court in Lemay v. The King[7]. Cartwright J., agreeing with the
majority in this regard, said (at p. 256):

In my respectful opinion the learned trial
judge erred in law in instructing himself that there is a rule of law such as
he deduced from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in LeMay (No. 1) viz: that
the unexplained omission on the part of the Crown to call a witness shewn by
the evidence to have been in a position to give relevant and material evidence
as to the guilt or innocence of the accused necessitates an acquittal.

As for the other grounds raised against the
verdict by the accused, they are dealt with to my entire satisfaction in the
reasons of Rinfret J.A.

On the whole, I would allow the appeal, set
aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal, restore the verdict and refer the
case back to the Court of Queen’s Bench (Crown Side) for passing sentence.

Appeal allowed and case referred back
to the Court of Queen’s Bench for passing sentence, LASKIN C.J. and BEETZ J.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Accused acquitted after jury
trial on charge of non-capital murder—Misdirection—Court of Appeal ordering new
trial on original charge—New trial directed by Supreme Court on charge of manslaughter—Jury
showing by questions that they rejected non-capital murder.

APPEAL from a majority judgment of the Court
of Appeal for British Columbia[1], whereby the
acquittal of the appellant on a charge of non-capital murder was set aside and
a new trial directed. Appeal allowed.

I.G. Waddell, for the appellant.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The appellant accused was
acquitted after a trial by jury before Anderson J. of the British Columbia
Supreme Court on a charge of non-capital murder of her husband. He died of a
knife wound during a drinking party at the spouses’ residence, a party that had
begun earlier in the evening at a hotel. They had had an argument and the
husband left the house. The appellant took a knife and was heard to threaten to
kill her husband. She then left the house, and returned after an interval
(variously estimated at five to fifteen minutes, ten minutes to half an hour,
and half an hour), with her face bruised and bloodied and her clothes muddy and

[Page 721]

bloodstained. She burst out that she had killed
her husband.

At her trial her defences were accident,
self-defence, drunkenness and provocation. No objection was taken by either
counsel for the Crown or for the accused to the trial judge’s charge. The jury
retired at 6:25 p.m., and a few minutes after 9 p.m. they asked for further instruction
on provocation and also “on the conditions for manslaughter”. The foreman then
added “some were wondering about what would be the reduction from manslaughter
to not guilty”. The trial judge recharged briefly on drunkenness and
provocation and the jury retired again. At 10:12 p.m. the jury came back again
and put the following question to the trial judge: “Re-define manslaughter for
some members of the jury. For example, is it applicable if there is no intent
to cause death or injury?” In responding to this question, the trial judge said
this:

If there is no intent to cause death or
injury there is no offence at all, or if there is a reasonable doubt that there
was no intent to cause death or injury it is your duty to acquit the accused.
That’s very simple because our whole—I don’t think there are any exceptions but
there are certainly no exceptions in this case—but if there is no intent to do
something wrong there is no offence; that’s very simple.

The jury returned at 11:35 p.m. with a verdict of acquittal,
both of non-capital murder and of manslaughter.

On appeal by the Crown, a majority of the
British Columbia Court of Appeal found fatal misdirection in the trial judge’s
above-quoted response to the jury’s question when they came back a second time
at 10:12 p.m. Maclean J.A.

[Page 722]

for the majority noted that the Crown had relied
on assault as the unlawful act to prove culpable homicide, and he held that
there was error in telling the jury that an intent to cause death or injury was
necessary to establish manslaughter. A new trial was directed on the original
charge, Maclean J.A. having said in the course of his reasons that “if the jury
was improperly instructed on the law relating to culpable homicide and
manslaughter it follows that there would be no proper basis for a correct
verdict on murder”. If by “culpable homicide” in this statement the learned
judge meant non-capital murder only (and this seems to be the proper view of
it), there is no warrant for saying that the charge was in this respect
improper.

In a dissent, Farris C.J.B.C. was of the opinion
that the charge taken as a whole was adequate; and that although the first
sentence of the impugned direction was wrong when read alone, the jury would
not be misled because they had previously been instructed on the defences of
drunkenness and provocation, and were left with the clear impression that only
accident or self-defence would justify acquittal if they found that the accused
had knifed the deceased. These last-mentioned defences, according to the Chief
Justice, would give meaning in this case to the trial judge’s statement that
“if there is no intent to do something wrong, there is no offence”. The Chief
Justice was of the further view that if there was to be a retrial, it should be
on manslaughter only because the jury had shown by their questions that they
had rejected non-capital murder.

[Page 723]

In my opinion, this is the proper conclusion,
and not a restoration of the verdict of acquittal. I am moved to this
conclusion because there was in the charge proper a misdirection similar to
that which was the subject of the appeal to the British Columbia Court of
Appeal. In the course of his charge, the trial judge said this:

If you find she didn’t mean to kill him you
couldn’t find her guilty of murder. Now of course if she didn’t mean to harm
him at all, she’s not guilty of anything.

I would allow the appeal, and substitute for the
direction of a new trial for non-capital murder a direction for a new trial on
a charge of manslaughter.

Judgment accordingly.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA
SCOTIA, APPEAL DIVISION

Criminal Law—Motor
Vehicles—Breathalizer—Refusal of right to counsel—Admissibility of certificate
of analysis—Criminal Code , ss. 235 , 236 , 237 —Canadian Bill of Rights, s. 2 (c)(ii).

The car driven by the appellant had swerved
over the sidewalk and was stopped by a constable who, in conversation with the
appellant, noticed a strong smell of alcohol on his breath, blood shot eyes and
a flushed face. He then gave him a breathaliser demand. The appellant at the
police station asked to speak to his lawyer before taking the test. This
request was refused and the appellant was given the alternative of either
providing the breath sample forthwith or being charged with refusing to provide
a breath sample. The appellant then submitted to the test which indicated a
reading of 230 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. At trial the
certificate of analysis was admitted in evidence and the appellant convicted of
driving with a blood alcohol level greater than 0.08 contrary to s. 236  of
the Criminal Code . The conviction was affirmed by the Appeal Division.

Held (Spence
and Laskin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux
C.J. and Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Dickson JJ: The result of the
breathaliser test was the only evidence on which the appellant could be
convicted and therefore was proof of “the main issue before the court”. Even if
this evidence had been improperly or illegally obtained, there were no grounds
for excluding it at common law. The certificate was both relevant and cogent
and was clearly admissible at common law. Whatever view may be taken of the
constitutional impact of the Canadian Bill of Rights it is not the case
that whenever there has been a breach of one of the provisions

[Page 575]

of that Bill it justifies the adoption of the
“absolute exclusion” rule.

Per Pigeon J.:
Even if the Canadian Bill of Rights is given the same effect as a
constitutional instrument, this does not mean that a rule of absolute
exclusion, which is in derogation of the common law rule should govern the
admissibility of evidence obtained whenever there has been a breach of one of
the provisions contained in that Bill.

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: The certificate of the result of the test obtained after a
demand made in open defiance of the Canadian Bill of Rights is not a
legal demand and therefore not “a demand made under Section 235(1).”

Per Laskin J.,
dissenting: The prosecution should not be permitted to invoke the
special provisions of s. 237  of the Criminal Code  after denial of
access to counsel in violation of s. 2(c)(ii) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights. There being no doubt as to such denial and violation, the
Courts must apply a sanction. There is no practical alternative to the rule of
exclusion if any serious view at all is to be taken of this breach of the Canadian
Bill of Rights.

The judgment of Fauteux C.J. and Abbott,
Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Dickson JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought, with leave
of this Court, from a judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of
Nova Scotia, which affirmed the judgment of Anderson Co. Ct. J., rendered after
a trial de novo whereby he had affirmed the appellant’s conviction
entered in the provincial magistrate’s court before M.D. Haley, a judge of that
court, on an information charging that he “did unlawfully have the control of a
motor vehicle having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the proportion
thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres
of blood, contrary to s. 236  of the Criminal Code .

The case presented by the Crown rested on the
evidence of the result of a chemical analysis of the breath of the accused made
in purported compliance with s. 237  of the Criminal Code , the
relevant subsection of which reads as follows:

237. (1) In any proceedings under
section 234  or 236 ,…

(c) where a sample of the breath of
the accused has been taken pursuant to a demand made under
subsection 235(1), if…

(ii) the sample was taken as soon as
practicable after the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed
and in any event not later than two hours after that time,

(iii) the sample was received from the
accused directly into an approved container or into an approved instrument
operated by a qualified technician, and

(iv) a chemical analysis of the sample was
made by means of an approved instrument operated by a qualified technician,…

evidence of the result of the chemical
analysis so made is, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, proof of
the proportion of alcohol in the blood

[Page 577]

of the accused at the time when the offence
was alleged to have been committed;…

Having regard to the arguments presented in this
appeal, I think it desirable at the outset to reproduce section 235  of the
Criminal Code  which reads as follows:

235. (1) Where a peace officer on
reasonable and probable grounds believes that a person is committing, or at any
time within the preceding two hours has committed, an offence under
section 234, he may, by demand made to that person forthwith or as soon as
practicable, require him to provide then or as soon thereafter as is
practicable a sample of his breath suitable to enable an analysis to be made in
order to determine the proportion, if any, of alcohol in his blood, and to
accompany the peace officer for the purpose of enabling such a sample to be
taken.

(2) Every one who, without reasonable
excuse, fails or refuses to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer
under subsection (1) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary
conviction and is liable to a fine of not less than fifty dollars and not more
than one thousand dollars or to imprisonment for not more than six months, or
both.

The evidence discloses that at about 1:30 a.m.
on June 3, 1972, a constable of
the Dartmouth Police Force stopped a car being driven by the appellant because
he noticed that it had swerved over the sidewalk. The constable had some
conversation with the appellant through the window of the car and he gave the
following evidence of his actions and observations:

Q. Now tell me what observations you made
of the accused, please?

A. First of all I smelled a strong smell of
alcohol on the accused’s breath. Secondly, I noticed the accused had bloodshot
eyes and a flushed face.

Q. Did you have any opinion after making
your observation as to his condition of sobriety?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. What was your opinion?

A. I …my own opinion he was intoxicated so
I gave him a demand regarding the breathalyzer.

[Page 578]

Q. Now what demand did you give him?

A. I demand you accompany me to the
Dartmouth Police Station to provide a sample of your breath suitable to be
analyzed to determine the amount of alcohol if any in your blood.

Q. Did you tell him anything else?

A. Yes. If he refused this demand he would
be charged with refusal.

Q. Now what time was it that you gave him
this demand?

A. 1:35 a.m., I looked at my watch at the
time.

Q. I take it it was only a matter of a few
minutes before that you had seen the car?

A. Yes, it was, sir.

Q. All right, did you go directly back to
the station?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And what happened back there? Very
briefly, now?

A. I turned the accused Mr. Hogan over
to Constable Gary MacDonald, our qualified breathalyzer operator.

THE COURT: Apparently Mr. Hogan
returned to the station with you?

A. Yes, he did.

In describing his actions after the “demand” had
been made, the appellant said:

My girlfriend and I both got out of the car
and we got in the back of Constable Rafuse’s car and we proceeded to the Dartmouth police station. Upon arrival I
asked my girlfriend to call my counsel.

No charge had been laid against the appellant at
this stage and he had accordingly not been formally arrested, but he gave the
following account of what transpired after his arrival at the police station:

Q. What happened then?

A. I was taken into the breathalyzer room
and introduced to constable MacDonald and I was sitting waiting for the test
when I heard my counsel.

[Page 579]

Q. What do you mean you heard your counsel?

A. I could hear him through the door my
counsel asking if I was at the police station, my counsel was present.

Q. I see, you recognize your counsel’s
voice?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. You know it well?

A. Yes.

Q. So you heard his voice asking to see
you, before the test was completed?

A. This was before the first test was
given, yes.

Q. I see and what did you do at that point?

A. I requested to Constable MacDonald to
see my counsel before taking the test and I was told that I didn’t have any
right to see anyone until after the test and if I refused the test I would be
charged with refusal of the breathalyzer.

Q. I see, so he told you no when you asked
to see your counsel?

A. That’s right.

Q. Why did you want to see counsel?

A. I wanted to see counsel to see whether I
had to take the test or not.

Q. And then I gather the test was given to
you?

A. Yes, I took the test rather than be
nailed with refusal.

Q. I see, in other words you took the
alternative?

A. Yes.

Q. It was offered to you by Constable
MacDonald?

A. Yes.

Q. And that alternative was offered to you
in reply to your request for counsel?

A. Yes, it was.

Q. Was counsel present when your test was
finished?

A. After I left the room I saw my counsel.

Q. I see and where was he?

A. Counsel was just outside the door to the
breathalyzer room.

[Page 580]

Q. At any time was he present during the
test?

A. No, he wasn’t.

The result of the breathalizer test was a
finding of 230 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood and in the
course of his cross-examination the appellant agreed that he had been drinking
rum and could have had “a good pint”.

It was contended on behalf of the appellant that
the evidence of the result of the chemical analysis of his breath taken by
Constable Mac-Donald, who was a qualified technician was inadmissible because
it was obtained in violation of s. 2.(c)(ii) of the Canadian Bill
of Rights which provides, in part, that:

…no law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as to…

(c) deprive a person who has been
arrested or detained…

(ii) of the right to retain and instruct
counsel without delay…

Counsel for the appellant relied on the case of Brownridge
v. The Queen[2],
in support of his contention that the evidence of the result of the
breathalizer test should have been excluded.

In the Brownridge case it was held that
the denial of the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay to an
accused person who was under arrest, afforded that person “reasonable excuse”
for refusing to comply with the demand made pursuant to s. 223(2) (now
235(2)), supra. In considering whether the Brownridge case can be
said to govern the circumstances disclosed in the present case, it is to be
remembered that Brownridge had refused to comply with a demand made under the
purported authority of s. 235(1), and the only question to be determined
was whether his having been denied the right to retain and instruct counsel
constituted a “reasonable excuse” for such refusal. As Mr. Justice Laskin
(as he then was) said in that case, at p. 954:

[Page 581]

This is not a case where the infringement
of the Canadian Bill of Rights renders a federal enactment inoperative. Regina
v. Drybones was a case where the particular federal enactment could have no
operation at all in the face of the Canadian Bill of Rights. The present
case does not present such a blunt face; its facts show that s. 223 can
operate with due obedience to the Canadian Bill of Rights. Hence, all
that is required is that in the invocation of or exercise of the powers under
s. 223 allowance be made for the exercise of the overriding right given by
s. 2(c) (ii) of the Canadian Bill of Rights.

In my view, the result of the failure of
the police officer who demanded the breath sample to make that allowance
vitiated the conviction in this case. This follows not on any theory that
violation of the Canadian Bill of Rights carried this consequence in
every criminal case, but because the violation in this case was the very basis
upon which the accused was charged with an offence under s. 223(2). In
short, the refusal of the accused to give the breath sample until he had an
opportunity to consult a lawyer, a position that he was entitled to take on the
facts herein and on the application of s. 2(c) (ii) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights to those facts, was the foundation of the charge and
conviction for refusing to give a breath sample when so requested.

In the Brownridge case it was the denial
of his right to “retain and instruct counsel without delay” which caused the
accused to refuse to comply with the demand to provide a sample of his breath
for analysis, whereas in the present case the appellant complied with the
demand, albeit reluctantly, and there is no causal connection between the
denial of the right to counsel and the obtaining of the certificate of the
breathalizer test which led to his conviction.

In my opinion the excerpts from the evidence
which I have reproduced above clearly indicate that the initial demand to
provide a sample of the breath for analysis was legally made by the constable
on the highway in accordance with s.

[Page 582]

235(1) at a time when the appellant was neither
“arrested” nor “detained” and he appears to me to have complied with that
demand without hesitation at least to the extent of agreeing “to accompany the
peace officer for the purpose of enabling such a sample to be taken.” There was
no request for counsel at this stage, and it was only after he had reached the
police station and was sitting waiting for the test that he heard the voice of
the lawyer whom he had retained through the agency of his girlfriend and
requested to see him in order to find out whether he had to take the test or
not. It was then that Constable MacDonald told him that he “didn’t have any
right to see anyone until after the test and if I refused the test I would be
charged with refusal of the breathalizer”. The appellant then took the test.

I have had the advantage of reading the reasons
for judgment prepared for delivery by the present Chief Justice and I agree
with him that the fact that the appellant could have refused the breathalizer
test unless he first consulted counsel does not mean that the breath test
evidence was procured by illegal means or trickery and I agree with him also
that the common law rule of admissibility of illegally or improperly obtained
evidence rests primarily on the relevancy of that evidence subject only to the
discretion of the trial judge to exclude it on the ground of unfairness as that
word was interpreted in this Court in The Queen v. Wray[3].

The result of the breathalizer test in the
present case was not only relevant, it was in fact of itself the only evidence
upon which the appellant could have been convicted of the offence of which he
was charged and it therefore constitutes proof of “the main issue before the
court”. Even if this evidence had been improperly or illegally obtained, there
were therefore no grounds for excluding it at common law. In the case of an
accused who the

[Page 583]

police considered to be intoxicated before the
test was taken and who himself agreed that he could have had “a good pint of
rum”, it can hardly be characterized as unfair to accept evidence in proof of
the exact quantity of alcohol that he had absorbed into his blood stream. Apart
from the result of the test constituting proof of an offence under s. 236 ,
it also afforded confirmation of the diagnosis made by the police officer and
served to corroborate the appellant’s own estimate of the amount of rum which
he had consumed.

As the technician’s certificate was both
relevant and cogent it was, in my opinion, clearly admissible at common law and
the courts at first instance and on appeal were correct in accepting it in
accordance with the rules of evidence governing the trial of criminal cases as
they presently exist in this country.

Laskin C.J., however, characterizes the Canadian
Bill of Rights as a “quasi constitutional instrument” by which I take him
to mean that its provisions are to be construed and applied as if they were
constitutional provisions, and in so doing he would adopt as a matter of policy
for Canada, apart from and at variance with the common law position, the rule
of absolute exclusion of all evidence obtained under circumstances where one of
the provisions of the Canadian Bill of Rights has been violated. This
approach stems from an acceptance of the reasoning of the Supreme Court of the United States in such cases as Mapp v. Ohio[4], where that rule was
accepted in relation to evidence obtained after the violation of a right
guaranteed by the American Constitution. These American cases, however, turn on
the interpretation of a Constitution basically different from our own and particularly
on the effect to be given to the “due process of law” provision of the 14th
Amendment of that Constitution for which I am unable to find any counterpart in
the British

[Page 584]

North America Act, which is the source of the legislative authority of the Parliament
of Canada and is characterized in the British North America Act (No. 2)
1949 (13 Geo. VI Ch. 81) as “the Constitution of Canada”.

The case of The Queen v. Drybones,[5] is authority for the
proposition that any law of Canada which abrogates, abridges or infringes any
of the rights guaranteed by the Canadian Bill of Rights should be
declared inoperative and to this extent it accorded a degree of paramountcy to
the provisions of that statute, but whatever view may be taken of the
constitutional impact of the Bill of Rights, and with all respect for
those who may have a different opinion, I cannot agree that, wherever there has
been a breach of one of the provisions of that Bill, it justifies the adoption
of the rule of “absolute exclusion” on the American model which is in
derogation of the common law rule long accepted in this country.

I am, on the other hand, in agreement with the
reasoning expressed by Lord Hodson in King v. The Queen[6], where the Privy
Council had to consider the effect of the search and seizure provisions of the
Jamaican Constitution on the judge’s discretion respecting the exclusion of
evidence obtained pursuant to such a search and seizure.

The provisions of the Jamaica (Constitution)
Order in Council, 1962, Schedule 2, section 19 read as follows:

(1) Except with his own consent, no person
shall be subjected to the search of his person or his property or the entry by
others on his premises.

(2) Nothing contained in or done under the
authority of any law shall be held to be inconsistent with or

[Page 585]

in contravention of this section to the
extent that the law in question make provision which is reasonably required…
for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime…

In the King case the appellant had been
found to be in possession of dangerous drugs after a search and seizure
contrary to the provisions of the Constitution, but in concluding that the
trial judge had acted properly in failing to exclude this evidence, Lord Hodson
said:

This constitutional right may or may not be
enshrined in a written constitution, but it seems to their Lordships that it
matters not whether it depends on such enshrinement or simply upon the common
law as it would do in this country. In either event the discretion of the court
must be exercised and has not been taken away by the declaration of the right
in written form.

It follows from all the above that I am of
opinion that the evidence of the result of the breathalizer test in the present
case was properly admitted in evidence and I would accordingly dismiss this
appeal.

PIGEON J.—I agree with Ritchie J. that this
appeal should be dismissed on the basis that, even if the Canadian Bill of
Rights is given the same effect as a constitutional instrument, this does
not mean that a rule of absolute exclusion, which is in derogation of the
common law rule, should govern the admissibility of evidence obtained wherever
there has been a breach of one of the provisions contained in that Bill.

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—I have had the
opportunity to read the reasons for judgment written by my brother Laskin. I
agree with his conclusion and with the reasons for that conclusion. I am also
of the opinion that the appeal could also be allowed upon the basis that the
word “demand” in s. 237(1) (c) and (f) of the Criminal
Code  must be interpreted to mean a lawful demand and that a demand which
was made in open defiance of the provisions of the Bill of Rights could
not be a lawful demand. Therefore, the certificate of the result of the test
obtained

[Page 586]

after such unlawful demand is not one made
admissible by the provisions of s. 237 .

I, therefore, would allow the appeal.

LASKIN J. (dissenting)—The issue in this
appeal may be formulated as follows. What is the effect of a denial by a police
officer of a right to counsel under s. 2(c)(ii) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44 upon the admissibility of subsequently
obtained breathalizer evidence by which the appellant accused may be convicted
of an offence under Criminal Code  s. 236 ? Under s. 2(c)(ii),
no law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as to deprive a person, who
has been arrested or detained, of the right to retain and instruct counsel
without delay. The offence under s. 236  is driving or having care or
control of a motor vehicle while having a reading of alcohol in the blood
exceeding 0.08.

In Brownridge v. The Queen[7], this Court decided
that an arrested person who refused to submit to a breath test when he was
denied an opportunity to consult counsel before taking the test could not be found
guilty of an offence under what is now Criminal Code  s. 235(2) . That
provision, so far as material, makes it an offence for a person without
reasonable excuse to fail or refuse to comply with a demand by a peace officer
under s. 235(1)  to take a breath test. The case now in appeal to this
Court involves an accused who, similarly, was denied an opportunity to consult
counsel before submitting to a demand that he take a breath test but who,
unlike Brownridge, did not continue to insist that he must first consult his
counsel. He yielded to the demand and took the test. His conviction under
s. 236  was founded upon the evidence of the breathalizer technician
obtained

[Page 587]

in accordance with Criminal Code  s. 237 .
It was conceded that without this evidence, obtained following denial of the
accused’s request to see his counsel (who was then in the police station to
attend upon the accused), the conviction cannot stand.

It is common both to Brownridge and to
the present case that access to counsel was not for the purpose nor would it
have had the effect of delaying the taking of the breath sample beyond the two
hour period specified in s. 237(1) (c)(ii). In this case, the
accused was confronted by a police officer at about 1.35 a.m. and then asked to
go to the police station, and they arrived there at 1.55 a.m., whereupon steps
were taken to administer a breath test. The accused had asked his female
companion to get in touch with his lawyer, and the latter had come immediately
to the police station and the accused heard his voice in an adjoining room. The
record is clear that he asked to see and consult with the lawyer but was
categorically refused an opportunity to do so. The demand that he submit to a
breath test was renewed and the accused submitted to it.

It is not disputed that the peace officer who
conducted the accused to the police station had at the time reasonable and
probable cause, within s. 235(1), to make the demand that the accused take
a breath test and accompany the peace officer for that purpose. There is no
doubt, therefore, that the accused was “detained” within the meaning of
s. 2(c)(ii) of the Canadian Bill of Rights; he risked
prosecution under s. 235(2)  if, without reasonable excuse, he refused the
demand which involved accompanying the peace officer to fulfil it.

[Page 588]

Counsel for the appellant urged that the demand
must be a lawful one, and contended that it could not be when it was supported
by an unlawful denial of right to counsel. In my opinion, what is involved in
this submission, if it is not to be treated as an effort to invalidate
retroactively a demand that was properly made in the first place, is an
allegation that the demand, being a continuing one to the time when the
breathalizer test is given, may justifiably be resisted at the point where the
right to consult counsel is denied before the test is taken. This, however, is
the Brownridge case, and turns on whether a charge under s. 235(2) 
will succeed. In the present case, the issue goes a little deeper, and the
question is not the lawfulness of a resistance to the continuing demand but
whether, failing resistance, an accused, who has wrongfully been denied counsel
before taking the test, may successfully contest the admissibility of the
breathalizer evidence which, taken under the special provisions for its use
prescribed by s. 237 , is tendered in support of a charge under
s. 236 .

In my opinion, the accused appellant is entitled
to succeed in this contention. I do not find it necessary to gloss the word
“demand” in s. 237(1) (c) and (f) to mean “lawful
demand”, consonant with the Canadian Bill of Rights, in order to qualify
the breathalizer evidence as receivable, with all the statutory advantages for
its reception provided by s. 237 . Strictly speaking, if the demand is made
in conformity with s. 235(1) this satisfies s. 237(1) (c) and (f).
The more relevant consideration is the relationship between the Canadian
Bill of Rights and the resort to special statutory methods of proof where
there is previous denial to an accused of a related guarantee of the Canadian
Bill of Rights. In this connection, I point out that there

[Page 589]

was in the present case no incompatibility
between recognition of the particular guarantee of access to counsel and resort
to the special mode of proof; and it was clearly the right of the accused to
have access to counsel before the authorities proceeded to administer the
breathalizer test.

The question that arises, therefore, is whether
the vindication of this right should depend only on the fortitude or
resoluteness of an accused so as to give rise to a Brownridge situation,
or whether there is not also an available sanction of a ruling of
inadmissibility where the police authorities are able to overcome an accused’s
resistance to a breathalizer test without prior access to counsel. Nothing
short of this would give reasonable assurance of respect of an individual’s
right to counsel by police authorities whose duty to enforce the law goes hand
in hand with a duty to obey it.

There is no suggestion here of any physical
force in the ultimate submission of the accused without having had his right to
counsel recognized, but I do not think that any distinction should be drawn in
the establishment of principle according to whether an accused yields through
fear or a feeling of helplessness or as a result of polite or firm importuning
or aggressive badgering. I should note also that there was no contention of
waiver by the accused of his right to counsel, assuming that would be an answer
to an alleged breach of any of his rights as an individual under the Canadian
Bill of Rights.

The present case does not involve this Court in
any reassessment of the principles underlying the admissibility of illegally
obtained evidence as they developed at common law. We have a statutory policy
to administer, one which this Court has properly recognized as giving primacy
to the guarantees of the Canadian Bill of Rights by way of a positive
suppressive effect upon the

[Page 590]

operation and application of federal
legislation: see The Queen v. Drybones[8],.
The result may be, as in Drybones, to render federal legislation
inoperative or, as in Brownridge, federal legislation may become
inapplicable in the particular situation while otherwise remaining operative.
The sanction in the present case would be to preclude use against a person of a
special form of proof when it is obtained following a deliberate violation of a
right of that person under the Canadian Bill of Rights. If, as the Bill
enjoins, s. 237  of the Criminal Code  is not to be applied so as to
deprive a detained person of access to counsel, I do not see how its provisions
can be utilized against a detained person in any case where that person’s right
of access to counsel has been denied in the course of that utilization. Moreover,
it cannot matter that resort to s. 237  is the only way in which proof can
be made of the main element of the offence defined in s. 236 .

Counsel for the Crown in this appeal put forward
the decision of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, sitting en banc, in Regina
v. Steeves[9],
and the decision of this Court in O’Connor v. The Queen[10], in support of the
conviction of the appellant. Both of these cases antedated Drybones. In Sleeves,
the accused had gone with his counsel to a police station to make out a
motor vehicle accident report and, when questioned by the police after proper
warning, he was advised by counsel not to answer certain questions. Thereupon
he was arrested for failing to stop at the scene of an accident and taken for
interrogation out of the presence of his counsel, who was refused permission to
accompany him and later was refused permission to see him. During his
interrogation the accused divulged the name of a person who was apparently
called

[Page 591]

as a Crown witness. The magistrate who tried the
case found that the accused had been denied access to counsel following his
arrest, in violation of the Canadian Bill of Rights; and although the
Crown’s evidence on the charge had been heard the magistrate dismissed it on
the ground that because of the denial of access to counsel he had been denied a
fair trial. On appeal by way of case stated, it was held that the magistrate
was wrong in dismissing the charge when he found a violation of the Canadian
Bill of Rights, and the case was remitted to the magistrate for
adjudication on the merits on the evidence adduced before him. Whether the
result in Steeves turned on the fact that the denial of access to
counsel in respect of the pre-trial interrogation had no bearing on the
fairness of the succeeding trial (as Ilsley C.J. said, speaking for the
majority), or did not involve a denial of a fair hearing under s. 2(e) of
the Canadian Bill of Rights (as Coffin J., concurring, said), it is not
in point or persuasive for the present case. In the perspective of the present
case, and in the light of Drybones, the proper result in Steeves would
be not to dismiss the charge against the accused but to require the Crown to
support the charge against him without the benefit of the testimony obtained by
denying to the accused his right of access to counsel.

In Steeves, Coffin J. also made the point
that the accused was not a compellable witness at the pre-trial interrogation.
If any analogy is to be drawn to the present case, the fact is that the accused
here was under compulsion to provide a breath sample unless he had a reasonable
excuse for refusing to submit. If the analogy be pursued, it would seem to
follow that because of the compellability, the denial of access to

[Page 592]

counsel should result in exclusion of the
evidence obtained following that denial.

O’Connor v. The Queen, although having some similarity to the present case differs in at
least two significant ways, in addition to being a pre-Drybones decision.
The accused O’Connor was charged with and convicted of impaired driving. He had
submitted to two breathalizer tests before he knew he was under arrest and
before he was told he was going to be charged. After taking the tests he asked
to get in touch with his lawyer and was allowed to make a telephone call which
proved unproductive. He was denied permission to make a second call. Ritchie J.
speaking for the Court majority noted (at p. 625 of [1966] S.C.R.) that
“on the facts as stated by the learned magistrate it is not suggested that the
appellant had been deprived of his rights under s. 2(c)(ii) until
after he had voluntarily submitted to the two breathalizer tests being
administered to him and it is a little difficult to understand the grounds upon
which Mr. Justice Haines decided that this evidence should be excluded”.
In the present case the denial of access to counsel occurred before any
breathalizer test was taken.

The second significant difference arises from
the further observation of Ritchie J. that even if the absence of the accused’s
lawyer deprived him of being advised of his right to refuse to take the tests
(under the law as it then stood) the breathalizer evidence was nonetheless
admissible because of the then s. 224(3)  of the Criminal Code , making
evidence of a breath test admissible notwithstanding the want of any prior
warning to the accused that he need not give the sample or that the results of
the analysis thereof might be adduced in evidence. Section 224(3) , referred to
in the O’Connor case, is now found in another context in s. 237(1) (b)
but with the important exclusion from its provisions

[Page 593]

of “a sample taken pursuant to a demand made
under s. 235(1)”. Special provision for the taking of a sample of breath
and for the admissibility of evidence of the analysis thereof is made in
s. 237 (1) (c) which opens with the words “where a sample of the
breath of the accused has been taken pursuant to a demand made under
section 235(1)”. That demand relates to reasonable and probable grounds
for believing that the person of whom the demand is made has been driving while
impaired. The breath sample analysis under s. 237(1) (c) is related
more directly however to the offence defined in s. 236 , of which the
accused in this case was convicted.

Finally, as to the O’Connor case, it was
decided on a strict view of the questions put by way of stated case, and they
did not involve any issue of the admissibility or exclusion of evidence based
upon the previous denial of access to counsel. Ritchie J. put the matter
clearly as follows (at p. 627 of [1966] S.C.R.):

As I have indicated, I am of opinion that
when Mr. Justice Haines decided that the evidence of the breathalizer
tests should be ignored, he was deciding a question of law which did not arise
out of the stated case and which does not form one of the grounds upon which
leave to appeal to this Court was granted.

Although it appears to me to be enough to rest
my decision in this appeal on the operative view of the Canadian Bill of
Rights taken in Drybones, I feel constrained to elaborate on the
considerations which move me to allow this appeal. I do this because otherwise
a comparison will inevitably be drawn between the policy underlying the
admissibility of relevant evidence, no matter how obtained (unless it falls
within the involuntary confession category) and the contrary policy which I
would enforce here,

[Page 594]

and an explanation should be offered for
preferring the latter. I approach my elaboration by noting that the present
case does not fall easily into the class of cases where evidence is illegally
obtained in the sense that illegal means or acts are the vehicles through which
the impugned evidence is procured, as for example, by illegal search or seizure
or by trespass or by force; nor does it fall easily within that class of cases
where tricks or falsehoods are used to get evidence against an accused person.
Forthright denial of access to counsel was not here a means of obtaining the
breath tests, to which the accused was required to submit unless he had a
reasonable excuse for refusing; and the fact that he could have refused, unless
he first consulted counsel, does not mean that the breath test evidence was
procured by illegal means or trickery as those terms were understood and
considered in Kuruma v. The Queen[11].
I need not therefore assess any of the cases in the two classes but will
deal with them overall in terms of the judicial policy or policies that they
exhibit.

The common law rule of admissibility of
illegally or improperly obtained evidence rests simply on the relevancy of the
evidence to issues on which it is adduced, without regard to the means by which
it was procured (confessions or out-of-court statements by an accused aside).
The rule in Canada goes back to Regina v. Doyle[12], where it was said, at
p. 353, in respect of evidence obtained by execution of an illegal search
warrant, that “the evidence is admissible so long as the fact so wrongly
discovered is a fact—apart from the manner in

[Page 595]

which it was discovered—admissible against the
party.” There is no thought that the criminal should go free because the
constable has blundered, (to use the words of Judge Cardozo in People v.
Defore[13],
at p. 21), subject only to a discretion in the trial judge to exclude
the evidence on the ground of unfairness. In this Court, the discretion has
been very narrowly confined: see The Queen v. Wray[14]; and a recent review
of Commonwealth case law carries the conclusion that “this discretion is very
rarely acted on”: see Heydon, Illegally Obtained Evidence (1), [1973]
Crim.L.Rev. 603, at p. 605; and see also Heydon, Illegally Obtained
Evidence (2), [1973] Crim.L.Rev. 690. Illegalities or improprieties attending
the eliciting or discovery of relevant evidence are, on the orthodox common law
view, res inter alios acta. They are said to have their sanction in
separate criminal or civil proceedings, of which there is little evidence,
either as to recourse or effectiveness; or, perhaps, in internal disciplinary
proceedings against offending constables, a matter on which there is no
reliable data in this country.

The choice of policy here is to favour the
social interest in the repression of crime despite the unlawful invasion of
individual interests and despite the fact that the invasion is by public
officers charged with law enforcement. Short of legislative direction, it might
have been expected that the common law would seek to balance the competing
interests by weighing the social interest in the particular case against the
gravity or character of the invasion, leaving it to the discretion of the trial
judge whether the balance should be struck in favour of reception or exclusion
of particular evidence. I have already indicated that the discretion has been
narrowed,

[Page 596]

and, I would add, to an extent that underlines a
wide preference for admissibility. It appears that only in a line of Scottish
and Irish cases has there been any consideration of striking a balance between
the competing interests involved where there is a challenge to admissibility
because of illegality or impropriety: see Heydon, op.cit., at pp.
607-610; and see also Cowen and Carter, Essays on the Law of Evidence
(1956), The Admissibility of Evidence Obtained through Illegal Searches and
Seizures, at pp. 83-92. Relevant to that consideration would be, of course, the
trustworthiness of the tendered evidence.

Opposed to the dominant common law position is
that at which the Supreme Court of the United States has arrived in enforcing
the guarantees of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, applicable to the
central authorities, against unreasonable searches and seizures, and, through
it, those of the Fourteenth Amendment enjoining the States not to “deprive any
person of life, liberty or property without due process of law”. In general, a
rule of exclusion of illegally obtained evidence, tendered to show the guilt of
an accused, is enforced both in federal and state prosecutions: see Weeks v.
U.S.[15],
Mapp v. Ohio[16].

The American exclusionary rule, in enforcement
of constitutional guarantees, is as much a judicial creation as was the common
law of admissibility. It is not dictated by the Constitution, but its rationale
appears to be that the constitutional guarantees cannot be adequately served if
their vindication is left to civil actions in tort or criminal prosecutions,
and that a check rein on illegal police activity which invades constitutional
rights can best be held by

[Page 597]

excluding evidence obtained through such
invasions. Whether this has resulted or can result in securing or improving
respect for constitutional guarantees is not an easy question to answer,
although attempts are being made to do so through empirical studies: see Spiotto,
Search and Seizure: An Empirical Study of the Exclusionary Rule and Its
Alternative (1973), 2 Jo.Leg.S. 243.

It may be said that the exclusion of relevant
evidence is no way to control illegal police practices and that such exclusion
merely allows a wrongdoer to escape conviction. Yet where constitutional
guarantees are concerned, the more pertinent consideration is whether those guarantees,
as fundamentals of the particular society, should be at the mercy of law
enforcement officers and a blind eye turned to their invasion because it is
more important to secure a conviction. The contention that it is the duty of
the Courts to get at the truth has in it too much of the philosophy of the end
justifying the means; it would equally challenge the present law as to
confessions and other out-of-Court statements by an accused. In the United
States, its Supreme Court, after weighing over many years whether other methods
than exclusion of evidence should be invoked to deter illegal searches and
seizures in state as well as in federal prosecutions, concluded that the
constitutional guarantees could best be upheld by a rule of exclusion.

The Canadian Bill of Rights is a half-way
house between a purely common law regime and a constitutional one; it may aptly
be described as a quasi-constitutional instrument. It does not embody any
sanctions for the enforcement of its terms, but it must be the

[Page 598]

function of the Courts to provide them in the
light of the judicial view of the impact of that enactment. The Drybones case
has established what the impact is, and I have no reason to depart from the
position there taken. In the light of that position, it is to me entirely
consistent, and appropriate, that the prosecution in the present case should
not be permitted to invoke the special evidentiary provisions of s. 237  of
the Criminal Code  when they have been resorted to after denial of access
to counsel in violation of s. 2(c)(ii) of the Canadian Bill of
Rights. There being no doubt as to such denial and violation, the Courts
must apply a sanction. We would not be justified in simply ignoring the breach
of a declared fundamental right or in letting it go merely with words of
reprobation. Moreover, so far as denial of access to counsel is concerned, I
see no practical alternative to a rule of exclusion if any serious view at all
is to be taken, as I think it should be, of this breach of the Canadian Bill
of Rights.

My conclusion does not, of course, preclude
proof otherwise than by resort to s. 237 , and such proof might well have
been available to the Crown in respect of a charge of impaired driving under
s. 234, had such a charge been laid in addition to or in lieu of a charge
under s. 236 .

I would, therefore, allow this appeal, set aside
the judgments below and quash the conviction.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Perjury—Accused testifying he
could not remember events described by him in statement to police—Whether false
evidence, known by accused to be false, given with intent to mislead
Court—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 120.

Courts—Stare decisis—Uniformity among
Provincial Appellate Courts required only as result of decisions of Supreme
Court of Canada.

The accused was assaulted by two men and
shortly thereafter he described to a police officer the details of what had
occurred. The next day he dictated to two detectives a statement again
describing the assault. He read over the statement and signed each page. In
consequence of the foregoing, the two men were charged that “with intent to
wound, they did unlawfully cause bodily harm to [the accused]”. At the time of
their preliminary inquiry, and before it began, one of the detectives who was
present at the taking of the statement from the accused showed him a
typewritten copy which he was asked to read, and then the detective asked if
“everything was alright”, to which the accused replied “yes”. When called to
give evidence at the preliminary inquiry, the accused said that he could not
remember the events described in the statement. In the result, the case against
the two men was dismissed. A charge of perjury against the accused was then
laid and following his trial he was convicted. On appeal, a majority of the
Alberta Appellate Division affirmed the conviction and the accused then
appealed to this Court. The only question to be considered was whether the
false evidence, which the accused knew to be false, was given with “intent to
mislead the Court” within the meaning of s. 120  of the Criminal Code .

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

This was not a case of mere error, honestly
made. The circumstances amply justified a conclusion that the failure of
recollection was dishonest and deliber-

[Page 108]

ately asserted to prevent the Court from
arriving at a decision upon credible evidence. The contention that the accused
by answering that he could not remember could not be said to have any intent to
mislead the Court when there was no other evidence against which his failure of
recollection could be measured was rejected.

Colder v. The Queen, [1960] S.C.R. 892, applied; R. v. Patterson (1967), 61 W.W.R.
379; R. v. Glenfield, [1934] 3 W.W.R. 465, overruled.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Appellate Division[1],
dismissing the appellant’s appeal from his conviction for perjury. Appeal
dismissed.

A.M. Harredence, Q.C., for the appellant.

R.B. Nelles, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This appeal, from the
affirmation by a majority of the Alberta Appellate Division of a conviction of
perjury, raises an important question as to the meaning of the words “with
intent to mislead” in s. 120  of the Criminal Code  and, in that
connection, raises also the question of the correctness of R. v. Patterson[2], a decision of the Saskatchewan
Court of Appeal. McDermid J.A., who dissented from the majority, did so on the
ground that he felt that in the interests of the uniform administration of the
criminal law he should follow the Patterson case, notwithstanding that he
considered that it was wrongly decided. Acting upon propositions advanced by
Harvey C.J.A. in R. v. Glenfield[3], McDermid
J.A. was of the view that he should follow a decision of another provincial
appellate Court, albeit in his opinion erroneous, when this resulted in an
acquittal of an accused, so long as he did not consider that decision to be
clearly wrong.

[Page 109]

In my opinion, R. v. Glenfield should not
be taken as establishing any governing rule as between or among provincial
appellate courts. A provincial appellate court is not obliged, as a matter
either of law or of practice, to follow a decision of the appellate court of
another province unless it is persuaded that it should do so on its merits or
for other independent reasons. The distinction drawn by Harvey C.J.A. between a
decision of another provincial appellate court which is felt to be wrong and a
decision thereof which is felt to be clearly wrong is not one that commends
itself either for its logic or its utility. Indeed, at the time the Glenfield
case was decided, the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, provided by
s. 1025(1), as enacted by 1920 (Can.), c. 43, s. 16, for an appeal in
cases of indictable offences to the Supreme Court of Canada, with leave, where
there was conflict with the decision of another provincial appellate court in a
like case. This provision, repealed by 1948 (Can.), c. 39, s. 42, is
somewhat inconsistent with the policy which the Glenfield case reflected
so far as uniformity of the criminal law was regarded from the standpoint of
provincial appellate court decisions. The only required uniformity among
provincial appellate courts is that which is the result of the decisions of
this Court.

The perjury charge in the present case arose in
the following circumstances. The accused was with a married woman in her
apartment in the early hours of February 2, 1972, when the husband, from whom
she was separated, broke in and chased the accused out the back door. A
constable arrived at the apartment at about 2 a.m. and began a search for the accused and the husband. The two turned
up at the apartment at about 4:50 a.m., with the accused looking as if he had
been assaulted. The constable drove him to a hospital for treatment, and during
the drive and again after being treated the accused described in detail what
occurred after the angry husband entered the apartment. He said he had been
caught near the apartment and assaulted, then taken by the husband and another
person by car to a yacht club area where he was again assaulted by the husband

[Page 110]

who used a hammer on him. The accused told of
the hammer being thrown away in a certain location and one was later found
there. Next day, the estranged wife picked up the accused at the hospital and
they returned to her apartment where the accused dictated to two detectives a
statement again describing the assault. He read over the statement and signed
each page. Before dictating the statement the accused described the assault to
the detectives.

In consequence of the foregoing, the husband and
his associate were charged that “with intent to wound, they did unlawfully
cause bodily harm to [the accused]”, an offence under Criminal Code  s.
228 . At the time of their preliminary inquiry on March 20, 1972, and before it
began, one of the detectives who was present at the taking of the statement
from the accused showed him a typewritten copy which he was asked to read, and
then the detective asked if “everything was alright”, to which the accused
replied “yes”. When called to give evidence at the preliminary inquiry, the
accused said that he could not remember being at the married woman’s apartment
on the particular morning and he could not remember the events of the day. He
did remember being in hospital and being treated for injuries, but could not
remember how he got them; and although he admitted knowing the two persons who
were charged under s. 228 , he could not remember seeing them in the
morning of February 2, 1972. In the result, the case against the two was
dismissed. The charge of perjury against the accused was then laid.

The charge alleged that he committed perjury by
falsely swearing that he did not remember seeing either the husband or his
associate on the morning of February 2, 1972, and that he did not remember
having been given a beating that morning, knowing this to be false and with
intent to mislead the Court. Section 120  of the Criminal Code  reads as
follows:

[Page 111]

Every one commits perjury who, being a witness
in a judicial proceeding, with intent to mislead gives false evidence, knowing
that the evidence is false.

It is common ground that the accused gave
evidence that was false and that he knew that it was false. The only question
to be considered here is whether this was done “with intent to mislead the
Court”.

Counsel for the appellant contended that the
accused by answering that he could not remember could not be said to have any
intent to mislead the Court when there was no other evidence against which his
failure of recollection could be measured. The Court, it was submitted, could
not be misled when there was nothing before it to lead it into error. In short,
the submission is that the failure to give any affirmative response by
asserting a want of recollection of events, which the accused had described in
out of court oral and written statements, cannot involve an intent to mislead
the Court when there was no other evidence to give concreteness to the lapse of
memory. Reliance was placed upon R. v. Patterson in support of these
contentions.

In R. v. Patterson, there was a similar
failure of recollection by a witness at a preliminary inquiry. He had been
interviewed by two police officers on January 30, 1966, in connection with a
shooting death that had occurred the previous day and had a conversation with
them about the involvement of one Newman in the shooting. When asked at the
time to give a written statement, the accused replied “You know me better than
that”. At Newman’s preliminary inquiry about seven weeks later the accused was
called as a witness, and when asked about his conversation with the police
officers he said that he could not recall any such conversation. In his words
at the time, “I forgot anything… if I said anything I forgot anything I did
say”. His appeal from a conviction of perjury was allowed by the Saskatchewan
Court of Appeal in reasons delivered by Culliton C.J.S. with whom Hall J.A.
agreed and in concurring reasons by Maguire J.A., Culliton C.J.S. concluded
that the

[Page 112]

Crown had failed to establish the “intent to
mislead, that is… intent to lead the Court into error or to cause the Court to
err”. He elaborated this conclusion as follows (at p. 156 of [1968]
2 C.C.C.):

Clearly the appellant did not intend to
assist the Court and it may properly be said that his attitude was of hostility
and his intent one of obstruction. Such states of mind, however, do not
constitute an intent to mislead. Here the appellant said nothing—he gave no
evidence upon which the Court could draw any inference or reach any conclusion.
As a matter of fact, he neither admitted nor denied making a statement to the
police officers but confined his testimony to the statement that if he had done
so, he had now forgotten. Such a statement, even if false, is a negative one
and cannot be construed as the giving of false evidence with the intent to
mislead the Court.

Maguire J.A. stated that he confined himself to
the particular facts and that “the particular testimony forming the basis of
the charge of perjury was not evidence admissible on the issue of the guilt of
the accused then under trial, and the prosecution has failed to establish the
intent to mislead, necessary to constitute the offence”.

In my opinion, the Patterson case is
indistinguishable on its facts and in its principle from the present case, and
I hold it to have been wrongly decided. The distinction that Maguire J.A. would
draw between evidence that is admissible on the issue of guilt and evidence
that is not so admissible is not in itself a tenable one when regard is had to
s. 107  of the Criminal Code , defining “evidence” for the purpose of
that part of the Criminal Code  which contains the perjury
section as “an assertion of fact, opinion, belief or knowledge whether
material or not and whether admissible or not”. Conceivably, it may be
appropriate in a particular case as precluding an inference that there was an
intent to mislead. It should be noted too that the fact that in a particular
case the Court could not

[Page 113]

be or would not be misled does not alone
preclude a finding that there was an intent to mislead. I am in agreement with
Cartwright J., as he then was, in Calder v. The Queen[4], at p. 897, that “it may well
be that if there were evidence to support findings that the appellant had given
evidence false in fact knowing it to be false the tribunal of fact, in the
absence of other evidence as to his intention, could properly draw the
inference that in so doing he intended to mislead the Court”. In the Calder case,
the accused was an innocent bystander who, under subpoena, became a witness in
a divorce case, and he erred in his recollection of events occurring more than
a year before. It was held that mere error afforded no basis for finding that
he either knowingly gave false evidence or intended to mislead the Court.

The present case, like the Patterson case,
is not one of mere error, honestly made. The circumstances of each, with almost
the same lapse of time between the statements given and the judicial proceeding
at which the accused was a witness (reinforced in the present case by the fact
that the statement was written and was confirmed by the accused just before the
preliminary inquiry began) amply justify a conclusion that the failure of
recollection was dishonest and deliberately asserted to prevent the Court from
arriving at a decision upon credible evidence. I do not see how by merely being
negative (according to the assessment made in the Patterson case) a
person charged with perjury can, on that ground alone, escape conviction when
his negative evidence (“I can’t remember”) has been found to have been false
and knowingly so.

It may be that drawing an inference of an intent
to mislead is more difficult where “can’t remember” evidence is given or “I
forget” evidence is given than where a witness lies about a fact about which he
gave an out-of-court statement or alters the narrative previously given by

[Page 114]

positive falsification or variation. This does
not, however, go to a different legal measure on the question of culpability.
The law of perjury, a necessary sanction in the administration of justice,
would become toothless if a calculated lapse of memory was enough to defeat it.
The quest for truth, so far as a court can discern it from evidence, can be as
easily frustrated by false negative evidence as by false positive evidence. In
this sense the falsity has positive consequences in either event.

There may be cases in which knowing
falsification will not support an inference of intent to mislead, but this is
not one of them. The Calder case indicates that to falsify knowingly is
not invariably enough for a conviction of perjury, and I take the same view. In
this respect, the point made in the Patterson case, that in Canada (as distinguished from other
jurisdictions) proof of an intent to mislead is necessary to conviction, is
worth restatement. It is the ratio of the Patterson case that is
unacceptable.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
SASKATCHEWAN

Criminal law—Oral threat to cause injury
made face to face—No offence under Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34,
s. 331(1)(a).

The respondent was found guilty of having, by
speaking to a certain person, uttered a threat to cause injury to the said
person, contrary to s. 331(1) (a) of the Criminal Code . The
Saskatchewan Court of Appeal set aside the conviction and the appellant
appealed to this Court from that decision. The point at issue was whether the
words “or otherwise” in s. 331(1)  are intended to cover purely oral
threats made directly or face to face by the person who utters them to the
person they are aimed at.

Held (Martland,
Judson and Pigeon JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Ritchie, Spence, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: In order to
conclude that s. 331 does not cover purely oral threats made face to face,
it suffices to fall into line with the technique used by Parliament in
delimiting the offence. The definition of the offence lists specifically,
though not exhaustively, a number of means of expressing a threat. The
non-exhaustive nature of the listing is not meant to do away with the very
technique used by Parliament to delimit the boundaries of the offence and
thereby to suppress all delimitation. A line must therefore be drawn at some
point with respect to the means by which threats can be uttered. A stop should
at least be made at the simplest, most direct and most frequently used mode of
expression, the oral proffering of a threat face to face, especially as it
appears never to have amounted to a criminal offence.

Per Martland,
Judson and Pigeon JJ., dissenting : The word “otherwise” in
s. 331(1)  includes an oral threat made face to face. There is no valid
reason for

[Page 486]

reading this enactment otherwise than
literally. There is no ambiguity whatsoever, it covers any threat of the kind
that is specified, the word “otherwise” being completely general.

The fact that oral threats are already
covered in certain cases under other sections is no reason for putting a
restrictive construction on the wording of a section written in general
terms.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], allowing an appeal
from the conviction of the accused under s. 331(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code . Appeal dismissed, Martland, Judson and Pigeon JJ. dissenting.

K.W. MacKay, for the appellant.

T.G. Graf, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Ritchie, Spence,
Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

BEETZ J.—The facts of the present case are
reported elsewhere: Regina v. Nabis1. It will suffice
to summarize them. Respondent was found guilty of having, by speaking to one
Donald Brown, uttered a threat to cause injury to said Brown, contrary to
s. 331 (1) (a) of the Criminal Code .

The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal set aside the
conviction and appellant appealed to this Court from that decision.

Counsel for the appellant submitted that the
Court of Appeal had erred in holding that oral threats made face to face do not
constitute an offence prohibited by s. 331  of the Criminal Code  and
that there could be no offence under this provision unless there had been
recourse to some instrument or means of communication. Appellant also submitted
that the Court of Appeal erred in following the reasoning of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Wallace[2],
rather than that of the High Court of

[Page 487]

Ontario in R. v.
DiLorenzo[3].

Section 331  of the Criminal Code  reads as
follows:

331. (1) Every one commits an offence who
by letter, telegram, telephone, cable, radio, or otherwise, knowingly utters,
conveys or causes any person to receive a threat

(a) to cause death or injury to any
person, or

(b) to burn, destroy or damage real
or personal property, or

(c) to kill, maim, wound, poison or
injure an animal or bird that is the property of any person.

(2) Every one who commits an offence under
paragraph (1)(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for ten years.

(3) Every one who commits an offence under
paragraph (1)(b) or (c) is guilty of

(a) an indictable offence and is
liable for imprisonment for two years, or

(b) an offence punishable on summary
conviction.

What the Court must decide is whether the words
“or otherwise” in s. 331 (1)  are intended to cover purely oral threats
made directly or face to face by the person who utters them to the person they
are aimed at.

In the Wallace case, the accused had been
charged with having, in the presence of a witness, uttered a threat to cause
death or injury to another person, but the indictment did not specify the means
by which the threat was uttered. At the outset of the trial the indictment was
quashed for reasons which are not reported. The Crown appealed. The only
question before the Court of Appeal of British Columbia was the following: did the indictment disclose an offence known to
the law? Branca J.A., speaking for the Court, said that even though, generally,
an indictment is not required to specify the means by which an offence is
committed, the matter stands on a different basis where a section makes
such means an element of the offence; further, in his opinion the words “let-

[Page 488]

ter, telegram, telephone, cable, radio” used in
s. 331  refer to a category of means of communication, all of which are not
mentioned in the section, and “or otherwise” must be restrictively construed so
as not to extend outside of this category. In other words, Branca J.A. applied the
ejusdem generis rule. The appeal was accordingly dismissed.

In the DiLorenzo case the accused had
been charged with having, by procuring one Norman Menezes to make the threat,
threatened to cause injury to a certain Richard Zavitz and his family. Replying
on Wallace, the accused moved before the presiding judge that the jury
be directed to bring in a verdict of acquittal on the ground that he was
charged with an offence unknown to the law. Keith J., of the High Court of
Ontario, treated as obiter the consideration of the ejusdem generis rule
in the Wallace case; in his opinion, the indictment could have been
quashed merely on the basis that the specific means by which the threat had
been expressed by the accused was not referred to in the indictment. Besides,
he differed with the British Columbia Court of Appeal and was of the opinion
that the words “or otherwise” in s. 331  ought to be interpreted as meaning
“or in any other way”. He declined to direct an acquittal.

In the instant case in the Court of Appeal, Hall
J.A.—with whom Woods J.A. concurred—after setting out his analysis of
s. 331 , and the history thereof, and comparing it with other Criminal
Code  provisions which make it an offence to utter threats if a particular
purpose is proven, opted in favour of the interpretation given in Wallace rather
than that given in DiLorenzo. He held further that the acts charged
against the accused in the DiLorenzo and Wallace cases could be
distinguished from the act charged here in that they involved threats meant to
be communicated to the victim through or by a third person instead of a threat
made face to

[Page 489]

face. Brownridge J.A. for his part rejected the
latter distinction. In his view, one had to choose between the two
interpretations above mentioned, and, for reasons pertaining to the history of
the legislation, he adopted the interpretation which had prevailed in the Wallace
case.

It is certain that, taken literally, the words
“or otherwise” in s. 331  may have a sufficiently broad meaning to embrace
purely oral threats made face to face. This is one of the arguments put forward
by counsel for the appellant.

In their present form, the provisions of
s. 331  date back to the Statutes of 1960-61, c. 43, s. 10, which
repealed the former s. 316, adopted by the 1953-54, c. 51, revision. This
latter section read as follows:

316. (1) Every one commits an offence who
sends, delivers, utters or directly or indirectly causes any, person to receive

(a) a letter or writing that he
knows contains a threat to cause death or injury to any person; or

(b) a letter or writing that he
knows contains a threat

(i) to burn, destroy or damage real or
personal property, or

(ii) to kill, maim, wound, poison or injure
an animal or bird that is the property of any person.

(2) Every one who commits an offence under
paragraph (a) of subsection (1) is guilty of an indictable offence
and is liable to imprisonment for ten years.

(3) Every one who commits an offence under
paragraph (b) of subsection (1) is guilty of

(a) an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for two years, or

(b) an offence punishable on summary
conviction.

These provisions had their origins in statutes
of 1869 which rendered uniform the law of the various Provinces respecting
offences against the person and property rights: Offences Against the Person
Act, 1869 (Can.), c. 20,
s. 15, and Malicious Injuries to Property, 1869 (Can.), c. 22, s. 58. These, in turn,
were derived

[Page 490]

from English statutes such as the Offences
against the Person Act, 1861 (U.K.), c. 100, s. 16:

Whosoever shall maliciously send, deliver
or utter, or directly or indirectly cause to be received, knowing the content
thereof, any letter or writing threatening to kill or murder any person, shall
be guilty of felony, and being convicted thereof shall be liable, at the discretion
of the Court, to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding ten years.

Before the 1960-61 amendment therefore, the Criminal
Code , in s. 316 , dealt only with threats made by a letter or writing.
The 1960-61 amendment no longer refers to a writing but it prohibits the
uttering of threats by letter, telegram, telephone, cable, radio, or otherwise.
Moreover, the structure of the sentence containing the prohibition has been
altered: under the 1953-54 wording, a person commits an offence when he
“…utters …a letter or writing that he knows contains a threat…”, whereas, since
the 1960-61 amendment, “every one commits an offence who by letter… or
otherwise, knowingly utters… a threat…”. So counsel for the appellant submitted
a second argument: it is the threat itself which is now prohibited whatever
means are adopted to express it whereas, before 1960-61, the statute merely
prohibited the uttering of a letter or writing which was known to contain a
threat.

Finally, appellant’s counsel pleaded that a
purely oral threat made face to face can be serious enough to warrant
prohibition. And, he argued, it is apparently not an offence under any other
provision of the Criminal Code . In this regard, appellant’s counsel
urged that mere words cannot, under s. 244 , amount to an assault, a
proposition which is generally accepted though it may sometimes be disputed:
Glanville Williams, “Assault and Words”, [1957] Crim. L.R. 219. He
urged further that s. 745 , under which the person making the threat could
be forced to enter into a recognizance to keep the peace, is a
section which does not create an offence.

[Page 491]

Nevertheless, a simple analysis of the wording
of s. 331  is far from being wholly supportive of appellant’s theory.

One can indeed ask why Parliament would take the
trouble to enumerate, even in a manner which is not exhaustive, various means
of expressing or conveying threats if its purpose was to prohibit threats by
whatever means they are uttered: the words “by letter, telegram, telephone,
cable, radio, or otherwise” would then serve no purpose in s. 331  other
than to enlighten the reader by a list of examples which not only would not be
limiting but would logically not even refer to essential elements of the
offence.

It appears rather, upon reading the 1960-61
amendment, that Parliament intended to include in its prohibition an increased
number of means whereby threats can be expressed or conveyed, having regard to
the advances of technology, which does not necessarily mean that it intended to
make a new type of offence the main object of which would be the threat itself,
however expressed.

I am reinforced in this view by the fact that
the conduct with which respondent is charged did not constitute a statutory
offence prior to 1960-61. It may be noted also that such conduct does not
appear to have constituted an offence at common law either: Brownridge J.A. in
the Court of Appeal quoted the following passage from the U.S. Corpus Juris
Secundum, vol. 86, p.787:

“At common law a mere threat was not a
criminal offence, at least when made in words not written, and without intent
thereby to influence the acts of the person threatened, although it might be
sufficient to invoke security to keep the peace”.

The question has been asked why purely oral
threats should not be prohibited. Some have reasoned that a person who goes to
the trouble of writing a threatening letter, for example, has already proceeded
from words to deeds and

[Page 492]

thereby manifested his resolve. Also, the use of
certain means may conceal the identity of the person making the threat or
prevent the prospective victim from judging what steps he can take to ensure
his safety. Lastly, it is possible that resort to any means other than the one
which human beings most usually employ to communicate with each other is likely
to amplify the threat, something which Parliament would seek to prevent.

Be that as it may, the offence contemplated in
s. 331  is remarkable in many respects. For the offender to be guilty of
it, it does not matter whether or not he intended to carry out his threat (R.
v. Syme[4]; R.
v. Johnson[5]), or
that he acted for any specific purpose. His motives are not relevant (R. v.
Solanke[6]).
Whether the threat raised the possibility of imminent or remote danger is
equally of no consequence. Nor is the effect of the threat on the prospective
victim: it is not even necessary that the person threatened be ever aware of
the fact that he was threatened.

The offence contemplated in s. 331  differs
in those respects from most other offences involving threats as the particular
objective aimed at is an essential element of the latter; it also differs from
another offence in some respects closely related to it, namely, that of
attempting or threatening, by an act or gesture, to apply force to the person
of another, for the commission of which the offender must have a present
ability to effect his purpose or cause the other party to believe on reasonable
grounds that he has such ability: Criminal Code , s. 244 (b).

The offence prohibited by s. 331  is of
singular flexibility. One may say that it consists of the simple expression of
a thought. That the expression of a thought, albeit a sinister one, should of
itself constitute a serious crime, regardless of the form it takes, the motives
of its author, and

[Page 493]

its present or probable effects on the victim or
on any other individual, seems to me to be contrary to the general economy of
our criminal law and also likely to lead to many difficulties, for countless
are those who do not weigh their words. I think it unlikely, in the absence of
more definite language, that the statute intended this. Such an offence must
almost of necessity be delimited. To achieve this result, two main techniques,
among others, can be used, and they are not mutually exclusive. The one consists
of taking into consideration the intent of the person making the threat or his
ability to carry it out or to cause others to believe, on reasonable grounds,
that he is able to do so; this is the technique generally used by Parliament in
other cases of threats; and the other consists of taking into account the means
used in expressing the threat, independently of the intent of the person
uttering it, the ability he has to carry it out and the probable effect the
threat will produce.

As is revealed by the history of the provision,
it is this second technique that the legislator has always employed here, and
it does not appear to me to have abandoned it in the present definition of the
offence, which lists specifically, though not exhaustively, a number of means
of expressing a threat. I do not think that the non-exhaustive nature of the
listing is meant to do away with the very technique used by Parliament to
delimit the boundaries of the offence and thereby to suppress all delimitation.
A line must therefore be drawn at some point with respect to the means by which
threats can be uttered. For my part, I would at least stop at the simplest,
most direct and most frequently used mode of expression, the oral proffering of
a threat face to face, especially as it appears never to have amounted to a
criminal offence.

The Court of Appeal also noted an anomaly that
would result from a construction of s. 331 

[Page 494]

extending its prohibition to purely oral
threats. Such threats in fact often accompany an assault, Criminal Code , s.
244 . If it is true that mere words cannot constitute an assault and that some
overt act is necessary for an assault to be committed, it would follow that the
purely oral threats prohibited by s. 331 , unaccompanied by any threatening
gesture, would constitute a more serious offence than assault. In some cases,
therefore, uttering a threat might be treated more severely than carrying it
out.

Other anomalies may be mentioned. Thus anyone
who may have threatened to injure another person both in the circumstances and
with the intent mentioned in s. 381 might be charged with threats, which
is an indictable offence, or with intimidation, which is only an offence
punishable on summary conviction, and prosecuted either under s. 331  or
under s. 381, whereas anyone who actually caused injuries to another in
the circumstances and with the intent stated in s. 381, without having
first threatened his victim with this harm, could only be charged with
intimidation.

Of course, such paradoxes do not by themselves
constitute decisive arguments against appellant’s contention: they may often
occur as the result of the numerous overlappings in the Criminal Code . Yet,
they deserve to be taken account of as legal interpretation must tend to
integrate various enactments into a coherent system rather than towards their
discontinuity.

In order to conclude that s. 331  does not
cover purely oral threats made face to face, it suffices to fall into line with
the technique used by Parliament in delimiting the offence. Reference to the ejusdem
generis rule would not appear to be essential particularly if applying that
rule should restrict the prohibition in s. 331  to the use of mechanical,
electronic or physical means or instruments and exclude from its scope the use
of messengers or other intermediary means. That is another question, which we
are not called on to answer in the present case.

[Page 495]

I feel I should also point out that the partial
similarity of language in ss. 330  and 331  of the Criminal Code  does not
necessarily entail an identical interpretation in view of the specific element
of intent used by Parliament to delimit the offence defined in s. 330 .

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Martland, Judson and Pigeon JJ.
was delivered by

PIGEON J. (dissenting)—The question in
this case is whether the word “otherwise” in s. 331(1)  of the Criminal
Code  includes a threat made by word of mouth or is to be somehow restricted
so as not to include such a threat made face to face. It is clear that, at
common law, an oral threat was not an offence, although it could be the basis
of an information on which a justice of the peace might require the defendant
to enter into a recognizance to keep the peace, as is now contemplated in
s. 745 . It is also clear that, before the 1961 amendment, 331, then known
as s. 316 , referred only to a letter or writing containing a
threat. However, the description of the offence presently covers explicitly not
only the written word (letter, telegram, cable), but also the spoken
word transmitted by electromagnetic waves (telephone, radio). It also
covers threats uttered or conveyed otherwise, and the question really is
whether any restriction is to be implied in this expression of general import.

In considering this question, one must bear in mind
the basic change effected by the 1961 amendment. Previously, it was only a
written message expressing a threat that was covered, not a threat in itself. A
threat, as distinguished from a threatening act or gesture which comes under
s. 244  (b), is an idea expressed in words. Therefore, it primarily
means menacing spoken

[Page 496]

words, seeing that writings are graphic signs
conveying the meaning of words. Thus, the basic change made in 1961 is that the
section no longer covers only the written transcription of the threatening
words, but the threatening words themselves whether uttered or conveyed by a
message in writing, or by telephone or radio, or otherwise. The question then
is: “Does the word ‘otherwise’ require the interposition of any mechanical, electrical
or electronic means for delivering the threat?”

I cannot see any valid reason for reading this
enactment otherwise than literally. There is no ambiguity whatsoever, it covers
any threat of the kind that is specified, the word “otherwise” being completely
general. Some may say: “But if this is so, why are five modes of transmission
enumerated, are not those words made meaningless if “otherwise” is construed
literally?” This objection fails on several grounds. There is first the
cardinal rule that there should be no departure from the literal meaning unless
there is some ambiguity. It follows that, only when a choice has to be made
between several possible constructions, is special consideration to be given to
a meaning whereby all words have some effect rather than a meaning whereby some
words are deprived of any effect.

Also, it is at least as important to give effect
to the word “otherwise” as to the words preceding it. By putting it in the
enactment, Parliament has indicated that the enumeration is not complete. While
some draftsmen may consider it undesirable to lengthen enactments by
enumerating a number of things followed by “or otherwise”, such a method of
drafting is so common that it should not be cause for concern. Of course, there
is always the ejusdem generis rule, but the enactment already including
several methods of voice transmission, I fail to see what genus could be
understood to be specified by the enumerated words which would include all
those words, leave some scope for non-enumerated things, and yet exclude direct
transmission of the human voice through the air face to face.

[Page 497]

That this is a complete departure from common
law principles creates no difficulty in my view. The present Criminal Code  has
done away with the common law entirely as far as the definition of offences is
concerned. It is, therefore, to be looked upon purely as a statutory enactment.
By the 1961 amendment, Parliament clearly indicated the intention to change the
law. There is no presumption that the law was not intended to be changed to the
full extent indicated by the words used.

With respect to obstruction of the course of
justice, s. 127(3) makes no distinction between written or oral threats.
Similarly, with respect to extortion, s. 305 makes no distinction between
written or oral threats. Is it not perfectly logical that no distinction should
now be made concerning threats uttered for a purpose other than obstructing
justice or extorting something? There is also no distinction made as to the
mode of making threats in s. 381(1)( a) and (b) dealing
with intimidation in the context of industrial disputes. While the two other
crimes just mentioned are serious indictable offences involving a maximum
penalty of ten years and fourteen years respectively, intimidation under
s. 381 is a summary conviction offence. Now s. 331 makes a
distinction with respect to the penalty between threats to cause death or
injury to a person (subs. 1(a)) and other threats (subs. 1(b) or
(c)). In the first case, the offence is indictable and the maximum
penalty is ten years. In the other cases, there is the option of an indictment
under which the maximum penalty is two years or a summary conviction under
which the maximum penalty is a fine of $500 or 6 months, or both (s. 722(1)).

From the above, it is apparent that whichever
way s. 331 is construed, there is some overlap-

[Page 498]

ping with s. 127(3), s. 305 or
s. 381(1) in many cases. It is now settled by our recent judgment in Lafrance
v. The Queen[7] that
the Code is not to be construed so as to avoid any duplication or overlapping
in the definition of offences. Therefore, it seems to me that the fact that
oral threats are already covered in certain cases under other sections is
no reason for putting a restrictive construction on the wording of a
section written in general terms. It is to be noted that the duplication
found to exist in the Lafrance case arose out of a major departure from
common law principles. Larceny involved the intention of misappropriating
definitively someone else’s property. However, the definition of “theft” in our
Criminal Code  extends to a taking with intent to deprive the owner of
the thing temporarily or absolutely. For this reason, it was held
that the taking of an automobile for a joy ride was theft, although it might
also be prosecuted as a summary conviction offence under s. 295 . This does
not mean that the offender can be convicted of both offences, because a
conviction for a substantially similar offence will bar any other conviction,
as decided in Kienapple v. The Queen (Feb. 12, 1974)[8].

There are not many cases on s. 331
subsequent to the 1961 amendment. In R. v. Wallace[9], the British Columbia Court of Appeal
upheld an order quashing an indictment charging only that the accused did utter
threat to cause death or injury to a named person. Branca J.A. speaking for the
Court, said (at pp. 43, 44):

Generally speaking, a count is not
insufficient by reason of the fact that it does not specify the means by which
an alleged offence is committed but where the means by which an act is done is
an essential

[Page 499]

ingredient of the offence as defined in any
section then its absence from the indictment stands on a different basis.

…

…in my judgment whatever may be the broader
meaning of the general words “or otherwise” as used in s. 316(1) if the ejusdem
generis rule does not apply is immaterial as in context they do in fact
follow the words “letter, telegram, telephone, cable, radio” which enumeration
of means of communication are all specimens of a genus or category of
communication that is not exhaustive and therefore “or otherwise” as used in
the context must be restricted to some means of communication not specifically
spelled out in the section, but within the genus or category created.

With respect, I cannot agree that “means of
communication” do not include voice communication. In Saumur v. The City of
Quebec[10], the
question was the validity of a city by‑law forbidding distribution of
“any book, pamphlet, booklet, circular, tract”. Rand J. said (at p. 332):

That public ways, in some circumstances the
only practical means available for any appeal to the community generally, have
from the most ancient times been the avenues for such communications, is
demonstrated by the Bible itself: in the 6th verse of ch. xi of Jeremiah
these words appear: “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in
the streets of Jerusalem”; (My emphasis.)

Branca J. also objected to the literal
construction (at p. 44):

If such were the case then the situation
that appalled the learned trial Judge in the Court below would in reality
result, that is that one who uttered a threat to another with the present
ability to effect his purpose could be charged under s. 230 and would be
liable to a comparatively lesser period of imprisonment as a maximum punishment
than where he had uttered a threat without the present ability to effect his
purpose, in which event he could be imprisoned for up to 10 years.

[Page 500]

It must first be pointed out that what was then
known as s. 230, and now is s. 244 , does not have reference to oral
threats. It reads:

244. A person commits an assault when,
without the consent of another person or with consent, where it is obtained by
fraud,

(a) he applies force intentionally
to the person of the other, directly or indirectly, or

(b) he attempts or threatens, by an
act or gesture, to apply force to the person of the other, if he has or causes
the other to believe upon reasonable grounds that he has present ability to
effect his purpose.

Dealing with that provision, Tysoe J.A. with
whom Branca J.A. concurred, said in R. v. Byrne[11], at p. 183, “no mere words can amount
to an assault”. However that may be, the 1961 amendment to s. 331 cannot
be limited in its scope by reason of such an overlapping. This follows from the
principle established in the Lafranee case. Furthermore, it should be
borne in mind that mens rea is always required for a crime to be
committed/Therefore, only those threats that are intended to be taken seriously
are to be covered by s. 331. In R. v. Wilkins[12], a case that was referred to throughout in
Lafrance, the Ontario Court of Appeal held that when an accused had
taken a policeman’s motor-cycle intending to drive it a short distance as a
prank, he was guilty neither of theft nor of joy-riding. It was said (at
p. 195) “His intention was merely to play a joke on Nichol and the judge
so found. The intention to perpetrate this joke, stupid though it was, is
incompatible with the evil intent which is inherent in the crime of theft.”

Applying the same principle to oral threats, it
would have to be said that if they are not meant to be taken seriously, there
could clearly be no offence against s. 331. Therefore, there is no need to
put a restrictive construction in order to avoid the possibility of prosecution
for uttering

[Page 501]

idle threats. In my view, Keith J. was correct
when, in R. v. DiLorenzo[13], he
declined to follow the opinion expressed in the Wallace case by the
British Columbia Court of Appeal. He said (at pp. 32, 33):

To my mind the words “or otherwise” ought
to be interpreted as meaning “or in any other way”. The ejusdem generis rule,
as defined by the British Columbia Court of Appeal, acknowledges that while
normally, where there has been an enumeration of specific things susceptible of
being construed as specimens of a single genus or category—but not exhaustive
thereof—their meaning should be restricted to things of that class or category,
there is nevertheless an exception where the context in which the general words
are used reasonably and clearly demand a broader significance or
interpretation. In my view the words “or otherwise” contained in s. 331(1) 
(a) demand that they be given such broader significance or
interpretation. Were one to hold otherwise it would mean that the voice of a
threatener communicated through the wires of a telephone or, without wires, by
radio would support a charge under this section while vocal threats within
human hearing range would not. It seems to me that to state it as simply as
that almost demonstrates the reasons why I decline to follow the interpretation
of the section enunciated in R. v. Wallace. It is my view that the
language of the indictment in the instant case does comply with the
requirements of s. 331(1) (a) and it is not liable to be quashed at
this time.

In R. v. Vallilee[14], at p. 414, Martin J.A. speaking for
the Ontario Court of Appeal, said with respect to s. 338(1) (obtaining
property by fraud):

In my view, the meaning of the
section must be gathered from the ordinary meaning of the words used. The
interpretation of the section ought not to be encumbered by concepts which
were in the outgrowth of excessively technical doctrines relating to the
offence of larceny which no longer have any application under our Criminal
Code .

[Page 502]

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal and restore the conviction.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Robbery and possession of
stolen automobile—Circumstantial evidence—Charge to jury—Instructions as to law
applicable in determining whether certain articles in possession of both
accused—Whether misdirection in application of s. 3(4) of Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.

The respondents L and M were each convicted,
after a jury trial, on two counts, one of robbery and one of possession of a
stolen automobile. The trial judge considered that the presence of certain
articles in a car driven by L, in which M was a passenger, was of considerable
importance. The articles included a briar pipe, a tie-down, a hand gun’s price
tag, which was an important evidentiary link to the robbery, and a note alleged
to relate to the plans for escape after the robbery. The pipe and the tie-down
had been removed from a stolen car alleged to have been the getaway car
following the robbery. The trial judge undertook to instruct the jury as to law
applicable in determining whether these items could be said to be in the
possession of both L and M and in so doing he directed the attention of the
jury to the provisions of s. 3(4)  of the Criminal Code .

The Court of Appeal, on considering the
respondents’ appeals from conviction, directed a new trial. Two of the members
of the Court agreed with the submission of counsel for the accused that
s. 3(4)  is applicable only where it is necessary to interpret the word
“possession” in a provision of the Criminal Code  and they held that
there had been an erroneous

[Page 295]

application of that provision prejudicial to
the accused.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and the verdict at trial restored.

The majority of the Court of Appeal erred in
their interpretation of s. 3(4) of the Code. Section 3(4)  does not purport
to define the word “possession”. It provides, generally, that for the
“purposes” of the Act possession may be established in certain ways. The words
“for the purposes of this Act” are broad enough to encompass all proceedings
brought under the Code.

The trial judge was not in error in stressing
the requirements of s. 3(4)  for establishing possession of the four
articles to which he referred. Here, as in Reference re R. v. Coffin, [1956]
S.C.R. 191, a rule relating to possession of certain articles was used to link
the accused to pieces of evidence in respect of a crime in which their
possession was not, otherwise, a material element. The operation of
s. 3(4)  was an important element in the appellant’s attempt to connect the
accused to the evidence as to the stolen car and to the robbery and it deserved
full attention in the charge to the jury.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
 Columbia[1],
allowing the appeals of the accused from their convictions, after a jury trial,
for robbery and possession of a stolen automobile. Appeal allowed.

G.L. Murray, Q.C., for the appellant.

S.B. Simons, for the respondents.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—Each of the respondents was
convicted, after a jury trial, on two counts, one of robbery and one of
possession of a stolen automobile. They appealed to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, which ordered a new
trial. From that judgment the Crown appeals to this Court, by leave, on a
stated question of law.

[Page 296]

A car owned by James A. Brown was stolen from
him on August 26, 1971. In the car at that time were various objects, including
a briar pipe and a rubber “tie-down”. Brown’s car, a Chevrolet Impala, was
blue-green in colour with a white top. It was recovered on August 27, 1971, in the vicinity of Alta Lake,
British Columbia, and when it was recovered the briar pipe and the “tie-down”, along
with other articles, were missing.

The Bank of Nova Scotia at Alta Lake was robbed about 12:45 p.m. on August 27 and, in connection with
the robbery, an automobile was used as an escape vehicle which was described by
witnesses as having a blue body with a white top. A gun was used in the robbery
by one man who entered the bank wearing a mask, sunglasses and an artificial
beard. The gun was described by the teller as having “an eight or ten inch
barrel on it” and as being “very dark, black, and quite clean looking”.

The man who entered the bank was identified by
the teller as the respondent Lovis, but under cross-examination she admitted
that this was a “well educated guess”.

The driver of the “get-away” car, who did not
enter the bank, was described by the witness Zebrowsky, who was in the bank at
the time of the robbery, as wearing “long yellow gloves”.

At or about the time the bank was robbed, the
witnesses Goddard and Straight saw an older model, light-coloured Chevrolet
parked on a side road not far from Whistler ski lift and both witnesses
identified the respondent Moncini as sitting in that car.

On August 11, 1971, a hand gun was missed from a
store owned by Mrs. Janowsky at Gibson, British Columbia. Attached to the gun was
a price tag and Mrs. Janowsky was able to

[Page 297]

identify both the gun and the price tag when
they were found in the circumstances described later.

The witness McConkey, the ski school director at
Whistler, drove up behind the ski shop at about noon on August 27 and noticed a
blue-coloured car parked there with two men in it and a third man standing
beside it. When he came out of the shop about three-quarters of an hour later
the car was gone. McConkey later saw the car at the police station in Squamish.
McConkey identified Lovis and McConnell as two of the men he saw at the ski
lift, at a line-up after the respondents had been apprehended. Later in court
when the two accused had been seated among the spectators, McConkey picked out
Lovis and one McLaren (who was not involved) and Moncini as a possibility.

At about 1:40 p.m. on August 27, an R.C.M.P.
constable was at a road block on the highway leading from Alta Lake to West Vancouver and stopped a light-blue
Chevrolet. There were three occupants of the car—Lovis was driving, Moncini was
in the back seat and one McConnell Was seated beside Lovis in the front seat.
In the car were three sleeping bags, together with a number of articles similar
to those stolen from Brown. Brown positively identified a briar pipe on the
back window as having come from his car. He also positively identified a rubber
“tie-down” which was found on the floor of the back seat as having come from
his stolen car. The R.C.M.P. constable, Lawton, later, at 3:25 p.m., saw the car again at which time he seized a
pair of leather pants from the car, together with a note in one of the pockets,
and he also seized a price tag which he found on the floor in the rear of the
car.

During the course of his conversation with the
occupants of the car, Lawton
saw the briar pipe and asked who was the pipe smoker and Moncini said that he
was. Moncini also admitted

[Page 298]

ownership of the leather pants, in the pocket of
which was found a note reading:

Pick me up in the cool car at three. Bring
two sleeping bags.

On October 14, 1971, Constable Felkar of the
R.C.M.P., as a result of a skin-diving expedition in Daisy Lake (just off the
highway between Alta Lake and West Vancouver), found a black bag which
contained a false beard, sunglasses, three hand guns and a quantity of money,
as well as a pair of tan gloves. One of the guns was identified by
Mrs. Janowsky as being the gun to which the price tag found in the car
occupied by the respondents, which she also identified, had been affixed.

Neither of the respondents gave evidence at the
trial and both were convicted on both counts contained in the indictment.

The trial judge properly considered that the
presence, in the car, driven by Lovis, in which Moncini was a passenger, of the
briar pipe and the rubber tie, both of which had been removed from Brown’s car,
of the price tag, and the note in the pocket of the leather pants which Moncini
said were his, was of considerable significance. He undertook to instruct the
jury as to law applicable in determining whether those articles could be said
to be in the possession of both Lovis and Moncini. He directed the attention of
the jury to the provisions of s. 3, subs. 4, of the Criminal Code , which
provides as follows:

For the purposes of this Act,

(a) a person has anything in
possession when he has it in his personal possession or knowingly

(i) has it in the actual possession or
custody of another person, or

(ii) has it in any place, whether or not
that place belongs to or is occupied by him, for the use or benefit of himself
or of another person; and

(b) where one of two or more persons, with
the knowledge and consent of the rest, has anything in his custody or
possession, it shall be deemed to be

[Page 299]

in the custody and possession of each and
all of them.

The Court of Appeal, on considering the
respondents’ appeals from conviction, directed a new trial. Two of the members
of the Court agreed with the submission of counsel for the accused that
s. 3(4)  is applicable only where it is necessary to interpret the word
“possession” in a provision of the Criminal Code  and they held that
there had been an erroneous application of that provision prejudicial to the
accused.

The appellant obtained leave to appeal to this
Court on the following question of law:

Did the Court of Appeal for the Province of British Columbia err in holding that the learned trial judge misdirected the jury on
both counts of the indictment with respect to the application of Section 3,
Sub-section 4, of The Criminal Code ?

With respect, I do not agree with the conclusion
reached by the majority of the Court of Appeal as to the scope of the
application of s. 3(4) . It is said, in their reasons, that “For the
purposes of this Act” is not synonymous with “In all proceedings under this
Act”. My opinion is that the subsection is applicable to all proceedings
under the Act.

Section 3(4)  is not a part of the definition
section of the Criminal Code . Definitions are set out in s. 2 
which appears under the heading “INTERPRETATION”. Section 2  commences with the
words “In this Act” and lists a series of words, followed, in each case, by the
verb “includes” or the verb “means”, in turn followed by a definition of the
specific word. Section 3(4)  comes under the heading “GENERAL”. It does not
purport to define the word “possession”. It provides that “For the purposes of
this Act” certain circumstances will constitute possession of “anything” in a
person.

The effect of s. 2 is that when a defined
word is used in the Code it shall have the meaning, or

[Page 300]

shall include the meaning, ascribed to it in
that section. But s. 3(4) is not dealing only with the meaning of the word
“possession” where it appears in the Code. It provides, generally, that for the
“purposes” of the Act possession may be established in certain ways.

The words “For the purposes of this Act” are
broad enough to encompass all proceedings brought under the Code, and, in my
opinion, they should receive that interpretation.

The effect of the construction placed by the
majority of the Court of Appeal upon s. 3(4) would be that, if the
respondents had been charged with having possession of the pipe, the tie-down
and the price tag knowing them to be stolen, possession could be proved in the
manner described in the subsection, but, if possession of those articles is
sought to be established as a circumstantial link in the chain of evidence in
proof of another crime, it cannot be established in that manner. This result,
in my opinion, would not be in accord with the intention of the subsection.

I mention, in passing, that the majority of the
Court of Appeal were of the view that s. 3(4) could properly be applied in
respect of the second charge against the respondents, i.e., possession
of Brown’s automobile, knowing it to be stolen, although the articles, the
possession of which was being discussed by the trial judge, were those
previously mentioned.

In the result, I am of the opinion that the
majority of the Court of Appeal erred in their interpretation of s. 3(4) 
of the Criminal Code .

This disposes of the legal issue in respect of
which the appellant was given leave to appeal. Counsel for the respondents
contends that, apart from this matter, the respondents were entitled to succeed
on their appeal to the Court of Appeal upon other grounds and he refers to the
statement made in the majority reasons that:

[Page 301]

Even if, contrary to my opinion,
s. 3(4)  could in an appropriate case be applicable to a count in which
possession was not an essential element, I think, with respect, that this was
not an appropriate case and that the charge was open to objection.

This statement is amplified in the next
following paragraph, as follows:

Whether or not the appellants had custody
or possession of the articles had no legal significance. The appellants were
not charged with illegal possession of the articles. The origin of the
articles, the history of their journeyings, where they were and who was present
when they were seen by the police at a roadblock, these were all circumstances
from which the jury could draw inferences in coming to a conclusion whether or
not the charge of robbery by the appellants had been proved. In this process, a
conclusion that the articles were in the custody and possession of the
appellants or one of them would not be a landmark, but the emphasis placed on
the imposed conclusion to be drawn from the proof of certain facts must have
led the jury to think that such a conclusion would establish nothing less than
an essential ingredient of Count 1 and carry them a long way towards a verdict
of guilty; it must have led them to think that there would be something
decisive of the case in the statutory conclusion of custody or possession,
which there was not. If the jury did not get that, or some similar, impression,
this part of the charge must have caused confusion in their minds by making
them wonder—as I have done—what the significance of all the talk of s.s. (4) of
s. 3 was.

With respect, after considering the charge, I do
not come to this conclusion. In the charge to the jury the position of the
appellant was outlined as follows:

In his address to you yesterday
Mr. Murray made statements as follows, or to the following effect: When he
opened before you and in addressing you yesterday he said that in the view of
the prosecution there was a successful plot to rob the bank; secondly, that the
participants in the plot were McConnell, Lovis and Moncini; thirdly, that these
three came into

[Page 302]

possession of a stolen car, namely the car
which Mr. Brown told us had been taken from him; fourthly, that
Mr. Brown’s car was the getaway car and that there was a switch of cars;
fifthly, that Mr. Lovis was the gunman and he was the one who robbed
Brenda McLeod and that Mr. Moncini was in the other car and indicated that
by reason of the robbery and by reason of the road block and by reason of
Highway 99 being the only highway from Squamish to Alta Lake, that certain
articles and money had been disposed of and left somewhere and were not in the
car when Constable Lawton stopped the car in the road block at 1:40 o’clock on
the afternoon of the robbery.

With respect to the pipe and the tie the
appellant sought to establish possession in both respondents as an important
evidentiary link connecting them with the stolen Brown car
(the subject-matter of Count 2) which was alleged to be the get-away car
after the robbery (Count 1). With respect to these items, the jury was
told:

So these two items, you see, you may infer
or you may be driven to the conclusion were from Mr. Brown’s car and are
in this other car, sometimes called the McConnell car, because McConnell
produced the registration and insurance indicating that he was the registered
owner of that car.

In that car there were three people and the
question is, who was in possession. That is not the proper way to state it. Has
the Crown proved that someone was in possession and, if so, who? You must
consider that question with regards to the definition of possession.

Under this definition the Crown is saying
and has said where one of three persons with the knowledge and consent of the
other two has anything in his possession, in his custody or possession, it
shall be deemed to be in the custody and possession of each and all of them.

Now, in the ordinary course to establish
that it must be found that one of the three persons was in possession and,
secondly, that that one person was in possession with the knowledge and consent
of the other two or one of the other two.

[Page 303]

The price tag was an important evidentiary link
in respect of the gun, which was thrown into the lake, and, thus, to the
robbery, the subject of Count 1. The note, found in the pocket of the pants,
was alleged by the appellant to relate to the plans for escape after the
robbery.

While it is true that the respondents were not
charged with illegal possession of those items, the significance of that
possession in relation to the offences with which they were charged can be
illustrated by a reference to the decision of this Court in Reference re R.
v. Coffin[2]. In
that matter, which involved a charge of murder, evidence was given relating to
the possession by the accused of articles which had been in the possession of
members of a hunting party, which included the victim, prior to his death. With
respect to this evidence it was contended, on behalf of the accused, that the
trial judge erred in instructing the jury on the doctrine of recent possession
and that the jury had been misdirected as to the burden resting on the accused
to explain his possession. It was also contended that the jury should have been
directed that they were not entitled to convict the accused of murder because
he was guilty of the theft of the various articles.

These objections were rejected, and the
significance of the possession of the stolen articles was dealt with by
Taschereau J. (as he then was), with whom Kerwin C.J. concurred, at
p. 204:

I also regard the second point as without
foundation. In my view, the judge was not required to tell the jury what he is
said to have neglected to tell them. The fact that Coffin had in his possession
recently stolen effects not only gave rise to the presumption, in the absence
of any explanation, that he had stolen them, but the jury was entitled to
conclude that it was one link in a chain of circumstances indicating that he
had committed the murder.

[Page 304]

Kellock J., with whom Rand J. and Fauteux J. (as
he then was) concurred, dealt with this matter as follows, at p. 225:

In my opinion, therefore, there was
abundant evidence from which the jury could conclude that the possessor of the
money and the other items was the robber and the murderer as well. I think they
have done so.

In Regina v. Exall, (1866) 4 F.
& F. 922, Pollock C.B., said at 924:

The principle is this, that if a person is
found in possession of property recently stolen, and of which he can give no
reasonable account, a jury are justified in coming to the conclusion that
he committed the robbery.

And so it is of any crime to which the
robbery was incident, or with which it was connected, as burglary, arson, or
murder. For, if the possession be evidence that the person committed the
robbery, and the person who committed the robbery committed the other crime,
then it is evidence that the person in whose possession the property is found
committed that other crime.

The law is, that if recently after the commission
of the crime, a person is found in possession of the stolen goods, that person
is called upon to account for the possession, that is, to give an
explanation of it, which is not unreasonable or improbable.

In a note to the above case at p. 850
of vol. 176 of the English Reports, the editor refers to the case of R. v.
Muller at p. 385 of the same volume, where the murder in question had
occurred in a railway carriage on a Saturday evening and on the following
Monday the prisoner was found in possession of the watch of the murdered man
which he said he had bought off a pedlar at the London docks. The question
arose as to whether, supposing the jury were not satisfied of the accused’s
guilt upon the evidence apart from the recent possession of the hat and watch,
such possession would be sufficient proof of the prisoner’s guilt of the
murder. The note reads:

That it would have been sufficient, if no
explanation at all had been offered, would be conceded. For the absence of
explanation would have amounted to an admission.

[Page 305]

In the light of these statements as to what may
be the effect of recent possession of stolen articles, not only in relation to
a theft of the articles themselves, but also in relation to the evidence as to
the commission of another crime, I do not think that it is a valid ground for
upsetting the jury verdict because the trial judge may have stressed the
requirements of s. 3(4)  for establishing possession of the four articles
to which he referred. Here, as in the Coffin reference, a rule relating
to possession of certain articles is used to link the accused to pieces of
evidence in respect of a crime in which their possession is not, otherwise, a
material element. The operation of s. 3(4)  was an important element in the
appellant’s attempt to connect the accused to the evidence as to the stolen car
and to the robbery and it deserved full attention in the charge to the jury. It
is not contended that the explanation of the meaning and effect of s. 3(4) 
was in error, and the trial judge fairly presented to the jury the submissions
of counsel for the respondents as to why the application of the
subsection would not involve a finding of possession in the respondents.

In the result, I would allow the appeal, set
aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal, and restore the verdict at trial.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Notice of appeal signed by
“agent” for Attorney General—Notice of appeal valid—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, s. 605.

Lemay v. The King, [1952] 1 S.C.R. 232, applied.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
 Columbia dismissing an appeal from the acquittal of the respondents on a
charge of conspiracy in violation of the Immigration Act. Appeal
allowed.

C.R. Lander and G. Pinos, for the
appellants.

T. Braidwood, Q.C., and J.W. Hogan, for
the respondents.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The question at issue here is
whether the Crown’s notice of appeal to the British Columbia Court of Appeal
from the acquittal of the respondents on a charge of conspiracy in violation of
the Immigration Act complied with s.605  of the Criminal Code . Upon
a preliminary objection taken before the British Columbia Court of Appeal, that
Court held that the notice of appeal was a nullity because of non-compliance
with s.605 , and that this was a matter of substance which obliged the Court to
dismiss the appeal.

Section 605 , so far as material here, reads as
follows:

(1) The Attorney General or counsel
instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal

[Page 504]

(a) against a judgment or verdict of
acquittal of a trial court in proceedings by indictment on any ground of appeal
that involves a question of law alone…

The notice of appeal in this case was in these
words in its material parts:

Take notice that the Attorney General of
Canada appeals to this Court …from the acquittal of the above-named respondents
upon the following grounds involving a question of law only…

…

Dated at Vancouver,
 British Columbia, this 28th
day of May, A.D. 1973

(sgd)
“Cory Stolte”

Agent
for the Attorney General of Canada.

This notice of appeal is filed by C.
Stolte, Esq., Agent for the Attorney General of Canada….

The gravamen of the complaint against the
validity of the notice of appeal was that s. 605  limited the right to
appeal, and hence the right to file the notice required under s. 607, to
the Attorney General or to counsel instructed by him for that purpose, and that
a notice signed by a person as “agent” of the Attorney General would not do. It
was conceded, as indeed it had to be by reason of s. 2  of the Criminal
Code , that the Deputy Attorney General of Canada could have brought the appeal and signed the notice of appeal. It
was contended, however, that an agent, even though no doubt is cast on the fact
of the agency, cannot bring the appeal in the name of the Attorney General when
the notice is signed by such agent in that character. Support for this contention
was said to reside in s. 748  (b) of the Criminal Code  which,
with respect to appeals in summary conviction matters, authorizes an appeal by,
inter alia, “the Attorney-General or his agent”, thus pointing up a
contrast with s. 605 .

The position taken by the respondents, in
support of the ruling of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, is that although
the Attorney General may himself appeal and bring the notice of appeal in his
name and sign it, and although this is also true of his deputy, and is also true
of

[Page 505]

counsel instructed by him, it cannot be done by
a person who signs as agent, nor can such a person properly sign a notice of
appeal taken in the Attorney General’s name. I am unable to accept this view of
s. 605  for the reasons that follow.

In Lemay v. The King[1],a case that was not brought to the notice
of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, this Court held (and it was unanimous
on this point) that the then s. 1013(4) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1927, c.36, as enacted by 1930 (Can.), c. 11, s. 28, giving the Attorney
General (and he alone is mentioned) a right of appeal on questions of law alone
to the provincial Court of Appeal against an acquittal on a charge of an
indictable offence, was not violated where the notice of appeal was signed by a
counsel as agent of the Attorney General. This Court (and it was the full
Court) rejected the contention that the Attorney General should have signed the
notice of appeal personally. In my opinion, the extension of the Crown’s right
to appeal to counsel instructed by the Attorney General, while also keeping the
right in the Attorney General as before, has not made the Lemay case
inapplicable. Indeed, I am unable to appreciate any but a semantic difference
between a counsel who is an agent of the Attorney general and a counsel
instructed by the Attorney General; the latter can surely be no more than an
agent, albeit perhaps a special one for the occasion.

Counsel for the respondents contended also that
there was no proof that the person signing as agent was in fact counsel for the
Attorney General or that he had been instructed by the Attorney General for the
purpose of the appeal. I do not think that this objection can be pressed here
when the issue raised by preliminary objection in the Court of Appeal was that
an agent was not empowered by s. 605  to sign the notice of appeal.
Moreover, I find it unnecessary in

[Page 506]

this case to consider either R.V. Green[2], where the agency alleged was stated as
being for the Minister of Justice for Canada instead of for the Attorney
General of Canada, or Martin v. The Queen[3],
where the notice of appeal was by “Mr. MacMillan for S. Sigsworth
representing the Attorney General of Canada”.

I would, accordingly, allow the appeal, set
aside the order of dismissal and remit the case to the British Columbia Court
of Apeal for determination on the merits.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Attempted murder—Charge to
jury—“must be unanimous in any verdict you bring back”—“All twelve of you must
agree to convict or acquit…”

The appellant was found guilty of two charges
of attempted murder and a charge of possession of a weapon for a purpose
dangerous to the public peace. The Court of Appeal, without giving reasons,
unanimously dismissed the appellant’s appeal. Leave was given by the Supreme
Court to appeal on a specific question of law as to whether the trial judge had
misdirected the jury.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: A trial judge is not, in
law, obligated to tell the jury that they may disagree; also, a direction that
whatever verdict is returned must be unanimous is not improper.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ. dissenting: This appeal raises a problem
often discussed as to the duty of the judge to charge a trial jury that
although their verdict may be unanimous they have the right to report a
disagreement. The words used in this case do not give sufficient indication to
the jury of their right to disagree.

conviction on March 29, 1973, on two charges of attempted murder and a charge
of possession of an unlawful weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public
peace. No written reasons for judgment were delivered by the Court of Appeal
for Ontario. This appeal is
taken by leave of this Court granted on February 25, 1974 upon the following
question of law:

Did the Court of Appeal of Ontario err in law in failing to hold that
the trial Judge erred in law in instructing the jury as follows:

You must be unanimous as to any verdict
that you bring back or as to an acquittal. All twelve of you must agree to
convict or acquit, and this applies to each accused and to all charges?

The portion of the learned trial judge’s charge
which included the quotation repeated in the Order granting leave, I wish to
cite in full:

Now, there are a number of verdicts which
you can return. You can return on the first count a verdict of guilty against
Harrison and Gaatch, a verdict of guilty against one or other of them, or a
verdict of not guilty.

If you return a verdict of guilty against
either of them, then you do not need to consider any of the included charges.
If, however, you come to the conclusion that either one of them is not guilty
of that charge, you must then consider the included offences of an assault
occasioning bodily harm, unlawfully causing bodily harm, pointing a firearm.

[Page 97]

The same included offences apply in the
third count against Harrison alone, that is, the charge of attempted murder of
Constable Kealy. If you find him not guilty, then you must consider each of
these three included offences.

With regard to the possession of an
unlawful weapon, I have dealt with that; I think I need not go back to it. With
regard to the fourth one, Mr. Gaatch in effect says that, “I am guilty of
that offence.” You will, however, have to come to a verdict with respect to that,
since it is before you.

You must be unanimous as to any verdict
that you bring back or as to an acquittal. All twelve of you must agree to
convict or acquit, and this applies to each accused and to all charges. What
happens after you bring in a verdict is in my realm alone, and should not be
considered when you are attempting to reach a verdict.

When you got out, I suggest you elect a
foreman who will be your chairman to preside over your sessions, take votes, do
whatever is necessary to have an orderly meeting. I will be here or nearby all
the time that you are out. If you need any additional information or help, I
will do my best to give it to you.

You will be accompanied by a Sheriff’s
officer. Tell him if you have some question, and court will be reconvened as
quickly as possible, and it will be dealt with. After you leave, it is my
practice to ask counsel if they have any objections or comments to make on my
charge. If they have, and I consider them to be proper ones, I will ask you to
come back so that I can meet any objections they raise.

It is getting fairly close to lunch time.
You are now Obliged to remain together until such time as you have given a
verdict. If you will let the Sheriff’s officer know you want lunch, it will be
brought up to you in your jury room. You may not depart from that room without
my leave and until a verdict has been reached or whatever other disposition has
to be made of the matter.

It will be seen that this appeal raises a
problem often discussed as to the duty of the judge to charge a trial jury that
although their verdict may be unanimous they have the right to report a
disagreement and therefore a failure to arrive

[Page 98]

at a verdict. Counsel for the appellant, of
course, relied on the statement by Fauteux J. (as he then was), in Latour v.
The King[1].

This is all that was said on the subject.
If one of the jurors could have reasonably understood from this direction—and
it may be open to such construction—that there was an obligation to agree upon
a verdict, the direction would be bad in law. For it is not only the right but
the duty of a juror to disagree if, after full and sincere consideration of the
facts of the case, in the light of the directions received on the law, he is
unable conscientiously to accept, after honest discussion with his colleagues,
the views of the latter. To render a verdict, the jurors must be unanimous but
this does not mean that they are obliged to agree, but that only a unanimity of
views shall constitute a verdict bringing the case to an end. The obligation is
not to agree but to co-operate honestly in the study of the facts of a case for
its proper determination according to law.

In the presence of the misdirections above
discussed, their gravity and their combined effect, I am unable to say that the
respondent has affirmatively shown that there was, in the result, no
substantial wrong and that justice was done according to law. And, as above
indicated, the judgment rendered by the Court is that the appeal is allowed,
the verdict of murder is quashed and a new trial is ordered.

The statement has been described in Hebert v.
The Queen[2], to
which reference is to be made hereafter, and elsewhere as a dictum but I am
unable to so regard the statement in view of Fauteux J.’s conclusion:

In the presence of the misdirections above
discussed, their gravity and their binding effect. . .”

I am of the opinion on the clear language of
Fauteux J.’s statement that it was one of several rationes decidendi and
I believe that the test set out by Fauteux J.:

If one of the jurors could reasonably have
understood from this direction—and it may be, open to such construction, that
there was an obligation to agree upon a verdict, the direction would be bad in
law.

[Page 99]

is the test which should be applied to determine
the appropriateness of a trial judge’s charge upon this issue. I am aware that
in the Hebert case that not only was Fauteux J.’s statement regarded as
a dictum but five of the nine judges upheld the charge in that particular case,
specifically stating that there was no obligation upon a trial judge to explain
to the jury that they could disagree. In Latour v. The King, the
only statement made by the trial judge in his charge was this:

This is an important case and you must
agree upon a verdict. This means that you must be unanimous.

On the other hand in the Hebert case the
trial judge said:

[TRANSLATION] Gentlemen: You must remind
yourself that the verdict that you will bring back whatever it be must be a
unanimous verdict. That is to say that all twelve of you must be of the same
opinion and bring back the same verdict.

Kerwin C.J. said that at p. 122:

The terse manner in which the trial judge
in that case had referred to the matter is to be noted. In the present instance
the trial judge made it quite clear to the jury what were their duties. He
stated, more than once, that they must be unanimous and again, more than once,
explained the various conclusions at which they could unanimously arrive. These
conclusions are the verdicts enumerated above. To give effect to the
appellant’s argument would mean that a trial judge should invite a jury to
disagree. This is a far different matter from an intimation, veiled or
otherwise, that, notwithstanding the views of one or more jurors, it was
necessary that one of certain defined conclusions be arrived at, or verdicts
returned. After going over the trial judge’s charge in its entirety, I am
satisfied that there is no basis for the argument on the first point.

Similar statements were made by Rand J. and
Estey J. Fauteux J., however, expressed in Hebert the same view as his
brethren that the whole of the charge must be considered and having so
considered he was not of the opinion

[Page 100]

that the right to disagree had been excluded. A
similar view is taken in the Court of Appeal of British
 Columbia in Rex v. Schlosser[3], per O’Halloran J.A. at p. 191:

In days long since juries were not
permitted to disagree (cf. R. v. Neal (1949), 33 Cr. App. R.
189), but the pendulum cannot yet have swung to the opposite extreme of encouraging
them to disagree.

In the Court of Appeal for Manitoba in Regina v. Wedge[4] Matas J.A. for the Court expressed
the same view as to a charge which read:

. . . to render a verdict you must be
unanimous; that is, the verdict you bring in must be the verdict of all of you.

On the other hand the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Regina v. DeMarco[5], considered a charge reading:

The other thing is, and most important if
anything is, that all twelve jurors must agree. It has to be a unanimous jury;
that means that everybody has to be of the one opinion whether the accused is
guilty or not guilty.

Martin J.A. said that at p. 374:

We are of the view that this comes
perilously close to the type of instruction that was held by the Supreme Court
of Canada to be error in the case of Latour v. The King (1950),
98 C.C.C. 258. This is quite a different direction to instructing the jury that
they must be unanimous with respect to any verdict that they return to the
Court.

It would seem to be the consistent course of the
Courts that a judge is not required to charge a jury that they may disagree.
Perhaps O’Halloran J.A. was correct and the pendulum has not yet swung to the
opposite extreme. I can see no serious objection to such a charge, accompanied
as it usually is by the judge’s admonition that the jurors should realize the
serious consequences which accompany a disagreement and

[Page 101]

attempt to resolve their differences. It is said
that the mere mention of disagreement to the charge in a jury is to invite the
jury to disagree. I do not subscribe to that fear and I am of the opinion that
a jury properly charged will strive to arrive at an unanimous verdict in
accordance with their oath despite the fact that they know that if they have an
irreconcilable difference they may report disagreement.

However, that may be and whether trial judges
should or should not be required to tell juries that they may disagree, I am
strongly of the opinion that to tell a jury that it cannot disagree is a major
fault which causes a mistrial and as Fauteux J. pointed out in Latour:

If one of the jurors could reasonably
understand from the direction that there was an obligation to agree upon a
verdict then the juror has been told that he cannot disagree.

I turn now to the actual words of the charge. In
the earlier parts of his charge, the learned trial judge has stressed to the
jury their own individual duty to consider the evidence and come to their
conclusion but in the portion that I have cited the emphasis was taken in
unanimity with two possible exceptions. The first is in this sentence: “What
happens after you bring in a verdict is my realm alone, and should not be
considered when you are attempting to reach a verdict”. The word “attempting”
may be considered as indicating a possible failure to reach a verdict but in my
opinion it lacks sufficient clarity to ensure that, as Fauteux J. put it, a
juror would not understand that there was an obligation upon him to reach a
verdict. The second is in the last sentence quoted in the charge:

[Page 102]

You may not depart from that room without
my leave until a verdict has been reached or whatever other disposition has to
be made of the matter.

Again, a lawyer would quickly assume that the
learned trial judge was referring to a possible disagreement but jurors are not
lawyers, lawyers are not eligible to be jurors and a person who is not a lawyer
might quite fail to understand that in that sentence the learned trial judge
was referring to a possible disagreement.

In each of these cases in my view the line is a
very thin one. In some cases it has been and should have been held that the
charge gave to the jury a sufficient indication of their right to disagree. In
other cases, very similar words have been held by other Courts not to give such
sufficient indication. I am of the opinion that this case falls in the latter
category and I cannot say that no juror hearing the charge in this particular
case would understand that he was under an obligation to bring in a verdict. It
is regrettable that this result should occur. A proper charge in my opinion can
be given without any danger that the jury will seize the opportunity to
disagree in disregard of their oath. I would allow the appeal and direct a new
trial.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—This appeal is brought, by leave of
this Court, on a single question of law. The Court of Appeal for Ontario had unanimously dismissed the
appellant’s appeal from his convictions on two charges of attempted murder and
a charge of possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace,
after trial by a jury.

The question of law is as follows:

Did the Court of Appeal of Ontario err in law in failing to hold that
the trial Judge erred in law in instructing the jury as follows:

[Page 103]

“You must be unanimous as to any verdict
that you bring back or as to an acquittal. All twelve of you must agree to
convict or acquit, and this applies to each accused and to all charges”?

The Court of Appeal did not deliver reasons for
its dismissal of the appeal, but we were advised by counsel for the appellant
that the question now in issue was argued on the appeal to that Court.

The appellant relies mainly on the reasons
delivered on behalf of the Court by Fauteux J., as he then was, in Latour v.
R.[6], at
p. 30, which conclude with the following statement:

The other matter in which comments may be
added, although the point was not raised by the appellant, is related to the
following direction given to the jury:

“This is an important case and you must
agree upon a verdict. This means that you must be unanimous.”

This is all that was said on the subject.
If one of the jurors could have reasonably understood from this direction—and
it may be open to such construction—that there was an obligation to agree upon
a verdict, the direction would be bad in law. For it is not only the right but
the duty of a juror to disagree if, after full and sincere consideration of the
facts of the case, in the light of the directions received on the law, he is
unable conscientiously to accept, after honest discussion with his colleagues,
the views of the latter. To render a verdict, the jurors must be unanimous but
this does not mean that they are obliged to agree, but that only a unanimity of
views shall constitute a verdict bringing the case to an end. The obligation is
not to agree but to co-operate honestly in the study of the facts of a case for
its proper determination according to law.

This Court had to consider the application of
the statement in Latour in Hebert v. R.[7] The

[Page 104]

whole Court sat in this case, and it included
all of the judges who had been members of the Court in the Latour case,
save one.

In the Hebert case the trial judge, in
instructing the jury, had said this:

[TRANSLATION] Gentlemen: You must remind
yourself that the verdict that you will bring back whatever it be must be a
unanimous verdict. That is to say that all twelve of you must be of the same
opinion and bring back the same verdict.

Kerwin C.J., with whom Taschereau J., as he then
was, and Abbott J. agreed, at p. 122, referred to the appellant’s reliance upon
the passage from Latour, cited above, which he described as an obiter
dictum, and went on to say:

The terse manner in which the trial judge
in that case had referred to the matter is to be noted. In the present instance
the trial judge made it quite clear to the jury what were their duties. He
stated, more than once, that they must be unanimous and again, more than once,
explained the various conclusions at which they could unanimously arrive. These
conclusions are the verdicts enumerated above. To give effect to the
appellant’s argument would mean that a trial judge should invite a jury to
disagree. This is a far different matter from an intimation, veiled or
otherwise, that, notwithstanding the views of one or more jurors, it was
necessary that one of certain defined conclusions be arrived at, or verdicts
returned. After going over the trial judge’s charge in its entirety, I am
satisfied that there is no basis for the argument on the first point,

Estey J., at p. 131, said:

A disagreement is not a verdict. It exists
only because of the inability of the jury to arrive at a decision and,
therefore, a verdict. In this context the jury would understand that he was
discussing a verdict as a decision and not in any way referring to the
possibility of a disagreement or denying their right to disagree. There is no
obligation upon a judge to explain to a jury they may disagree. In fact, a
trial judge does not accept a disagreement until he is satisfied that

[Page 105]

there is no reasonable possibility of the
jury arriving at a unanimous decision.

Fauteux J., who dissented on other matters,
said, at p. 143:

[TRANSLATION] It is, however, with respect
to the judge’s charge as a whole that the matter must be weighed. So
considered, I do not think that one can, in the present case, say that the
right to disagree has been excluded.

With these reasons Locke J., who also dissented
on other matters, concurred.

None of the members of the Court upheld the
appellant’s submission on this point. None of them expressed the view that the
direction under consideration was improper if one of the jurors could
reasonably have understood that there was an obligation to agree upon a
verdict.

This judgment negatives any suggestion that a
trial judge is, in law, obligated to tell the jury that they may disagree. It
also holds that a direction that whatever verdict is returned must be unanimous
is not improper. In my opinion that is all that the trial judge did in the
present case. I will repeat the passage from his charge cited in the question
of law on which leave was granted and add to it his next following sentence:

You must be unanimous as to any verdict
that you bring back or as to an acquittal. All twelve of you must agree to
convict or acquit, and this applies to each accused and to all charges. What
happens after you bring in a verdict is in my realm alone, and should not be
considered when you are attempting to reach a verdict.

The emphasis is my own.

In my opinion the second sentence, which is the
one of which the appellant complains, cannot be read in isolation. The essence
of the direction is that a verdict to convict or to acquit must be unanimous.
The words underlined show

[Page 106]

that the jury was not being told that it had to
reach a verdict.

In my opinion, on the basis of the judgment of
this Court in Hebert, the appeal should be dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE
COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO

Criminal law-Civil rights-Motor vehicles-Due
process of law - Self -crimination - Compulsory breath test Protection against
self-crimination--Sections 223  and 2244(3)  of the Criminal Code  not
inoperative-Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44, ss. 1(a), (b), 2(d),
(e), (f)-Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.) , c. 51, ss. 223, 224A(3).

The appellant was charged under s.
223(2)  of the Criminal Code  with failing or refusing, without reasonable
excuse, to comply with a demand by a peace officer under s. 223(1)  for a breath
sample to enable an analysis to be made to determine the pro-portion of alcohol
in his blood. The Provincial Judge dismissed the charge on the ground that s.
223  and s. 224A(3) , providing
that the evidence of such re­fusal was admissible, were inoperative because of
the Canadian Bill of Rights. On appeal by the Crown by way of stated
case, the decision was reversed. An appeal from that decision was dismissed by
the Court of Appeal without recorded reasons. The ap­pellant was granted leave
to appeal to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux
C.J. and Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The meaning to be given to the
language employed in the Bill of Rights is the meaning which it bore in
Canada at the time when the Bill was enacted. It follows that the phrase
""due process of law"" as used in s. 1(a) is to be construed as mean­ing
""according to the legal processes recognized by Parliament and the Courts
in Canada."" Therefore, ss. 223 and 224A(3) of the Code, enabling a peace
officer to compel a citizen to submit to a breath test, does not offend against
the right of the individual not to be deprived of the security of his person
""without due, process of law.""

[Page 890]

Furthermore, these two sections do
not abridge the accused's right to ""protection against self-crimi­nation"".
These words, as they occur in s. 2(d) of the Bill of
Rights are to be taken as meaning pro­tection
against ""self-incriminating statements"" and not as embracing
""incriminating conditions of the body"" such as the alcoholic content
of the breath or blood.

Per Abbott,
Martland, Judson, Hall, Spence, Pigeon and Laskin JJ.: There was no violation
of s. 2(e). The appellant was heard on the charge against him and had full
opportunity to make his defence. As to s. 2(f), if it is compatible with the Canadian
Bill of Rights to require a person, on pain of liability to punishment, to
give a sample of his breath, there is no violation of s. 2(f) in making evidence
of unjustified refusal admissible on a charge of driving under s. 222,

It is not an answer to reliance by
the appellant on s. 1(a) and s. 1(b) that s. 223  does not discriminate
against any person by reason of race, national ori­gin, colour, religion or
sex. The absence of such discrimination still leaves open the question whether
s. 223  can be construed and applied without abro­gating, abridging or
infringing the guarantees of ""due process of law"" under s. 1(a) and
""the pro­tection of the law"" under s. 1(b).

The phrase ""due process of
law"" has its context in the words of s. 1(a) that precede it and, in the
present case, ""the right of the individual to ... security of the
person"". In so far as s. 223 , and especially 223(1), may be
regarded as a procedural aid to the enforcement of the substantive offence
created by s. 222, it is not obnoxious to s. 1(a). No more can be read
into s. 1(a) from a procedural standpoint than is already comprehended by s. 2(e)
and s. 2(f). In so far as s. 223  may be regarded, in the light of s.
223(2) , as having specific substantive effect in itself, s. 1(a) does
not make it inoperative. Assuming that ""except by due process of law""
provides a means of controlling substantive federal legislation, compelling
reasons ought to be advanced to justify the Court in this case to employ a
statutory, as contrasted with a constitutional, jurisdiction to deny operative
effect to a substantive measure duly enacted by Parliament. Those reasons must
relate to objective and manageable standards

[Page 891]

by which a Court should be guided.
Neither reasons nor underlying standards were offered here.

There is no merit in the submission
that the pre-s. 223  state of the law which was favourable to a potential
accused person, could not be changed to his disadvantage without offending s.
1(b). The Canadian Bill of Rights did not freeze the federal statutes on the day it came into effect.

The appellant's submission under s. (2)
fails. A peace officer acting under s. 223(1) is not covered by the words ""other authority"" in s. 2(d).
Otherwise, the contention would amount to a claim to have the benefit of
counsel whenever a peace officer is in the performance of a statutory duty to
require a suspect to give information or to submit to a physical test. This result
does not flow from s. 2(d). The function confided to a peace officer under s. 223(1) does not bring him within s. 2(d).
Moreover, the compelled provision of a breath sample by a person without
concurrent protection against its use in evidence against him, does not offend
against the self-crimina­tion guarantee in s. 2(d). That section gives no
war-rant for applying the privilege against self-crimina­tion at large. The
formulation of the privilege in s. 2(d) is a qualified one; the section goes no
farther than to render inoperative any statutory or non statutory rule of
federal law that would compel a person to criminate himself before a Court or
like tribunal through the giving of evidence, without concurrently protecting
him against its use against him. It follows that the compulsory taking of a
breath sample and the introduction of the analysis into evidence, if properly
provided for, and, alternatively, the pro-vision of a sanction for the
unjustified refusal to give a breath sample cannot be effectively challenged
under s. 2(d).

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1],
affirming a judgment of

Fraser J.

R. E. Walker, for the appellant. 

M. Manning, for
the respondent

[Page 892].

THE CHIEF JUSTICE---This is an appeal by leave from a judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario[2]
dismissing without recorded reasons an appeal from the decision of Fraser J.
who an­swered affirmatively the following question stated by the Trial Judge:

Did I err in law in holding that section 223  of the Criminal
Code  and section 224(A) (3) of
the Crimi­nal Code are rendered inoperative by virtue
of a conflict with the Canadian Bill of Rights?

Having had the advantage of reading the reasons
prepared by my brothers Ritchie and Laskin, I agree that the appeal should be
disposed of as they propose. In view of the all embracing scope of the Canadian
Bill of Rights and the relatively recent character of this important
statute, I would prefer, while I appreciate the learned considera­tion given to
the matter by my brother Laskin, to confine my opinion to the facts of this
case, adopt the simpler approach taken by my brother Ritchie and rest my
opinion on the reasons he gave which, in my respectful view, are sufficient for
the deci­sion of this particular case.

The judgment of Abbott, Hall, Spence, Pigeon and
Laskin JJ. was delivered by

LASKIN J.-The Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44 is invoked
in this case to sterilize certain provisions of the Criminal Code , viz., ss.
223  and 224A(3) , as enacted by s. 16 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968-69
(Can.), c. 38. That it may have a sterilizing effect upon federal legislation
was decided by this Court in Regina v. Drybones[3]. Whether that must be
the result here in no way depends upon what was decided in Regina v, Drybones.

The appellant was charged under s. 223(2)  with
failing or refusing, without reasonable excuse, to comply with a demand by a
peace officer under s. 223(1) for a breath sample to enable an anal­ysis to be
made to determine the proportion of

[Page 893]

alcohol in his blood. The provincial judge
before whom the charge was tried concluded that the Crown had proved its case
against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt. Nonetheless, he dismissed the
charge on the ground that s. 223  was inoperative because of the Canadian Bill of Rights. Thereafter, he acceded to a
Crown request to state a case in which the following question was submitted for
determination:

Did I err in law in holding that section 223  of the
Criminal Code  and section 224A(3) 
of the Criminal Code  are rendered inoperative by
virtue of a con­flict with the Canadian Bill of Rights?

Fraser J., after extensive reasons, answered
this question in the affirmative, and an appeal from his judgment was dismissed
without written reasons. Leave to appeal to this Court was granted by an order
of October 6, 1971.

In view of the course of the argument, I deem it
prudent to put at the forefront of these reasons two rather obvious
propositions; first, the Cana­dian Bill of Rights did not freeze the federal statute book as of its effective date,
which was August 10, 1960; and, second, federal law enacted after the date of
the Canadian Bill of
Rights as well as
pre-existing federal law may be found to run foul of the prescriptions of the Canadian
Bill of Rights.

Sections 223  and 224A(3)  of the Criminal Code 
are connected with s. 222 , as enacted at the same time, and I reproduce all
these provi­sions preliminary to a consideration of the effect of the Canadian
Bill of Rights upon ss. 223  and 224A(3) . They read as follows :

222. Every
one who, while his ability to drive a motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol or a
drug, drives a motor vehicle or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion
or not, is guilty of an ... offence ...

223. (1) Where a peace officer on
reasonable and probable grounds believes that a person is commit­ing, or at any
time within the preceding two hours has committed, an offence under section
222, he may, by demand made to that person forthwith or as soon

[Page 894]

as practicable, require him to provide then
or as soon thereafter as is practicable a sample of his breath suitable to
enable an analysis to be made in order to determine the proportion, if any, of
alcohol in his blood, and to accompany the peace officer for the purpose of
enabling such a sample to be taken.

(2) Every one who, without reasonable
excuse, fails or refuses to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer
under subsection (1) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction
and it liable to a fine of not less than fifty dollars and not more than one
thousand dollars or to im­prisonment for not more than six months, or both.

224A. (3) In any proceedings under section
222, evidence that the accused, without reasonable excuse, failed or refused to
comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer under subsection (1) of
section 223  is admissible and the court may draw an inference therefrom adverse
to the accused.

The contention of the appellant is that ss.
223  and 224A(3)  are in collision with s. 1(a) (b) and s. 2(d) (e) (f)
of the Canadian Bill of Rights. I reproduce these provisions,
along with s. 5(1) (2) which was also brought into play in connection with the
various submissions made by the parties. They are as follows:

1. It is hereby recognized and declared
that in Canada there have existed and shall continue to exist without
discrimination by reason of race, national origin, colour, religion or sex, the
following human rights and fundamental freedoms, namely,

(a) the right of the individual to life,
liberty, security of the person and enjoyment of property, and the right not to
be deprived thereof except by due process of law;

(b) the right of the individual to equality
before the law and the protection of the law;

2. Every law of Canada shall, unless it is
expressly declared by an Act of Parliament of Canada that it shall operate
notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied as not to abro­gate, abridge or infringe
or to authorize the abroga­tion, abridgement or infringement of any of the

[Page 895]

rights or freedoms herein recognized and
declared, and in particular, no law of Canada shall be con­strued or applied so
as to

(d) authorize a court, tribunal,
commission, board or other authority to compel a person to give evidence if he
is denied counsel, protection against self crimination or other constitutional
safeguards;

(e) deprive a person of the right to a fair
hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for the
determination of his rights and obligations;

(f) deprive a person charged with a
criminal offence of the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty
according to law in a fair and pub­lic hearing by an independent and impartial
tri­bunal, or of the right to reasonable bail without just cause;

5. (1) Nothing in Part I shall be construed
to abrogate or abridge any human right or fundamental freedom not enumerated
therein that may have ex­isted in Canada at the commencement of this Act.

(2) The expression ""law of Canada""
in Part I means an Act of the Parliament of Canada enacted before or after the
coming into force of this Act, any order, rule or regulation thereunder, and
any law in force in Canada or in any part of Canada at the commencement of this
Act that is subject to be repealed, abolished or altered by the Parliament of
Canada.

The reference by counsel for the appellant to s.
5(1) was not amplified by any indication of a tenable ground thereunder for
questioning the operative effect of ss. 223  and 224A(3)  of the Criminal Code . The
same observation applies to the invocation of s. 2(e) and (f) of the Canadian Rill of Rights. The accused was heard on the charge against him and had full
opportunity to make his defence. His objection to the charge, arising out of
his refusal to give a sample of his breath, did not involve any allegation of a
denial of a fair hearing but went rather to the substan­tive character of s.
223  and, in consequence, to

an issue of proof under s. 224A(3)  of the Criminal
Code . If it is compatible with the Cana­dian Bill of Rights to
require a person, on pain of liability to punishment, to give a sample of his
breath under s. 223(1) , I see no violation of s. 2(f) of the Canadian Bill
of Rights in making evidence of unjustified refusal admissible on an
impaired driving charge under s. 222  of the Criminal Code . The
presumption of innocence is not necessarily qualified by a statutory provision
for the admission of rebuttable evidence, and certainly not by a statutory
provision, like s. 224A(3) , for the admission of evidence from which a Court
may, not must, draw an inference adverse to the accused.

The operative effect of s. 224A(3)  in the light
of the Canadian Bill of Rights depends, therefore, on the operative
effect of s. 223 ; and if this last-mentioned provision is in any way in
conflict with the Canadian Bill of Rights, that conflict must be found,
if at all, in s. 1(a) or in s. 1(b) or in s. 2(d) thereof.

In considering the reach of s. 1(a) and s. 1(b),
and, indeed, of s. 1 as a whole, I would observe, first, that the section is
given its controlling force over federal law by its referential incorporation
into s. 2; and, second, that I do not read it as making the existence of any of
the forms of pro­hibited discrimination a sine qua non of its
opera­tion. Rather, the prohibited discrimination is an additional lever to
which federal legislation must respond. Putting the matter another way, federal
legislation which does not offend s. 1 in respect of any of the
prohibited kinds of discrimination may nonetheless be offensive to s. 1 if it
is viola­tive of what is specified in any of the clauses (a) to (f) of s. 1. It
is, à fortiori, offensive if there is
discrimination by reason of race so as to deny equality before the law. That is
what this Court decided in Regina v. Drybones and I need say no more on
this point.

[Page 897]

It is, therefore, not an answer to reliance by
the appellant on s. 1(a) and s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights that
s. 223  does not discriminate against any person by reason of race, national
origin, colour, religion or sex. The absence of such discrimination still
leaves open the question whether s. 223  can be construed and applied without
abrogating, abridging or infring­ing the rights of the individual listed in s.
1(a) and s. 1 (b). What the appellant pointed to in s. 1(a) was the guarantee
of ""due process of law"", and his contention under s. 1(b) was that s.
223  denied him ""the protection of the law"". I shall deal with these
submissions in turn.

The phrase ""due process of law"" has
its con-text in the words of s. 1(a) that precede it. In the present case, the
connection stressed was with ""the right of the individual to ... security
of the person"". It is obvious that to read ""due process of law""
as meaning simply that there must be some legal authority to qualify or impair
security of the person would be to see it as declaratory only. On this view, it
should not matter whether the legal authority is found in enacted law or in unenacted
or decisional law. Counsel for the appellant does not, of course, stop here. He
con-tended for a qualitative test of legislation to meet the standard of due
process of law and urged that the Court find that s. 223  fell below it. This
was, however, a bare submission, not reinforced by any proposed yardstick.

What it amounted to was an invitation to this
Court to monitor the substantive content of legis­lation by reference to s.
1(a). The invitation is to take the phrase ""except by due process of
law"" beyond its antecedents in English legal history, and to view it in
terms that have had sanc­tion in the United States in the consideration there
of those parts of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the American
Constitution that forbid the federal and state authorities respectively to
deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.

[Page 898]

The English antecedents, specifically 28 Edw.
III, c. 3 of 1355 (""no man of what state or con­dition he be, shall be put
out of his lands or tene­ments nor taken, nor disinherited, nor put to death
without he be brought to answer by due process of law"") as backed up by
the earlier Magna Carta, c. 29, reissue of 1225 (famous for the phrase
""per legem terrae""), point to pro­cedural considerations, although it
has been con-tended that they go farther: see McIlwain: Due Process of
Law in Magna Carta (1914), 14 Col. L. Rev, 27. It is evident from s. 2 of the Canadian
Bill of Rights that its specification of particular procedural protections
is without limitation of any others that may have a source in s. 1.

In so far as s. 223 , and especially s. 223(1),
may be regarded as a procedural aid to the enforcement of the substantive
offence created by s. 222 , I do not find it obnoxious to s. 1(a) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights. (am unable to ap­preciate what more can be rea into s. 1(a) from a procedural standpoint than is already compre­hended by s. 2(e)
(""a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice"") and by s. 2(f) (""a fair and public hearing by an
in-dependent and impartial tribunal"") I need not consider here whether the
express concern of s. 2(f) with criminal charges indicates that s. 2(e) must
refer to non-criminal proceedings. I would not read these two provisions as
pointing to different standards of procedural fairness in their respective
applications (if that be the case) to non-criminal and criminal proceedings,
save as those standards spring from the nature of the proceeding.

There is no occasion here to look at s. 223  in
terms of the revulsion and shock of conscience which influenced the Supreme
Court of the United States in Rochin v. California[4] to hold that the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was there violated. It was a case of
forcing upon

[Page 899]

a suspect the use of an emetic to obtain morphine
capsules which he had swallowed. In my opinion, the policy reflected in s. 222 
could properly, at the instance of Parliament, be supported by the
prescriptions of s. 223  without there being any denial to an accused of a fair
hearing, that is, of due or just process.

Counsel for the respondent conceded in argu­ment
that s. 1(a) could have application to pre-trial matters affecting a
person who is or is about to be charged with an offence. He submitted,
how-ever, that in the present case self-crimination was the only possible
ground of objection under s. 1(a) and, since it was covered expressly in
s. 2(d), there was no reason to consider it separately and independently under
s. 1(a). The force of this submission depends on a view of the scope of s. 2(d)
on which counsel for the appellant and counsel for the Crown are in
disagreement; and, accordingly, I defer consideration of the scope of the
protection against self-crimination, so far as it may be comprehended under s.
1(a) as well as under s. 2(d), until I give my reasons on the appellant's
submissions with respect to s. 2(d).

In so far as s. 223  may be regarded, in the
light of s. 223(2) , as having specific substantive effect in itself, I
am likewise of the opinion that s. 1(a) of the Canadian Bill of Rights does
not make it inoperative. Assuming that ""except by due process of law""
provides a means of control-ling substantive federal legislation-a point that
did not directly arise in Regina v. Drybones-compelling reasons ought to
be advanced to justify the Court in this case to employ a statutory (as
contrasted with a constitutional) jurisdiction to deny operative effect to a
substantive measure duly enacted by a Parliament constitutionally com­petent to
do so, and exercising its powers in ac­cordance with the tenets of responsible
government, which underlie the discharge of legislative authority under the British
North America Act. Those reasons must relate to objective and man­ageable
standards by which a Court should be

[Page 900]

guided if scope is to be found in s. 1(a) due
process to silence otherwise competent federal legislation Neither reasons nor
underlying stand­ards were offered here. For myself, I am not pre-pared in this
case to surmise what they might be.

American judicial experience with the Fifth and
Fourteenth Amendments, in respect of substantive due process, does not provide
any ground upon which this Court might stand for the purpose of resorting to
due process in s. 1(a) as a means of controlling such federal laws as s.
223  of the Criminal Code . If there is any analogy at all to be drawn
between the Canadian Bill of Rights and the American Constitution, it is
to be found with respect to the first eight amendments to that Con­stitution,
which inhibit federal action, and not with respect to the Fourteenth, which is
referable to the states.

A recurring issue in American judicial exper­ience
during this century has been the extent to which the Fourteenth Amendment
(consisting in its first section of a citizens' privileges and im­munities
clause and an equal protection clause as well as of a due process clause)
protects against state action which involves invasions of what is specified in
the first eight amendments. There is no such issue of interaction involved
under the Canadian Bill of Rights. The late Justice Frank­furter made
the point in his concurring reasons in Adamson v. California[5] that due process in the
Fifth Amendment does not subsume what is other-wise explicitly guaranteed
against federal invasion in the first eight amendments; and this is apropos in
Canada without any need to consider his further assertion (vigorously rejected
by the late Justice Black in his dissent in the same case) that this conclusion
should be accepted with respect to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
As in the first eight amendments (which may be compendiously referred to
as the American 

[Page 901]

Bill of Rights) so in the Canadian Bill of
Rights, the due process clause does not stand alone, but is part of a
scheme which includes among the protected ""human rights and funda­mental fredoms""
(1) the political liberties, (2) the right to counsel, (3) the right to
reason-able bail, (4) protection against self-crimination and (5) protection
against cruel and unusual punishment. In addition to these common features, the
American Bill of Rights is express on pro­tection against unreasonable searches
and seizures, double jeopardy, and the taking of private prop­erty for public
use without just compensation.

Each of these last-mentioned provisions has been
recognized as within Fourteenth Amendment protection (see, respectively, Mapp
v. Ohio[6],
Benton v. Maryland[7]
and Chicago, Burlington etc. Ry. v. Chicago [8]) and so too has the
federal guaran­tee of right to counsel in criminal cases (see Gideon v.
Wainwright[9]),
although not without overruling an earlier decision (see Betts v. Brady[10]). An overruling was
also involved before the protection against self-crimination was in­cluded in
the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees (see Twining v. New Jersey[11] and Malloy v. Hogan[12]). I make reference to
these cases to show that in the main there has been a jealous judicial concern
for fair criminal procedure in the State Courts, and the federal guarantees in
this area have provided an acceptable measure. There is no similar need to pour
content into the Cana­dian due process clause when it is surrounded by the
specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights that 1 have already mentioned.

[Page 902]

The immediate issue is, however, the wider one
of the extent to which the Fifth Amendment due process clause has been used as
a brake on federal law-making, apart from matters of pro­cedural regularity or
procedural fairness. Here too there has been a checkered history, involving
such questions as unreasonable discrimination, the degree of immunity of
private business from public regulation, and the limits of permissible
interference with freedom of contract. It appears that so-called economic due
process has been abandoned (see.. West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish[13]) in the realization
that a Court enters the bog of legislative policy-making in assuming to
enshrine any particular theory, as for example, untrammelled liberty of
contract, which has not been plainly expressed in the Constitution.

This commends itself to me with respect to due
process in the Canadian Bill of Rights. Parlia­ment has spoken clearly
on certain types of discrimination; it has used familiar, albeit general, words
in its legislative guarantees of freedom of religion, speech, assembly,
association and the press; and it has been even more specific in what it has
enumerated in s.2, although even here there are difficulties of interpretation.
The very large words of s. 1(a), tempered by a phrase (""except by due
process of law"") whose original English meaning has been overlaid by
American constitutional imperatives, signal extreme caution to me when asked to
apply them in negation of substantive legislation validly enacted by a Par­liament
in which the major role is played by elected representatives of the people.
Certainly, in the present case, a holding that the enactment of s. 223  has
infringed the appellant's right to the security of his person without due
process of law must be grounded on more than a substitution of a personal
judgment for that of Parliament. There is nothing in the record, by way of
evidence or admissible extrinsic material, upon which such a holding could be
supported. I am, moreover, of the opinion that it is within the scope of
judicial notice to recognize that Parliament has acted in

[Page 903]

a matter that is of great social concern, that
is the human and economic cost of highway acci­dents arising from drunk
driving, in enacting s. 223  and related provisions of the Criminal
Code . Even where this Court is asked to pass on the con­stitutional
validity of legislation, it knows that it must resist making the wisdom of
impugned legis­lation the test of its constitutionality. A fortiori is this so where it is measuring legislation by a statutory
standard, the result of which may make federal enactments inoperative.

The submission under s. 1(b) that s. 223  was a
denial of the ""protection of the law"" amounted at bottom to a
contention that the pre-s: -223 state of the law, which was more favourable to
a potential accused person, could not be changed to his disadvantage without
offending s. 1(b). I find no merit in this position, based as it is on the
""frozen statute book"" theory. It was not argued that the appellant
was denied ""equality be-fore the law"" under s. 1(b), and hence it is
unnecessary to consider whether s. 1(b) must be read as wholly conjunctive so
as to make the declaration of the protection of the law a reinforcement of the
requirement of equality before the law. This Court has pointed out in Regina
v. Drybones[14]
that ""law"" in s. 1(b) refers to federal law, as defined in s. 5(2)
of the Canadian Bill of Rights.

This brings me to the final submission of the
appellant, that under s. 2(d), which was the one argued at greatest length.

Four points are taken by counsel for the ap­pellant
in reliance upon s. 2(d). First, he sub­mits that a peace officer acting under
s. 223(1) is covered by the phrase ""other authority"" in s. 2(d).
Second, it is his contention that the unqualified words ""to give
evidence"" in s. 2(d) (that is, unqualified by any express limitation to
testimony at a hearing) are broad enough and (having regard to the
purpose of the Bill of Rights

[Page 904]

as expressed in its preamble and in s. 1) should
be construed to cover the results of com­pelled physical tests as well as
compelled oral utterance. Third, it is urged that s. 2(d) extends to
persons who may be but are not yet parties or witnesses, and the contrast is
made with s. 2(g) which does speak, inter alia, of a
party or witness before a court, commission, board or other tri­bunal in connection
with the provision of an interpreter. Fourth, the allegation is that pre-trial
compulsion at the instance of a peace officer to submit to a test that may
yield incriminating re­sults is a denial of protection against sef-crimi­nation
within s. 2(d).

The position of counsel for the Crown on these
four points was that s. 2(d) did not admit of the segmented
consideration which they postulated; and that, read as a whole and against
other provi­sions of s. 2 such as s. 2(g), the proper conclu­sion was that s. 2(d)
envisaged compelled self-incriminating testimony at a hearing. Section 223 ,
quite clearly, is not of that order.

If the opening words of s. 2(d) (""authorize
a court, tribunal, commission, board or other auth­ority""), taken in the
context of the whole of s. 2(d), invite the application of the ejusdem generis
rule to the words ""other authority"" this affords, without more,
an answer to the appel­lant's submissions. It is said, however, by the
appellant that the genus is exhausted by the words ""court, tribunal,
commission and board"", and hence ""other authority"" may well
refer to a peace officer. Reference is made to the rules governing confessions,
which are predicated upon statements made to ""persons in authority"",
among whom, of course, are peace officers.

I am of the opinion that the usual approach in
statutory interpretation of reading a questioned provision ,as a whole is
particularly apposite in the present case. Looking, at the terms of s. 2(d),

authorize a court, tribunal, commission, board
or other authority to compel a person to give evidence if he is denied counsel,
protection against self-crimi­nation or other constitutional safeguards,

some assistance in arriving at its meaning is
pro­vided by the juxtaposition of the words ""if he is denied counsel""
and ""protection against self-cri­mination"". Not only must the words
""other authority"" not be taken in isolation from the connecting words
""compel a person to give evid­ence"", but they must also be related to
the im­mediately following phrases, of which the first is ""if he is denied
counsel"". The appellant's sub-mission on the words ""other
authority"" would, if accepted, mean that (1) the phrase ""compel a
person to give evidence"" must be read as includ­ing in its meaning
""the supply of proof of facts to be adduced at trial""; and (2) the
peace officer who proceeds to act under s. 223  must, at least if the affected
person so requests, give him an opportunity to obtain counsel. This would not
be a case of entitlement to counsel by a person who has been arrested, for
which provision is made separately under s. 2(c) (ii) of the Canadian Bill
of Rights, but would amount to a claim to have the benefit of counsel
whenever a peace officer is in the performance of a statutory duty to re-quire
a suspect to give information or to submit to a physical test. I cannot accept
this result as flowing from s. 2(d) of the Canadian Bill of
Rights.

However, even taking the words ""other auth­ority""
in isolation, they have subject matter in such legislation as the Immigration
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-2 and the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-23. The first-mentioned Act provides that immigration officers may
administer oaths and take evidence under oath in connection with the
examination of persons seeking admission to Canada. It also provides for
inquiries by a Special Inquiry Officer, likewise authorized to administer oaths
and take sworn evidence, which may lead to an order of deportation. Even if the
Special Inquiry Officer could be considered a ""tri­bunal"" or a
""board"" within s. 2(d), it is my opinion that the immigration officer
in his conduct

[Page 906]

of an examination fits more appropriately in the
category of ""other authority"" than in any of the categories of
""court, tribunal, commission or board"".

The Combines Investigation Act provides
for the appointment of a Director of Investigation and Research who is required
in certain circum­stances to hold inquiries into alleged offences under Part V
of the Act; and he may, in that connection, obtain the authority of a member of
the Restrictive Trade Practices Commission to examine persons under oath or to
have production of books and records or to require written returns as to the
business and business dealings of per-sons or corporations involved in the
inquiry. Al-though there is some similarity in the functions of the Director
and that of a peace officer in the in­vestigation of crime, the similarity
ceases where the Director is engaged in an inquiry for which counsel has been
appointed to assist therein and at which evidence is taken under oath. The
Director, in such a case, may properly be re­garded as falling within the words
""other auth­ority"", as being within the genus signified by the
preceding words ""court, tribunal, commission, board"" under s. 2(d)
of the Canadian Bill of Rights.

The immigration officer under the Immigration
Act and the Director under the Combines Investi­gation Act in their
character as officers presiding over an examination and an inquiry are carrying
out duties of a different order than what a peace officer is empowered to do
under s. 223(1)  of the Criminal Code . I conclude therefore that
the function confided to a peace officer under s. 223  (l) does not bring
him within s. 2(d) of the Canadian Bill of Rights.

Apart entirely from the point just discussed, I
am of opinion that the compelled provision of a breath sample by a person,
without concurrent protection against its use in evidence against him, does not
offend against the self-crimination guarantee as it is expressed in s. 2(d).
Although I am in the main in agreement with what was said

[Page 907]

by Freedman C. J. M. in Regina v. McKay[15], a case involving the
same considerations as the present one, he did not address himself directly to
the self-crimination question, as did Fraser J. in the present case, but dealt
only with the mean­ing of the words ""other authority"" and ""to give
evidence"".

I approach the issue of self-crimination by ob­serving
that statutory compellability to give a breath sample does not per se raise
any question of illegally obtained evidence and, a fortiori, does not
raise any question of illegally obtained state­ments or admissions. In this
respect, therefore, s. 223  removes one of the problems that was can­vassed
during the course of the proceedings at trial and on appeal in the case of Attorney-Gen­eral
of Quebec v. Begin[16].

Although that was a case where the accused
consented to a blood test, it was urged unsuccess­fuly in this Court that the
failure to forewarn him of the likely use of the results of the test pre­cluded
the Crown from adducing evidence thereof. This Court concluded that the rules
respecting the admissibility of statements by an accused did not come into play
upon the taking of a blood sample. The governing judgment, delivered by Fauteux
J., as he then was, referred to Wigmore's rationale of those rules, which test
admissibility by voluntariness, as based on the exclusion of self-criminating
statements that may be false: Evidence (3rd ed. 1940), vol. 3, p. 250.
That rationale had no application to the results of a physical test. The
judgment of this Court in Piché v. The Queen[17], although expanding the protection of the confession rules to include
any statements of an accused to a person in authority, has other-wise no
bearing on the matter under consideration.

In the light of Begin and of the
subsequently enacted Canadian Bill of Rights the question that remains
to be answered is whether the statutorily

[Page 908]

compelled giving of a breath sample, although
not raising any issue of illegally obtained admis­sions of an accused, is
nonetheless a form of self-crimination that is within the expression thereof in
s. 2(d). Pertinent to this question is the fact that s. 2(d) in referring to
""a person"" certainly covers both a witness other than an accused and
an accused. Counsel for the appellant would have it that ""person""
also covers a suspect whom a peace officer confronts under s. 223(1) ; and he
proceeds from this base to contend that the sanc­tion-supported demand for a
breath sample involves compelled self-crimination referable to a subsequent
charge and trial for impaired driving.

In view of what has gone before in these
reasons, this contention cannot succeed unless it be held that (1) s. 2(d), in
respect of self-crimina­tion, extends to protect an accused against the
introduction of evidence adduced through the mouth of another but which was
compelled from the accused, and (2) the protection against self-crimination
includes protection against the use of evidence of the results of compelled
incriminating physical tests; or (having regard to the terms of s. 224A(3)  of
the Criminal Code ) prohibits the drawing of an adverse inference (which
would indirectly involve compulsory self-crimination) from the refusal to
submit to physical tests. This submission dissolves, of course, the formal
distinc­tion between compulsory self-crimination and the use of the answers or
the analysis against a person in subsequent proceedings.

An accused person remains under the law of
Canada a non-compellable witness for the prose­cution. The history of this
matter in this country is recounted by Cartwright J., as he then was, in Batary
v. Attorney-General of Saskatchewan[18].
What lies behind the first branch of the contention above-noted is the
proposition that what cannot be compelled from an accused directly at his trial
should not be compellable from him at a pre-trial or pre-arrest stage. Prior to
the enactment of the Canadian Bill of Rights it was not thought to be
incompatible with the preservation of an accused's immunity for evidence to be
given by another

[Page 909]

about an accused's physical appearance or his
clothing (to take two examples), with a resulting incriminating effect. I speak
here of matters of observation only and leave out of account others, mentioned
by Fauteux J. in Begin18 which might be compelled but without statutory authorization to
support the compulsion. Again, an accused could not before the enactment of the
Canadian Bill of
Rights nor can he since its enactment claim any
immunity or privilege against the admissibility of his voluntary disclosures
where they are re-levant to a charge against him. It is submitted, however,
that where compelled cooperation of a person in his self-crimination is
provided by sta­tute, s. 2(d) of the Canadian Bill of Rights should be construed to preclude evidence of the results of that
cooperation, or of the refusal to cooperate, from being adduced against him in
subsequent proceedings.

Apart from s, 2(d), and apart from questions of
constitutionality such as arose in the Batary case, supra, statutes
compelling a person to make disclosures or to submit to tests that may be
incriminating raise questions about the scope of the privilege against
self-crimination only in the con-text of the admissibility of the disclosures
or of the results of the tests in subsequent proceedings. This issue has
recently been canvassed by Heydon, Statutory Restrictions on the
Privilege against Self-Incrimination, (1971) 87 Law Q. Rev. 214, and
reference may also be made to the judgment of this Court in Walker v. The
King[19].
What is involved is the clarity of the compelling statute and whether, if
the statute is ambiguous or silent on the question of admissibility, the
privilege against self-crimination can be invoked to deny admissibility. In the
present case, it is conceded that unless the appellant is aided by s. 2(d) of
the Canadian Bill of
Rights, there is no ground for avoiding the plain
effect of ss. 223  and 224A(3)  of the Criminal Code .

[Page 910]

Section 2(d) gives no warrant for
applying the privilege against self-crimination at large; rather it has a
specific focus. The Supreme Court of the United States has had to wrestle with
a con­stitutional statement of the privilege which is cast in wider terms; the
relevant portion of the Fifth Amendment provides that no person ""shall be
com­pelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself"". Although
the word ""witness"" could sup-port a narrow construction, there is no
such limit­ing context in the Fifth Amendment as there is in s. 2(d), which
relates the protection against self-crimination to the giving of evidence, at
the be-hest of a court or like tribunal, by the person en-titled to the
protection The Fifth Amendment formulation is not so confined as a matter of
words; and it has been held wide enough to sup-port the assertion of the
privilege in ""custodial interrogation"" (the phrase is from Miranda
v. Arizona[20]),
with consequent exclusion of state­ments obtained as a result thereof
unless there are specified procedural safeguards, as well as be-fore a court or
like tribunal.

A week after its decision in Miranda, the
Supreme Court of the United States concluded that the privilege did not apply
to the ""custodial bleeding"" of an accused. In Schmerber v. Cali­fornia[21], it held in a majority
judgment that the taking of a blood sample from an accused at the direction of
a police officer but over the accused's objection, when he was under arrest and
in hos­pital for treatment for automobile injuries, and the admission of the
analysis as evidence against him on a trial for driving while intoxicated, did
not violate his Fifth Amendment privilege against being ""compelled in any
criminal case to be a witness against himself"", a privilege which, under Malloy
v. Hogan, already mentioned, was secured against State invasion by the
Fourteenth Amendment. The Court majority, speaking through Brennan J., put the
matter as follows (at p. 761) :

We . . must now decide whether the withdrawal of
the blood and admission in evidence of the analysis

[Page 911]

involved in this case violated the petitioner's
privi­lege. We hold that the privilege protects an accused only from being
compelled to testify against himself, or otherwise provide the State with
evidence of a testimonial or communicative nature and that the withdrawal of
blood and use of the analysis in ques­tion in this case did not involve
compulsion to these ends.

In short, he was of the view that ""the
privilege reaches an accused's communications, whatever form they might take,
and the compulsion of re­sponses which are also communications, for example,
compliance with a subpoena to produce one's papers"" (at pp. 763-4).
Brennan J. was guarded in accepting literally the distinction be­tween the
compelling of communications or testi­mony and compulsion which makes a suspect
or an accused the source of real or physical evi­dence, pointing out that some
physical tests, as, for example, by lie detector apparatus, may be directed to
eliciting responses which are essen­tially testimonial. That, however, was not
the case before him.

The minority view in Schmerber is typified
by the reasons of the late Justice Black who said that ""to reach the
conclusion that compelling a person to give his blood to help the State convict
him is not equivalent to compelling him to be a witness against himself strikes
me as quite an extraordi­nary feat"" (at p. 773). Justice Black noted that
the majority refused to adopt Wigmore's narrow view of the privilege against
self-crimination as merely barring the use of forced incriminating statements coining
from a person's own lips; but, this being so, he felt unable to see a
distinction between recognizing the privilege in respect of an accused's papers
and not recognizing it in the communicative effect of an analysis of his blood.

The Wigmore view was referred to by this Court
in Begin and was again mentioned favour-ably in Reference re Validity
of Section 92(4) of The Vehicles Act, 1957 (Sask.)[22], (see, for ex-ample,
Rand J. at p. 618, ""I take the rule of

[Page 912]

immunity from incriminating evidence to be
con-fined to that which bears a testimonial charac­ter""). On the other
hand, the Supreme Court of the United States appeared to be unanimous in Schmerber
that at least compelled utterances and communications of a suspect or of an
accused in custody are privileged under the Fifth Amendment, regardless of
whether they are sought to be introduced into evidence directly from the mouth
of the person claiming the privilege or indirectly through the mouth of
another. There may be logic in the view that utterances and communications that
cannot be compelled from an accused in the court room should not be compellable
from him in out-of-court interrogation. But whatever be the logic as to the
scope of the privilege against self-crimination, either in the United States or
else-where, the governing text in this case is s. 2(d). The formulation of the
privilege in s. 2(d) is a qualified one; and apart from the question
whether it would, if applicable here, cover the compulsory taking of breath
samples as well as compelled utterances and communications, I can-not read s. 2(d)
as going any farther tan to render inoperative any statutory or
non-statutory rule of federal law that would compel a person to criminate
himself before a court or like tribunal through the giving of evidence, without
concur­rently protecting him against its use against him] I leave for
future consideration the scope of the term ""evidence"" since this is
not a matter that arises in the present case.

This view of s. 2(d) means, in the case of an accused
person, that he cannot be made a compel­lable witness unless the Canadian
Bill of Rights is expressly by-passed for that purpose as pro­vided in the
opening words of s. 2 thereof. The English version of s. 2(d) is supported
in this construction by the French version which speaks of ""à contraindre une
personne à témoigner si on lui refuse ... la protection contre son propre té­moignage ...."" Indeed, it follows from my view of s. 2(d) that the
compulsory taking of a breath sample and the introduction of the analysis into
evidence (if properly provided for), and, alternately, 

[Page 913]

the provision of a sanction for the unjusti­fied
refusal to, give a breath sample cannot be effectively challenged under that
provision of the Canadian Bill of Rights.

Accordingly, the appellant's submissions under
s. 2(d) fail. It remains to consider whether there is a residuary scope of the
privilege, beyond what is recognized under s. 2(d), that falls within s. 1(a)
and accordingly makes s. 223  inoperative It would be specious to contend
that the likeli­hood of self-crimination constitutes a reasonable excuse within
s. 223(2)  and that the subsection is otherwise unaffected. To allow this
contention would be to debilitate the provision as fully as if the privilege
against self-crimination had been raised against it as a whole. The issue then
is not whether self-crimination or the likelihood thereof goes to the saving
clause of s. 223(2) , but whether the entire s. 223  is without
effect on that ground under the warrant of the due process clause of s. 1(a).

I do not think that the Canadian Bill of
Rights can be construed as having taken a piecemeal ap­proach to the
privilege against self-crimination. The history of the privilege as a Canadian
deriv­ative from the English common law is accurately reflected in the way it
is expressed in s. 2(d): see 8 Wigmore on Evidence (McNaughton revi­sion,
1961), # 2250, pp. 284 if. The scope or policy of the privilege may be another
thing, as it has proved to be under its constitutional formu­lation in the
United States. Unless s. 2(d), where the privilege is expressed, yields room to
take policy beyond history-and I have already dealt with s. 2(d) in this
respect-I do not think that s. 1(a), where there is no reference to the
privilege and whose words provide no historical warrant for embracing it, can
be taken to include in its protection an extension of the privilege beyond what
is found in s. 2(d).

No doubt, the generous words of s. 1(a) may
bring to mind matters other than protection against self-crimination for which
protection may be sought thereunder, failing their specific mention

[Page 914]

 elsewhere in the Canadian Bill of Rights. I do not propose to
speculate on them; their day of decision may come, but in this case I am con­cerned
with a submission that although self-cri­mination is expressly dealt with in
one provision of the statute, this Court should find another expression thereof
in another provision of the same statute where it is not expressly mentioned.

There is a distinction to be drawn in respect of
the privilege which is commanded by the exper­ience with it in this country and
in the United States. The point in the criminal process at which the privilege
can be asserted is one thing; what the privilege embraces at that point is
something else. It is my conclusion that the point of asser­tion has been fixed
in s. 2(d) and I do not think I can invoke s. 1(a) to shift it to a
stage which would make it effective against s. 223 .

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Martland and Judson JJ. was
delivered by

MARTLAND J.-I would dismiss this appeal. I agree with the reasons given by my
brother Laskin. I also agree with the reasons of my brother Ritchie, but, in so
doing, I do not adopt, as final, any specific definition of the phrase
""due process of law"", as used in s. 1(a) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights.

RITCHIE J.-I have had the advantage of read­ing the reasons for judgment prepared
for delivery by my brother Laskin and I agree that the appeal should be
disposed of in the manner proposed by him.

In the present case the appellant was charged
under s. 223  of the Criminal Code  with failing or refusing without
lawful excuse to comply with a demand by a peace officer under s. 223(1)  for a
breath sample to enable an analysis to be made in order to determine the
proportion, if any, of alcohol in his blood. The charge was dismissed at trial
on the ground that s. 223  of the Criminal Code  was inoperative
because of the Canadian Bill of Rights. The learned judge at first
instance

[Page 915]

was requested to submit and did submit the
following question for determination by way of stated case:

Did I err in law in holding that section 223  of
the Criminal Code  and section 224A(3)  of the Criminal Code  are rendered
inoperative by virtue of a con­flict with the Canadian Bill of Rights?

The relevant sections of the Criminal Code  and
the Canadian Bill of Rights (hereinafter re­ferred to as ""the Bill
of Rights"") are set out in full in the reasons for judgment of
my brother Laskin.

The question posed by the stated case was con­sidered
at length by Fraser J., who gave an affir­mative answer which was affirmed
without re-corded reasons by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.[23]

Leave to appeal to this Court having been
granted, the main ground urged by the appellant was that the provisions of ss.
223  and 224A(3)  could not be applied without abridging the ap­pellant's right
to ""protection against self crimina­tion"" and that such provisions
were therefore inoperative as being in conflict with s. 2(d) of the Bill of
Rights.

It was also argued that since ss. 223  and
224A(3)  had the effect of enabling a peace offi­cer to compel a citizen to
submit to a breath test which might yield incriminating evidence against him at
his trial, these sections offend against the right of the individual not to be
deprived of the security of his person ""without due process of law""
which is recognized by s. 1(a) of the Bill of Rights.

In concluding that the impugned sections of the Criminal
Code  did not offend against the ""due process"" provisions of s.
1(a) of the Bill of Rights, my brother Laskin has made an extensive and
instructive review of the meaning of ""due process of law"", in the
course of which he makes reference to the origins of the phrase and its ap­plication
in decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States of America. While I
agree that ss. 223  and 224A 

[Page 916]

do not offend against s. 1(a) of the Bill of
Rights, I prefer to base this conclusion on my understanding that the
meaning to be given to the language employed in the Bills of Rights is
the meaning which it bore in Canada at the time when the Bill was enacted, and
it follows that, in my opinion, the phrase ""due process of law"" as used in
s. 1(a) is to be construed as meaning ""according to the legal processes
recognized by Parliament and the courts in Canada"".

I think, as I have said, that the real issue in
this case is whether or not the provisions of ss. 223  and 224A(3)  in so
far as they provide that an individual may be compelled to give a sample of his
breath which can later be used against him at his trial, amount to enforced
""self crimina­tion"" and thus abridge the individual's right to
""protection against self crimination"" which is recognized by s. 2(d)
of the Bill of Rights.

In accordance with the view which I have
al-ready expressed as to the meaning which I think should be attached to the
language of the Bill of Rights, I would prefer to base my opinion on the
meaning of the words ""protection against self crimination"" as they occur in s. 2(d)
on the cases decided in this Court and more particularly on the cases of The
Attorney General for Quebec v. Begin[24],
and Validity of Section 92(4) of The Vehicles Act, 1957 (Sask)[25].

In the course of his reasons for judgment in the
latter case, the present Chief Justice, relying on the case of Begin, had
this to say:

Indeed the confession rule requiring a warning,
ex­clusively concerns self incriminating statements of the accused, and
aims at the exclusion of those which are untrue. As its subject matter or
purpose, the confession rule does not embrace the incrimi­nating conditions of
the body, features, fingerprints, clothing or behaviour of the accused, that
persons, other than himself, observe or detect and ultimately report as
witnesses in judicial proceedings.

I think, therefore, that the words
""protection against self crimination"" as they occur in s. 2(d)
of the Bill of Rights are to be taken as meaning

[Page 917]

protection against ""self incriminating statements"" and not
as embracing ""incriminating conditions of the body"" such as the
alcoholic content of the breath or blood.

I do not find it necessary to go further afield
in order to interpret this phrase as it occurs in the Canadian Bill of
Rights.

As I have said, I would dispose of this appeal
in the manner proposed by my brother Laskin.

Appeal dismissed.

Present: Judson, Ritchie, Hall, Spence and
Laskin JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Forgery—Falsification of
inventory sheets—False document—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 268(e)(ii), 309(2), 340.

The appellant was a principal in a firm that
had a contract with a company to take periodic inventories in its stores and
was in charge of this exercise at store No. 20 of the company’s extensive store
system. It is alleged that he had falsified inventory sheets or records, which
were prepared in his writing, respecting the inventory on certain dates carried
by that store. The evidence showed that the sums recorded in the particular
inventory sheets exceeded those shown on the inventory slips for the same
items.

He was charged with one count of fraud, five
counts of forgery and five counts of uttering. A directed verdict of acquittal
was entered on four forgery counts and on four associated uttering counts. The
jury returned a verdict of acquittal on the remaining three counts. The Crown
appealed only the acquittals on the directed verdicts. These were set aside,
and a new trial was directed. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held (Hall and
Laskin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Judson,
Ritchie and Spence JJ.: The false entries contained in the inventory sheets
which were certified to be true and correct by the appellant, made these sheets
“false documents” within the meaning of s. 309  of the Criminal Code . This
section, which describes the crime of forgery, comes within Part VII of the
Code and must be read in light of the interpretation provisions of s. 268 . Were
it not for the provisions of s. 309(2) , the meaning defined in s. 268 (e)
would be the only meaning attributable to the words “false document”, but
s. 309(2)  makes it plain that for the purpose of the offence of forgery, those
words include not only the

[Page 889]

making of a document which is false in the
manner defined in s. 268(e), but also the making of a material
alteration in or addition to a document which is genuine. Section 309(2)
has the effect of enlarging the meaning of the words “false document” in s.
268(e) so as to cover documents which might not otherwise be included. A
document which is false in reference to the very purpose for which the document
was created is certainly one which is false in a material particular. The
inventory sheets in question contained false information as to the matters
which they purported to certify and so were false in a number of material
particulars and, therefore, each was a “false document” within the meaning of
Part VII which contains s. 309 .

It is impossible to regard the language of s.
268(e) as nothing more than a reformulation of the wording of s. 335(l)(i)
of the old Code. The wording of s. 268(e) (ii) is plain and unambiguous
and the task of the Courts is to give effect to it whether it results in a
change in the common law definition of forgery or not.

If full effect were given to the definition
in s. 268(e) (ii) there may well be duplication between the offences
created by s. 340  and s. 309 . That question does not arise in the present case,
but the matter is in any event one for Parliament and not for the Courts.

Per Hall and
Laskin JJ., dissenting: The inventory sheets were not false documents
within s. 268(e) (ii) of the Code. The falsity and materiality connoted
by the words in s. 335(l) (i) of the old Code have to do with the
genuineness of the document as such, in so far as it purports to be what it is
not. There has been no change in the law of forgery to include within it not
only documents whose genuineness as such is in issue but also those that are
genuine enough in themselves but have recorded on them false information.
Nothing new was contemplated in respect of forgery by the Royal Commission on
the Revision of the Criminal Law in 1952. False document is defined in s. 268(e)
only for the purpose of the forgery provisions of s. 309 , and the conception of
genuineness is basic to the offence according to the very terms in which the
offence is defined. There is no reason to turn falsification of records into a
new kind of forgery by virtue of s. 268(e) (ii), and so obliterate the
distinction between this offence and the one under s. 340. A new trial was
properly directed by the Court of Appeal.

[Page 890]

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, allowing an appeal
by the Crown from a directed verdict of acquittal on charges of forgery and
uttering. Appeal dismissed, Hall and Laskin JJ. dissenting.

Arthur Maloney, Q.C., for the appellant.

B. Wright, for the respondent.

The judgment of Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.
was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—I have had the benefit of reading the
reasons for judgment of my brother Laskin in which he has made a thorough
analysis of the circumstances giving rise to this appeal and I agree with him
that the first question to be determined is whether or not the false entries
contained in the inventory sheets which were certified to be true and correct
by the appellant, made these sheets “false documents” within the meaning of s.
309  of the Criminal Code .

In directing the jury to bring in a verdict of
not guilty in respect of counts 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the indictment
preferred against the appellant, the learned trial judge felt himself bound by
the decision of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Regina v. Chow Sik Wah and
Quon Hong[1], where
Mr. Justice Kelly, speaking on behalf of the Court, adopted, as applicable
to a prosecution under s. 309  of the Criminal Code , the common law
conception of “a false document” as stated in Kenny’s Outlines of Criminal Law,
17 ed., pages 354 and 355 where it is said:

A writing is not a forgery when it merely
contains statements which are false, but only when it purports to be itself
that which it is not. The simplest and most effective phrases by which to
express this rule is to state that for the purposes of the law of forgery the
writing must tell a lie about itself.

Upon this basis Mr. Justice Kelly held of
the document there in question at page 404:

To be a false document this document must
tell an untruth about itself, not about some other document of which it
purports to be no more than a copy.

[Page 891]

The same position was clearly stated by
Blackburn C.J. in Ex parte Windsor[2]
where he said:

Forgery is the false making of an
instrument purporting to be that which it is not; it is not the making of an
instrument which purports to be what it really is, but which contains false
statements. Telling a lie does not become a forgery because it is reduced into
writing.

Even if the meaning of a “false document” as
expressed by the learned author of Kenny’s Outlines of Common Law, supra,
and by Blackburn J., was an essential ingredient of a charge under s. 309 
of the Criminal Code , I am nevertheless not fully satisfied that
the learned trial judge would have been justified in directing the acquittals
as he did because, as is pointed out by the respondent’s counsel, the false
inventory returns here in question might be said to tell a lie about themselves
in the sense that they contain a certificate as to the correctness and accuracy
of figures which are false.

I am, however, relieved of the necessity of
deciding this latter question because in the present case the words “false
document” must, in my opinion, be given the meaning which the Criminal Code  attributes
to them and not the meaning which they have come to bear under the common law
of England, and it follows in my view that any document that is false in some
material particular is “a false document” within the meaning of Part VII of the
Criminal Code  (offences against rights of property).

Section 309 , which describes the crime of
forgery, comes within Part VII of the Criminal Code  and it must
therefore be read in light of the interpretation provisions of s. 268  which
read, in part, as follows:

268. In this Part,…

(e) ‘false document’ means a
document

(i) the whole or some material part of
which purports to be made by or on behalf of a person

(A) who did not make it or authorize it to
be made, or

(B) who did not in fact exist;

[Page 892]

(ii) that is made by or on behalf of the
person who purports to make it but is false in some material particular;

(iii) that is made in the name of an
existing person, by him or under his authority, with a fraudulent intention
that it should pass as being made by some person, real or fictitious, other
than the person who makes it or under whose authority it is made.

Section 309 , on the other hand, reads as
follows:

309. (1) Every one commits forgery who
makes a false document, knowing it to be false, with intent

(a) that it should in any way
be used or acted upon as genuine, to the prejudice of any one whether within
Canada or not, or

(b) that some person should
be induced, by the belief that it is genuine, to do or to refrain from doing
anything, whether within Canada
or not.

(2) Making a false document includes

(a) altering a genuine
document in any material part,

(b) making a material
addition to a genuine document or adding to it a false date, attestation, seal
or other thing that is material, or

(c) making a material
alteration in a genuine document by erasure, obliteration, removal or in any
other way.

If I understood him correctly, the first
argument advanced by Mr. Maloney on behalf of the appellant was that the
provisions of s. 309(2) contained a definition which excluded from the meaning
of “false document”, as a constituent of the crime of forgery, all documents
which did not “tell a lie” about themselves, and thus excluded documents such
as those here in question which would otherwise come within the terms of s.
268(e) (ii) as being “false in some material particular”. This argument
presupposes that the word “includes” as used in s. 309(2) should be construed
as if it were the word “means” in such fashion as to exclude a part of the
definition contained in s. 268(e).

In considering the effect to be given to the
words “means” and “includes” as they are employed in the Criminal Code , respondent’s
counsel has referred to the reasons for judgment of Doull, J., speaking on
behalf of the Supreme Court

[Page 893]

of Nova Scotia en banc, in Rex v. Jollimore[3], where he said at page 389 of the
interpretation section of the Criminal Code  (s. 2 ):

The definitions in s. 2 of the Code are
of two kinds. Some subsections,… use the word ‘means’ in defining terms; on the
other hand many other subsections,… use the word ‘includes’. There is a great
difference in the effect of the two words. The first class of definitions give
statutory meanings to the terms so defined and that meaning is the only meaning
applicable to the words in the Criminal Code .

On the other hand, the
subsections using the word ‘includes’ have no such restrictive meaning but
enlarge the meaning of the word to cover something which would not otherwise be
included in the term, or the inclusion of which would be doubtful.

Accepting this explanation as I do, I am of the
opinion that, were it not for the provisions of s. 309(2), the meaning
defined in s. 268(e) would be the only meaning attributable to the words
“false document” as used in Part VII of the Criminal Code , but that s.
309(2)  makes it plain that for the purpose of the offence of forgery, those
words include not only the making of a document which is false in the
manner defined in s. 268 (e), but also the making of a material
alteration in or addition to a document which is genuine. I do not think that
s. 309(2)  means any more or any less than this.

The meaning described in s. 309(2) does not, in
my opinion, exclude the primary meaning given to the words “false document” by
s. 268(e) (ii), but merely has the effect of enlarging the meaning of
the words so as to cover documents which might not otherwise be included.

In the case of Regina v. Chow Sik Wah and
Quon Hong, supra, which was relied on by the learned trial judge, the Court
of Appeal of Ontario made no reference to the definition contained in s. 268(e)(ii)
and I can only conclude that it was either disregarded or found to be
inapplicable to the circumstances of the case. In that case the accused
fabricated a letter purporting to be signed by a Canadian immigration official.
He had the

[Page 894]

letter photographed and the photograph was sent
to a friend in China to assist
him in securing entry into Hong Kong. It was held that the intention of the
accused with respect to the use of the photograph was the critical element in
proving that its production had been a forgery and Mr. Justice Kelly said:

…since the photograph, the alleged false
document, was not to be used as a genuine letter or was not intended to induce
anyone to believe it to be genuine, the action of the accused no matter how
reprehensible and how calculated to defraud someone would not constitute the
commission of forgery.

It thus appears that if it had been found that
the accused intended to induce anyone to believe that the photograph was a
genuine document he would have been found to have committed forgery. No such
question arises here. The forgery and uttering counts were taken from the jury
and the only issue now raised is whether they were capable of being forgeries
within the meaning of the Criminal Code .

It was further submitted on behalf of the
appellant that s. 268(e) (ii) should be interpreted by reference to s.
335(l) of the old Criminal Code , the relevant portion of which reads as
follows:

335. (l) ‘false document’ means

(i) a document, the whole or some material
part of which purports to be made by or on behalf of any person who did not
make or authorize the making thereof, or which, though made by, or by the
authority of the person who purports to make it, is falsely dated as to time or
place of making, where either is material, or…

(The italics are my own)

It was contended that this language adopted the
common law meaning of “false document” and that reference to the draft bill
submitted by the Royal Commission on the Revision of the Criminal Law in
February 1952 indicates that s. 268(e) is merely a rearrangement of the
language used in the former s. 335(l) (i), and does not afford any basis for
the suggestion that the common law of forgery is in any way affected or altered
by the new statute. Having regard to what was said in this Court in The
Attorney General of Canada

[Page 895]

v. Readers
Digest Association Canada Limited et al.[4],
per Cartwright J. (as he then was) at 786 and following, and by the House
of Lords in Assam Railways and Trading Company v. Commissioners of Inland
Revenue[5], I
cannot derive any assistance from the report of this Royal Commission or from
its terms of reference.

The situation is that s. 335(l) of the old Criminal
Code  (R.S.C. 1927, c. 36) was repealed by 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, and the
present s. 268(e) was substituted therefor. With the greatest
respect for those who may take a different view, I cannot subscribe to the
proposition that the wording of a section which Parliament has repealed
can be incorporated into the section which has been enacted to replace it
in such manner as to give to the contrasting language of the new
section the meaning and effect of the old one. The old section has
gone and can only be looked to as part of the legislative history and in order
to determine the purpose for which the new section was enacted.

In the case of Fraser v. The Minister of
National Revenue[6], the
Privy Council was considering the amendment of s. 5(1)(a) of the Income
War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 97, which changed the word “shall” to
“may”, and in the course of delivering the reasons for judgment, Lord Macmillan
had occasion to say of the amended and the amending sections at page 1125:

The contrast is pointed. When an amending
Act alters the language of the principal statute the alteration must be taken
to have been made deliberately.

I am, with respect, unable to regard the
language of s. 268(e) as nothing more than a reformulation of the
wording of s. 335(l) (i) of the old Code. In my opinion the wording of
s. 268(e) (ii) is plain and unambiguous and the task of the courts
is to give effect to it whether it results in a change in the common law
definition of forgery or not.

Therefore, the task is to determine whether
these inventory sheets were “false documents”

[Page 896]

within the definition contained in s. 268  (e)
of the Criminal Code . I am of the opinion that a document which is
false in reference to the very purpose for which the document was created is
certainly one which is false in a material particular. The inventory sheets
here in question contained false information as to the very matters which they
purported to certify and so were false in a number of material particulars and,
therefore, each was a “false document” within the meaning of Part VII of the Criminal
Code  which contains s. 309 .

It was further argued on behalf of the appellant
that s. 340  of the Criminal Code  makes it an offence to make a false
entry in a document with intent to defraud and that if full effect were given
to the definition in s. 268 (e) (ii) there would be duplication between
the offences created by s. 340  and s. 309 . This may well be so although the
question does not arise in the present case, but the matter is in any event, in
my view, one for Parliament and not for the courts.

In the case of Regina v. Hopkins and Collins[7], the Court of Criminal Appeal in England
had to consider the effect of the meaning of forgery under the Forgery Act 1913
as amended, in a case where the accused men had made false entries in a cash
book, and it was contended on their behalf that this was not an offence under
the common law of forgery. In the course of his reasons for judgment, Lord
Goddard, commenting on this submission by defense counsel at page 234, had this
to say:

The jury having convicted on these matters,
Mr. Cox submitted to the court that the offence amounted only to
falsification of accounts, with which the appellants were not charged, and did
not amount to forgery. He supported that argument by old cases, more especially
the case of WINDSOR, Re (1865) 6 B. & S. 522, but in the opinion of
the court we are only concerned now with the Forgery Act, 1913, as amended by
the Criminal Justice Act, 1925, because forgery is a statutory offence.
Parliament has laid down in the clearest possible way what amounts to forgery.
The Act starts in section 1 by saying: ‘(1) For the purposes of this Act,
forgery

[Page 897]

is the making of a false document in order
that it may be used as genuine.’ I think the prevalent opinion of the court is
that if a man has a cash book and proceeds to make false entries in it so that
it does not represent the truth and does not represent what he received and
what he paid out, that book is a false document, and it is made false by the
person who keeps it.

In conclusion Lord Goddard reverted to the submission
that the offence amounted only to falsification of accounts, saying:

For these reasons, although an indictment
might have been preferred under the Falsification of Accounts Act, the court
has come to the conclusion that the facts which were proved here and which must
have been accepted by the jury clearly fall within the words of the Forgery
Act, 1913. What might have been the position at common law, it is not necessary
for us to discuss. Forgery no longer depends on the common law, nor does it depend
on the Forgery Act, 1830 (rep.), or many other statutes which have been passed
from time to time. It depends simply on the statute of 1913 and, in the opinion
of the court, this case clearly falls within it.

Similarly, it can, in my opinion, be said in the
present case that forgery no longer depends on the common law nor does it
depend on the old Criminal Code . It depends simply on the present Code
and as I have indicated, I am of opinion that this case clearly falls within
it. My brother Laskin has pointed out that the case of Hopkins and Collins has
been the subject of critical comment by legal text book writers, but it was a
decision of five members of the Court of Criminal Appeal in England and I find their reasoning more
persuasive than that of the commentators.

In conclusion it was submitted on behalf of the
appellant that acquittal by the jury on a charge of fraud under s. 323  of the Criminal
Code  (count 1) was inconsistent with conviction with respect to the various
counts of forgery and uttering. In this regard I am content to adopt the
conclusion reached by Mr. Justice Aylesworth in the course of the reasons
for judgment which he rendered on behalf of the Court of Appeal where he said:

In particular, the acquittal on count 1
which was of obtaining money by fraud would not in any sense im-

[Page 898]

port an acquittal upon a charge of forgery
or of uttering. We are satisfied that the verdict of the jury had they been
properly charged on the counts in question would not necessarily have been an
acquittal.

For all these reasons I would dismiss this
appeal.

The judgment of Hall and Laskin JJ. was
delivered by

LASKIN J. (dissenting)—The accused,
appellant in this Court, was charged with one count of fraud, five counts of
forgery and five counts of uttering. He was tried before His Honour Judge Steen
and a jury in Metropolitan Toronto, and in the course of the trial a directed
verdict of acquittal was entered on four forgery counts (being counts 2, 4, 8
and 10) and on four associated uttering counts (being counts 3, 5, 9 and 11).
The case went to the jury on count 1 (fraud), and on counts 6 and 7 (forgery
and uttering respecting the same forged document), and a verdict of acquittal
was returned on all three counts. The Crown appealed only the acquittals on the
directed verdicts, its appeal was allowed, the verdicts of acquittal were set
aside and a new trial was directed on the eight counts involved in the appeal.
It is this order for a new trial that is alone in issue in this Court.

The charges against the accused arose out of the
alleged falsification by him of inventory sheets or records, which were
prepared in his writing, respecting the inventory on certain dates carried by
store 20 of The Becker Milk Company Limited’s extensive store system. The accused
was a principal in a firm that had a contract with the Becker Company to take
periodic inventories in its stores. Girls were hired by the accused’s firm to
count the stock items in the stores and to put the values on inventory slips.
These values were then entered on inventory sheets, and a copy of each went to
the Becker Company head office, one was left with the particular store manager
and one remained with the accused’s firm. The accused was in charge of this
exercise at store

[Page 899]

20 at the times specified in the charges. The
evidence showed that the sums recorded on the particular inventory sheets
exceeded those shown on the inventory slips for the same items.

In directing acquittals on the eight counts
above-mentioned, the trial judge accepted the contention of counsel for the
accused that none of the inventory sheets in question was a “false document” as
that term is used in and defined for the purposes of the forgery provisions of
the Criminal Code . He relied on the judgment of the Ontario Court of
Appeal in Regina v. Chow Sik Wah and Quon Hong[8], accepting it as binding upon him,
and, accordingly, he rejected the applicability of Regina v. Hopkins and
Collins[9], a
judgment of the English Court of Criminal Appeal. On the Crown’s appeal, the Ontario
Court of Appeal held that the trial judge was in error in relying on the cited
decision of that court, that it preferred English adjudication and that the
documents fell within s. 268(e) of the Criminel Code, which
defines “false document”. It also held that the jury acquittals on counts 1, 6
and 7 did not involve a disposition of the counts in appeal; and it held,
thirdly, that the accused could not invoke the “no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice” principle.

The three holdings of the Ontario Court of
Appeal constitute the grounds of appeal by the accused to this Court. On the
assumption that the accused fails on the first two points, I would not agree
that the right to order a new trial on the Crown’s appeal, as provided in s.
592(4)  (b) (ii) of the Criminal Code , should founder on the
principle that there was in any event “no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice” in the acquittals of the accused. This qualifying proviso, although no
longer expressly included in the Criminal Code  provisions for appeals by
the Crown, as it is in those governing appeals by an accused (see s. 592(1)  (b)
(iii)), may be given an analogical application within the scope of

[Page 900]

discretion conferred upon the provincial Court
of Appeal under s. 592(4) , especially having regard to the fact that the
Crown’s right of appeal from an acquittal is limited under s. 584(1) (a)
to questions of law alone.

That was the view taken in the New Brunswick
Court of Appeal in Regina v. Savoie[10]
and approved by the Nova Scotia Supreme Court en banc in Regina
v. Munster[11], and
I agree with it. The test proposed by Kerwin J. in White v. The King[12], when the “no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice” proviso applied expressly to appeals against acquittal
as well as to those against conviction, is, in my opinion, appropriate to the
analogical application of the proviso. It was put as follows: The onus is on
the Crown to satisfy the Court that the verdict would not necessarily have been
the same if the error of law had not been made. On this test, I agree with the
Court of Appeal that (assuming it to be right on the two issues of law) a new
trial was properly directed.

Turning to the two substantial grounds of
appeal, I deal first with the submission that the entry of false information on
the inventory sheets did not make them false documents for the purposes of the
forgery and uttering charges. Forgery is defined in s. 309  of the Criminal
Code , and subs. 1 and 2 thereof read as follows:

(1) Every one commits forgery who makes a false
document, knowing it to be false, with intent

(a) that it should in any way
be used or acted upon as genuine, to the prejudice of any one whether within
Canada or not, or

(b) that some person should
be induced, by the belief that it is genuine, to do or to refrain from doing
anything, whether within Canada
or not.

(2) Making a false document includes

(a) altering a genuine
document in any material part,

[Page 901]

(b) making a material
addition to a genuine document or adding to it a false date, attestation, seal
or other thing that is material, or

(c) making a material
alteration in a genuine document by erasure, obliteration, removal or in in any
other way…

Uttering is dealt with in s. 311 (1) in these
terms:

(1) Every one who, knowing that a document
is forged,

(a) uses, deals with, or acts
upon it, or

(b) causes or attempts to
cause any person to use, deal with, or act upon it,

as if the document were genuine, is guilty
of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years…

Central to proof of these offences is the
knowing use of a false document as if it were genuine. Central to this appeal
is the question whether the inventory sheets prepared by the accused are false
documents within s. 268 (e) (ii) of the Criminal Code ,

Section 268 (e) reads in full as
follows:

(e) “false document” means a
document

(i) the whole or some material part of
which purports to be made by or on behalf of a person

(A) who did not make it or authorize it to
be made, or

(B) who did not in fact exist;

(ii) that is made by or on behalf of the
person who purports to make it but is false in some material particular;

(iii) that is made in the name of an
existing person, by him or under his authority, with a fraudulent intention
that it should pass as being made by some person, real or fictitious, other
than the person who makes it or under whose authority it is made.

It is common ground that the relevant portion of
the definition in this case is s. 268 (e)(ii).

All the other provisions of s. 268 (e) are
mere rearrangements of the language found in the

[Page 902]

predecessor section of the old Criminal
Code , namely s. 335 (l). Section 268 (e)(ii) also draws on
language that was in s. 335 (l) (i) but goes beyond it, as a comparison with
that language reveals. The particular language of s. 335 (l) (i) is this:

or which, though made by, or by the
authority of the person who purports to make it, is falsely dated as to time or
place of making, where either is material…

It is plain to me that the falsity and
materiality connoted by the foregoing words have to do with the genuineness of
the document as such, in so far as it purports to be what it is not. The
question raised by the reformulation of the foregoing words into the more
expansive terms now found in s. 268 (e) (ii) is whether there has been a
change in the law of forgery to include within it not only documents whose
genuineness as such is in issue but also those that are genuine enough in
themselves but have recorded on them false information.

There are, in my opinion, cogent reasons for
concluding that no such drastic change in the law of forgery was accomplished.
Section 268 (e) in its present form is the result of the work of the
Royal Commission on the Revision of the Criminal Law which reported on February 22, 1952, and submitted its revision in
the form of a draft Bill. Under it, the proposed s. 268 (e) is
shown, in a concordance table, as the then existing s. 335(l), a fact
which is evident from simple comparison. The Royal Commission’s terms of
reference were, inter alia, to rearrange provisions and Parts, to seek
to simplify by omitting and combining provisions, to adopt uniform language and
to revise ambiguous and unclear provisions. In the main, as its Report shows,
the Royal Commission rearranged and consolidated. There is no indication that
anything new was contemplated in respect of forgery.

Again, “false document” is defined in s. 268 (e)
only for the purpose of the forgery provisions of s. 309 , and the conception of
genuineness is basic to the offence according to the very terms in which the
offence is defined. The contrast is with counterfeit character or with imita-

[Page 903]

tion of the character of a document, and not
with whether it embodies false information that does not go to its character as
a document. As it is put in Kenny’s Outlines of Criminal Law (19th ed.
1966), at p. 387 “a writing is not a forgery when it merely contains statements
which are false, but only when it falsely purports to be itself that
which it is not”.

Finally, on this point, I draw attention to s.
340  of the Criminal Code  which makes it an offence to make a false entry
in a document with intent to defraud. The accused was not charged under this
section which would appear to be the one appropriate to the mere
falsification of records where the purport of the records as such is not
affected. There is no reason, either in history or in text, to turn such
falsifications into a new kind of forgery by virtue of s. 268 (e) (ii),
and so obliterate the distinction between the two offences.

The distinction between these two offences
emerged in an interesting way in Ex parte Windsor[13],
which concerned an extradition treaty between Great
 Britain and the United States covering, inter alia, forgery, which was not, however,
defined. A bank clerk in New York, who had made false entries in books of the bank to conceal
embezzlements, was arrested in England, and his extradition was sought under the treaty because of a New York statute which declared the offence
to be forgery in the third degree. Extradition was refused on the ground that
the alleged offence (similar to that under s. 340  aforementioned) was not
forgery under English law. It was in this case that Blackburn J. made his well‑known
statement that

Forgery is the false making of an
instrument purporting to be that which it is not; it is not the making of an
instrument which purports to be what it really is, but which contains false
statements. Telling a lie does not become a forgery because it is reduced into
writing.

This does not mean that a person cannot be
guilty of forgery when he executes a document in his own name. The question is
whether in doing so

[Page 904]

he has also made a false document in the sense
of giving it an apparent operation or effect which is untrue (but without
regard otherwise to the truth or falsity of the statements in it). This is what
was aimed at by the language, already quoted, of the concluding part of s.
335(l) (i) of the predecessor Criminal Code . An application of this
proposition may be found in Rex v. Wells[14], where the false back-dating of a deed of
settlement to obtain an income tax advantage was held to make the deed a false
document for the purposes of a prosecution for uttering a forged deed.

Antedating a later deed to defeat a prior grant
was similarly held to be a forgery in the earlier case of Regina v. Ritson[15]. There Kelly C.B. put the principle
in the following words (at p. 356):

…looking at the ancient authorities and the
textbooks of the highest repute such as Com. Dig., Bacon’s Abr., 3 Co. Inst,
and Sir Michael Foster, they are all uniformly to the effect, not that every
instrument containing a false statement is a forgery, but that every instrument
which is false in a material part, and which purports to be that which it is
not, or to be executed by a person who is not the real person, or which
purports to be dated on a day which is not the real day, whereby a false
operation is given to it, is a forgery.

It is worth recalling that the English law on
the subject was codified in Stephen’s draft code in 1878 and this codification,
reflected also in the first and second draft Bills proposed for enactment by
the British Parliament (see s. 315(a) of the draft Bill of 1879 and s.
610(b) of the draft Bill of 1880) came into the first Canadian Criminal
Code of 1892. The relevant provision was s. 421(a), which is in
the very language that carried down to the current revision that gave us s.
268 (e) (ii). In Taschereau’s Criminal Code  (1893), the following passage
from the Fifth Report of the English Criminal Law Commissioners (1840) is found
at pp. 490-1:

Where the instrument is forged, as where a
certificate purporting to be signed by an authorized

[Page 905]

officer was not, in truth, signed by him, a
party to whom it is shown is deceived in being induced to suppose that the fact
certified is accredited by the officer whose certificate it purports to be, and
he is deceived in that respect whether the fact certified be true or false. If,
on the other hand, such a certificate be in truth signed by the officer whose name
it bears, the instrument is not forged although the fact certified be falsely
certified, for here the party receiving the certificate is deceived, not by
being falsely induced to believe that the officer had accredited the instrument
by his signature, but from the officer having falsely certified the fact. The
instrument may, therefore, be forged although the fact authenticated be true.
The instrument may be genuine although the fact stated be false.

I need not speculate on what matters other than
false dating as to time or place are now comprehended within s. 268 (e)
(ii). I repeat that I do not regard its rearranged and generalized language as
involving a departure from the principle underlying the provision which it
replaced.

I have considered Regina v. Hopkins and
Collins[16], decided
under the English Forgery Act, 1913, as amended by the Criminal Justice Act,
1925, and do not find it persuasive. It has not escaped home criticism (see Kenny,
op. cit., at p. 388), and the facts show that there were subsequent
alterations of the entries originally made in the cash book. In the present
case, there is no evidence of any alteration of the information originally
recorded on the inventory sheets.

Crown counsel argued alternatively that the
inventory sheets were “false documents” within s. 268 (e) (ii)
because they embody a certification of the figures shown on them; and he
submitted, in the further alternative, that they became “false documents”
because of the breach of contract and excess of authority by reason of the
accused increasing the amounts taken from the inventory slips. These
alternatives do not change the relevant facts and they do not meet the legal
requirements which I hold are involved in s. 268 (e) (ii).

I would, accordingly, on this ground allow the appeal,
set aside the order for a new trial, and

[Page 906]

restore the directed verdicts of acquittal on
the eight counts in question. In these circumstances, I refrain from
considering the second main submission involving the law respecting
inconsistent verdicts and res judicata. I would leave open the question
of their applicability to the situation presented here by the acquittals on
counts 1, 6 and 7.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Non-capital murder—Jury
trial—Judge’s instruction to the jury—Comments on accused failure to
testify—Testimony of accomplice—Substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice—Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 307, s. 4(5)—Criminal Code ,
1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 202A(3), 206(2), 592(1)(b)(iii).

The appellant was found guilty by a jury of
non-capital murder. His appeal was dismissed by a unanimous decision of the
Court of Appeal. He was granted leave to appeal to this Court and limited his
grounds of appeal to the two grievances concerning the judge’s address to the
jury to which the Court of Appeal devoted its attention, namely: (a) comments
on the accused’s failure to testify, and (b) failure to give the necessary
instructions regarding testimony by an accomplice.

Held (Hall and
Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux
C.J. and Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.: The language used by the
trial judge was a statement of an accused’s right not to testify, rather than a
comment on his failure to do so. The instructions cannot be construed as
prejudicial to the accused or such as to suggest to the jurors that his silence
was used to cloak his guilt.

[Page 651]

Even if the remarks may be construed in a
manner contrary to the provisions of s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence
Act , no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred, and the
verdict would necessarily have been the same had the judge not made them. In
view of the record this is a case where the provisions of s. 592(1)  may
validly be applied.

As to the trial judge’s failure to instruct
the jury on an accomplice’s testimony, the Court of Appeal has rightly found
that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred.

Per Hall and
Spence JJ., dissenting: The trial judge was in breach of s. 4(5)  of
the Canada Evidence Act  and the provisions of s. 592(1) (b)(iii)
cannot be used to dismiss the appeal. The decision of McConnell and Beer v.
The Queen, [1968] S.C.R. 802, does not apply on either point. It could not
be said that a jury properly instructed could reasonably come to no other
conclusion than that the appellant was guilty.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of
Queen’s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec1, affirming the appellant’s
conviction for non-capital murder. Appeal dismissed, Hall and Spence JJ.
dissenting.

J.P. Ste-Marie, Q.C., for the appellant.

Bruno Pateras, for the respondent.

The judgment of Fauteux C.J. and of Mart-land,
Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The appellant was found guilty
by a jury presided by Cousineau J., of having, in Montreal, on November 25,
1965, unlawfully caused the death of Madeleine Legault, thereby committing the
crime of non-capital murder described in the provisions of ss. 202A(3)  and
206(2)  of the Criminal Code .

Avon appealed from this verdict, and his appeal
was dismissed by a unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal[1], then composed of Tremblay C.J. and Casey,
Rinfret, Owen and Montgomery JJ. The Court, stating that all other

[Page 652]

grounds of appeal were ill-founded, devoted its
attention to two grievances concerning the judge’s address to the jury, namely:
(i) comments on the accused’s failure to testify, and (ii) failure to give the
necessary instructions regarding testimony by an accomplice. It was decided, on
the one hand, that the remarks by the trial judge complained of did not violate
the provisions of s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act , and that they
could not be taken as a prejudicial comment, such as to justify an order for a
new trial. On the other hand, it was considered that the judge erred in law in
omitting to instruct the jury as to the testimony of an accomplice; judging,
however, that on the record, a reasonable jury legally instructed on this point
would necessarily have found the accused guilty of non-capital murder and
pointing out that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred,
the appeal was dismissed as authorized by the provisions of s. 592(1)  (b)
(iii).

The appellant was later granted leave to appeal
from this judgment to this Court.

Let us summarize the evidence as to the facts
surrounding the death of Madeleine Legault. Early in the afternoon of November
25, 1965, the appellant, Robert Avon, accompanied by Henri Latulipe, went to
Madeleine Legault’s apartment. They found her there, with a friend, Nelson
Laliberté. The four spent part of the afternoon there drinking, in large
quantity, some of them wine and the others beer. A dispute eventually broke out
between Avon and the victim. Words were exchanged: Avon accused Madeleine
Legault of being a “stool”, and she called him a “bastard.” Laliberté told her
to shut up and, as she continued, he slapped her. Avon hit her and punched her
to the floor. He bent over her and continued to strike her with his fists and
feet.—According to Latulipe, Laliberté, who denies this, was also striking the
victim at this point.—The latter, who was bleeding from the lower part of her
face and her nose, begged Avon to stop; Laliberté and Latulipe asked Avon to
stop, but he continued. When he finally ceased hitting her, Laliberté and
Latulipe put the victim on her bed, where the three men eventually abandoned
her and left the apartment. According to Latulipe, she was no longer speaking
and was gasping. At

[Page 653]

six o’clock that afternoon, police officers
found her dead in her bed. At about seven o’clock, Dr. Valcourt, a
pathologist, went to the apartment and certified the death, which he put at
between 3 and 4 o’clock that afternoon. The nature of the recent wounds
observed by him on the victim’s body confirms the evidence that she had been
savagely beaten that afternoon. The doctor attributed death to the fact that
she inhaled blood while she was unconscious due to a meningeal hemorrhage
caused by blows inflicted on her head.

At the outset of the hearing before this Court,
counsel for the appellant stated that he would limit his grounds of appeal to
the two grievances to which the Court of Appeal devoted its attention.

As to the first, based on s. 4(5)  of the Canada
Evidence Act , these are the passages complained of in appellant’s factum,
and reported at pages 126 and 136 of the joint case:

[TRANSLATION] The accused did not testify.
Evidently, he could have done so. He is not obliged to do so. I must tell you
immediately, because it is better to say it, it is not because the accused did
not testify that you should believe that he could be guilty. His absence from
the witness box, the fact that he did not testify and did not call any
witnesses, has nothing to do with the trial. Because you will have to come to
your decision only on the well-established principle that the Crown must prove
and establish the guilt of the accused.

* *
*

Actually, you have merely the Crown’s
evidence. The defense did not call witnesses, and the accused did not testify:
he did not have to. It is up to the Crown to prove its case.

Section 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act  provides
that:

4. (5) The failure of the person charged,
or of the wife or husband of such person, to testify, shall not be made the
subject of comment by the judge, or by counsel for the prosecution.

As is known, there is a similar provision,
applying to counsel for the prosecution and not the judge, contained in
s. 1(b) of the imperial statute The

[Page 654]

Criminel Evidence Act (1898), 61-62 Vict., c. 36. In Ross v. Boyd[2], it was held regarding this
provision that:

The object of the Criminal Evidence Act was,
while conferring on the accused the right to give evidence, to prevent his
suffering prejudice—if he did not choose to exercise the right—by the
prosecutor commenting upon his failure to give evidence.

and the judge added:

…there was no authority for the proposition
that such comment was in all cases a reason for quashing the conviction.

The real meaning, intention and spirit of the
provisions of s. 4(5) of our Evidence Act were recently considered
by this Court in McConnell and Beer v. Her Majesty the Queen[3]. Expressing the views of the
majority, Ritchie J. stated, as set out in the headnote to the decision:

This section was enacted for the
protection of accused persons against the danger of having their right not to
testify presented to the jury in such fashion as to suggest that their silence
is being used as a cloak for their guilt. It would be “most naive” to ignore
the fact that when an accused fails to testify, there must be at least some
jurors who say to themselves, “if he didn’t do it, why didn’t he say so.” It is
for this reason that it is of the greatest importance that a trial judge should
remain unhampered in his right to point out to the jury that there is no onus
on the accused to prove his innocence by going into the witness box. To
construe s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act  as interfering with
that right not to testify would be contrary to the purpose of the
section itself.

I do not think I should add to our colleague’s
comments, regarding the cases The King v. McLean[4], Kelly v. The King[5], Bigaouette v. The King[6] and Wright v. The King[7]. However, relying on the concise and
accurate distinction made

[Page 655]

by Ritchie J. in McConnell and Beer, supra, I
would say that the language used by Cousineau J. is a “statement” of an
accused’s right not to testify, rather than a “comment” on his failure to do
so. In my opinion, the instructions complained of cannot be construed as
prejudicial to the accused or such as to suggest to the jurors that his silence
was used to cloak his guilt. On the contrary, by telling them, as stated above:
“His absence from the witness box, the fact that he did not testify and did not
call any witnesses, has nothing to do with the trial,” the learned judge, in a
manner favourable to the accused, set aside the acknowledged right of any judge
of the fact—judge or jury—to consider whether the evidence produced by the
prosecution is such that, in the absence of explanation or contradiction, it
can validly justify a conviction. Undoubtedly, the Crown retains the burden of
proof at all times, right to the end of the trial. It does not follow, however,
that one should confuse the two meanings and the significance which doctrine
and jurisprudence (see especially Latour v. The King[8]) assign to the expression “burden of
proof,” and which Phipson on Evidence, 8th ed., explains as follows, at
page 27:

As applied to judicial proceedings, the
phrase “burden of proof” has two distinct and frequently confused meanings: (1)
The burden of proof as a matter of law and pleading—the burden, as it has been
called, or establishing a case, whether by preponderance of evidence, or
beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) The burden of proof in the sense of introducing
evidence… So in criminal cases, even where the second, or the minor burden
of introducing evidence is cast upon or shifted to the accused, yet the major
one of satisfying the jury of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is always
upon the prosecution and never changes; and if, on the whole case, they have
such a doubt, the accused is entitled to the benefit of it and must be
acquitted.

Even if the remarks complained of by appellant
may be construed in a manner contrary to the provisions of s. 4(5)  of the Canada
Evidence Act , I would say that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice occurred, and that the

[Page 656]

verdict would necessarily have been the same had
the judge not made them. In view of the record, I am of the opinion, as was
held by the Court of Appeal, that this is a case where the provisions of
s. 592(1) may validly be applied. While it must be admitted that the applicability
of these provisions to cases of an infringement of s. 4(5)  may have in the
past given rise to a jurisprudence somehow lacking in uniformity, that should
no longer be so. Indeed, we are bound by the judgment of this Court in McConnell
and Beer, supra, where at the end of his reasons, Ritchie J. said:

As I do not consider that the remarks made
by the learned trial judge concerning the accused’s right to keep silent were
obnoxious to the statutory direction contained in s. 4(5)  of the Canada
Evidence Act , I would dismiss this appeal on that ground, but I am in any
event satisfied that even if they could have been so construed, they could not
have had any effect upon the outcome in the present case.

This conclusion contains the two reasons on
which dismissal of the appeal was based, and the second of these necessarily
involves application of the provisions of s. 592(1) in cases where there
is a breach of s. 4(5) . With all due respect for the contrary opinion, the
second reason should not be held as obiter dictum. On this aspect of the
matter, the principle stated in London Jewellers, Ltd. v. Attenborough[9] is to be applied:

We are not entitled to pick out the first
reason as the ratio decidendi of the case and neglect the second, or to
pick out the second reason as the ratio decidendi and neglect the first;
we must take both as forming the ground of the judgment.

As far as the second grievance raised by
appellant is concerned, namely the trial judge’s failure to instruct the jury
on an accomplice’s testimony, Owen J. speaking on behalf of all his colleagues
on the Court of Appeal, stated:

However, after considering the record I am
of the opinion that a reasonable jury, after being properly

[Page 657]

directed, would necessarily have found the
Appellant guilty of non-capital murder. Therefore, I think this is a case for
the application of the provisions of Section 592(l)(b)(iii) Cr. C. In my
opinion no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred by reason
of the defective charge with respect to accomplices.

I respectfully agree with these views, and would
only add this passage taken from the reasons of Sloan C.J. in The Queen v.
Pavlukoff[10]:

…the fact that accused did not testify in
the face of inculpatory facts was a matter which the Court of Appeal could
place on the scale in applying s. 1014(2).

For all these reasons, I would dismiss the
appeal.

The judgment of Hall and Spence JJ. was
delivered by

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Province of Quebec[11] pronounced on March 28, 1969. The Court of
Appeal of the Province of Quebec affirmed the conviction of the appellant on a
charge of non-capital murder contrary to s. 202A(3)  of the Criminal
Code .

In his notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal,
the appellant raised a large number of grounds of appeal and in this Court
pursued two of them. I find it necessary to deal with only one ground and I
express no opinion on the other ground of appeal urged.

It was submitted for the appellant that on two
occasions in his charge to the jury the learned trial judge commented on the
fact that the appellant had not testified in his defence and that that comment
is, therefore, a breach of s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C.
1952, c. 307. That subsection is very brief. I quote it in full:

4. (5) The failure of the person charged,
or of the wife or husband of such person, to testify, shall not be made the
subject of comment by the judge, or by counsel for the prosecution.

[Page 658]

Almost at the beginning of the charge delivered
by the learned trial judge, he said in paragraph 4:

[TRANSLATION] There is also one principle
which you must keep before you, an essential principle, that it is always up to
the Crown to establish the guilt of the accused. This means that when the
accused comes before his peers, namely before you, he is presumed innocent. It
was up to the Crown to adduce evidence to substantiate the crime with which he
is charged, to establish that it was committed by him. In other words, the
Crown always has the burden of proof, never the accused; and this leads me to
embark upon an immediate digression. The accused did not testify. Evidently, he
could have done so. He is not obliged to do so. I must tell you immediately,
because it is better to say it, it is not because the accused did not testify
that you should believe that he could be guilty. His absence from the witness
box, the fact that he did not testify and did not call any witnesses, has
nothing to do with the trial. Because you will have to come to your decision
only on the well-established principle that the Crown must prove and establish
the guilt of the accused.

Again, almost at the end of the charge, the
learned trial judge said:

[TRANSLATION] Gentlemen, you have heard two
witnesses. There were three persons in this adventure. I am not saying in the
adventure of the beating, but there were three persons in on the drinking. The
Crown stresses that to be fair to all concerned, I think the defence would
agree, this is a question which may be of interest in their evidence on the
question of the witnesses’ credibility. This means that if by taking account of
the fact that these persons were there, you can decide whether their evidence
is interested—could they have an interest in telling or not telling the truth?
You will have to consider this. On the other hand, the fact that a person was
on the scene of the crime does not mean that he has a reason for not telling
the truth. There again, I stress that you are free to believe them or not. That
is your privilege. Before disbelieving someone, however, you must reflect
carefully and consider whether the witness in question had an interest in
lying. Actually, you have merely the Crown’s evidence. The defence did not call
witnesses, and the accused did not testify: he did not have to. It is up to the
Crown to prove its case. You have what evidence there is; you must accept it.
If you come to the conclusion that the witnesses were not speak-

[Page 659]

ing the truth, that is another matter. You
must be convinced, the evidence must prove to you that the accused struck the
blow. If you don’t believe the witnesses—there were two witnesses, Laliberté
and Latulippe—do you have any reason to reject them? That will be up to you to
decide. Personally, I do not see any reason. The decision rests with you. Are
they interested? Finally, did they have any reason for not telling the truth?
That will be for you to decide. I do not see any special reason. It is well to
point this out to you, it has been brought to your attention. This is not a
case of a witness passing by on the street, who is totally independent. You can
ask yourselves, “Did they have any special reason for lying, for not telling
the truth?”

The question with which I am concerned is
whether the learned trial judge in either of the portions of the charge which I
have quoted above was in breach of the said s. 4(5)  of the Canada
Evidence Act  and if he were so in breach then may the provisions of
s. 592(1)  (b) (iii) be used to dismiss the appeal despite such
error in law.

Counsel for the respondent Attorney General
urges the decision of this court in McConnell and Beer v. The Queen[12], where, again, both of the issues
were considered. There is, however, considerable question as to whether the
decision in McConnell and Beer v. The Queen may be applied to the
facts in the present case and it is necessary, in order to come to a conclusion
thereon, to examine very carefully the circumstances both in that case and in
the present one. In the former case, the two accused men had been arrested
under most incriminating circumstances. The accused Beer gave to the police, at
the time of his arrest, a statement in which he sought to explain the presence
in the automobile at the wheel of which he sat of various instruments which were,
no doubt, instruments of housebreaking and the accused McConnell similarly
explained his presence outside the car under an open window of a nearby dry
cleaning establishment. Neither accused gave evidence but their counsel during
cross-examination of the constable who was called as a Crown witness elicited
these statements from the constable. After the learned trial

[Page 660]

judge had delivered his charge to the jury to
which no exception could be taken on the issue presently under consideration,
counsel for the accused submitted:

Your Honour, you said when referring to the
explanation of Mr. McConnell that the statement was not made under oath,
and you said it is up to you to decide, was he there for that reason only. I
believe it is not incumbent upon the accused to prove that was the only reason.
The onus would be on the Crown to prove that that was not the only reason.

The objection of counsel as stated to the
learned trial judge was based on a sentence in the charge of the learned trial
judge which sentence was as follows:

The explanations of Mr. Beer were not
made under oath and you do not have to accept them. Consider the circumstances
under which they were made and then decide. If you have any reasonable doubt,
then you must give the accused the benefit of the doubt.

It will be seen that neither the sentence in the
charge to which counsel for the accused objected nor the actual objection
submitted by that counsel dealt with any statement as to the failure of the
accused to give evidence.

The learned trial judge, however, then recharged
the jury in these words:

Gentlemen of the jury, it was pointed out
that in the course of my charge to you I stated that you did not have to accept
the explanations of the accused because those explanations were not made under
oath. You are not to take it from that that there is any onus upon the accused
to prove their innocence by going into the witness box and testifying in their
defence. There is no such onus on these or any accused persons in any criminal
trial of proving their innocence by going into the witness box and testifying
in their own defence. You are not to be influenced in your decision by either
of the accused not going into the witness box and testifying, but the Court
does point out that these explanations were given and when made were not made
under oath and it is not only for that reason alone, but for any number of
reasons that may occur to you, to decide if you will accept those explanations.

[Page 661]

Mr. Justice Ritchie, in giving judgment for
the majority of this Court, was of the opinion that the paragraph last above
quoted did not amount to a comment contrary to the provisions of s. 4(5) 
of the Canada Evidence Act . This was the conclusion reached by the
majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario and expressed in the reasons of
Mr. Justice Evans for that Court. Mr. Justice Ritchie said at
p. 809:

Here the language used by the trial judge
to which objection is taken was not so much a “comment” on the failure of the
persons charged to testify as a statement of their right to refrain from doing
so, and it does not appear to me that it should be taken to have been the
intention of Parliament in enacting s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act  to
preclude judges from explaining to juries the law with respect to the rights of
accused persons in this regard.

It must be remembered that what the learned
trial judge was commenting on in both his original charge and in the recharge
was not the failure of the accused to give evidence but that the counsel for
the accused was advancing as the defence of that accused a statement made by
the accused persons not under oath and made to the constable at the time of
their arrest. It is true that perhaps by accident there slipped into his
recharge on three occasions the phrase “by going into the witness box and
testifying in their defence”. The whole purport of both the charge and the
recharge, however, was not a comment on failure to testify but rather a comment
on the urging of a defence not supported by sworn testimony given either on
behalf of the Crown or the accused. Mr. Justice Ritchie, in coming to his
conclusion, in my opinion, relied on two previous decisions of this Court:
firstly, Kelly v. The King[13]
and secondly, Wright v. The King[14].

In the Kelly case, again the accused had
not given evidence but he had been permitted to address that jury after the end
of the Crown’s case and in doing so made a number of state-

[Page 662]

ments of fact. The trial judge, in his charge,
had pointed out that such a method was not the one by which a defence could be
adduced but that the jury was entitled to the guarantee of an oath before they
should consider the statements made by the accused in such a fashion. Kelly
v. The King came to this Court on an appeal from the judgment of the
Court of Appeal of Manitoba upon a case reserved by Mr. Justice
Prendergast, the presiding judge at the trial. The fifteenth question submitted
upon such reserved case was:

15. Was I right in my comments upon the
statement of the accused to the jury, with respect to it not being made under
oath, and, if so, was this prejudicial to a fair trial of the accused or a
violation of the “Canada Evidence Act ?”

Idington J. said at p. 246:

As I gather from the learned judge’s charge
he felt he had erred and tried to rectify it by pointing out that statements of
the accused in an address are not evidence and are not to be treated as such.
He would have erred if he had failed under such circumstances in making plain
as he did the law on the subject.

Duff J., as he then was, said at p. 259:

As to the first of these grounds I
can find nothing which, when fairly construed, amounts to such comment within
the meaning of the statutory prohibition.

And Anglin J., as he then was, said at
p. 263:

There was no comment whatever on the
failure of the accused to testify. His right to do so was not mentioned during
the trial. The learned judge merely discharged his duty in warning the jury
against treating the statement which he had allowed the accused to make as the
equivalent of sworn testimony.

I am, therefore, of the opinion that Kelly v.
The King falls within exactly the same class as McConnell and Beer v.
The Queen. Both hold that a warning to the jury that they should not
consider as evidence unsworn statements made by the accused person, in the
former in his address following the Crown’s case and in the latter

[Page 663]

in statements made to a constable at the time of
arrest, was not a breach of s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act . In
my view, warnings to the jury that they must depend, in arriving at their
verdict, upon sworn evidence are very different from a statement to the jury
that the accused has not given evidence in his own defence.

In Wright v. The King, Chief
Justice Rinfret, referring to Rex v. Gallagher[15], said at p. 326:

We have nothing of the kind here. The
accused appellant was no where mentioned in those portions of the charge which
are objected to. In the last two paragraphs above mentioned the only statement
in the charge is that the evidence of the victim is “the only evidence we
have”; and, as to the first statement: “her evidence is not denied”, the
learned Judge no doubt was referring there to the fact that, in the course of
Mrs. Bosnia’s evidence, she said that on her way back to Halifax she had
told Mr. Bell that she had been attacked and Mr. Bell confirmed that;
also that when she reached her house she had told Mrs. Marriott that she
had been mistreated and had described such mistreatment by saying that the
appellant “had tried to rape her” and “she said that he did”. Not only was that
not denied, but it was confirmed by Mrs. Marriott.

We think the Bigaouette case, [1927]
S.C.R. 112, certainly goes as far on that subject as this Court would care to
go and, like the majority of the Court of Appeal, we are unable to find that
the remarks here complained of could have any effect on the jury as being a
comment “obnoxious to the statutory direction”.

Again, what was being considered was not a
direct statement by the trial judge that the accused had not testified in his
own defence but statements made by the trial judge that certain evidence was
not denied when at least part of that evidence could have been denied by others
than the accused. As to the comments of the Chief Justice, “we think the Bigaouette
case certainly goes as far on that subject as this court would care to
go…”, it must be pointed out that Chief Justice Rinfret was a member of the
Court

[Page 664]

in the Bigaouette case and that he
concurred in the judgment given for the Court by Duff J., as he then was.

My personal view is that the comments of the
Chief Justice in the Wright case in reference to the Bigaouette case
may be applied with equal force to decisions in both the Wright case and
the McConnell and Beer case so that neither of those cases should be
extended to apply to such situations as the present one where there was a
direct and repeated statement by the learned trial judge that the accused had
failed to testify. I am of the opinion, on the other hand, that that situation
is covered by the decision of this Court in Bigaouette v. The King[16], where Duff J., as he then was,
gave a very short judgment dealing with a charge in which the learned trial
judge had said. I here translate and summarize: Doctor Marois has made an
autopsy and he has declared that death occurred by six or seven o’clock in the
morning. You see the circumstances which surrounded the death of the deceased.
If the death, my friends, occurred at six o’clock or seven o’clock in the
morning, the accused was at that moment present in the house for, by his own
statement, he had not left until eight o’clock in the morning. He was alone
with his mother in the house when death came and if the accused were alone with
his mother when she was killed the defence would be able to explain by whom
this murder had been committed.

Duff J. said at p. 114:

It seems to be reasonably clear that,
according to the interpretation which would appear to the jury as the more
natural and probable one, the comment implied in this passage upon the failure
of la défense to explain who committed the murder would, having regard
to the circumstances emphasized by the learned trial judge, be this, namely,
that it related to the failure of the accused to testify upon that subject at
the trial. It is conceivable, of course, that such language might be understood
as relating to a failure to give an explanation to police officers or others;
but the language of the charge is so easily and naturally capable of being
understood in the other way, that it seems plainly obnoxious to the
enactment referred to, subs. 5 of s. 4, R.S.C., c.

[Page 665]

145. The law, in our opinion, is correctly
stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Stuart in Rex v. Gallagher
(1922) 37 Can, Cr.C . 83, in these words:

…it is not what the judge intended but what
his words as uttered would convey to the minds of the jury which is the
decisive matter. Even if the matter were evenly balanced, which I think it is
not, and the language used were merely just as capable of the one meaning as
the other, the position would be that the jury would be as likely to take the
words in the sense in which it was forbidden to use them as in the innocuous
sense and in such circumstances I think the error would be fatal.

(The underlining is my own.)

It will be seen that Duff J., as he then was,
interpreted the words of the charge to be a direct comment on the failure of
the accused to give evidence. The words, of course, were not nearly so direct,
final and without equivocation as the words used in the present charge, and certainly
I am of the opinion that if Duff J., as he then was, considered the comments in
Bigaouette as being contra to what he described in the case as “the
imperative direction of subs. (5) of s. 4  of the Canada Evidence Act  then
the statement made by the learned trial judge in the present case is even more
plainly a breach of the said subsection. Nor is this conclusion affected by the
suggestion that the learned trial judge was only doing what he was entitled to
do and what he should do, that is, to give to the jury the ruling that the
whole burden of proof was on the Crown and that the accused need prove nothing.
The learned trial judge had so instructed the jury in the first part of the
charge which I have quoted above and had done so in an appropriate manner and
in a manner well nigh traditional. With respect, however, he left that
discharge of a proper duty and clearly infringed the provisions of the
subsection of the Canada Evidence Act  when he continued, saying,
“and that leads me to embark upon an immediate digression. The accused has not
testified. Of course, he could have done so. He is not obliged to do so.” Those
words, as I have pointed out above, were said at the opening of the charge.
They were not required as any ex-

[Page 666]

planation of the duty of the jury to only base
their verdict upon sworn testimony and, in my view, they constituted “a failure
to observe the imperative directions of subs. (5) of s. 4  of the Canada
Evidence Act ”.

The second question is if, as I believe, the
learned trial judge was in breach of subs. (5) of s. 4  of the Canada
Evidence Act , may the provisions of s. 592(1)  (b) (iii)
of the Criminal Code  be applied thereto to result in the dismissal of
the appeal on the ground that despite the error in law no substantial miscarriage
of justice occurred. The majority of this Court in the McConnell and Beer case
were of the opinion that such a course was available to this Court and to the
Court of Appeal from whence the appeal had come. Since the majority of this
Court had already determined that the comment in question in the McConnell
and Beer case had not been a comment contra to the provisions of the Canada
Evidence Act , I am of the opinion that their view in reference to the
applicability of s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Code was obiter.
However, for the present case, I am ready to accept that obiter as being
the statement of the law. I must point out, however, that the only effect of
such a view is that it is possible to use the provisions of the said
subsection of the Code not that those provisions should be used in all
cases. On the other hand, each case must be carefully examined in order to
determine whether or not the Court should avail itself of the provisions set
out in s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Code.

In Colpitts v. The Queen[17], I dealt with the test which must
be applied to determine whether the subsection can be used and said:

Therefore, this Court must apply the test
set out in the aforesaid cases and, to quote again from Brooks v. The
King, [1927] S.C.R. 633,

The onus is upon the Crown to satisfy the
Court that the jury, charged as it should have been,

[Page 667]

could not, as reasonable men, have done
otherwise than find the appellant guilty.

Cartwright J., as he then was, said at
p. 744:

A number of authorities which should guide
the Court of Appeal in deciding whether, misdirection having been shewn, it can
safely be affirmed that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has
occurred are quoted in the reasons of my brother Spence. Upon reading these it
will be observed that, once error in law has been found to have occurred at the
trial, the onus resting upon the Crown is to satisfy the Court that the verdict
would necessarily have been the same if such error had not occurred.

And Ritchie J., at p. 745, agreed to an
application of the test which had been established by the authorities to which
I had referred. Let us, therefore, apply that test to the circumstances in the
present case.

The slaying was committed in a room in which
four persons were present: the deceased woman, the accused and the two
witnesses, Latulippe and Laliberté. All four of those persons had consumed
alcohol very heavily. The two persons who gave evidence at the trial were
Latulippe and Laliberté. Their evidence certainly implicated the accused very
strongly but the evidence of one of the witnesses contradicted the other and
involved that other albeit in a rather minor fashion. The slaying having been
committed, the three persons, the accused, Laliberté and Latulippe left the
premises and continued their drinking. Now how could it be said that a jury
properly instructed, that is, without it having been pointed out to them by the
learned trial judge that the accused had not given evidence in his own defence,
could reasonably come to no other conclusion than that the accused was guilty?
Surely a jury could as reasonably have said “How can we convict upon the
contradictory evidence of these two persons both of whom were intoxicated and
both of whom certainly were interested in the outcome of the trial in which one
of the three persons alone was accused of the crime whether or not those
persons were, in law, accomplices?”. I note that as early as in Allen v.

[Page 668]

The King[18], Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J., in reasons expressly concurred in by
Duff J., as he then was, said at pp. 339 and 340:

I cannot agree that the effect of the
section is to do more than, as I said before, give the judges on an appeal
a discretion which they may be trusted to exercise only where the illegal
evidence or other irregularities are so trivial that it may safely be assumed
that the jury was not influenced by it. If there is any doubt as to this the
prisoner must get the benefit of that doubt propter favorem vitœ. To say
that we are in this case charged with the duty of deciding the extent to which
the improperly admitted evidence may have influenced some of the jurors would
be to hold, as I have already said, that Parliament authorized us to deprive
the accused in a capital case of the benefit of a trial by jury.

For these reasons, I am of the opinion that
s. 592(1) (b) (iii) should not be used in the present case. I would
therefore allow the appeal and direct a new trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA
SCOTIA, APPEAL DIVISION

Criminal law—Trade offences—Conspiracy to
unduly lessen competition—Elements of offence—Admissibility of evidence of
public benefit—“Undue”, “Unduly”—Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-23, s.32(1)(c).

Appellants, 73 insurance companies, were
charged with conspiracy to prevent or lessen unduly competition in the price of
fire insurance upon property in the Province of Nova Scotia contrary to
s. 32(1)(c) (rep. and sub. 1974-75 (Can.),
c. 76, s. 14(1)) of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-23. Appellants were all members of the Nova Scotia Board of
Underwriters and set their fire insurance rates in accordance with the rates
set by the Board. There were several other large insurance companies which were
not members of the Board which had operated in the Province for many years.
These non-member companies did not adhere to the Board’s rate schedule. The
issues were whether there was an agreement to which appellants were parties
evidencing a common design to prevent or lessen competition in the price of
fire insurance generally throughout the Province and whether if there were such
an agreement it was undue and therefore proscribed by the section. Appellants
were acquitted at trial; however the Appeal Division reversed, entered a
conviction and imposed fines totalling $339,700.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Judson and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and
the judgment at trial restored.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Pigeon, Dickson and Beetz JJ.: The sole question was whether this
agreement was entered into in order to prevent or lessen competition “unduly”.
The existence of an agreement to prevent or lessen competition does not, of
itself, constitute an offence under the section. The illegal character of the
agreement lies in the fact that the prevention or lessening is undue. It
is only by assessing what the result would be if the agreement were implemented
that the undueness can be measured. The trial judge correctly

[Page 732]

heard evidence as to the effect of the plan
on free competition in the insurance business. The evidence indicated that the
Board when establishing its rates always took into consideration the competition
from non-Board companies; that a large international company could do business
in Nova Scotia by paying a licence fee; that the share of the market taken by
the non-Board members had increased over the period in question, and
particularly in the decade 1960 to 1970, mentioned in the charges. Thus a
substantial body of evidence supported the finding of the trial judge that
competition was not stifled by the action of the Board. The majority of the
Appeal Division erred in finding that whenever a “meaningful segment of the
insurance industry” is shown to be involved in the agreement the effect on
competition then becomes “undue”. The charges related to the fire insurance
industry in the Province and were not made out by proving that a particular group
within the industry had agreed to abide by rates set by the Board.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Judson and Spence JJ. dissenting: The Crown’s appeal to the
Appeal Division was properly brought under s. 605(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code  upon errors in law at the trial with reference to (a) the
meaning of “unduly” in s. 32(1)(c) of the Combines
Investigation Act; and (b) the admission of defence evidence
received over objection by the Crown, and designed to show public benefit in
what the accused had conspired to do. In interpreting “unduly” the trial judge
felt obliged to determine “whether or not there had been any undue lessening of
competition”. This ignored the fact that the charge was one of conspiracy and
it is not an ingredient of that offence that proof must be made that
competition was in fact lessened unduly. The offence is completed if there is a
conspiracy which has as its object the inordinate lessening of competition. The
effect does not matter, if the object is unlawful. Moreover it was wrong for
the trial judge to admit evidence of public benefit. The trial judge further
erred in his observation that appellants did not intend their agreement to have
the effect of virtually relieving them from the influence of competition. The mens
rea of the offence was, in the circumstances, the intention of appellants
to enter into the agreement. The undisputed facts as to the portion of the
market in the hands of the Board made it unnecessary to consider what the
situation would have been if they had a very small portion of the business.
There was no onus, as the trial judge appeared to feel there was, on the Crown
to establish a monopoly

[Page 733]

or virtual monopoly.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of Nova Scotia[1], Appeal
Division, allowing an appeal by the Attorney General of Canada from the
judgment of Hart J. at trial of a directed verdict of not guilty of a charge
against seventy three insurance companies under s. 32(1)(c) of
the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-23 as amended.

JJ. dissenting.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Judson and
Spence JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—The issues
in this appeal raise basic questions respecting our law on illegal combines and
have ramifications which go beyond the particular facts of this case. The
Crown’s appeal from the acquittal of the various accused on a charge under
s. 32(1)(c) of the Combines Investigation Act, now R.S.C.
1970, c. C-23, was allowed by a majority judgment of the Nova Scotia
Supreme Court, Appeal Division, on the ground of error of law on the part of
the trial judge who was sitting without a jury, and a conviction was entered on
the findings of fact made by the trial judge. On further appeal to this Court
it was contended, inter alia, that there was not a question of law alone
involved in the appeal to the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appeal Division within
s. 605(1) (a) of the Criminal Code . If that is so, it would
be unnecessary to deal with any of the other issues raised on the hearing in
this Court and the appeal would have to be allowed and the acquittal restored.

[Page 734]

It was the position of the Crown in this Court
that there were two questions of law upon which the trial judge erred and that
in respect of each an appeal from the acquittal of the accused properly lay to
the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appeal Division. The first alleged error related
to the meaning of “unduly” in s. 32(1)(c), and the second concerned
the admission of certain evidence, received under Crown objection, adduced by
the defence and designed to show public benefit in what the accused had
conspired to do.

In my opinion this evidence ought not to have
been received and ought not to have been used by the trial judge, as it clearly
was, as an aid in determining whether the conspiracy or agreement among the
accused to lessen competition in the price, that is, the premiums for fire
insurance in Nova Scotia was a conspiracy or agreement to do so “unduly”.

The relevant passages from the trial judge’s
reasons on the question of public benefit are as follows:

Counsel for the Crown took objection to the
admission of any evidence tending to show that the work of the Board was for
the public benefit, on the ground that such evidence was not relevant. In
support of this position he relied upon Howard Smith Paper Mills Limited et
al v. The Queen (1957), 8 D.L.R. (2d) 449, a decision of the Supreme Court
of Canada [and on the reasons of Taschereau J. at p. 452]:

…

I admitted the evidence of
Mr. Shakespeare and others even though it may be said that it related to a
benefit received by the public from the work of the Board, for another reason
however. There can be no doubt that if the offence charged is established
beyond a reasonable doubt, no amount of good intention on behalf of the
participants in the conspiracy will in any way excuse their conduct. This is
made abundantly clear by the remarks of Taschereau, J., and is a principle
followed regularly by our courts in criminal proceedings. On the other hand,
before deciding whether the offence charged has been, in fact, committed, the
Court must address itself to the problem of whether or not there has been any
undue “lessening of competition”. In making this determination I am satisfied
that it is necessary to

[Page 735]

look at the type of evidence presented by
witnesses for the defence, and have done so…

It is clear from these reasons that not only did
the trial judge receive evidence which was not admissible on the question of
undueness but that he also erred, and erred gravely, in regarding “undueness”
as something that had to be established as existing in fact rather than being a
matter bound up in the proof of the illegal conspiracy charged in this case. I
refer again, for emphasis, to the following statement in the foregoing passage
quoted from his reasons:

…before deciding whether the offence
charged has been, in fact, committed the Court must address itself to the
problem of whether or not there has been any undue ‘lessening of
competition’… [The emphasis is mine]

The matter was considered by the Nova Scotia
Court of Appeal, and although the majority, speaking through Macdonald J.A.,
canvassed the authorities and came to the conclusion (in his words) that “the
injury to the public does not have to be demonstrated” it appeared to blend
this issue with its conclusion of error on the part of the trial judge on the
first point raised here by the Crown, that is the meaning of the term “unduly”.

The seriousness of the trial judge’s error in
reviewing evidence of public benefit to blunt the Crown’s case on whether the
conspiracy was one to lessen competition unduly in the price of fire insurance
is amply demonstrated by the assertions of public benefit in the evidence
accepted by the trial judge, those assertions being repeated in argument of
counsel for the accused appellants in this Court and being as follows:

1. The operations of the Nova Scotia Board of
Insurance Underwriters were intended to secure the solvency of the member
companies.

2. Through such operations costs were minimized.

[Page 736]

3. The Board’s operations involved useful
assistance to fire departments in Nova Scotia on fire prevention.

4. It provided technical assistance in
connection with assessment of risks.

5. It was of assistance to municipalities in the
Province on fire prevention methods.

The question of public detriment (as to which
evidence of public benefit would be admissible) is a matter that arises on
charges of unlawful mergers or unlawful monopolies, and it was a crucial
question in the recent judgment of this Court in The Queen v. K.C. Irving
Limited et al.[2] Where
the charge is one of conspiracy, whether it be conspiracy in general terms to
lessen competition unduly or, as in this case, conspiracy to lessen unduly
competition in the price of fire insurance premiums, the statute does not
require proof of public detriment nor correlatively does it prescribe or import
a defence of public benefit. If there is any dominant theme that is reflected
in the case law on illegal conspiracies under the present Combines
Investigation Act and under predecessor legislation, it is that of the
public interest in competition, which the statute is designed to protect as
being the ultimate good in a market economy and not to be diluted by any
showing that the impugned combination has brought benefits to the public,
either in price or in services or otherwise.

As long ago as Weidman v. Shragge[3], Anglin J. pointed out that the
definition of the offence of conspiracy to lessen competition did not warrant
equating “unduly” with “unreasonably”. The issue arose in that case, a civil
case concerning the enforceability of a contract, because the common law of
restraint of trade was qualified by the notions of reasonableness of the
restraint in the interests of the parties to the challenged transaction and in
the interests of the public. This coun-

[Page 737]

try’s long standing statutory policy on criminal
combinations to lessen competition rejected the common law qualification and
introduced the standard of undueness, related directly to competition and
without any alleviation according to the goodness or badness of the conspiracy
to lessen it.

Succeeding cases appeared to take for granted
the distinction made in Weidman v. Shragge, excluding private advantage
as well as public benefit as alleviating factors upon a charge of an illegal
conspiracy. A specific reference to it was made by Mignault J. in Stinson-Reeb
Builders Supply Co. v. The King[4], at
p. 280 where he said that

…the advantage thus obtained by the
manufacturers and dealers of the association is not the proper test… Injury to
the public by the hindering or suppressing of free competition, notwithstanding
any advantage which may accrue to the business interests of the members of the
combine is what brings an agreement or a combination under the ban of [the
law]:

“Injury to the public” in the passsage above
quoted was not intended to suggest that it was open to accused persons to show
or provide evidence to indicate the contrary, and thus to justify a finding by
the trial judge that the Crown had not proved the illegal conspiracy beyond a
reasonable doubt. However, counsel for the appellants took that very point in
his submissions, and supported it by referring to the evidence thereon given by
Shakespeare, the manager of the Nova Scotia Board of Insurance Underwriters,
evidence which the trial judge accepted and upon which, it is clear, that he
acted.

The issue of public benefit was raised squarely
in Howard Smith Paper Mills v. The Queen[5].
In his reasons in that case, Taschereau J. (as he then was) referred to
what Mignault J. said in the Stinson-Reeb case, and which I quoted
above, and

[Page 738]

made clear that public benefit has no place in
Canadian statutory policy to defeat a charge of an illegal conspiracy to
interfere with or lessen competition. I refer to what he said, at pp. 406‑7:

It has been argued on behalf of the
appellants that the offence is not complete, unless it has been established by
the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt, that the agreement was detrimental to the
public, in the sense that the manufacture or production was effectively
lessened, limited or prevented, as a result of the agreements entered into. It
has also been suggested that there is no offence, if it is shown that the acts
complained of were beneficial to the public. With these submissions I
entirely disagree. Conspiracy is a crime by itself, without the necessity of
establishing the carrying out of an overt act…

The public is entitled to the benefit of free
competition, and the prohibitions of the Act cannot be evaded by good
motives. Whether they be innocent and even commendable, they cannot alter the true
character of the combine which the law forbids, and the wish to accomplish
desirable purposes constitutes no defence and will not condone the undue
restraint, which is the elimination of the free domestic markets.

It is my strong view that traders, manufacturers
and producers cannot, as the law now stands, monopolize a substantial part of
the markets of the country in given industries, to promote their own business
interests, and then set themselves up as public benefactors, by saying to the
Courts that the conspiracy was organized in order to achieve the stabilization
of prices and production.

In the same case, Kellock J. emphasized (at
p. 411) that public benefit is embedded in the statutory policy of freedom
of competition, and Cartwright J. (as he then was) took the same point in
saying (at p. 427) that “the Court, except I suppose on the question of
sentence, is neither required nor permitted to inquire whether in the
particular case the intended and actual results of the agreement have in fact
benefited or harmed the public”.

This, in my view, states the law as it has been
understood for the past sixty-five years, and there can have been no doubt
about it, at least since the judgments in the Howard Smith case. The
trial judge, in the passages I quoted from his reasons, while apparently saying
that evidence of public

[Page 739]

benefit was as such inadmissible, nonetheless
admitted that very evidence as having a bearing on whether there was undueness
in the conspiracy. I confess to great difficulty in appreciating how that
evidence can be relevant to undueness and be admitted in that respect when its
thrust is public benefit and it is inadmissible for that purpose and hence
inadmissible on the question of undueness. This error by the trial judge is itself
enough to warrant an appellate court in setting aside the acquittal.

That, however, is not the only error committed
by the trial judge. In the very passage of his reasons which I quoted and in
which he decided to look at the evidence of public benefit, he asserted that in
order to determine whether the offence charged against the appellants had been
committed he was obliged to determine “whether or not there has been any undue
lessening of competition”. This ignores the fact that the charge is one of conspiracy.
It is not an ingredient of the offence that proof must be made that competition
was in fact lessened unduly. Even assuming (although the trial judge nowhere
says so) that proof of an actual lessening of competition might provide support
for a finding that there was a conspiracy to that end and that it was directed
to an undue lessening, the absence of any proof of actual lessening of
competition, let alone of an undue lessening, does not conclude the matter
against the Crown.

This second error, even if a subordinate one in
itself, is connected with what I consider to be a major error as to the meaning
of “undueness”, which the trial judge regarded as requiring proof that the
accused intended their agreement to have the effect of lessening competition
unduly and hence evidence of an absence of such an intention would remove a
necessary prop of the Crown’s case.

[Page 740]

After reviewing the evidence, most of it
relating to public benefit and hence inadmissible because irrelevant to the
issues in the case, the trial judge approached the critical question of
undueness after making the findings set out in the following passage of his
reasons:

There can be no doubt that there was in
fact here an agreement among all of the defendants to lessen competition in the
price of insurance. This agreement is spelled out very clearly in the
Constitution, By-Laws, Rules and Regulations of the Nova Scotia Board of
Insurance Underwriters of which unincorporated association all of the
defendants were members. I am further satisfied from the oral testimony given
at the hearing that the members knew that they were agreeing to virtually
eliminate competition among themselves when undertaking to abide by rates
established by the Board for all of them. The question remaining is whether or
not the lessening of competition in the price insurance comes within the
meaning of “unduly” as interpreted by the Courts.

There followed in the trial judge’s reasons an
extensive examination of the case law, with copious quotations from a succession
of judgments, including those of this Court. In my opinion, the trial judge
has, in his reasons, misconstrued the decisions of this Court on the nature of
the offence charged against the accused.

He stated his conclusion as follows:

After considering all of the evidence I
find that the agreement under which the defendants marketed insurance between
1960 and 1970 was not criminal in nature. Although it had the effect of
lessening competition among the members of the Board it did not lessen competition
throughout the industry in a manner that could be said to be improper,
inordinate, excessive or oppressive. Nor do I believe that the defendants
intended their agreement to have the effect of virtually relieving them from
the influence of free competition. In my opinion the defendants have not
conspired or agreed to lessen unduly competition in the price of insurance on
property in this Province.

There are three obvious faults in this
application of the law to the evidence. First, proof of the offence does not
require that the conspiracy have the effect of lessening competition
improperly, inordinately, expressively or oppressively. The

[Page 741]

offence is completed if there is a conspiracy
which has as its object the inordinate lessening of competition; effect does
not matter if the object is unlawful. This is clear from the judgment of Kerwin
J. for the majority of the Court in Container Materials Ltd. v. The King[6], at pp. 158‑159, and it is
clear as well from the reasons delivered in the Howard Smith case. The
second fault resides in the trial judge’s observation in the passage quoted
that the defendants did not intend their agreement to have the effect of
virtually relieving them from the influence of free competition. Again this is
not what this Court has laid down. Kerwin J. in the Container Materials case
addressed this point directly when he referred to the argument of the accused
in that case that “the agreement or arrangement must have been intended by the
accused to have [the] effect [of unduly to prevent or lessen competition]”. He
then continues as follows:

This is not the meaning of the enactment
upon which the count was based. Mens rea is undoubtedly necessary, but
that requirement was met in these prosecutions when it was shown that the appellants
intended to enter, and did enter, into the very arrangement found to exist.

Even apart from the third fault to which I will
refer, the foregoing errors again make it impossible in my view for the
acquittal to stand; and, indeed, on the very findings made by the trial judge I
am of the opinion that the majority judgment of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court,
Appeal Division was correct in not only setting aside the acquittal but in
entering a conviction.

The third fault has to do with the question of
market which the trial judge, as I read his reasons, took to be all fire
insurance business throughout Nova Scotia. It appeared to be his view that,
that being so, it was incumbent on the Crown to establish an undue lessening of
competition throughout the whole province. As Macdonald J.A. noted in his
majority reasons on appeal, the trial judge appeared to be putting an onus on
the Crown to

[Page 742]

establish a monopoly or virtual monopoly.
Clearly, this is not what is called for on a charge of conspiracy. The
undisputed facts as to the portion of the market in the hands of members of the
Nova Scotia Board of Insurance Underwriters make it unnecessary to consider
what the situation would have been if they had a very small portion thereof. I
should emphasize as well that the charge against the appellants relates to the
price of fire insurance premiums and not to competition in other aspects of the
business, and it is as to that element, which is specifically mentioned in the
definition of the offence, that the question of market must be considered. It
is enough to say, finally, that the Board of which the appellants were members
was not a mere information centre but a command post requiring of its members
observance of premium rates.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon,
Dickson and Beetz JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of

fire insurance upon property in the Province of Nova Scotia, and did thereby
commit an indictable offence contrary to s. 32(1)(c) of the Combines
Investigation Act.

[Page 743]

Section 32(1) of the Combines Investigation
Act, R.S.C. 1970 c. C-23 as amended, reads, in part, as follows:

Every one who conspires, combines, agrees
or arranges with another person…

(c) to prevent, or lessen, unduly,
competition in the production, manufacture, purchase barter, sale, storage,
rental, transportation or supply of an article, or in the price of insurance
upon persons or property, …

is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for two years.

The essence of this charge is that the
appellants were parties to an agreement “to prevent or lessen unduly
competition in the price of fire insurance upon property in the Province of
Nova Scotia.” This charge, in my view, relates to the fire insurance business
as a whole within the Province and the questions to be determined are whether
there was an agreement to which the appellants were parties evidencing a common
design to prevent or lessen competition in the price of such insurance
generally throughout the Province, and whether if there were such an agreement,
it was undue and therefore proscribed by the section.

All the accused companies and other companies
referred to in the charge were at some time during the period therein mentioned
members of an unincorporated association known as the Nova Scotia Board of
Underwriters (hereinafter referred to as the “Board”) which, since January 5,
1857, had operated in Nova Scotia where its members issued policies of
insurance upon property in that Province at prices or rates that were
promulgated or issued to them by the Board and which also as a group worked for
such things as improved fire protection in co-operation with local authorities
and which provided inspectors of properties for rating purposes.

The facts giving rise to this prosecution are
elaborately discussed in the comprehensive judgment of the learned trial judge
which is conveniently reported at 19 C.C.C. (2d), pp. 449 to 507,

[Page 744]

and the accuracy of his factual analysis does
not appear to me to be seriously questioned in the judgment of the Appeal
Division, which is reported at 22 C.C.C. (2d), pp. 513 to 553. In the latter
Court Mr. Justice Coffin delivered a dissenting opinion affirming the
judgment at trial and Macdonald J.A., with whom Cooper, J.A. agreed, prefaced
his majority opinion with the words: “I have had the opportunity of reading the
opinion prepared for delivery by my brother Coffin in which he clearly and
completely summarizes the facts and issues involved herein”.

It is not seriously contested that one of the
purposes envisaged in the organization of the Board was that its members should
agree among themselves to provide insurance at the same rate or price, but the
sole question is whether this agreement was entered into in order to prevent or
lessen competition “unduly”.

The meaning to be attached to the word “unduly”
in this context has been discussed in a great number of cases, the majority of
which are referred to at length in the judgments of the courts below. I think,
however, that the most helpful discussion of the subject is to be found in the
reasons for judgment of the various members of this Court in Howard Smith
Paper Mills Limited et al v. The Queen[7]. In that case the offence of which
the appellants had been convicted was provided for by s. 498(1)(d)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927 c. 36, and the language of
which was in all essentials the same as s. 32(1) of the Combines
Investigation Act. The section reads, in part, as follows:

498. (1)
Every one is guilty of an indictable offence… who conspires, combines, agrees
or arranges with any other person…

(d) to unduly prevent or lessen
competition in the… price of insurance upon person or property.

In the course of the reasons for judgment
rendered on behalf of himself and Rand and Fauteux, JJ., Mr. Justice
Kellock had occasion to refer to

[Page 745]

the characterization of the word “unduly”
contained in the reasons for judgment of Anglin J. in Weidman et al v. Shragge[8], where he said, of the agreement in
that case at pp. 42 and 43:

…the prime question certainly must be, does
it, however advantageous or even necessary for the protection of the business
interests of the parties impose improper, inordinate, excessive or oppressive
restrictions upon that competition the benefit of which is the right of
everyone.

Mr. Justice Kellock also noted that this
judgment of Anglin J. received the approval of this Court in Stinson-Reeb
Builders Supply Company v. The King[9], was
later described by Kerwin J. in Container Materials Ltd., et al v. The King[10], where he said:

Under the decision in the Stinson-Reeb case,
the public is entitled to the benefit of free competition except in so far as
it may be interfered with by valid legislation, and any party to an
arrangement, the direct object of which is to impose improper, inordinate,
excessive or oppressive restrictions upon that competition, is guilty of an
offence.

In the course of his reasons for judgment in the
Howard Smith Paper Mills case, Kellock J., also referred to the reasons
for judgment of Duff C.J.C. in the Container Materials Ltd., case, supra,
where the Chief Justice had said, at p. 151:

The second point arises from the contention
of the appellants that the essence of the offence is an agreement to do
something injurious to the public; that such injury to the public must appear
from the evidence and must be found as a fact in order to establish a legal
basis for a conviction.

And later at p. 152 in the same case, where
Duff C.J.C. had said of the protection afforded by the section:

This protection is afforded by stamping
with illegality arrangements which when carried into effect, prevent or lessen
competition unduly and making such arrangements punishable offences; and as the
enactment is aimed at protecting the public interest in free competition it is from
that point of view that the question must be considered whether or not the
prevention or lessening agreed upon will be undue.

[Page 746]

In commenting on the submission made by counsel
for the appellants in the Howard Smith Paper Mills case, Kellock J.
said, at p. 411:

With respect to question five it is not
necessary in my opinion to discuss the argument which was addressed to us in so
far as that argument was founded upon matters of evidence. The essence of the
argument is that although the agreement which the courts below have found to
contravene the provisions of s. 498(1)(d), continued without break
throughout the period mentioned in the indictment, and although s. 498(1)(d)
remained unrevoked, the agreement ceased to come within the ban of the
section during the period of war time controls for the reason that all
possibility of competition in fine papers was eliminated by virtue of the
legislation then in effect.

In my opinion the short answer to this
contention is contained in part of the reasons for judgment of Duff C.J.C. in
the Container Materials case, supra. At p. 153 the learned
Chief Justice after pointing out that the Court of Appeal had held that the aim
of the parties to the agreement there in question had been to secure effective
control of the market in Canada and that they had been very largely successful
in that aim went on to say: ‘But the fact that such was the agreement affords
in point of law a sufficient basis’ for a finding that the section had
been contravened.

Mr. Justice Cartwright delivered a separate
opinion on behalf of Mr. Justice Locke and himself in which he discussed
the test theretofore applied in determining the meaning of unduly in the
context of s. 498(1)(d) saying, at p. 425:

I must confess that I have found difficulty
in discerning just what that test is. As was pointed out by Anglin J., in Weidman
et al. v. Shragge, supra at p. 41, the conclusion is
inescapable that Parliament contemplated that there may be agreements to
prevent or lessen competition which do not fall within the prohibition of
s. 498(1)(d); the intended prevention or lessening must be
‘undue’ to render the agreement criminal. ‘Undue’ and ‘unduly’ are not absolute
terms whose meaning is self-evident. Their use presupposes the existence of a
rule or standard defining what is ‘due’. Their interpretation does not appear
to me to be assisted by substituting the adjectives ‘improper’, ‘inordinate’,
‘excessive’, ‘oppressive’ or ‘wrong’, or the corresponding adverbs, in the
absence of a statement as to what, in this connection, is proper, ordinate,
permissible or right.

And later at p. 426:

[Page 747]

In essence the decisions referred to appear
to me to hold that an agreement to prevent or lessen competition in commercial
activities of the sort described in the section becomes criminal when the
prevention or lessening agreed upon reaches the point at which the participants
in the agreement become free to carry on those activities virtually unaffected
by the influence of competition, which influence Parliament is taken to regard
as an indispensable protection of the public interest; that it is the
arrogation to the members of the combination of the power to carry on their
activities without competition which is rendered unlawful; …

There being substantial agreement as to the
meaning of the word “unduly” and no material difference existing as to the
facts, the issue raised by the difference of approach at trial and on appeal is
whether the facts, which are not seriously disputed, disclose an agreement to
prevent or lessen competition “unduly” as that word is explained in the
cases in this Court which are referred to and followed by both Mr. Justice
Hart and Mr. Justice Macdonald.

The fact that an agreement existed to prevent or
lessen competition in the price of insurance does not of itself constitute an
offence under the section; the illegal character of the agreement lies in the
fact that the prevention or lessening is undue and it appears to me that
the best if not the only way in which to determine this is by considering
whether competition would be unduly prevented or lessened if the design
evidenced by the agreement were carried into effect. In my view it is only by
assessing what the result would be if the agreement were implemented that the
elusive quality of undueness can be measured, and it was for this reason that
the learned trial judge in the present case heard evidence as to the effect of
the plan on free competition in the insurance business.

In my view this was well put by Mr. Justice
Coffin in the course of his dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal where he
said, at p. 534:

I am of opinion that the trial Judge was
not in error in admitting the defence evidence. I accept the position that it
is not the actual result of the agreement with which we are concerned, but the
effect which the agreement would have if carried out. Nevertheless, in my

[Page 748]

view the trial Judge was entitled to look
at this evidence to satisfy himself on the question whether the object of the
agreement was to lessen competition unduly. It was relevant in his search for
the design and plan of the agreement.

The burden lying upon the Crown in this case is
to establish beyond a reasonable doubt first, that the respondents intended to
enter into a conspiracy, combination, agreement or arrangement and, secondly,
that that conspiracy, combination, agreement or arrangement if it were
carried into effect would prevent or lessen competition unduly. These are
questions of fact and the only question of law to which this appeal can be said
to give rise is the meaning of unduly in the context of s. 32(1)(c).

After his comprehensive analysis of the facts
and his review of the cases, the trial judge concluded as to this question at
p. 504, 19 C.C.C.:

This review of the various statements on
the meaning of ‘unduly’ as it relates to the offence of lessening competition
brings me to these conclusions. An agreement to prevent or lessen competition
alone is not an offence. What is criminal is an agreement that is intended to
lessen competition improperly, inordinately, excessively, oppressively or one
intended to have the effect of virtually relieving the conspirators from the
influence of free competition. There is no requirement for the Crown to prove
the existence of a monopoly and it is a question of fact as to whether the
agreement reaches the point of intending to lessen competition unduly and
therefore becomes a criminal conspiracy.

In my view this is an accurate assessment of the
meaning of unduly as it has been construed in the various cases and it does not
appear to me that the respondent or the majority of the Court of Appeal
seriously dispute it. The learned trial judge, however, had said at
p. 487:

There can be no doubt that there was in
fact here an agreement among all of the defendants to lessen competition in the
price of insurance. This agreement is spelled out very clearly in the
constitution, by-laws, rules and regulations of the Nova Scotia Board of
Insurance Underwriters of which unincorporated association all of the
defendants were members. I am further satisfied from the oral testimony given
at the hearing that the members knew that they were agreeing to virtually

[Page 749]

eliminate competition among themselves when
undertaking to abide by rates established by the Board for all of them. The
question remaining is whether or not the lessening of competition in the price
of insurance comes within the meaning of ‘unduly’ as interpreted by the Courts.

This passage was the subject of the following
comment by Mr. Justice Macdonald in the Appeal Division at 22 C.C.C. (2d),
at p. 551:

In the first-quoted passage the learned
trial Judge found as a fact that the members of the Board entered into an
agreement among themselves to virtually eliminate competition amongst themselves.
When this finding, which is completely supported by the evidence, is looked at
in light of the proven fact that the Board members held the majority portion of
the fire insurance market in the Province during the material period of time it
seems to me that what existed is the very type of situation in which the quoted
authorities say that ‘undueness’ undoubtedly exists.

And he later observed at p. 552:

The situation as it appears to me is that
once the Crown established that the Board companies, who underwrote the
majority of the property insurance risks in the Province, agreed, as the
learned trial Judge found, to virtually eliminate competition as to the price
of fire insurance among themselves, then ‘undueness’ if not presumed was
certainly established. My understanding of the law is that it is not necessary
for the Crown to establish that the whole of the fire insurance industry was
adversely affected by, or involved in, such agreement of the Board members or
that the object of the agreement was to so affect or involve the industry.
Rather, all that is required is that a meaningful segment of the insurance
industry be shown to have been involved in the agreement.

These comments by Mr. Justice Macdonald are
at variance with the evidence of the Board Manager, Mr. Shakespeare, of
whom the trial judge said, at p. 469 of the report:

His evidence was forthright and credible,
and from it I find the following facts.

The learned trial judge proceeded at p. 470
to cite the following portions of Mr. Shakespeare’s evidence:

Mr. Shakespeare indicates that the
Board when establishing its rates must always take into consideration the
competition from non-Board companies which has been increasing in recent years.
A large international insur-

[Page 750]

ance company, such as Lloyds, as long as it
is registered in Ottawa, can do business in Nova Scotia by paying a licence
fee. These companies are always available to those who seek them but although
they may be in a position to grant a lower rate, they normally do not maintain
the type of service to clients in the Province that is provided through the
Board, or through resident non-Board companies.

When these observations are taken in conjunction
with the fact that the share of the market taken by non-Board members has increased
over the period in question, and particularly in the last half of the decade
referred to in the charge, it becomes apparent that Mr. Justice Macdonald
in the passage quoted from his reasons for judgment was overstating the matter
considerably in making his own finding of fact to the effect that the agreement
as to price made between the Board companies inter se of itself
established undueness. There is a substantial body of evidence to support the
view of the trial judge that competition was not stifled by the Board’s actions
and with all respect, I think that the majority of the Appeal Division were
wrong in finding that wherever a “meaningful segment of the insurance industry”
is shown to be involved in the agreement, then it becomes undue. In the penultimate
paragraph of his judgment, the learned trial judge had said, at pp. 506 and
507:

After considering all of the evidence I
find that the agreement under which the defendants marked insurance between
1960 and 1970 was not criminal in nature. Although it had the effect of
lessening competition among the members of the Board it did not lessen
competition throughout the industry in a manner that could be said to be
improper, inordinate, excessive or oppressive. Nor do I believe that the
defendants intended their agreement to have the effect of virtually relieving
them from the influence of free competition. In my opinion the defendants have
not conspired or agreed to lessen unduly competition in the price of insurance
on property in this Province.

Of this passage, Mr. Justice Macdonald
observed at p. 551 and 552 of the report:

…the learned trial Judge was obviously
considering the whole of the insurance industry and not just the Board
part thereof. Considered in such light the learned trial

[Page 751]

Judge found that the agreement did not
lessen competition unduly throughout the industry. I would interject here that
the charge is not that the respondents lessened unduly competition in the price
of fire insurance but rather, that they conspired to do so.

The learned trial Judge as noted concluded
the last-quoted passage by saying that in his opinion the respondents had not
conspired or agreed to lessen unduly competition in the price of insurance on
property in this Province.

In summary, it is my opinion that the
learned trial Judge was considering the effect of the agreement on Board
members in the first passage and on the whole industry in the
second.

As I have indicated, I am in agreement with
Mr. Justice Coffin in concluding that the trial judge was justified in
considering the evidence of Mr. Shakespeare and others as to the measure
of competition evidenced in the fire insurance business during the decade in
review for the purpose of satisfying himself on the question of whether the
object of the agreement was to lessen competition unduly. It was, as
Mr. Justice Coffin has said: “relevant in his search for the design and
plan of the agreement”. It was in this sense and not as evidence related to a
benefit received by the public that Hart J. admitted the testimony of
Mr. Shakespeare and concluded that the agreement of the Board was not for
the purpose of lessening competition unduly. Notwithstanding the argument of
counsel in this Court, I am satisfied that this latter conclusion formed the
basis upon which the learned trial judge found the appellants to be not guilty
of the charge preferred against them under s. 32(1)(c) of the Combines
Investigation Act and that his verdict was not based upon any finding that
the agreement in question was of benefit to the public. This appears to me
to be indicated in the following passage in the reasons for judgment of
Mr. Justice Hart where he said:

I admitted the evidence of
Mr. Shakespeare and others even though it may be said that it related to a
benefit received by the public from the work of the Board, for another reason
however. There can be no doubt that if the offence charged is established
beyond a reasonable doubt, no amount of good intention on behalf

[Page 752]

of the participants in the conspiracy will
in any way excuse their conduct. This is made abundantly clear by the remarks
of Taschereau, J., and is a principle followed regularly by our courts in
criminal proceedings. On the other hand, before deciding whether the offence
charged has been, in fact, committed, the Court must address itself to the
problem of whether or not there has been any undue ‘lessening of competition’.
In making this determination I am satisfied that it is necessary to look at the
type of evidence presented by witnesses for the defence, and have done so…

As I have indicated at the outset, I am of
opinion that the charge here laid is one relating to the fire insurance
industry as a whole within the Province and it is not made out by proving that
a particular group within the industry have agreed with each other to abide by
rates promulgated by the Board.

For all these reasons I would allow this appeal
and restore this judgment rendered at trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law —Non-capital murder —Defence of
provocation —Whether jury properly instructed as to doctrine of reasonable
doubt —Whether miscarriage of justice —Criminal Code , s. 215 .

L was charged with the murder by shooting of
his neighbour S. On the night of the murder S had entered L’s house in a
drunken state and, following an argument, had physically and verbally assaulted
him. L retreated to his bedroom but was unable to secure the door and came out
again with a shotgun, which he fired at S thereby killing him. L was charged
with non-capital murder and pleaded self-defence and provocation.

In his instructions to the jury the judge
explained the doctrine of reasonable doubt and applied it to the defence of
self-defence. After a recess, he dealt with the defence of provocation but made
no further reference to the doctrine of reasonable doubt. The appellant claims
that the judge erred in law in failing to explain to the jury that if they were
in doubt as to whether his act was provoked it was their duty to reduce the
offence to manslaughter.

Held (Ritchie
and de Grandpré JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Martland, Judson, Spence, Pigeon, Dickson and Beetz JJ.: In a case
such as this, the Appeal Court
must decide what the jury understood rather than whether the correct formula
was used by the trial judge in his charge to them. The judge’s instruction as
to reasonable doubt may be express or implied. However, in the case at bar
there were three references to the doctrine of reasonable doubt in relation to
self-defence and none in relation to provocation, with the result that the jury
could well have concluded that reasonable doubt and provocation were unrelated.
Since the evidence of provocation was strong and the question as to whether the
appellant acted under provocation was a matter of fact for the jury to decide,
it cannot be said

[Page 647]

that a reasonable jury, properly directed, could
not have done otherwise than find the appellant guilty of murder.

Per Ritchie
and de Grandpré JJ., dissenting: While it is true that the jury must
understand the law, it is also true that an appeal court must not impose a
formula on the trial judge and it is in attempting to reconcile these two
principles that differences of opinion may arise as to whether or not the judge
misdirected the jury in any particular case. The present case may be
distinguished from the Latour case where the judge stated that it was
for the jury to say whether or not the necessary facts had been “established”
to warrant a plea of self‑defence, in that there was no such misdirection
in the case at bar where the judge used the words “find” and “decide”, which
were approved in the Latour case. As to the doctrine of reasonable
doubt, the “golden thread” of the presumption of innocence to which the judge
referred at the outset is present throughout his remarks.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia dismissing appellant’s appeal from his conviction for
non-capital murder. Appeal allowed and new trial ordered, Ritchie and de
Grandpré JJ. dissenting.

J.E. Hall, for the appellant.

G.S. Cumming, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Martland,
Judson, Spence, Pigeon, Dickson and Beetz JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The appellant, George Joseph Linney,
was convicted on a charge of non‑capital murder. An appeal to the British
Columbia Court of Appeal was unsuccessful. By leave of this Court he now
appeals on the following question of law:

Did the Court of Appeal err in failing to
hold that there was non-direction amounting to a misdirection in that the
learned trial Judge failed to instruct the jury that if they were in doubt as
to whether the act of killing was

[Page 648]

provoked it was their duty to reduce the
offence from murder to manslaughter?

The appellant was charged with murdering Eddie
Leonard Strandlund on May 24, 1974, at Fort
 St. John, British Columbia. The appellant and Strandlund were neighbours and apparently
friends. The appellant was of mild temperament and failing health. Strandlund
was younger and aggressive. Strandlund had a serious alcohol problem. When
drunk, he was given to violent and bulling conduct, at times abusing the
appellant in a sadistic manner. On the night of the offence alleged in the
indictment, Strandlund entered the appellant’s house uninvited and drunk. Six
people were in the house The appellant, who had been asleep, got up to get something
to eat. An argument ensued between the appellant and Strandlund in the course
of which Strandlund assaulted the appellant, hit him over the head with a
coffee pot, insulted him, threatened him and then began hurling things about
the house. The appellant retreated to his nearby bedroom and sought
unsuccessfully to fasten the bedroom door. Failing to do so, he emerged from
the bedroom with a shotgun which he fired at Strandlund from a distance of a
few feet, killing him. The principal defences put forward at trial were self‑defence
and provocation.

Early in his charge to the jury, the trial judge
adverted to the reasonable doubt doctrine in these words:

Now I should like to talk to you about the
burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The onus or burden of proof of the
guilt of the accused person rests upon the Crown and never shifts. There is no
burden on the accused person to prove his innocence. The Crown must prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused person is guilty of the offence with
which he is charged before he can be convicted. If you have a reasonable doubt
as to whether the accused committed the offence with which he is charged, it is
your duty to give the accused the benefit of the doubt and find him not guilty.
In other words if after considering all the evidence, the arguments of counsel
and my charge you come to the conclusion that the Crown has failed to prove to
your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused

[Page 649]

committed the offence with which he is
charged, then it is your duty to give the accused the benefit of the doubt and
to find him not guilty.

Following the quoted passage the trial judge
discussed at length the general principles to be observed in a criminal case,
reviewed the evidence in detail, instructed upon the applicable
sections of the Criminal Code , and then after recess, dealt with
the defences of self-defence and provocation. The charge as to self-defence
included three references to reasonable doubt. When the judge came to consider
whether the accused was provoked into committing the unlawful act he read to
the jury s. 215 of the Code. He explained that there were two
steps:

First you must decide if an ordinary
person, not necessarily George Linney, but an ordinary person would have been
deprived of self-control by the wrongful acts or insults of Strandlund…

The second test is that you must find if in
fact the accused George Linney was provoked by these things, actually acted on
the provocation on the sudden before it was time for his passion to cool. Now
in coming to a conclusion on these two points you must answer the first
question in favour of the accused before you can proceed to the second
question.

Further instruction followed, concluding:

It follows that if you also answer the
second question in the affirmative, that is to say, you find that Linney acted
on the provocation on the sudden before there was time for his passion to cool,
then you should bring in a verdict of manslaughter.

The judge made no reference to reasonable doubt
while charging on provocation. In the final paragraph of the charge, speaking
of jury unanimity, the judge said:

…if any of you has a reasonable doubt as to
the innocence or guilty [sic] of the accused, it is your duty to obey your
conscience and to refuse to be persuaded against your conscience by your fellow
jurors.

The jury requested further instruction
respecting “the legal definition of the term provoke and intent as related to
the non-capital murder

[Page 650]

charge.” A lengthy recharge followed. The judge
instructed the jury that:

…provocation is a defence to this [charge]
in the sense that if you find provocation, the crime can be reduced from murder
to manslaughter.

And again:

Now you’ve got to decide whether an
ordinary person would be deprived of the power of self‑control by reason
of those acts I have just described, then you go on to the second step… and
decide if in fact George Linney was provoked…

In like manner:

It follows that if you answer the second
question in the affirmative and find that George Linney actually acted on the
provocation on the sudden, then you should bring in a verdict of manslaughter.

Reasonable doubt was not mentioned during the
recharge.

The charge and recharge are attacked as
defective for want of adequately relating reasonable doubt to the provocation
defence. An appeal court, in assessing the adequacy of a jury charge, is
looking for the general sense which the words used must have conveyed, in all
probability, to the mind of the jury. The Court must be satisfied that the jury
would understand the onus was on the Crown to prove each issue or negative each
defence beyond a reasonable doubt. They must realize that the reasonable doubt
doctrine is always engaged; that it is not displaced in respect of the
defences. They must be clear in their minds that, if they have reasonable doubt
on any issue, they have the duty to allow the accused to succeed on that issue.

The relevant question is what the jury
understood, not whether or not a particular formula was recited by the judge. A
jury charge is not a formulary and one set of words may well be as good as
another. An appeal court ought not to be astute to draw recondite or precious
distinctions, or to lay down precise formulae for articulating the principles
upon which the jury must be

[Page 651]

instructed. That point was made by the House of
Lords in Mancini v. D.P.P.[1]
in rejecting the submission that the warning as to reasonable doubt must be
repeated again and again while instructing on the various issues.

In the well-known case of R. v. Prince[2], Caldecote L.C.J. held a jury
charge:

…insufficient having regard to the absence
of any direction that, if upon a review of all the evidence, the jury were left
in reasonable doubt whether, even if the appellant’s explanation were not accepted,
the act was provoked, the appellant was entitled to be acquitted of the charge
of murder.

That there should be a particular direction on
reasonable doubt accompanying the instructions on defences is supported by such
cases as R. v. Kovach[3]; R.
v. Harms[4]; R.
v. Illerbrun[5], and
the recent case of R. v. Haight[6].

In Latour v. The King[7], the appellant was convicted of
murder after a trial by jury. He had pleaded self-defence, provocation and
drunkenness. The trial judge properly charged the jury as to the burden of
proof and the benefit of doubt, in accordance with the words of Lord Sankey
L.C. in Woolmington’s case[8]. The
fault alleged, as in the case at bar, was that when the judge later dealt with
the defences, he entirely failed to direct the attention of the jurors, in
their consideration of the plea of provocation, to their duty to give the
appellant the benefit of the doubt, if any, in favour of the lesser charge of
manslaughter.

In Latour, the trial judge had also
charged incorrectly in stating that it was for the jury to say whether or not
the necessary facts had been “established” to warrant a plea of self-defence.

[Page 652]

The word “established” was also used in charging
on provocation. In the present case, although the judge did not use the word “establish,”
upon a fair reading of the entire charge, I cannot escape the conclusion that
when the judge spoke repeatedly of “to find” and “to decide” the jury must have
been left with the impression that there was an onus on the accused to satisfy
them that the killing was provoked or, at least, to decide that issue upon a
balance of probabilities. That is error in that it places a lesser burden on
the Crown than the law requires. Provocation, in the relevant sense, is a
technical concept and not easy to apprehend. The jury was clearly in a state of
some doubt as it asked for further direction on provocation. The danger of the
jury being misled into the belief that there was a burden on the accused would
have been increased by the fact that the accused went into the witness box; see
R. v. Lewis[9]. In
all the circumstances I think that, when instructing the jury as to
provocation, the judge should have told them that the appellant was entitled to
a verdict of manslaughter if they found that the appellant was provoked, or if
they entertained a reasonable doubt on the matter.

Counsel for the Crown contended that Latour’s
case was authority for the proposition that the jury could be instructed as
to reasonable doubt in relation to provocation, either expressly or by clear
implication. I agree with that submission. Counsel then submitted that, in the
present case, where the trial judge specifically instructed the jury with
respect to application of the doctrine of reasonable doubt to the plea of
self-defence and then turned immediately to the alternative verdict of
manslaughter which, he explained, could result if the jury were of the view
that the force used was excessive, or the accused was provoked, the principle
that the accused should have the benefit of the doubt in relation to the issue
of provocation was clearly implied. With respect, I do not think any such
implication arises. On the contrary, the jury, having heard of reasonable doubt
three times in

[Page 653]

relation to self-defence, and at no time in relation
to provocation, could well have concluded that reasonable doubt and provocation
were unrelated. The conclusion was open that self‑defence was dealt with
on one basis, provocation on another.

Counsel for the Crown submitted that even if
there was misdirection, as a matter of law, no substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice resulted. The evidence as to provocation is such, it is contended,
that (i) a properly charged jury could not, as reasonable men, have found
provocation; (ii) that Linney did not act on the sudden and before there was
time for his passion to cool; and (iii) that what is alleged as provocation
cannot be characterized by suddenness, nor did it strike upon a mind unprepared
for it. As to (i), Mr. Justice Robertson, of the British Columbia Court of
Appeal, said that the evidence of provocation was strong and I agree with him.
The point raised in (ii) is something for a jury to decide. The argument on
(iii) proceeds on the basis that because Linney had suffered insults and hurt
from Strandlund more or less routinely for a considerable period, he would be
inured to invective and abuse, so his mind would not be unprepared for what
befell him on the night of May 24, 1974. I do not think that is inevitably so
and, in any case, it is a question for the jury. Anyone may have a breaking
point. I do not think that evidence of earlier bullying negates the possibility
of provocation in a legal sense, or in any way makes the accused volens. I
do not think one can properly say that a reasonable jury, properly directed,
could not on the evidence adduced at the trial of the appellant have done
otherwise than find the appellant guilty of murder.

I would accordingly allow the appeal, set aside
the conviction, and direct a new trial.

[Page 654]

The judgment of Ritchie and de Grandpré JJ. was
delivered by

DE GRANDPRE J. (dissenting)—I have had
the advantage of reading the reasons prepared for delivery by my brother
Dickson.

Like him, my guiding lights are two well
recognized principles: that the accused must have received a fair trial in the
sense that the jury has been made to understand the relevant law, and that an
Appeal Court must be careful not to impose upon trial judges iron-bound
formulae against which must be examined jury charges. It is the reconciliation
of these two principles that gives rise to differences of opinion.

Appellant has relied heavily on the unanimous
decision of this Court in Latour v. The King[10], where the judgment was delivered by
Fauteux J. as he then was. A reading and re-reading of the charges in Latour
and in the case at bar has convinced me that the differences between the
two cases are so considerable that it is quite possible to reach here a
different result. The Court in Latour was in the presence of numerous
misdirections and reached its conclusion in the light of their gravity and of
their combined effect. Two of these misdirections are relevant to the case at
bar:

(1) the use by the trial judge of the word
“established” in a context which suggested that the duty to establish was on
the accused;

(2) the failure in examining the defence of
provocation to make it plain that the principle as to reasonable doubt was
applicable thereto.

The judgment of the Court deals at great length
with the first of these misdirections and concludes at p. 27:

For, once properly instructed as to what
the law recognizes as ingredients of self‑defence or of provocation, the
accurate question for the jury is not whether the accused has established such
ingredients but whether the evidence indicates them. And they, then,
must be directed that, should they find affirmatively or be left in
doubt on the question put to them, the accused is entitled, in the

[Page 655]

case of self-defence to a complete
acquittal, or in the case of provocation to an acquittal of the major offence
of murder.

(The underlining is mine.) Repeatedly, in his
charge, the trial judge in Latour had used the expressions “if you
decide”, “if you find”, “if you accept”, “should you decide” and these
expressions are not criticized by the judgment of Latour which, on the
contrary, asserts that the jury “must be directed that, should they find
affirmatively…”. The only criticism of the Court is directed to the use of the
word “established” in a context indicating that the burden was on the accused.
We have no such misdirection in our case and it is not possible to find fault
with the trial judge for having used the words “find” and “decide” which have
clearly been approved in Latour.

The second relevant misdirection in Latour is
the one of concern to us, namely as to reasonable doubt. In Latour, reasonable
doubt had been referred to only in one part of the charge, that is at the
outset when the judge was outlining to the jury the basic principles of law. It
was not mentioned again when dealing with the defence of drunkenness, nor was
it mentioned when dealing with self-defence or provocation. In my view, the
situation is radically different here. After having in the first two paragraphs
of his charge underlined the role of the jury in our law, and the functions of
the judge and of the jury, his Lordship continues:

Now let’s deal a bit with the general law.
First of all the presumption of innocence. The golden thread of this
presumption is woven deep into the fabric of our law; simply put it means an
accused person is presumed to be innocent until the Crown has satisfied you
beyond a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. It is a presumption which remains
with the accused from the beginning of the case until the end. This presumption
only ceases to apply if having considered all the evidence you are satisfied
with the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Now I should like to talk
to you about the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The onus or burden
of proof of the guilt of the accused person rests upon the Crown and never
shifts. There is no burden on the accused person to prove his innocence. The
Crown must

[Page 656]

prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused person is guilty of the offence with which he is charged before he can
be convicted. If you have a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused
committed the offence with which he is charged, it is your duty to give the
accused the benefit of the doubt and find him not guilty.

Again, reasonable doubt is mentioned when
dealing with the credibility of witnesses:

If you have reasonable doubt as to the
accuracy of the evidence given by the witnesses for the Crown or the weight you
should give to such evidence, you must give the benefit of that doubt to the
accused and not to the Crown.

When dealing with the rule as to circumstantial
evidence, the judge reiterates that the accused is entitled to the benefit of
the doubt.

After a full review of the evidence, the judge
examines the various defences raised. Three times, he refers to reasonable
doubt on the issue of self-defence, concluding on this point with the following
words:

If on the whole of the evidence and
considering what I have said, there is reasonable doubt in your mind that the
accused was acting in self-defence then you should bring in a verdict of not
guilty.

Immediately afterwards he turns to the issue of
manslaughter:

I would like to deal with manslaughter.
Even after considering all the above you may believe the accused is not guilty
of the non-capital murder as I have described it but neither is he entitled to
be acquitted on the grounds of self-defence. In that event you should consider
whether he is guilty of manslaughter, for one of two reasons. First, that
although the accused, Linney, did act in self-defence the force used was
excessive in the circumstances. If you find that, bring a verdict of
manslaughter. Or second, that the accused was provoked into committing the
unlawful act because of the actions of the deceased, Strandlund within the
legal meaning of that word as I will now discuss it with you.

[Page 657]

Follows a lengthy discussion of the principles
relevant to a plea of provocation, after which he concludes:

In summary, you may bring in a verdict of
manslaughter if you find the accused acted out of self-defence but used
excessive force in the circumstances or the accused was provoked into killing
Strandlund as I have described provocation to you. This leaves you with three
possible verdicts. 1) guilty as charged. 2) not guilty. 3) guilty of
manslaughter.

In the closing remarks, I find the following
words completing a short summary on the theory of the defence:

Thus the defence suggests there is a
reasonable doubt as to whether or not Linney acted in self-defence and if you
agree, then Linney ought to be acquitted.

The final instruction was, of course, about the
desirability of unanimity:

Since this is a criminal trial it is
necessary that you should be unanimous in your verdict, in other words it is
necessary that each and all of you should agree on whatever verdict you may see
fit to determine. Unless you are unanimous in finding the accused not guilty
you cannot acquit him nor can you find a verdict of guilty unless you are
unanimously agreed that he is guilty. While it is very desirable that you
should reach an unanimous verdict of guilty or not guilty, never the less if
any of you has a reasonable doubt as to the innocence or guilty of the accused,
it is your duty to obey your conscience and to refuse to be persuaded against
your conscience by your fellow jurors. However let me urge you to make every
effort to reach a conclusion one way or the other. When you retire to the jury
room you may take with you the Indictment and the Exhibits and once again I
will remind you that you have three possible verdicts: guilty as charged; not
guilty or guilty of manslaughter.

I find it impossible to conclude, on this charge
read as a whole, that the pertinent directions as to reasonable doubt were not
plainly given. The “golden thread” of the presumption of innocence to which the
trial judge referred at the outset is ever present in his remarks. The benefit
of the doubt rule is repeatedly brought home to the jury. Admittedly, the words
“benefit of the doubt” were

[Page 658]

not used immediately next to the word
“provocation” but the meaning is plainly there for any reasonable jury to grasp
and understand.

More than once, the three possible verdicts are
mentioned:

guilty of murder,

guilty of manslaughter,

not guilty.

As to the first one, the words used are in the
best tradition of our criminal law. As to the third, again no valid criticism
may be proffered: the benefit of the doubt is to play in favour of the accused
whether applied to the evidence generally or more particularly to the plea of
self‑defence. Between these two extremes stands the possible verdict of
manslaughter and I cannot bring myself to believe that, instructed as they
were, the members of the jury could avoid the conclusion that the doctrine of
proof beyond reasonable doubt applied also to that verdict.

The more so, if it is noted that on more than
one occasion the charge deals with the verdict of manslaughter by mentioning in
the same breath: excessive use of force in self-defence and provocation. The
jurors knew that they should bring in a verdict of not guilty if on the whole
of the evidence, they had a reasonable doubt in their minds that the accused
was acting in self‑defence. A logical and necessary corollary was that
the same respect of the reasonable doubt rule was to be shown by them when
dealing with the use of excessive force in self‑defence; thus, on that
aspect of the case, when dealing with the possible verdict of manslaughter,
reasonable doubt was plainly in the picture. To hold that it was also plainly
there in relation to the other aspect of the possible verdict of manslaughter,
namely the plea of provocation, is simply to have faith in the common sense of
the jurors.

For these reasons, I am of the view that the
situation here is very different from what it was in

[Page 659]

the case of Latour. I cannot but agree
with the Court of Appeal which was unanimous in upholding the verdict.

I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Arson—Charge to the
jury—Complaint of non-direction—Appellant alleging that matters vital to the
defence were not put to the jury—Evidence as to lack of motive not included in
charge—Criminal Code , ss. 389 , 391 , 618(1) (a).

Appellant was convicted of arson. The case
for the Crown rested on the contention that the fire had been deliberately set
and, as the evidence as to the identity of appellant as the man who set it was
almost entirely circumstantial, on motive and opportunity. Appellant had a
number of creditors and although none of them appeared to have been pressing
him at the time of the fire there was evidence that he was in financial difficulties.
After the fire appellant filed a claim of loss which did not appear to be
excessive and indeed before the fire he had received an offer to purchase at a
sum higher than the estimate on which his claim was based. To this he had made
a counter offer which was not accepted. The Crown also alleged exclusive
opportunity. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal but Dubin J.A. dissented
on the grounds that there was non-direction amounting to misdirection in the
trial judge’s charge to the jury in that he failed to adequately place before
the jury and refer the jury to evidence vital to their determination of the
guilt or innocence of the accused and failed to instruct the jury adequately on
the issue of opportunity. The accused brought an appeal as of right under s.
618(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .

Held (Laskin
C.J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Spence, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: Appellant
conceded that the fire had been set deliberately but the evidence as to the
identity of the man who set it was almost entirely circumstantial. There was no
complaint of the

[Page 623]

trial judge’s direction in respect of
circumstantial evidence. The only error in this regard was favourable to the
appellant. In presenting a defence to a jury it is the trial judge’s duty not
only to outline the theories of the defence but to give the jury matters of
evidence essential in arriving at a just conclusion in reference to that
defence. However the evidence in this case justified a properly instructed
jury in concluding that the appellant had the exclusive opportunity to set this
fire and did set it and the dissenting judge, like the other members of the
Court of Appeal, was of opinion that the trial judge had fairly set forth the
respective theories of the Crown and the defence. The determination of the
appeal therefore rested on deciding whether or not the reasons for dissent
raised questions showing that the trial judge failed to give the jury “matters
of evidence essential in arriving at a just conclusion in reference to that
defence”. While the trial judge failed to refer on the question of motive to
appellant’s refusal of the offer to purchase prior to the fire, in seeking to
prove the identity of the culprit motive was immaterial if the opportunity to
set the fire was shown to have been exclusive. The overriding consideration in
assessing such errors as those referred to in the dissent was that the events
on the day of the fire were unfolded at the trial by witnesses who had played a
part in them. If the trial judge omitted from his direction the matters
complained of in dissent because he did not consider them essential to the jury
reaching a just conclusion the Supreme Court should not substitute its view for
that of the trial judge as to what were and what were not essential matters of
evidence to be included in a direction which met with the approval of
appellant’s counsel at trial and with the majority in the Court of Appeal.

Per Laskin
C.J., dissenting: For the reasons of Dubin J.A. dissenting in the Court
of Appeal the judgments below should be set aside and a new trial ordered.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal

jury. Appeal dismissed, Laskin C.J.

Edward Then, for the respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—For the
reasons given by Dubin J.A., dissenting in the Ontario Court of Appeal, I would
set aside the judgment of that Court and the conviction and order a new trial.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Spence, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario
dismissing the appellant’s appeal from the conviction of arson entered against
him at his trial before His Honour Judge Dick sitting with a jury.

Mr. Justice Dubin delivered separate and
dissenting reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal of Ontario, expressing the opinion that the
appeal should be allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. The
appeal accordingly comes to this Court as of right in accordance with the
provisions of s. 618(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  and the question
of law raised by the dissenting opinion is recorded in the order for judgment
of the Court of Appeal as follows:

…Mr. Justice Dubin, dissenting therefrom
and expressing the opinion that the appeal should be allowed, the conviction
set aside and a new trial directed on the following grounds, in law, namely:
there was non-direction amounting to misdirection in the learned trial judge’s
charge to the jury in that he failed to adequately place the defence before the
jury and refer the jury to evidence vital to their determination of the guilt
or innocence of the accused and failed to instruct the jury adequately on the
issue of opportunity.

The reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal
have now been conveniently reported in (1974), 6 O.R. (2d) 496, (hereinafter
referred to as the “report”), and I therefore feel relieved of the obligation
of reciting the facts giving rise to this prosecution in any more than skeleton
form.

[Page 625]

The evidence showed that the appellant was the
sole owner of the property destroyed by fire and that he was in the course of
effecting repairs on the house situate thereon at the time of the fire. On the
afternoon of February 21, 1972, the appellant, together with his common-law
wife and another woman had been in the house during the afternoon and the women
had left for about an hour in order to go shopping during which period the
appellant was left alone. There is no doubt that there were flammable materials
available on the premises which the appellant accounted for as materials which
were necessary in the work he was doing. The two women returned at
approximately 5 p.m. and
assisted in cleaning up while the appellant was doing some painting work. Later
in the afternoon they worked together with the appellant in replacing railing
on the staircase.

The two women and the appellant left the house
at 7 p.m. at which time neither of the women observed or detected any evidence
as to fire on the premises. They also stated that when they left the lights had
been turned out and the doors locked.

The evidence as to when the fire was first
observed is somewhat conflicting, ranging in time from 8 to 10 p.m., at which
latter time the fire department was in fact called in, and when the firemen
arrived they found the doors locked as well as the windows, and although a bolt
to one of the cellar windows was missing, it, as well as all the other windows
in the cellar, had been covered over with cloth which was nailed down and which
did not appear to have been displaced.

The house in question had been purchased by the
appellant in October 1971 for $16,600 and he stated that it was purchased for
the purpose of resale and he had made considerable improvement on it since his
purchase. The property was insured for $20,000 in November, 1971, which was the
amount recommended by the insurance agent as replacement cost. After the fire
the appellant filed a proof of loss based on an estimate of $15,500 which does
not appear to have been exorbitant. It is also noteworthy that before the fire
the appellant received an offer to purchase in the sum of

[Page 626]

$19,000 and made a counter offer of $20,500
which was not accepted.

The appellant had a number of creditors and
although none of them appeared to have been pressing him at the time of the
fire, there is evidence upon which the jury would have been justified in
concluding that he was in financial difficulties.

It was conceded on behalf of the appellant that
the fire had been set deliberately but the evidence as to the identity of the
appellant as the man who set it was almost entirely circumstantial. There is,
however, no complaint by the appellant as to the trial judge’s instructions to
the jury in respect of circumstantial evidence and he was in fact more than
favourable to the defence in this regard as he included in his charge the
caution that it was “dangerous to convict” on such evidence. This was an error
but one of such a character as to colour the jury’s approach to the evidence
and to materially weaken the Crown’s case.

I am familiar with the cases in this Court
concerning the duty of a trial judge in instructing a jury which are referred
to by Mr. Justice Dubin in his dissenting opinion at pp. 509 and 510 of the
report, and I agree with Mr. Justice Spence when he said, in Colpitts v.
The Queen[2], at
p. 752, that it is part of the trial judge’s duty in addressing the jury
“to not only outline the theories of the defence but to give the jury matters
of evidence essential in arriving at a just conclusion in reference to that
defence.” (The italics are my own.)

The indictment charged that the appellant

...on or about the 21st of February,
1972…did unlawfully and wilfully, without legal justification or excuse, and
without colour of right, and with intent to defraud, set fire to a certain
building, to wit: a dwelling, the property of the said Gustave Imrich…

[Page 627]

In the course of his dissenting reasons for
judgment, Mr. Justice Dubin included the following passage:

The learned trial judge in his charge to
the jury very fairly set forth the respective theories of the Crown and of the
defence and did so with a very even hand. However, with respect to the learned
trial judge, he did not draw to the attention of the jury evidence which was
vital to the defence and which bore directly on the issue of guilt or innocence
in this case, nor did he relate such evidence to the legal propositions which
he very fully placed before the jury.

In my opinion the evidence as a whole was such
as to justify a properly instructed jury in concluding that the accused did in
fact have the exclusive opportunity to set this fire and that he did set it.
This was also the opinion of all judges in the Court of Appeal, including
Mr. Justice Dubin who stated, at p. 511 of the report:

On the evidence, it was open to the jury
properly instructed to have concluded that the accused did in fact have the
exclusive opportunity to set this fire. It was open to them to reject the
evidence of the witness who testified as to the open window and the presence of
lights at a material time. On all the other evidence, including evidence to
which I have not specifically referred, a jury could conclude that the accused
was the only person who had the opportunity to set the fire, even though it was
open to them to find to the contrary.

Having regard to the fact that Mr. Justice
Dubin, like other members of the Court, was also of opinion that the trial
judge fairly set forth the respective theories of the Crown and of the defence,
it appears to me to follow that the determination of this appeal resolves
itself into deciding whether or not the dissenting reasons for judgment raise
questions showing that the trial judge failed to give the jury “matters of
evidence essential in arriving at a just conclusion in reference to that defence”.

The first error complained of by Dubin J.A.,
related entirely to the question of motive in that he considered that the trial
judge should have referred the jury to the evidence that the accused, shortly
before the fire, had refused an offer to

[Page 628]

purchase the premises for $19,000. In seeking to
prove the identity of the culprit in such a case as this, motive is immaterial
if the opportunity to set the fire is shown to have been exclusive. In my view
the whole theory of the Crown was that Imrich had the exclusive opportunity to
set this fire and on this issue instructions relating to motive cannot be
characterized as “matters of evidence essential in arriving at a just
conclusion”. It seems to me that such an instruction could only have had the effect
of leaving the jury with the impression that lack of motive was of importance
even where exclusive opportunity was proven.

Dubin J.A. further took exception to the fact
that the trial judge had failed to instruct the jury with regard to the
evidence of one witness who testified to seeing a window open and lights in the
window after the accused and his two friends had left the house. He referred to
this as “vital” evidence and put the matter thus:

If the jury accepted the testimony of this
one witness then the Crown’s theory that the accused had the exclusive
opportunity to set this fire would have had to fail.

The evidence as to there being a light in the
house after Imrich had left is conflicting and confusing and it is to be
remembered that the witnesses were testifying in June, 1973, to the events of
the evening of February 21, 1972. After the lapse of this period of time, it is not surprising that
there were differences between witnesses. Everything turned on the exact time
when the lights were allegedly seen and the witness to whom Mr. Justice Dubin
referred was basing his testimony on his recollection of the time when a
certain television program was being viewed by his children. Acceptance of this
evidence leads to the conclusion that some unknown arsonist had broken into the
locked premises for the purpose of setting the fire and had elected to turn on
the lights although there were no curtains to shield the window. In my view
this is a highly speculative conclusion and is inconsistent with the statement
of the appellant and his two friends that they had locked all doors and windows
on leaving, which

[Page 629]

must be viewed in conjunction with the evidence
of the firemen who testified that the doors and windows were locked when they
arrived except one on which the locking mechanism had rotted, and who further
testified that the snow piled outside the cellar windows was not disturbed and
there were no indications of forcible entry. The trial judge did not consider
the evidence as to the light to be essential and as a majority of the Court of
Appeal appeared to have agreed with him, I would not interfere on this ground.

Dubin J.A. took the further ground that the
trial judge had erred in failing to mention to the jury the fact that Mr.
Imrich’s two women friends were on the premises for a considerable time after
the fire was alleged to have been set and detected no evidence of fire. With
the greatest respect I do not share the view that this was in any sense an
essential matter for the defence.

Further objection was taken to the charge of the
trial judge in that he failed to instruct the jury that there was no direct
evidence that the premises were set fire to at the time alleged by the Crown as
the scientific evidence was consistent with it having been set either before
the accused arrived or after he left the premises. The appellant was in the
premises for an hour alone in the afternoon of February 21 at a time when
flammable material was available for setting the fire; there is no suggestion
that anyone was in the house in the morning, and I have dealt with the evidence
suggesting that someone broke into the premises after the departure of Imrich
and his friends. There is in my view no evidence to support the suggestion that
the fire was set before the appellant arrived or after he left and, in my view,
it is not necessary, where a strong case of circumstantial evidence has been
presented, for the Crown to exclude every speculative possibility which is
consistent with innocence.

Finally, Mr. Justice Dubin objected that the
trial judge in addressing the jury should have referred to threats received by
the appellant from time to time, but there is nothing in the evidence to
connect these threats with the fire and I do not

[Page 630]

consider that reference to them was “essential
in arriving at a just conclusion”.

As is noted in the reasons for judgment of both
Mr. Justice Schroeder and Mr. Justice Dubin, the learned trial judge failed to
instruct the jury with respect to s. 391  of the Criminal Code  which reads
as follows:

391. Where a
person is charged with an offence under section 389  or 390 , evidence that he is
the holder of or is named as the beneficiary under a policy of fire insurance
relating to the property in respect of which the offence is alleged to have
been committed is, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary and where
intent to defraud is material, proof of intent to defraud.

The result of this omission was that the jury
was not made aware of the statutory presumption of “proof of intent to defraud”
arising out of the fact that the premises were insured. I agree with Mr.
Justice Schroeder that this lapse on the part of the judge was favourable to
the appellant, but in any event the jury had before it the fact of the
existence of the insurance policy and that the appellant filed a proof of loss
based on an estimate of $15,500. If the members of the jury believed that
Imrich set the fire, they could also conclude, without the aid of s. 391  that
he was claiming a substantial sum of money from the insurers in respect of a
fire which he himself had set and that that was only consistent with an
intention to defraud the insurance company. The jury’s verdict must be read in
light of the fact that they obviously disbelieved the appellant’s denial under
oath of having set the fire or having had anything to do with its ignition.

There is no complaint as to the judge’s charge
in regard to this evidence, and in my view the overriding consideration in
assessing the errors alleged by Dubin J.A., must be that the events of the
afternoon and evening of February 21, 1972 were unfolded before the judge and
jury from the mouths of the witnesses who had played a part in them. The trial
lasted for eight days and the testimony of the witnesses was succeeded by lengthy
addresses from counsel for the defence and the Crown in which all phases of the
evidence were

[Page 631]

made the subject of comment. At the end of this
long trial the judge was required to charge the jury and there is no doubt that
he omitted to mention the matters complained of by the dissenting judge in
appeal; but it can only be concluded that in the context of all the evidence
which he had heard, he did not consider these matters essential to the jury
reaching a just decision, and at the conclusion of his remarks counsel for the
appellant stated “The defence has no objection to Your Honour’s charge”.

I am conscious of the fact that counsel’s
failure to object to the charge does not preclude the allegation of errors on
appeal, but it is a circumstance which, taken together with the opinion of the
majority of the Court of Appeal, means that this Court is being invited to
substitute its view for that of the trial judge as to what were and what were
not essential matters to be included in a charge which had met with the
approval of the appellant’s counsel at trial and which was endorsed by the
majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario. Notwithstanding the persuasive
opinion of Mr. Justice Dubin and the forceful argument presented by counsel for
the appellant, I am not prepared to adopt this course.

For these reasons I would dismiss this appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Evidence—Hearsay—Statement by
deceased made to counsel of the accused—Requirements for admission of the
statement—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, s. 610.

The respondent O’Brien and one Jensen were
jointly charged with possession of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking.
O’Brien was arrested and convicted; Jensen fled the country. Following the
respondent’s conviction, Jensen returned to Canada but charges against him were stayed. Later on, Jensen told the
respondent’s counsel, Mr. Simons, that he alone had committed the act. He
agreed to testify to that effect but died before the hearing. The British
Columbia Court of Appeal having granted leave to adduce fresh evidence,
Mr. Simons repeated Jensen’s statement before that Court. On the strength
of Mr. Simons’ testimony the Court allowed the appeal and directed an
acquittal. Leave to appeal to this Court was granted on the question whether
Mr. Simons’ evidence was inadmissible as hearsay.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

It is settled law that evidence of a
statement made to a witness by a person who is not himself called as a witness
is hearsay and inadmissible when the object of the evidence is to establish the
truth of what is contained in the statement. The evidence being offered by
Mr. Simons to prove that Jensen and not O’Brien had committed the act, is
a classic example of hearsay and is inadmissible unless it falls within an
exception to the hearsay rule.

The respondent sought to support the
admissibility of Mr. Simons’ testimony as falling within an exception to
the hearsay rule. This Court considered that the rule established in The
Sussex Peerage case, (1844), 8 E.R. 1034, as to absolute exclusion of
declarations against penal interest should not be followed. However, a
declaration against penal interest should meet certain

[Page 592]

requirements before being held admissible.
These requirements are, inter alia: (1) the fact stated should
have been “to the deceased’s immediate prejudice” at the time when he stated
it; (2) when the deceased made the statement he should have known the fact to
be against his interest; (3) the declaration would have to be made to such a
person and in such circumstances that the declarant should have apprehended a
vulnerability to penal consequences as a result; (4) the vulnerability to penal
consequences would have to be not remote. Jensen did not make his declaration
of guilt until ten months after the respondent had been convicted and not until
almost six months after the charges which he himself faced had been stayed. He
made his statement in the privacy of Mr. Simons’ office and refused to
swear an affidavit. His obvious desire was not to create damaging evidence, detrimental
to his penal interest. Viewed from Jensen’s subjectivity, the statement was not
against his interest. Failure to fall within the exception is fatal to the
admission of Mr. Simons’ hearsay. The evidence being inadmissible,
s. 610  of the Criminal Code  does not apply.

APPEAL from a judgment of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal which, after hearing new evidence, set aside the
conviction and directed an acquittal. Appeal allowed and conviction restored.

[Page 593]

M.M. de Weerdt, Q.C., and H.J. Wruck, for
the appellant.

John D. McAlpine, Q.C., and Keith R.
Hamilton, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON J.—Martin Edward O’Brien and Paul Jensen
were jointly charged with possession of a narcotic for the purpose of
trafficking. O’Brien was arrested and convicted; Jensen fled the country.
Following O’Brien’s conviction, Jensen returned to Canada. He told O’Brien’s counsel, Mr. Simons, that he, Jensen, alone
had committed the act. He agreed to testify to that effect. Before the hearing,
Jensen died. Leave to adduce fresh evidence was obtained from the British
Columbia Court of Appeal. Mr. Simons repeated Jensen’s statement before
that Court. On the strength of Mr. Simons’ testimony the Court allowed the
appeal and directed an acquittal. The substantial question upon which this
Crown appeal turns is whether Mr. Simons’ evidence was inadmissible as
hearsay.

Leave to appeal against the judgment of the
Court of Appeal was granted on the following question of law:

That the Court of Appeal for British Columbia erred at law in holding
that hearsay evidence given before that Court by Sidney B. Simons pursuant to
leave granted in accordance with section 610  of the Criminal Code  would
have been capable of raising a reasonable doubt in the mind of the trial judge
as to the guilt of the accused.

Mr. Justice McFarlane, of the British
Columbia Court, was of opinion that the evidence of Mr. Simons was not
hearsay.

It is settled law that evidence of a statement
made to a witness by a person who is not himself called as a witness is hearsay
and inadmissible when the object of the evidence is to establish the truth of
what is contained in the statement; it is not hearsay and is admissible when it
is proposed to establish by the evidence, not the truth of the statement but
the fact that it was made. This succinct formulation of the hearsay rule which
one

[Page 594]

finds in Subramaniam v. Public Prosecutor[1], at p. 970, was repeated with approval
in Ratten v. Reginam[2], at
p. 805. The reasons supporting the exclusion of hearsay evidence were
stated by Lord Normand in Teper v. The Queen[3], at p. 486:

The rule against the admission of hearsay
evidence is fundamental. It is not the best evidence and it is not delivered on
oath. The truthfulness and accuracy of the person whose words are spoken to by
another witness cannot be tested by cross-examination, and the light which his
demeanour would throw on his testimony is lost.

The evidence of Mr. Simons was offered for
the purpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted. It was sought, through
that evidence, to prove that Jensen, and not O’Brien, had committed the act
with which O’Brien stood charged, or at least to raise a reasonable doubt as to
O’Brien’s guilt. That is the classic touchstone of inadmissible hearsay.

Before this Court counsel for O’Brien sought to
support the admissibility of Mr. Simons’ testimony as falling within an
exception to the hearsay rule. It was contended that a hearsay statement by a
deceased person against his interest constitutes such an exception. The
exception rests upon necessity and presumed trustworthiness. The witness is
dead; there is no other evidence available on the point. It is considered that
declarations made by persons against their own interests are “extremely
unlikely to be false” per Fletcher Moulton L.J. in Tucker v. Oldbury
Urban Council[4], at
p. 321.

In several of the early cases the exception is
expressed in broad language. Thus in Standen v. Standen[5], in which the validity of a marriage
was at issue Lord Kenyon heard the evidence of Charles Standen that the banns
had not been duly published three times. Standen testified that he

[Page 595]

had been told by the clergyman that a friend of
the wife forbade them the second time they were published. As to this, Lord
Kenyon said, at p. 48:

If the entry in the register was not truly
stated, the clergyman was guilty of felony, and he put himself in a dangerous
situation by making such a confession as that stated by the witness Charles
Standen.

In Middleton v. Malton[6], secondary evidence of the contents
of a private book was received. Bayley J. said, at p. 323:

It is a general principle of evidence, that
declarations or statements of deceased persons are admissible when they appear
to have been made against their interest.

and Parke J. said, at p. 327:

The general rule undoubtedly is, that facts
must be proved by testimony upon oath. This case, however, falls within the
exception necessarily engrafted upon that rule, viz. that an admission of a
fact made by a deceased person, which is against the interest of the party
making it at the time, is evidence of that fact as between third persons.

In Powell v. Harper[7], Parke J. allowed a witness to
testify as to what he had been told by one Askins who, it was said, had stolen
a number of rosewood chair tops. Mr. Justice Parke dealt with an objection
to the admission of this evidence by saying: “Yes. What he said is evidence to
shew that he committed the larceny.”

The question whether declarations against
interest extended to declarations against penal interest as well as
declarations against pecuniary interest was considered in The Sussex Peerage[8]. In that case, which the Crown asks
the Court to follow, it was held by all of the Lords that the declarations of
deceased persons are not generally admissible unless they are against the
pecuniary interest of the party making them. Lord Campbell said, at p. 1045:

[Page 596]

But as to the point of interest, I have
always understood the rule to be, that the declaration, to be admissible, must
have been one which was contrary to the interests of the party making it, in a
pecuniary point of view; and, with the exception of Standen v. Standen, I
do not know any case which appears to break in upon that principle. I think it
would lead to most inconvenient consequences, both to individuals and to the
public, if we were to say that the apprehension of a criminal prosecution was
an interest which ought to let in such declarations in evidence.

Reasons in support of the more limited rule were
advanced by Lord Brougham in the same case in the following strong language, at
p. 1045:

To say, if a man should confess a felony
for which he would be liable to prosecution, that therefore, the instant the
grave closes over him all that was said by him is to be taken as evidence in
every action and prosecution against another person, is one of the most
monstrous and untenable propositions that can be advanced.

and by Lord Denman in these words:

With regard to declarations made by persons
in extremis, supposing all necessary matters concurred, such as actual
danger, death following it, and a full apprehension, at the time, of the danger
and of death, such declarations can be received in evidence, but all these
things must concur to render such declarations admissible. Such evidence,
however, ought to be received with caution, because it is subject to no cross‑examination.

The judgment of Hamilton L.J. (later Lord
Sumner) in Ward v. H.S. Pitt & Co.; Lloyd v. Powell Duffryn Steam Coal
Company[9] (reversed
on other grounds[10]) deals
at length with the admissibility of statements made by deceased persons and
contains the following well-known passage with respect to the rule and its
theoretical base:

It has long been held that the interest to
which the statement must be adverse must be a pecuniary one or, which is only a
species of the same genus, a proprietary one. A statement would not be against
interest if only generally criminatory; one “which might in some way or other
injuriously affect the interest of the party” (per Lord Lyndhurst L.C., Lords
Brougham and Denman in

[Page 597]

the Sussex Peerage Case) or
which might be prejudicial to reputation or social consideration.

The reasons given for admitting such
evidence at all shew the stringency of these essential conditions. The case is
exceptional, not to say anomalous. The evidence thus admitted is hearsay and
the person on whose credit it rests is beyond cross-examination and is not even
seen by the jury. The ground is that it is very unlikely that a man would say
falsely something as to which he knows the truth, if his statement tends to his
own pecuniary disadvantage. As a reason this seems sordid and unconvincing. Men
lie for so many reasons and some for no reason at all; and some tell the truth
without thinking or even in spite of thinking about their pockets, but it is
too late to question this piece of eighteenth century philosophy.

The Sussex Peerage case has found some support in the American courts. In Donnelly
v. United States[11], Mr. Justice
Pitney, for the majority of the United States Supreme Court, excluded the
confession of a third party, since deceased, to the crime with which the
appellant was charged. In so doing, he noted the chief grounds of the exclusion
of hearsay evidence. He referred to the evidence being without the sanction of
an oath, the lack of responsibility on the part of the declarant for error or
falsification and the absence of opportunity “to observe the demeanour and
temperament of the witness and to search his motives and test his accuracy and
veracity by cross-examination.”

In Donnelly’s case, Mr. Justice
Holmes, with whom Mr. Justice Lurton and Mr. Justice Hughes concurred,
disagreed with the majority opinion in a brief but trenchant dissent.

Recently, in United States v. Harris[12], Chief Justice Burger observed that
the implication of Donnelly’s case that statements against penal
interest are without value and per se inadmissible had been widely
criticized. He continued, at p. 584: “Whether or not Donnelly is to
survive as a rule of evidence in federal trials, it should not be

[Page 598]

extended to.…”

In Donnelly, Mr. Justice Pitney said
that there was, at that time, a “great and practically unanimous” weight of
authority in the state Courts against admitting evidence of confessions of
third parties made out of court and tending to exonerate the accused. That
unanimity has disappeared: Hines v. Commonwealth[13]; Sutter v. Easterly[14]; People v. Lettrich[15]; People v. Spriggs[16]; People v. Brown[17]; Blocker v. State[18]; McClain v. Anderson Free Press[19].

In Scolari v. United States[20] the United
 States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, followed Donnelly,
feeling bound so to do, but stated at the same time:

We leave to a more propitious occasion the
question as to how old, or how badly reasoned, or both, a Supreme Court
decision on a question of evidence must be before we are to feel free to refuse
to follow it.

Dean Wigmore has made a devastating onslaught on
a rule which would admit declarations against pecuniary interest but deny
admission to declarations against penal interest (5 Wigmore (3d)
paras. 1476, 1477). His attack is founded upon logic and upon the
historical argument that The Sussex Peerage case was a departure from
the earlier rule that admissions against interest generally were accepted in a
proper case; The Sussex Peerage case was a “backward step,” in the words
of Traynor J. in People v. Spriggs, supra. Dean Wigmore is not alone in
his reproach: see Baker, The Hearsay Rule, 64; Morgan “Declarations
Against Interest”, 5 Vand. L. Rev. 451; Jefferson, “Declarations Against
Interest; an Exception to the Hearsay Rule”, 58 Harv. L. Rev. 1.

[Page 599]

The effect of the rule in The Sussex Peerage case,
as it has been generally understood, is to render admissible a statement by a
deceased that he had received payment of a debt from another or that he held a
parcel of land as tenant and not as owner, but to render inadmissible a
confession by a deceased that he and not someone else was the real perpetrator
of the crime. The distinction is arbitrary and tenuous. There is little or no
reason why declarations against penal interest and those against pecuniary or
proprietary interest should not stand on the same footing. A person is as
likely to speak the truth in a matter affecting his liberty as in a matter
affecting his pocketbook. For these reasons and the ever-present possibility
that a rule of absolute prohibition could lead to grave injustice I would hold
that, in a proper case, a declaration against penal interest is admissible
according to the law of Canada; the rule as to absolute exclusion of
declarations against penal interest, established in The Sussex Peerage case,
should not be followed.

There is a further question. Can it be said that
Jensen’s declaration to Mr. Simons qualifies as a declaration against
penal interest? The requirements to be met before admission of an extra
judicial statement were stated by Hamilton L.J. in Ward v. H.S. Pitt &
Co.; Lloyd v. Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Company, supra. In Demeter v.
The Queen[21], this
Court held that the principles enunciated by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in
that case furnished a valuable guide for consideration in the event this Court
should determine that a declaration against penal interest was not to be held
inadmissible under the rule against the reception of hearsay evidence.

The second and third requirements in Ward’s case
were:

2. It is essential that such fact should
have been “to the deceased’s immediate prejudice,” that is against his interest
at the time when he stated it. If it may be construed for his interest or
against it (Massey v. Allen) or may only be against his interest in
certain future events (ex parte Edwards) it is inadmissible.

[Page 600]

3. It is essential that the deceased should
have known the fact to be against his interest when he made it, because it is
on the guarantee of truth based on a man’s conscious statement of a fact, “even
though it be to his own hindrance,” that the whole theory of admissibility
depends. It is “a necessary element, that the subject-matter of the
declaration…must have been within the direct personal knowledge of the person
making the declaration” (per Lord Selborne L.C. in Sturla v. Freccia);
“to support the admissibility it must be shewn that the statement was, to
the knowledge of the deceased, contrary to his interest” (per Fletcher Moulton
in Tucker v. Oldbury Urban Council, [1912] 2 K.B. 317,321).

The first and second principles enunciated by
the Ontario Court of Appeal in Demeter were, in part:

1. The declaration would have to be made to
such a person and in such circumstances that the declarant should have
apprehended a vulnerability to penal consequences as a result.

2. The vulnerability to penal consequences
would have to be not remote.

In the case at bar, Jensen did not make his
declaration of guilt until ten months after the respondent had been convicted
and sentenced and not until almost six months after the charges which he
himself faced had been stayed.

It might be useful to recall the chronology and
the time intervals:


 
  
  December 13, 1972
  
  
  Date of alleged offence. Jensen left the country upon hearing that
  O’Brien had been arrested.
  
 
 
  
  April 2, 1974
  
  
  O’Brien convicted.
  
 
 
  
  April 11, 1974
  
  
  Jensen returned to Canada and was arrested.
  
 
 
  
  April 26, 1974
  
  
  O’Brien sentenced.
  
 
 
  
  September 24, 1974
  
  
  Charges against Jensen stayed.
  
 
 
  
  October, 1974
  
  
  Mr. Simons’ office in communication with Jensen at which time
  Jensen agreed to attend to discuss. He did not appear.
  
 
 
  
  March 12, 1975
  
  
  Jensen attended at the office of Mr. Simons.
  
 
 
  
  April 16, 1975
  
  
  Jensen died from drug overdose.
  
 


[Page 601]

Jensen had consulted counsel. According to
Mr. Simons’ notes of the interview, Jensen told him “no affidavits—O.K. to
talk to Martin’s [O’Brien’s] lawyer—lawyer says to take Canada Evidence Act .”
There was presumably always the possibility that the stay of proceedings
against Jensen might be lifted—the record is silent as to the reason for the
stay—but the entire circumstances in which the statement was made negative the
conclusion Jensen apprehended exposing himself to prosecution. The statement
was made in the privacy of Mr. Simons’ office. The public confession was
to be in circumstances in which his words could not be used nor be receivable
in evidence against him in any criminal trial. The following passage is taken
from the transcript of the proceedings before the Court of Appeal:


 
  
  Bull, J.A.
  
  
  … and I am willing to accept it, that this man would not swear an
  affidavit as to these things because he thereby would not have the protection
  of the Canada Evidence Act .
  
 
 
  
  Maclean, J.A.
  
  
  Yes, because he would take the risk.
  
 
 
  
  Bull, J.A.
  
  
  Because he would be taking a risk, and I do not blame him.
  
 
 
  
  Maclean, J.A.
  
  
  Yes, friendship would not have gone that far
  
 


As Professor Morgan has stressed in his article,
in The Sussex Peerage case one of Lord Lyndhurst’s reasons for holding
the testimony inadmissible was that the offered declarations were made to
declarant’s own son, “and in so making them, it cannot be presumed that he
would have exposed himself to prosecution, or that he made them under any
belief that he should do so.”

The guarantee of trustworthiness of a statement
made out of Court flows from the fact that the statement is to the “deceased’s
immediate prejudice.” To be admissible there must be a realization

[Page 602]

by the declarant that the statement may well be
used against him. That is the very thing Jensen wished to avoid. He had no
intention of furnishing evidence against himself. His obvious desire was not to
create damaging evidence, detrimental to his penal interest. Yet, that is the
very basis upon which admissibility of extra-judicial declarations of penal
interest rests. In my opinion, the statements of Jensen to Mr. Simons
failed to meet the requirements for admissibility. Viewed from Jensen’s
subjectivity, the statements were not against interest. Failure to fall within
the exception is, therefore, fatal to the admissibility of Mr. Simons’
hearsay.

Section 610  of the Criminal Code  lends no
assistance to respondent’s case. It is a prerequisite that any evidence sought
to be adduced under the discretion granted by that section be admissible
evidence. The section manifestly does not authorize a Court of Appeal to
dispense with the law of hearsay evidence. If that were so we would have the
anomalous situation in which counsel could seek to adduce on appeal that which
the common law prohibits at trial. The section is not operative until the
threshold for admissibility as defined by common law and statute is crossed.
That threshold has not been crossed in the instant case.

A last word: The Court of Appeal allowed
Mr. Simons, who had been acting as counsel for the accused O’Brien, to
give his own evidence as to the story he had heard from Jensen. Whether or not
Mr. Simons was a competent witness in the circumstances is a point to
which no considered submission was addressed and on which I express no opinion.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the
acquittal entered by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia and restore the
conviction, subject to determination of the issues raised on behalf of the
respondent in the Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal, which have not yet
been argued. The decision of the Court of Appeal was made following the
argument relating to the tendering of the evidence of Mr. Simons. I would,
accordingly,

[Page 603]

refer the matter back to the Court of Appeal for
adjudication on the issues yet to be decided.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Evidence—Hearsay
evidence—Admissibility of alleged confession by deceased declarant—Whether
statement adverse to declarant’s interests—Criminal law—Decisions relative to
sequestration of jury—Not a question of law.

Appellant was charged with murder. The Crown
case was that appellant had procured some unknown person to kill his wife.
Appellant sought to introduce evidence that a person unconnected with him had
confessed to the murder of the wife. That person was an escaped convict who had
died prior to the trial and the witness, Dinardo to whom he had confessed
indicated that he would not have given the evidence implicating his friend had
the friend still been alive. The trial judge excluded the confession as hearsay
evidence. At the commencement of the trial and thereafter during the course of
the trial, the trial judge refused application by the defence that the jury be
sequestered but subsequently on his own motion ordered that the jury be
sequestered. Appellant was convicted and his subsequent appeal was dismissed.
Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was granted in respect of two questions,
First, whether the Court of Appeal had erred in holding that the trial judge
had not erred in initially refusing to sequester the jury and later doing so
rather than declaring a mistrial and, second, whether the Court of Appeal had
erred in holding that the trial judge had not erred in ruling that the evidence
of the confession by the deceased Eper was inadmissible.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence J.: In the circumstances the alleged confession by Eper, since
deceased, was not admissible. The question of whether or not a statement made
against the declarant’s penal interest rather than his pecuniary or proprietary
interest should be admissible can be left open as to its total tenor to be
dealt with on another occasion. There could well be circumstances

[Page 539]

when the whole intent in adducing such a
statement is to show that the declarant and not the accused had committed the
physical act where the statement should be admissible and of very considerable
probative weight despite the fact that in his statement the declarant might
advance justification for his act.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ: Appeals to the
Supreme Court under s. 618(1)(b) are limited to questions of law. The
decision of the trial judge was not on a question of law and the judgment of
the Court of Appeal did not raise a question of law. The Supreme Court was
therefore without jurisdiction to consider that issue. The Court is not
precluded from reaching such a conclusion by the fact that leave to appeal was
granted in respect of the question.

The confession by Eper did not meet the
necessary requirements for admissibility. Even on the assumption that it is not
necessary that the interest to which such statement is adverse must be a
proprietary or pecuniary one, there was nothing in the evidence to show that
when Eper made the statement it was contrary to his interest either penal or
pecuniary. It was a statement by an escaped criminal under sentence of life
imprisonment to a man with a long criminal record who had been his accomplice
in crime for many years.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] dismissing an
appeal by the appellant from his conviction on a charge of noncapital murder.
Appeal dismissed.

Edward L. Greenspan and Mark Rosenberg,
for the appellant.

J. David Watt, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence J. was
delivered by

SPENCE J.—I have had the opportunity to consider
the reasons for judgment to be delivered by my brother Martland. I agree with
him that the

[Page 540]

appeal should be dismissed and, in the main, I
am in accord with the reasons which he expresses.

Particularly, I agree that under the
circumstances which existed in the present case the alleged confession by Eper,
since deceased, which Dinardo testified Eper had made to him, is not
admissible. I shall be dealing on another occasion with the general question of
whether or not a statement made against the declarant’s penal interest rather
than merely his pecuniary or proprietary interest should be admissible but, for
the present purposes, I desire to leave open the question as to the total tenor
of such statement. I can well understand occasions when the whole intent in
adducing such statement from the witness who heard it from the lips of the
deceased declarant is to show that the declarant and not the accused had
committed the physical act and that therefore a statement made by the deceased
declarant that he had committed the physical act should be admissible and of
very considerable probative weight despite the fact that in his statement the
declarant might advance some allegation, for instance, an allegation that he
acted in self-defence.

I, therefore, agree that the appeal should be
dismissed.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—This appeal is from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario,
which dismissed the appellant’s appeal from his conviction on a charge of
non-capital murder. Leave to appeal to this Court was granted in respect of two
questions, which are defined in the order granting leave to appeal, as follows:

(1) Did the Court of Appeal of Ontario err in holding that the trial Judge
did not err in refusing to sequester the jury as sought on several occasions by
defence counsel and in sequestering the jury after the trial had gone on for
about six weeks instead of declaring a mistrial?

(2) Did the Court of Appeal of Ontario err in holding that the trial Judge
did not err in holding that a confession by the deceased Eper to the witness,
exonerating the accused, was inadmissible?

[Page 541]

The trial lasted for 51 days and a great deal of
evidence was presented. The facts are set forth in the reasons for judgment of
the Court of Appeal, which are reported in (1976), 10 O.R. (2d.) 321. It is not
necessary to review them save insofar as they relate to the questions in issue.

1. Sequestration of the Jury.

At the commencement of the trial application was
made on behalf of the appellant that the jury be sequestered. This application
was refused. Similar applications were made during the course of the trial on a
number of occasions. They were unsuccessful. Subsequently the trial judge, on
his own motion, ordered that the jury be sequestered.

The relevant provision of the Criminal Code  is
s. 576(1) :

The judge may, at any time before the jury
retires to consider its verdict, permit the members of the jury to separate.

The trial judge exercised this discretion by
permitting the jury to separate, until the time when he decided no longer to
permit them to do so. His failure to sequester the jury at the commencement of
the trial was raised as a ground of appeal before the Court of Appeal and was
rejected.

In my opinion the decision of the trial judge on
this question was not a decision on a question of law. If the Court of Appeal
had considered that this decision by the trial judge had resulted in a
miscarriage of justice, it would have had the power to deal with the matter
under s. 613(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code , but the Court
did not so find. On an appeal to this Court under s. 618(1) (b) the Court
is limited to the consideration of “any question of law”. In my opinion the
decision of the trial judge as to sequestration of the jury was not on a
question of law, and the judgment of the Court of Appeal confirming that
decision does not raise a question of law. This Court is, therefore, without
jurisdiction to consider that issue. The fact that leave to appeal was granted
in respect of this question does not preclude the Court from reaching this
conclusion. (R. v. Warner[2]).

[Page 542]

2. Refusal to admit the confession of the
deceased Eper.

The facts giving rise to this issue are as
follows. The case for the Crown was that the appellant had procured some
unknown person to kill the appellant’s wife. The appellant sought to introduce
evidence through the witness Dinardo that one Eper, who was apparently
unconnected with the appellant, had confessed to the murder of the appellant’s
wife. Eper was an escaped convict, who had been serving a sentence for life at
the time of his escape, and who had died prior to the trial. Dinardo was his
friend and testified that he would not have given evidence implicating Eper in
the murder if Eper had still been alive. The trial judge excluded the alleged
confession as being hearsay evidence.

The submission of counsel for the appellant is
that this evidence was admissible by reason of the exception to the hearsay
rule in respect of declarations against interest. The Court of Appeal defined
the issue thus raised in the following passage from its judgment:

At common law an oral or written
declaration against pecuniary or proprietary interest by a deceased declarant
has been long held to be admissible to prove the fact declared. In excluding
that part of Dinardo’s evidence the learned trial Judge followed The Sussex
Peerage (1844), 11 CI. & Fin. 85, 8 E.R. 1034, where it was laid down
by the House of Lords that a declaration against penal interest is not
admissible. The appellant argued that this Court should not follow The
Sussex Peerage and should follow some earlier English decisions of Courts
lower than the House of Lords where declarations against penal interest had
been held to be admissible. Alternatively, the appellant argued that the
declarations in question were admissible as against pecuniary interest on the
basis that admission of the killing subjected Eper to a possible action under
the Fatal Accidents Act.

All that has usefully been said to date in
denial or support of the appellant’s first contention can be found by
referring, on the one hand, to The Sussex Peerage and the very
thoughtful and learned judgment of the South Australia Supreme Court in Frits
van Beelen (1974), 9 S.A.S.R. 163, and, on the other hand, to

[Page 543]

Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd ed. (1974) p. 349, para. 1476; Hines v. Commonwealth (1923),
117 S.E. 843, and the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Holmes in Donnelly
v. U.S. (1913), 228 U.S.
243.

It has generally been accepted as the law of England since The Sussex Peerage case
that the exception to the rule excluding hearsay evidence in respect of
declarations made against interest is confined to statements made against
pecuniary or proprietary interest and does not permit evidence of a statement
by a deceased person against his penal interest.

The leading authority in the United States is the decision of the
Supreme Court of the United States in the Donnelly case, referred to above, in which the
majority of the Court followed The Sussex Peerage case. Mr. Justice
Holmes, who, along with two other members of the Court dissented, pointed out
in his reasons that the confession of the murder by the deceased which was
sought to be put in evidence was “coupled with circumstances pointing to its
truth”. Counsel for the appellant has cited to us a number of cases in which
State Courts have extended the exception to the hearsay rule to include
statements against penal interest. On the other hand, the United States Court
of Appeal, Ninth Circuit, in Scolari v. United States[3], when requested to exercise authority to
decline to follow the Donnelly case refused to do so.

The Court of Appeal in the present case, while
pointing out that it was not bound by The Sussex Peerage case and thus
would be free to choose between the two opposing contentions, was of the view
that the facts of the present case did not make it necessary or propitious to
settle the law. The Court held that, even if a declaration against penal
interest was not necessarily inadmissible, the confession of Eper in question
here was not a declaration against penal interest. The reason for so holding is
stated as follows:

At the time of both the alleged
declarations in question in this case Eper was an escaped convict under
sentence of life imprisonment. In the result, he could not be sentenced to a
consecutive sentence so that there could be no penal consequence for the crime
admitted to

[Page 544]

which he was vulnerable: R. v. Sinclair
(1972), 6 C.C.C. (2d) 523. The completely uncertain effect on his prospects
of parole in the event of another conviction is too remote and uncertain to be
regarded as a penal consequence. In addition, at the time of the declaration to
Dinardo he and Eper had been accomplices in crimes for many years and Dinardo,
on his evidence, was acting as an accessory after the fact in assisting
concealment of evidence of the crime declared. Dinardo testified he would not
have given his evidence if Eper were alive.

The Court of Appeal enunciated a number of
principles which would have to be applied in determining whether a declaration
is against penal interest which, in its view, would have to be applied in
addition to those applicable in determining whether a declaration is against
pecuniary or proprietary interest. They are as follows:

1. The declaration would have to be made to
such a person and in such circumstances that the declarant should have
apprehended a vulnerability to penal consequences as a result. In Sussex
Peerage the Lord Chancellor would not have admitted the declaration in any
event of the rule because it was made to the declarant’s son. In ordinary
circumstances where a declaration is made for instance to an unestranged son,
wife or mother, the psychological assurance of reliability is lacking because
of (sic) risk of penal consequences is not real and the declarant may
have motives such as a desire for self‑aggrandizement or to shock which
makes the declaration unreliable.

2. The vulnerability to penal consequences
would have to be not remote.

3. “…the declaration sought to be given in
evidence must be considered in its totality. If upon the whole tenor the
weight is in favour of the declarant, it is not against his interest”: Re
Van Beelen, p. 208; R. v. Agawa (1975) 11 O.R. (2d) 176.

4. In a doubtful case a Court might
properly consider whether or not there are other circumstances connecting the
declarant with the crime and whether or not there is any connection between the
declarant and the accused.

5. The declarant would have to be
unavailable by reason of death, insanity, grave illness which prevents the
giving of testimony even from a bed, or absence in a jurisdiction to which none
of the processes of the Court extends. A declarant would not be unavailable in
the circumstances that existed in R. v. Agawa.

[Page 545]

These furnish a valuable guide for consideration
in the event that this Court should determine that a declaration against penal
interest is not to be held inadmissible under the rule against the reception of
hearsay evidence. In the present case, however, it is my opinion that the
confession by Eper did not meet the requirements necessary for the admission of
a declaration made against pecuniary or proprietary interest.

Those requirements were stated by Hamilton L.J.
in Ward v. H.S. Pitt & Co.; Lloyd v. Powell Duffryn Steam
Coal Company[4], at p.
137. The judgment of the Court of Appeal was reversed on other grounds by the
House of Lords in Lloyd v. Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Company[5], but on this issue the views of Hamilton
L.J. were supported by two of the Law Lords and no dissent therefrom was
expressed by the other two Law Lords who sat on the appeal. The requirements
are listed as follows:

1. It is essential that the deceased should
have made a statement of some fact, of the truth of which he had peculiar
knowledge. The rule applies only to statements as to “acts done by the deceased
and not by third parties” (per Sir R. Phillimore in The Henry Coxon (1878)
3 P.D. 156, 158). It does not extend to cover statements made by a deceased
person of what others had told him (Tindal C.J. and Lord Campbell in Lord
Trimlestown v. Kemmis (1843) 9 CI. & F. 749, 780, 785).

2. It is essential that such fact should
have been “to the deceased’s immediate prejudice,” that is against his interest
at the time when he stated it. If it may be construed for his interest or
against it (Massey v. Allen) (13 Ch. D. 558) or may only be against his interest in certain future
events (Ex parte Edwards) (14 Q.B.D. 415) it is inadmissible.

3. It is essential that the deceased should
have known the fact to be against his interest when he made it, because it is
on the guarantee of truth based on a man’s conscious statement of a fact, “even
though it be to his own hindrance,” that the whole theory of admissibility
depends. It is “a necessary element, that the subject-matter of the
declaration…must have been within the direct personal knowledge of the person
making the

[Page 546]

declaration” (per Lord Selborne L.C. in Sturla
v. Freccia (1880) 5 App. Cas. 623, 633); “to support the admissibility
it must be shewn that the statement was, to the knowledge of the deceased,
contrary to his interest” (per Fletcher Moulton L.J. in Tucker v. Oldbury
Urban Council (1912) 2 K.B. 317, 321).

4. It has long been held that the interest
to which the statement must be adverse must be a pecuniary one or, which is
only a species of the same genus, a proprietary one. A statement would not be
against interest if only generally criminatory; one “which might in some way or
other injuriously affect the interest of the party” (per Lord Lyndhurst L.C.,
Lords Brougham and Denman in the Sussex Peerage Case (11 CI. & F.
85, 110, 111)), or which might be prejudicial to reputation or social
consideration.

Even on the assumption that it is not necessary
to meet the requirement numbered 4, the confession in this case does not meet
the requirement numbered 3. There is nothing in the evidence to show that when
Eper made his statement to Dinardo that he apprehended or had any cause for
apprehension that it was contrary to his interest, either penal or pecuniary.
This was a statement made by an escaped criminal under sentence of life
imprisonment to a man with a long criminal record, who had been his accomplice
in crime for many years. In fact Dinardo stated in evidence that he would not
have given his evidence if Eper were alive.

In these circumstances the confession did not
meet the requirements for admissibility of a declaration by a deceased person,
and in my opinion the Court of Appeal was right in holding that it was properly
rejected as evidence by the trial judge.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Manslaughter—Causation—Assault and kicking of
deceased—Unlawful act—Death resulting from asphyxia due to deceased choking on
vomit—Malfunctioning epiglottis—Criminal Code , ss. 205(1) , 207 , 208 .

Evidence—Medical evidence—Evidence as to cause of death—Death
due to vomiting and deceased choking—Vomiting probably caused by a
kick—Malfunctioning epiglottis—Criminal Code , ss. 205(1) , 207 , 208 .

Appellant and deceased both young hockey players were the
leading players in two competing teams. During the game, which was rough, the
players were aggressive and feelings ran high. Appellant was subjected to
racial insults by the deceased and other members of the opposing team.
Following a heated exchange of profanities appellant and deceased were both
ejected from the game. Appellant however indicated that he intended to continue
the confrontation and made repeated threats. The deceased was apprehensive and left
the arena at the end of the game. Outside, appellant caught up with him,
attacked him and, though held back, managed to kick him in the abdomen. Death
resulted shortly thereafter. The medical evidence indicated that the deceased
had died from asphyxia from aspiration of foreign materials due to vomiting and
that the malfunction of the epiglottis was probably caused by the kick but
could have resulted from fear. Appellant testified he had acted in self-defence
but was convicted of manslaughter.

Appellant appealed unsuccessfully and on further appeal, three
grounds were urged, first, that the trial judge failed to delineate clearly the
issue as to the cause of death of the deceased and to relate the evidence to
that issue; second, that the Court of Appeal erred in holding that there was
evidence on the basis of which the jury was entitled to find that it had been
established

[Page 507]

beyond a reasonable doubt that the kick caused the death; and,
third, that the charge to the jury on the matter of self-defence amounted to
misdirection.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

The issue as to the cause of death was properly and
sufficiently delineated by the trial judge. The assault by appellant on the
deceased was clearly an unlawful act and there was cogent evidence to which the
jury could apply common sense in considering the issue of causality. The jury
was not limited to medical evidence but had the benefit of uncontradicted
evidence of lay witnesses that appellant kicked the deceased in the stomach
area, that this kick caused immediate distress and that the death followed in
minutes. There was therefore evidence upon which the jury was entitled to
convict.

While the medical experts did not speak in terms of absolute
certainty the weight to be given to that expert evidence was a matter for the
jury which was entitled to consider all of the evidence expert and lay. There
was substantial evidence before the jury indicating that the kick was at least
a contributing cause of death, outside the de minimis range, and that
was all that the Crown was required to establish. It was immaterial that the
death was in part caused by a malfunctioning epiglottis to the malfunction of
which appellant may, or may not, have contributed. A person commits homicide
when directly or indirectly, by any means, he causes the death of a human being
and it was therefore no defence that appellant did not expect that death would
ensue. Finally there could be no criticism of the judge’s charge on
self-defence. For some considerable time before the incident appellant alone
was the aggressor.

conviction for manslaughter. Appeal dismissed.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario dismissing an appeal brought by the appellant from his
conviction by judge and jury on a charge of manslaughter. The indictment
alleges that the appellant did unlawfully kill Barrie Ross Cobby by
kicking him.

On February 18, 1973 a hockey game was played between the
Applewood Midget Team and the Cooksville Midget Team at the Cawthra Park Arena
in the Town of Mississauga. The leading player on the Applewood team was the
deceased, Barrie Cobby, sixteen years of age; the leading player on the
Cooksville team was the appellant. The game was rough, the players were
aggressive and feelings ran high. The appellant, who is black, was subjected to
racial insults by Cobby and other members of the Applewood team. Following a
heated and abusive exchange of profanities, the appellant and Cobby were both
ejected from the game. The appellant made repeated threats that he was going to
“get” Cobby. Cobby was very apprehensive and left the arena at the end of the
game, some forty-five minutes later, accompanied by eight or ten persons
including friends, players, his coach and the team’s manager. The appellant
repeated his threats and challenges to fight as the group departed. Cobby did
not take up the challenge. Instead, he hurried toward a waiting car. The
appellant caught up with him at the bottom of the outside steps and directed
one or two punches to Cobby’s head. Several of Cobby’s team mates grabbed the
appellant and held him. Cobby, who had taken no steps to defend himself, was
observed to double up and stand back while the appellant struggled to free
himself from those holding him. While Cobby was thus bent over, and
approximately two to four feet from the appellant, the appellant delivered what
was described as a hard,

[Page 509]

fast kick to Cobby’s stomach area. Only seconds elapsed between
the punching and the kick. Following the kick, Cobby groaned, staggered towards
his car, fell to the ground on his back, and gasped for air. Within five
minutes he appeared to stop breathing. He was dead upon arrival at the Mississauga
 General Hospital.

Dr. David Brunsdon, who performed an autopsy, testified that in
his opinion death was due to the aspiration of foreign materials present from
vomiting. He defined aspiration as the breathing, or taking in, of foreign
material through the windpipe into the lungs. It appears from the medical
evidence that aspiration is generally due to barbiturate overdosage, alcohol
intoxication, motor vehicle accidents or epilepsy. One medical witness
testified to the possibility of spontaneous aspiration, whereby foreign
material may be aspirated without any precipitating cause. This witness had
seen three such cases out of the 900 to 1000 cases of aspiration which he had
experienced. In none of the three cases was the aspiration preceded by a blow.
The consensus among the doctors was that spontaneous aspiration was a rare and
unusual cause of death in the case of a healthy teenager such as Cobby.
Normally, when a person vomits the epiglottis folds over to prevent the
regurgitated stomach contents from entering the air passage. In the instant
case this protective mechanism failed.

In the Court of Appeal for Ontario three points were raised: (i)
whether there was evidence of a causal connection between the kick and the
death, upon which the jury was entitled to convict; (ii) whether the verdict
was unreasonable; and (iii) whether the charge of the trial judge adequately
delineated the essential issues and related the evidence to them. The majority
of the Court (Evans and Martin JJ.A.) concluded that the issue of causation
fell to be determined by the jury on the whole of the evidence, not the medical
evidence alone. It was held that the charge, viewed in its totality, was
adequate and contained no error in law. Mr. Justice Houlden, dissenting,
noted that three doctors gave expert medical evidence for the

[Page 510]

prosecution as to the kick and the vomiting and all three doctors
agreed that the kick probably caused the vomiting though they could not
positively state that it did. He agreed that there was evidence upon which the
jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt the kick caused Cobby’s death but, in
his opinion, the trial judge erred in failing to make clear to the jury the
Crown had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the kick caused the vomiting.
In his view, by dealing generally with the law concerning manslaughter, assault
and self-defence and then setting out at length the Crown and defence theories,
the trial judge confused the jury. The judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal
dismissing the appeal specified the point of dissent in these terms: “the trial
judge failed to clearly delineate the issue as to the cause of death of the
deceased Cobby and to relate the evidence to that issue”.

The ground of dissent in the Ontario Appeal Court forms the first
ground of appeal in this Court. Counsel for the appellant submits that the
trial judge, in emphasizing the act of assault as a constituent element in the
crime of manslaughter, did not make it clear to the jury that the act of
assault must also cause the death of the deceased and, secondly, that in giving
his summation of the Crown and defence theories, the trial judge referred to
the issue of causation as defence counsel’s argument that the cause of death
had not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. It is contended that the effect
of these remarks was to minimize this issue in the minds of the jury. The jury
was never instructed, it is said, that as a matter of law one of the issues on
which they had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt was that the kick
caused the vomiting.

[Page 511]

The trial judge commenced the general part of his charge with
instruction as to onus of proof, presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt.
He moved then to a discussion of circumstantial evidence and related that
subject to what he referred to as “an important area, the cause of death,”
adding “here no one saw inside Barrie Cobby’s throat, or stomach or his lungs
and here the evidence is circumstantial and indirect”. Later in the charge,
while discussing intent in relation to manslaughter, the trial judge said:

Therefore, in this case if you find the accused acted
unlawfully in kicking Cobby, and that death resulted therefrom, it is
immaterial whether the accused Intended, or did not intend to cause death.

In giving his general directions on the law of manslaughter the
trial judge stated:

...manslaughter is the causing of death of a human being by
an unlawful act, but not an intentional act.

Later he added:

...any improper use of force, which is unlawful, if death
results is manslaughter.

The following passage of the charge is attacked by the appellant
on the ground that it failed to emphasize that the act of assault must also
cause the death of the deceased:

...So that one difference between manslaughter and the act
of assault is that in manslaughter the intent to kill is not necessary, whereas
in assault the intent to apply force is necessary. Because a person commits
assault without consent when he applies force intentional to the person of the
other, directly or indirectly. So once you have an assault, the unlawful
application of force, and a person dies as a result thereof, whether it is
intended that he die or not, then you have the crime of manslaughter.

It seems to me that this criticism is unwarranted because the
judge stated plainly that in order to constitute the crime of manslaughter
there must

[Page 512]

not only be an assault but a person must die as a result thereof.

The judge again adverted to the cause of death during a
discussion of the mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and heart massage carried out by
the ambulance attendants, and the effect of ss. 207 and 208 of the Code. He
said:

At any rate, I thought I should read those sections, so that
you can on this law and on the evidence probably disregard anything that took
place afterwards as being the cause of death in so far as the legal
implications are concerned.

During his discussion on the theory of the Crown the following
rather lengthy, but important, passage appears:

The second part of the Crown’s case deals with the cause of
death, and it is the allegation of the Crown that it has proven beyond a
reasonable doubt that death was as a result of the unlawful act. The Crown’s
theory is that as a result of the kick alone, by the combined factor of the kick
and fear that Cobby brought up, he did not eject the food from his mouth, but
instead because of some malfunction at that time of the Epiglottis, the air
passage was not closed off and instead of swallowing the food contents that had
come up he breathed some in to his lungs and died of asphyxiation, that is by
smothering, or lack of breath.

Although most of the above were seen and related by
witnesses, as I have indicated earlier, what actually happened inside Barrie
Cobby was of course not seen, so that here we have the application of
circumstantial evidence, as I explained earlier, that is, in this particular
matter the Crown must show that the events that took place inside the deceased
were linked up to the kick, that they are consistent with the kick being the
cause of death and inconsistent with any other rational explanation.

In support of this, the Crown says that the deceased was a
healthy young man of 17 at the time of the kick, that immediately prior to that
he had come down the stairway and was walking, and acting in a normal manner,
that he was able to react to the hand blow by covering up, and that it was the
kick that felled him. The Crown further suggest, in this regard, that the
deceased had no propensity to vomit, that he had only played ten minutes in the
game, that he had taken no drugs, or alcohol, and only a minimal amount of
Aspirin

[Page 513]

which was not present in the stomach on later analysis. That
if the deceased was nervous, or frightened, this was not the main cause of his
death, but only a contributing factor, and the accused has to take his victim
as he finds him, and this principle in law is known as the thin skull
principle, and Counsel has given you a. dissertation on thin skull, and just by
way of another example. If a person goes to rob someone, and he strikes him on
the head while robbing him, and he just intends a light tap, but the man has a
thin skull and suffers shall we say severe brain injury, it is not a defence
for the robber to say he didn’t know the man had a thin skull, and that no one
else, or few others, would have had such, would have received a brain injury
from that tap. A person takes his victim as he finds him. The severity in this
particular case or the kick is for you to decide upon. But even if it was not
severe, if you find it caused death, the severity is immaterial, but the
severity may be something for you to consider as to whether or not it was the
cause of death.

The Crown says that this is not a case of spontaneous
aspiration, and a definition was given to you of inhaling into the windpipe of
stomach contents by the individual and usually matter that had been vomited up,
with no underlying reason and it often results in death, and rather than
spontaneous aspiration, the Crown’s theory is the symptoms, and this is what
one would expect as the result of the kick.

The first paragraph and the final paragraph of the passage merit
particular attention. It is true they appear during that part of the charge in
which the theory of the Crown is under consideration but the effect is to place
squarely before the jury the issue as to the cause of death and to relate the
evidence to that issue. Opinions may differ as to the sequence to be followed
by a trial judge in covering the many matters which must be covered in the
course of any jury charge. There is no hard and fast rule in this regard, so
long as the jury members know, what it is they are called upon to decide and
that, generally speaking, though not invariably, they receive guidance in
relating the evidence to the issues.

Further instruction as to causation was given to the jury, while
the theory of the defence was being discussed, in these passages:

[Page 514]

Firstly, the Defence says that the Crown, has not proven its case
beyond a reasonable doubt, and that case is divided into two parts. One, in
dealing with whether there was an unlawful act, and second, whether death was
as a result of the alleged unlawful act.

The theory of the Defence is that the Crown has failed in both
these areas.

The other aspect of the Defence theory has to do with the medical
evidence. Namely, that the Crown has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that
the accused died as a result of the kick. Mr. Maloney has related the evidence
of the doctors in some detail, and I don’t propose to cover the same ground.
The gist of his argument was that the strongest medical evidence was in favour
of the Crown was to speak of probabilities and that this falls short of proof
beyond a reasonable doubt, and that Dr. Smith said that he could not give an
opinion that the cause was the kick. An opinion beyond a reasonable doubt, and
this evidence was given at the preliminary enquiry and there was
cross-examination not only of Dr. Smith on this matter, but also of Dr.
Brunsdon, and Mr. Maloney says if the doctors can’t say that the kick was
the cause of death, beyond a reasonable doubt, how can you make a finding of
casual connection that you are required to do beyond the required reasonable
doubt. [Emphasis added.]

In concluding his charge the judge again spoke of reasonable
doubt and related that concept to causation. He said:

I have instructed you as to the meaning of reasonable doubt,
and I repeated it for you earlier, and it is for you to decide on all the
evidence if there is a reasonable doubt in your minds as to the cause of death.
If there is, you must acquit, if there isn’t, and you also find the kick was
unlawful—I am sorry—it is for you to decide on all the evidence if there is a
reasonable doubt in your minds as to the cause of death. If there is you must
acquit, and if there isn’t you must also consider the kick, whether or not it
was unlawful. If you find the Crown has satisfied you beyond a reasonable doubt
that the kick was unlawful and that it was the cause of death, satisfied on
both those matters, then it is your duty to convict.

I agree with the majority view in the Ontario Court of Appeal
that the issue as to the cause of death was properly and sufficiently
delineated by the trial judge. It was not an unduly complicated issue. The
assault by the appellant upon the

[Page 515]

deceased boy was undoubtedly an unlawful act. The principal issue
was whether the appellant had committed homicide by directly or indirectly, by
any means, causing the death of Cobby and whether such homicide was culpable
for the reason that it was caused by an unlawful act. The Crown quite properly
chose to establish causation principally through medical evidence and the
doctors, men of high professional standing, understandably were disinclined to
speak in absolute terms.

Dr. Brunsdon testified as to the effect of a sudden blow in the
abdominal area. He said:

I couldn’t say always, but it certainly I think, would be
predisposed to regurgitation. I am certainly not going to say it would happen
in every case, but I think it could be predisposed to.

During cross-examination, Dr. Brunsdon used the expressions “very
possible” and “very probable” to describe the cause and effect of the kick and
the vomiting. As to the relationship of the kick and aspiration, he said:

I can amplify that a bit. It is a rare condition, but the
kick would have made it more likely to aspirate.

The following passage appears in the testimony of Dr. Hillsdon
Smith, Professor of Forensic Pathology at the University of Toronto:

I have already given in evidence that fear by itself can
cause vomiting, a kick by itself can cause vomiting. The two together have
simply a greater effect than either of those singly.

The jury was not limited to the evidence of the medical experts.
In considering the issue of causation the jury had the benefit of
uncontradicted evidence of a number of lay witnesses to the effect that the
appellant kicked the deceased boy in the stomach area, that the kick was
followed by immediate distress, and that the death occurred within minutes.
This was cogent evidence to which the jury could apply common sense in
considering

[Page 516]

the issue of causality. In my opinion, the first gound of appeal
cannot be maintained.

The second ground, not unrelated to the first ground, is that the
Court of Appeal erred in holding that there was evidence on the basis of which
the jury was entitled to find that it had been established beyond a reasonable
doubt that the kick caused the death. This broad question is unfortunately
phrased, in that it leaves doubt whether the issue raised is one of sufficiency
of evidence, a question of fact to which the jurisdiction of this Court does
not extend, or an entire absence of evidence upon which a finding could be made
that the kick caused the death, a question of law. The appellant’s factum tends
to remove the uncertainty by subsuming, within the broad question, three
narrower questions. The first of these is whether the jury were restricted to a
consideration of the expert medical evidence in making their determination on
the issue of causation. It is conceded that the jury was entitled to consider
all of the evidence, expert and lay, in their deliberations with respect to the
issue of causation but on the precise question of whether or not the kick
caused the vomiting or the aspiration, it is contended the jury was restricted
to the medical evidence. It seems to me to be a novel proposition, subversive
of the usual jury procedure, that on a particular issue the jury should be
denied the evidence of certain witnesses. I have difficulty also in reconciling
the concession that the jury is entitled to consider all of the evidence on the
issue of causation but something less than all the evidence when considering
the only causative questions in the case, namely, whether the kick caused the
vomiting and whether the kick caused the aspiration. In support of his
submission counsel cited Walker v. Bedard and Snelling[2].
That was a civil case tried by Lebel J. without a jury in which damages were
claimed against a surgeon and an anaesthetist for the death of a patient
following the injection of nupercaine into the spinal canal. Lebel J. quoted
with approval a passage from the

[Page 517]

American decision in Ewing v. Goode[3]
in which the following words appear:

But when a case concerns the highly specialized art of
treating an eye for cataract, or for the mysterious and dread disease of
glaucoma, with respect to which a layman can have no knowledge at all, the
court and jury must be dependent on expert evidence. There can be no other
guide, and, where want of skill or attention is not thus shown by expert
evidence applied to the facts, there is no evidence of it proper to be
submitted to the jury.

The other case cited was State v. Minton[4]
in which the death of the deceased was caused by a pistol bullet fired by one
of the defendants, and a resulting hemorrhage. The judgment contains these
words:

The State did not undertake to show any causal relation
between the wound and the death by a medical expert. For this reason, the
question arises whether the cause of death may be established in a prosecution
for unlawful homicide without the use of expert medical testimony. The law is
realistic when it fashions rules of evidence for use in the search for truth.
The cause of death may be established in a prosecution for unlawful homicide
without the use of expert medical testimony where the facts in evidence are
such that every person of average intelligence would know from his own
experience or knowledge that the wound was mortal in character.

There is no proper foundation, however, for a finding by the
jury as to the cause of death without expert medical testimony where the cause
of death is obscure and an average layman could have no well grounded opinion
as to the cause.

In my opinion, neither of the cases cited lends any support to
the proposition sought to be advanced by the appellant. No useful comparison is
possible between an operation for glaucoma and the circumstances in the case at
bar. In Minton’s case the causal relation between the wound and the
death was established without medical evidence.

[Page 518]

It is important in considering the issue of causation in homicide
to distinguish between causation as a question of fact and causation as a
question of law. The factual determination is whether A caused B. The answer to
the factual question can only come from the evidence of witnesses. It has
nothing to do with intention, foresight or risk. In certain types of homicide
jurors need little help from medical experts. Thus if D shoots P or stabs him
and death follows within moments, there being no intervening cause, jurors
would have little difficulty in resolving the issue of causality from their own
experience and knowledge.

Expert evidence is admissible, of course, to establish factual
cause. The work of expert witnesses in an issue of this sort, as Glanville
Williams has pointed out (Causation in Homicide [1957] Crim. L.R. 429 at
p. 431), is “purely diagnostic and does not involve them in metaphysical
subtleties”; it does not require them to distinguish between what is a “cause,”
i.e. a real and contributing cause of death, and what is merely a
“condition,” i.e. part of the background of the death. Nor should they
be expected to say, where two or more causes combine to produce a result, which
of these causes contributes the more.

In the case at bar, the Crown had the burden of showing factual
causation, that beyond a reasonable doubt the kick caused the death. In my
view, the trial judge did not err in failing to instruct the jury that in
determining that issue they could consider only the medical evidence. The issue
of causation is for the jury and not the experts. The weight to be given to the
evidence of the experts was entirely for the jury. In the search for truth, the
jury was entitled to consider all of the evidence, expert and lay, and accept
or reject any part of it. Non-medical testimony is available to both the Crown
and the accused, and in the instant case, lay evidence was vital to the defence
raised by the appellant. That evidence tended to show that all the
circumstances preceding the kick were such as to create in the deceased boy a
highly

[Page 519]

emotional state which might well have given rise to spontaneous
vomiting, unassociated with the kick.

The second sub-question raised is whether there was evidence on
the basis of which the jury was entitled to find that it had been established
beyond a reasonable doubt that the kick caused the death. In answer to this
question it may shortly be said that there was a very substantial body of
evidence, both expert and lay, before the jury indicating that the kick was at
least a contributing cause of death, outside the de minimis range, and
that is all that the Crown was required to establish. It is immaterial that the
death was in part caused by a malfunctioning epiglottis to which malfunction
the appellant may, or may not, have contributed. No question of remoteness or
of incorrect treatment arises in this case.

I should like to adopt two short passages from a Case Note on R.
v. Larkin[5]
by G.A. Martin, as he then was, which appeared in (1943), 21 Can. Bar. Rev. 503
at pp. 504-5:

There are many unlawful acts which are not dangerous in
themselves and are not likely to cause injury which, nevertheless if they cause
death, render the actor guilty of culpable homicide, e.g., the most trivial
assault, if it should, through some unforeseen weakness in the deceased, cause
death, will render the actor guilty of culpable homicide.

…

In the case of so-called intentional crimes where death is
an unintended consequence the actor is always guilty of manslaughter at least.
The act of the accused in R. v. Larkin fell within the class of
intentional crimes because he was engaged in committing an assault upon
Nielsen, and the fact that he caused a different type of harm to that which he
intended did not free him from criminal responsibility.

The Crown was under no burden of proving intention to cause death
or injury. The only intention necessary was that of delivering the kick to
Cobby. Nor was foreseeability in issue. It is no defence to

[Page 520]

a manslaughter charge that the fatality was not anticipated or
that death ordinarily would not result from the unlawful act.

In R. v. Cato[6]
the act supporting the manslaughter conviction was the injection by the accused
into another person of morphine which the accused had unlawfully taken into his
possession. Attention was directed to causation, and the link alleged to exist
between the injection of morphine and the death. The appellant’s argument based
on the medical evidence of causation and the rejection of that argument by the
Court of Appeal are to be found in the following passage, at p. 44:

First of all, he invited us to look at the evidence of
causation, and he pointed out that the medical evidence did not at any point
say ‘This morphine killed Farmer’; the actual link of that kind was not
present. The witnesses were hesitant to express such a view and often recoiled
from it, saying it was not for them to state the cause of death. It is
perfectly true, as Mr. Blom-Cooper says, that the expert evidence did not in
positive terms provide a link, but it was never intended to do so. The expert
witnesses here spoke to factual situations, and the conclusions and deductions
therefrom were for the jury. The first question was: was there sufficient
evidence upon which the jury could conclude, as they must have concluded, that
adequate causation was present?

The third sub-question is whether there was evidence from which
the jury was entitled to find that it had been established beyond a reasonable
doubt that the kick caused the aspiration. It is contended that the burden on
the Crown was to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the kick caused both the
vomiting and the aggravated condition of aspiration. I do not agree. A person
commits homicide, according to s. 205(1) of the Code, when directly or
indirectly, by any means, he causes the death of a human being. Once evidence
had been led concerning the relationship between the kick and the vomiting,
leading to aspiration of stomach contents and asphyxia, the contributing
condition of a malfunctioning epiglottis would not prevent conviction for
manslaughter.

[Page 521]

Death may have been unexpected, and the physical reactions of the
victim unforeseen, but that does not relieve the appellant.

In R. v. Garforth[7],
a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of England, the accused,
aged 16, and another young man, S., quarrelled with the deceased, aged 18,
outside a dance-hall. S. kicked the deceased and when he doubled up stabbed him
in the neck and heart, then the accused kicked him on the body and legs and S.
kicked him on the head. S. was found guilty of murder and the accused was found
guilty of manslaughter. The accused appealed against his conviction on the
ground there was no evidence that what he did was a cause of death. It was
held, dismissing the appeal, that there was clear evidence that the accused
unlawfully assaulted the deceased and inflicted minor injuries which
contributed to the death. Had the jury found that the accused intended to do
grievous bodily harm, he would have been guilty of murder.

It is a well-recognized principle that one who assaults another
must take his victim as he finds him. An extreme example of the application of
the principle will be found in the English case of R. v. Blaue[8]
in which the Court upheld a conviction for manslaughter where the victim’s
wounds were only fatal because of her refusal, on religious grounds, to accept
a blood transfusion. The Court rejected the argument that the victim’s refusal
had broken the chain of causation between the stabbing and the death.

Although causation in civil cases differs from that in a criminal
case, the “thin skulled man” may appear in the criminal law as in the civil
law. The case of R. v. Nicholson[9]
will serve as an illustration. In that case, the accused dealt the

[Page 522]

deceased man two heavy blows. The man who was struck was in poor
physical condition. His heart was abnormally small and he was suffering from
Bright’s disease. An eminent medical specialist was asked if the blow or blows
could cause death, given the condition of the body which was described, and he
said it was possible. The blow might be one of the causes. Over-indulgence in
alcohol, bad health, and the blow and tussle combined, in his opinion, to
account for the result. The appeal from conviction was dismissed. Even if the
unlawful act, alone, would not have caused the death, it was still a legal
cause so long as it contributed in some way to the death. I myself presided at a
jury trial in which the accused, one Alan Canada, following an argument, struck
his brother lightly on the head with a piece of firewood as a result of which
the brother died some time later without regaining consciousness. The medical
evidence showed that the bony structure of his skull was unusually thin and
fragile. The accused, on the advice of counsel, pleaded guilty to a charge of
manslaughter and I have never considered that he was wrong in doing so.

I would conclude this point by saying that although Dr. Hillsdon
Smith thought that once vomiting had been induced, aspiration in these
circumstances was no more than an accident, both Dr. Brunsdon and Dr. Butt
acknowledged that the kick may have contributed to the epiglottal malfunction.

That brings me to the third and final ground of appeal, namely,
whether the trial judge’s charge to the jury on the issue of self-defence
amounted to misdirection. Although undoubtedly much upset by the actions and
language of Cobby during the first ten minutes of play, thereafter the
appellant alone was the aggressor. He relentlessly pursued Cobby some
forty-five minutes later for the purpose of carrying out his threats to “get”
Cobby. Despite the frail factual underpinning for such a defence, the trial
judge charged fully on self-

[Page 523]

defence and in a manner which, in my opinion, was not open to
criticism.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Evidence—Gross
indecency—Similar facts—Criminal Code , s. 157 .

Appellant was convicted by a judge without a
jury of three counts of gross indecency with three adolescents. The offences
were committed in the office of appellant, who is a specialist in education and
counselling. The Crown introduced similar fact evidence involving two other
adolescents and this evidence was admitted by the trial judge. The majority of
the Court of Appeal confirmed the conviction: Rinfret J.A. was of opinion that
there had been no error in law, while Crête J.A. held that even though the
similar fact evidence had been improperly admitted, appellant had not thereby
suffered any serious prejudice. Dubé J.A., however, expressed his dissent:
hence the appeal as of right to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The trial judge showed that he was fully
aware of the danger of convicting without corroboration in cases of gross
indecency. There is thus no reason for substituting a different assessment of
the facts for his, since the question is essentially one of credibility, and he
had the inestimable advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses.

On the admissibility of similar fact
evidence, it is in the discernment of the trial judge. In exercising this
discretion, he must have regard to the general principles established by the
cases. There is no closed list of the sort of cases where such evidence is
admissible. It is, however, well established that it may be admitted to rebut a
defence of legitimate association for honest purposes, as well as to rebut
evidence of good character. Since the defence in the case at bar was precisely,
besides character evidence, that the visits of the young witnesses had been
made for perfectly legitimate purposes, the similar fact evidence was certainly
admissible in rebuttal. Nevertheless, since the accused could not possibly have
asked for an acquittal without this defence, he suffered no prejudice from
similar fact evidence having been admitted in chief.

[Page 19]

Secondly, where similar fact evidence is thus
admissible, the evidence on each similar count may also be used to corroborate
the evidence in each of the other cases. The evidence on each count therefore
becomes admissible to rebut the defence on each of the other counts, with no
necessity of having it repeated.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal of Quebec[1]
affirming a conviction by a judge of the Court of the Sessions. Appeal
dismissed.

Claude Filion and Gérard Beaudry, for the
appellant.

Jean Montplaisir, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

PIGEON J.—This appeal is from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal of the Province
of Quebec, [1976] C.A. 67,
affirming a conviction by Dollard Dansereau J. of the Court of the Sessions.
The three counts against appellant are of having committed acts of gross
indecency on August 23, 1972,
with Yvan…, on August 1, 1972, with Jean-Yves… and on July 24, 1972, with Perri… The appeal brought as
of right is based on the dissent of Dubé J., who would have acquitted the
appellant. The formal judgment does not specify the grounds in law upon which
the dissent is based, as is required under s. 606  of the Criminal Code .
I shall first summarize the facts which led to the prosecution.

Appellant, an unmarried man in his forties, has
been a teacher, a school principal and a school inspector. Since 1967 he is a
specialist in education

[Page 20]

with the Department of Education. He holds, inter
alia, a B.A. in philosophy, a master’s degree in education and a master’s
degree in academic and professional counselling. After receiving the last
mentioned degree, he opened a counselling office at his residence in an
apartment building, while still retaining his position with the Department of
Education.

Perri, an eleven-and-a-half-year-old boy who had
already seen the accused in his counselling office, some ten times starting in
the summer of 1970, had an appointment with him on August 21, 1972. To justify
his refusal to go, he told his mother he had had enough indecent manipulation.
His mother then phoned to postpone the interview and called the police. On
August 23, between five and six p.m., two police officers went to the accused’s
apartment with a search warrant issued by the Social Welfare Court. While one
spoke to the accused in the living room, the other went into the counselling
office. There he found fifteen-year-old Yvan, sitting on a chair in front of a
desk on which lay a mental aptitude test form. This test is made up of
seventy-five questions which must be answered quickly, since the test is timed.
The time-clock was running on the desk, but Yvan was sitting with his head
down, “bent over himself in an unusual manner… with his hands crossed below the
belt”. The police officer noted that the boy’s fly was down and commented on
this. The boy answered that he had just been to the washroom. Both officers
questioned him, but obtained no information. After giving them his name and
address, the boy was allowed to leave. The two officers arranged to meet with
him at his parents’ home in Longueuil a week later. They saw him alone first
and obtained an incriminating statement from him, confirming what he had told
his mother, a school teacher, when returning home “white as a sheet”, she says,
on August 23. It should be noted that Yvan too had gone to accused’s office
some ten times in 1972, and had at times shown great reluctance to return, although
never giving any indication of the reason for his reluctance.

[Page 21]

During their search, the officers found a large
brown envelope in a filing cabinet. The return address on it was that of a
presbytery on the outskirts of Quebec City, the address of the accused was
written in ink as the destination. It was marked “Personnel” and, in red
ink, there was written [TRANSLATION] “TO be destroyed after examination”. It
contained a half-dozen obscene publications dealing with the male sex. One in
particular was not only obscene, but perversive: “HUSTLER”, “a story in photo
of a young man’s search for himself”. This fifty-page story in photographs
(many in full colour) is that of a homosexual liaison, depicted in all its
manifestations—even the most disgusting—in the most explicit manner possible,
and presented as the happy development of a young man’s personality. Fully
conscious of the perversive character of this pornography, the publisher has
printed in bold yellow type at the top of the cover page: “For the private
contemplation of ADULTS ONLY”. At the trial Jean‑Yves, who was
fifteen-and-a-half years old in August 1972, and who had also seen the accused
at his office some ten times, testified that in addition to having committed
the alleged acts, the accused had shown him this magazine. The accused denied
it, like the rest, but the evidence presented for the defence by Richard and
Robert, two young men, brothers, living with the accused and sharing his
bedroom, seriously weakened his denial. In fact, although testifying for the
accused, they both admitted that he had shown them this filth which he had
received at the beginning of the year and kept in his possession instead of
destroying it. While these two young men were adults, in 1972 they were twenty-one
and twenty-two respectively, the priest who sent him this progaganda for
homosexuality, this incitement to debauchery, surely did not intend it for such
use.

The trial was held in camera without a jury. I
find it necessary to quote five pages from the judgment stating in the main the
judge’s reasons for the conviction:

[TRANSLATION] The evidence submitted by the
prosecution and the defence on the whole has shown that the

[Page 22]

main purpose of the accused’s meetings with
the five alleged victims (including two cases of similar acts) was to try to
solve psychological or guidance problems. According to his alleged victims,
however, this was not the accused’s only purpose: he took advantage of these
meetings to commit acts of gross indecency on or with them. The scenario was
almost always the same: from the first meetings, the accused made the victim
sit on his knees, felt his penis, sometimes masturbated him and even had the
victim masturbate him on one or two occasions. The accused advised each of the boys
to keep silent about this sexual activity during the interviews. In view of the
circumstances, the Court considers that it had good reason to admit as it did
the similar fact evidence which, in any case, merely supplemented that
presented on the indictment.

In his testimony, the accused absolutely
denied the acts of gross indecency with which his five alleged victims charged
him, although he did admit meeting with each of them in his office. The
interviews, he said, were spent studying psychological or academic problems
submitted to him. He admitted that he did show interest in these adolescents’
sexual behaviour, but stated that he never took part in criminal acts such as
those with which he is charged. Richard and Robert…, called by the defence,
have been living with the accused for some months and share his bedroom. Both
these young men were originally counselled by the accused as adolescents, with
the consent of their parents, and especially of their father,… These two
witnesses for the defence stated that they never saw or heard anything from the
office of the accused which suggested that acts of gross indecency were being
committed. It is true, however, that neither was ever present at these
interviews of the accused with young boys or girls.

Yvan… told the Court with obvious sincerity
of the immoral and illegal acts the accused committed with him. He explained
why at first he lied to the police officer. This explanation is adequate when
one takes into account the age and education of the boy at the time of these
incriminating incidents and lies.

The same observations apply mutatis
mutandis to Jean-Yves… He would not admit to his mother that he and the
accused were committing immoral acts. He did, however, reveal these acts when
questioned by the police. In Court, during the examination‑in‑chief
and the cross-examination, he answered the questions without hesitation and
with a ring of truth. This Court believes his testimony.

[Page 23]

Lastly, there is Perri…, who triggered the
original police investigation which led to the charges in the case at bar. His
impatience and ill humour when his mother insisted that he go to the accused’s
office, when he wanted to enjoy a school holiday and play, exploded and
resulted in the serious charge against the accused. His mother corroborated
this part of her son’s testimony. The facts described by the boy to the Court
were similar to those described in Court by Yvan… and Jean-Yves…—indecent
manipulation and advice to say nothing. This Court does not find any reason or
reasons in Perri …’s testimony sufficient to justify rejecting it.

In their testimony, Michel… and Jean
(brother of Richard and Robert) showed that the accused took advantage of the
parents’ trust and the private consultations which the latter had their children
attend, to commit acts of gross indecency on and with them. The accused also
advised them to remain silent. The Court feels that these two youths, who
appeared before the Court to relate facts which are humiliating for them at
their present age, told the truth.

The credibility of the witnesses for the
defence, Richard and Robert…, is vitiated by the fact that in Court they showed
an excessive admiration for and attachment to the accused. These feelings make
them still prefer a suspicious cohabitation in the apartment of the accused to
life in their family’s home. In any case, their testimony is hardly positive
with respect to what may have gone on in the counselling office between the
accused and the three young men named in the indictment, as visual witnesses
they knew nothing.

The accused’s interest in denying the facts
upon which the charges rest is only natural, considering the effect a
conviction may have on his career. The accused placed great emphasis on the
tests administered to his three alleged victims. In defence, he could do no
more than deny the accusatory facts advanced by the three alleged victims.
Further, the five youths have nothing to gain from harassing the
accused. This Court must also keep in mind that the trial was held in camera. In
this way, the witnesses for the prosecution were heard separately from each
other. Further, they did not know each other, at least not well, before the
case at bar began. It cannot be seriously argued that officers Brault and
Clermont prevailed upon the witnesses for the prosecution to commit perjury for
having the accused convicted. The absence of spontaneous admissions on their
part is a neutral fact on which the defence cannot really rely.

[Page 24]

The statute and case law require the
presiding judge to be on guard against the danger of error in convicting the
accused in the case at bar unless the testimony of the three alleged victims is
corroborated on facts implicating the accused in the crimes with which he is
charged. However, the absence of corroboration does not necessarily imply the
acquittal of a person charged with gross indecency.

There is no doubt that the accused’s
private interviews with the three young boys afforded him perfect opportunities
to carry out his perverted intentions. The occasion or opportunity to commit a
criminal offence however, should not be confused with corroboration as defined
in the case law. Nevertheless, both can guide us in assessing the credibility
of the witnesses in the case at bar. Had the occasion or opportunity never
existed, the acts with which the accused is charged would probably never have
been committed. This opportunity is also shown in the similar fact evidence
concerning Michel… and Jean…

The discovery of obscene publications in
the accused’s counselling office can be considered a factor which tends to
lessen the credibility of the accused with respect to a charge of gross
indecency, even though such publications cannot be accepted as corroboration of
the testimony of the three alleged victims. The accused had easy access to
these publications, and young Jean-Yves… claims to have been shown those
magazines. The fact that the accused received the publications from Rev. Marcel
Fournier, of Quebec City, is of little importance—what matters is that he kept
them.

Lastly, the visits by the accused and
Richard, Robert, Jean and their brother Pierre to a transvestite show in Quebec
City, and to an establishment frequented by transvestites, denote questionable
tendencies on the part of the accused when the charges against him are read and
the approximate ages of the youths at that time are calculated.

Above all, the accumulation of similar fact
evidence through the testimony of not only Michel… and Jean…, but also of each
of the three young boys involved in the indictment, cannot be regarded as
corroboration, but it cannot fail to make an impression on a jury called up on
to decide on the veracity of the accused’s denials. The CAMPBELL case,
mentioned above, invites them to do so.

Basing his opinion, as the trial judge did,
mainly on what Lord Goddard stated in Campbell[2], Rinfret J.A. (now Chief Justice)
held that the trial judge had not erred in law:

[Page 25]

[TRANSLATION] I feel that the trial judge
was right in admitting evidence of a first similar fact as evidence in chief
since, as he explained, due to questions in cross-examination, “the presiding
judge anticipated a defence based on the completely honourable nature of the
relations between the accused and the young men mentioned in the indictment”.

The defence was in fact a denial of the
alleged acts, and evidence of excellent reputation.

In addition to the persons previously
mentioned, who could have no knowledge of accused’s private life, the defence
called two witnesses, the brothers Richard and Robert…, who both live with
appellant.

This resulted in throwing the book of the…
family’s troubles wide open, which compelled the Crown to call in rebuttal the
father, …, and one of his sons, Jean (the brother of Richard and Robert) who
had also been under the care of appellant at one time.

Jean contradicted the testimony of his own
brothers. He was led to describe appellant’s undue influence on his family,
appellant’s behaviour toward him, and his personal experience. In this witness’
testimony several similar acts were revealed; this evidence contradicted that
of the two brothers, and was admissible as such.

Crête J.A., relying on Harris[3], felt that the similar fact evidence
had been improperly admitted, but concluded that the conviction should stand,
saying:

[TRANSLATION] Excluding this evidence, I
still feel that the only finding which the evidence at the trial as a whole can
lead to, is that appellant is guilty and that he suffered no substantial wrong,
and there was no miscarriage of justice (s. 613(1)(b)(iii) Cr. C).

It is extremely difficult to ascertain to what
extent dissent of Dubé J.A. involved questions of law rather than fact. After
pointing out that in Leblanc v. The Queen[4],
this Court had held similar fact evidence admissible, not to prove the
criminal act, but to establish guilty intent, he stressed that

[Page 26]

in the case at bar the act itself was what had
to be proved. He then stated that the trial judge had based his decision to
allow the similar fact evidence on the judgment in Harris from which he
quotes, and goes on to say:

[TRANSLATION] It would seem that the trial
judge did not take into account the fact that it that case it is explained that
similar fact evidence can only be admitted in very definite cases:

“to prove intention or mens rea, as
well as to rebut a possible defence of accident.”

Although it is true that the trial judge
referred to Harris, he nevertheless relied mostly on Campbell, as
appears from the last sentence I have quoted from his judgment. Dubé J.A. later
stated:

[TRANSLATION] On the other hand, some
cases, especially R. ex rel. Taggart v. Forage, reported in C.R.N.S.,
Vol. 3 (1968), pp. 117 et seq, allow similar fact evidence to show
homosexual tendencies of the accused, but the judge does insist on the need for
extreme caution in admitting such evidence and stresses this should only be
done in very definite cases.

In the case at bar, appellant saw thousands
of adolescents at interviews, yet only five of these youngsters accused
appellant of having committed homosexual acts. In the circumstances, I feel it
cannot be said that in allowing similar fact evidence, homosexual tendencies in
appellant, or a system to commit homosexual acts, were proven.

It should also be noted that in R. ex
rel. Taggart v. Forage, where similar fact evidence was admitted, the
accused was acquitted because it was found that, on the whole, the evidence
would not support a verdict of guilty with a sufficient degree of certainty.

Apart from the danger of admitting similar
fact evidence, there is in the case at bar an even greater danger resulting
from the fact that the similar facts in question are as uncorroborated as the
charges themselves. In fact, not one of those facts is corroborated by
anything; in each case, the testimony of a young adolescent is denied by the
accused and in no way proven by corroborating evidence.

[Page 27]

It is true that the charges against
appellant are not such as to require corroboration, but the courts have
consistently warned of the danger of convicting a person accused of this type
of crime solely on the word of the victim. It is even more dangerous to accept
such evidence when it is given by a child or adolescent.

The trial judge seems to have considered
that in the case at bar each count was a link added to the chain, as was each
similar fact admitted as evidence. But, in my view, since each of the links is
as weak as the next in terms of evidence, it adds no strength to the chain:
however it must be presumed that the repetition of charges of this nature can
have an enormous influence on the person who has to pass judgment. In the case
at bar, for example, I have great doubt that the trial judge would have found
appellant guilty if only one of the adolescents had testified against him. I
therefore conclude that the verdict of guilt was the result of letting himself
be influenced by the addition of other charges and similar facts.

I fail to see how the decision of Hartt J. in Forage[5] can be urged against the verdict of
Dansereau J. The latter does not appear to disagree of any question of law with
his colleague from Ontario. He came to a different conclusion on the facts, but
I see no reason to suspect that he did it without the required care and
caution.

With respect, I must say that I do not find
judicious at all Dubé J.A.’s comment on the small number of cases found amongst
the thousands of adolescents the accused saw in interviews. If such misconduct
were generalized, it could not go on without being immediately denounced.
Furthermore, there is evidence showing that the number of cases possible is not
in the thousands or hundreds, not even in scores. In fact, after searching and
examining all of the accused’s files, where complete information on interviews
with each adolescent was found, the officers interrogated six or seven boys
only, and of these, two or three were witnesses for the prosecution.

The judgment of Dansereau J. shows that he was
fully aware of the danger of convicting in

[Page 28]

cases of this kind. I see absolutely no reason
for substituting a different assessment of the facts for his, since the
question is essentially one of credibility, and he had the inestimable
advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses. I cannot understand that a judge
of the Court of Appeal would seem to give greater weight to the opinion of a
nun who believed in the innocence of the accused without having heard the
evidence, even if she was Jean-Yves’ and Perri’s grade school teacher at a
boarding school.

Everyone knows that the rule of caution so much
relied by Dubé J.A. was specially stressed by this Court in Horsburgh[6]. What is perhaps not as well-known,
because as far as I know it is unfortunately not reported, is the final outcome
of the case: an acquittal at the retrial, on a finding that there had been a
conspiracy by children who, as an excuse for their immorality, charged the
accused with being their accomplice. In my opinion, the circumstances in the
case at bar, which I considered necessary to state at some length after having
read, reread and analysed the evidence and exhibits, exclude any possibility of
a conspiracy against the accused by the witnesses for the prosecution.

I come now to what may be considered as
questions of law on which the dissenting judge expressed an opinion contrary to
the judgment of the majority. Although far from certain that they are really
the grounds of dissent, I shall, in order to consider the appeal on the most
favourable basis possible, assume that the dissent raises these two questions:

1. Is similar fact evidence inadmissible if it
tends to prove another criminal act;

2. Where there are several counts in an
indictment, may the evidence on one be used to decide on the others.

In Campbell[7], the headnote of which was quoted by
the trial judge, Lord Goddard ended his

[Page 29]

opinion with the following remarks, at pp.
102-103:

As we are endeavouring in this judgment to
deal comprehensively with the evidence of children, we may perhaps endeavour to
give some guidance to courts who have from time to time to deal with cases of
sexual assaults on children where the evidence of each child deals only with
the assault on him or herself. In such cases, it is right to tell a jury that
because A says that the accused assaulted him, it is no corroboration of his
evidence that B says that he also was the victim of a similar assault, though
both say it on oath. At the same time we think a jury may be told that a
succession of these cases may help them to determine the truth of the matter,
provided they are satisfied that there is no collaboration between the children
to put up a false story. And if the defence is one of innocent association by
the accused with the children, the case of Sims, 31 Cr. App. R. 158;
[1946] K.B. 531, subsequently approved on this point by the House of Lords in Harris
v. The Director of Public Prosecutions, 36 Cr. App. R. 39; [1952] A.C. 694,
shows that such evidence can be given to rebut the defence.

Concerning the Harris case, which was
mentioned by every judge on appeal, as well as by the trial judge, Viscount
Simon said, at p. 705:

It is, I think, an error to attempt to draw
up a closed list of the sort of cases in which the principle operates: such a
list only provides instances of its general application, whereas what really
matters is the principle itself and its proper application to the particular
circumstances of the charge that is being tried…

In Kilbourne[8], a case which bears great similarity
to the case at bar, since it deals with homosexual acts committed with six
young boys less than fifteen years old, the House of Lords has reversed the
judgment of the Court of Appeal[9] in
which Lord Denning did not take part and the rule in the Campbell case
was not applied in the same way as both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal
applied it in the case at bar. Lord Hailsham, expressing views endorsed by Lord
Morris and not contradicted by the others, said at p. 741:

I also agree with the Court of Appeal in
saying that the evidence of each child went to contradict any possibility of
innocent association. As such it was admissible as

[Page 30]

part of the prosecution case, and since, by
the time the judge came to sum up, innocent association was the foundation of
the defence put forward by the accused, the admissibility, relevance, and,
indeed cogency of the evidence was beyond question…

In the case at bar, the defence was precisely,
besides character evidence, that the visits of the young witnesses were made
for perfectly legitimate purposes. This defence made the similar fact evidence
admissible in rebuttal. Since, even without such similar fact evidence, the
accused could not possibly have asked for an acquittal without this defence, he
suffered no prejudice from similar fact evidence having been admitted in chief
even assuming the trial judge had erred in this respect. In Kilbourne, as
mentioned by Lord Hailsham, the Court of Appeal held the similar fact evidence
inadmissible and quashed the verdict because the trial judge has told the jury
that the evidence on each count could be considered as corroboration on the
other counts. But Lord Hailsham said at pp. 748-749:

Whatever else it is, the rule about fellow
accomplices is not authority for the proposition that no witness who may
himself require corroboration may afford corroboration for another to whom the
same consideration applies, and this alone is what would help the respondent.
When a small boy relates a sexual incident implicating a given man he may be
indulging in fantasy. If another small boy relates such an incident it may be a
coincidence if the detail is insufficient. If a large number of small boys
relate similar incidents in enough detail about the same person, if it is not
conspiracy it may well be that the stories are true. Once there is a sufficient
nexus it must be for the jury to say what weight is given to the combined testimony
of a number of witnesses.

In Boardman[10], a charge of homosexuality was
again in issue. The accused was the principal of a boarding school for boys.
The three counts involved three students aged sixteen, seventeen and eighteen.
The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction on the third count and let the other
two

[Page 31]

convictions stand. It must be noted that the
trial judge had told the jury that it had to decide on the third count without
considering the evidence presented on the other two, but that the evidence on
each of the first two counts could serve to support the other as similar fact
evidence. In view of the small number of similar acts, the House of Lords
admitted that this case was “right on the borderline” (at p. 445). The
headnote reads:

Held, dismissing
the appeal, that there were circumstances in which, contrary to the general
rule, evidence of criminal acts on the part of an accused other than those with
which he was charged became admissible because of their striking similarity to
other acts being investigated and because of their resulting probative force;
that it was for the judge to decide whether the prejudice to the accused was
outweighed by the probative force of the evidence and to rule accordingly; and
that, on the facts of the present case, the judge had been entitled to direct
the jury as he had done.

Finally, in the recent case of Alward and
Mooney v. The Queen[11], this
Court unanimously affirmed a conviction for a murder when, because it was
committed in the course of a robbery with violence, evidence of two other
robberies with violence had been admitted as similar fact evidence. Expressing
the unanimous opinion of the Court on the question of the admissibility of such
evidence as proof of the alleged criminal act, Spence J. stated at pp. 564-565:

…I find of considerable interest and
relevance the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R. v. Straffen, (1952),
36 Cr. App. R. 132, which dealt with the question of the accused’s admission
that he had strangled two other little girls in circumstances remarkably like
those proved to exist in the strangling of a third with which he was charged.
There Slade J. said:

Mr. Elam said: How far, then, does the
admissibility of such evidence go; does it go to a burglar, housebreaker, thief
and so on? Lord Sumner, in THOMPSON’S CASE (supra), pointed out
that they were merely examples of persons who fell within the genus of
dishonest persons; but, speaking for myself, I think that if the question of
identity arose in a case of housebreaking and it were possible to adduce
evidence that there was some peculiarity in relation to earlier housebreakings,
which was apparent also in the case

[Page 32]

of the housebreaking charged, so as to
stamp the accused man not only with the housebreaking charged but with the
earlier housebreakings, and there was evidence that he had committed the
earlier housebreakings, that would fall within the same principle of
admissibility, not to prove his propensity for housebreaking, but to prove that
he was the person who committed the housebreaking charged.

So that Court was of the opinion that
similar fact evidence was admissible to prove the very fact of identity.

On the admissibility of similar fact evidence, I
think it should be said that it is essentially in the discretion of the trial
judge. In exercising this discretion, he must have regard to the general
principles established by the cases. There is no closed list of the sort of
cases where such evidence is admissible. It is, however, well established that
it may be admitted to rebut a defence of legitimate association for honest
purposes, as well as to rebut evidence of good character. Where the evidence is
admissible on the first mentioned basis, it may be admitted as part of the case
for the prosecution.

Secondly, where similar fact evidence is thus
admissible, the evidence on each similar count may also be used to corroborate
the evidence for the prosecution on each of the other counts. Seeing that
similar fact evidence may be used to rebut the kind of defence above mentioned,
the evidence on each count becomes admissible to rebut the defence on each of
the other counts. It cannot obviously be necessary to have it repeated for this
purpose; it is enough to say that it may be taken into account.

Since I wrote the above, another judgment of the
English Court of Appeal has been reported in which the law on these questions,
in cases involving homosexual acts, has again been reviewed (R. v. Scarroti[12]). The conviction was affirmed on
grounds which imply approval of the principles on which Dansereau J. relied in
first instance to admit similar fact evidence and to judge all counts

[Page 33]

on the overall evidence.

I therefore conclude that the dissenting judge
on appeal erred in holding that each count in the indictment should have been
judged without taking into account the evidence on the others.

I wish to point out that no analogy should be
sought between the questions examined in the instant case and those which may
arise in respect of the use of evidence presented on what is commonly called a voir
dire. The importance of the distinction between this kind of “trial within
a trial” and the trial itself is due to the special rules governing it, see The
Queen v. Gauthier[13]. These
rules can in no way be likened to those governing rebuttal evidence.

I am of the opinion that the appeal should be
dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law — Breaking and entering with intent —
Presumptions — Evidence given by defence disbelieved by trial judge — No
""evidence to the contrary"" so as to prevent operation of subs. 2(a)
of s. 306 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 — Evidence must be such as
will at least raise reasonable doubt as to guilt.

The accused was charged with breaking and entering a
place with intent to commit an indictable offence therein, contrary to s.
306(1) (a) of the Criminal Code . The accused gave evidence which the
trial judge did not believe. The question therefore before the Court was
whether evidence given by the defence but disbelieved by the trier of fact is
""any evidence to the contrary"" so as to prevent the operation of
subs. 2(a) of s. 306 of the Code which states: ""For the
purposes of proceedings under this section, evidence that the accused (a) broke
and entered a place is, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, proof
that he broke and entered with intent to commit an indictable offence
therein"".

The trial judge considered himself bound by two
decisions of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, R. v. Marshall, [1971]
1 C.C.C. (2d) 505, and R. v. Rivera, [1975] 2 W.W.R. 56, which appeared
to require only testimony believed or unbelieved by the trier of fact on the
issue of intent to commit an indictable offence at the place in question in
order to rebut the statutory pre­sumption of proof of intent. Accordingly, the
trial judge dismissed the charge and acquitted the accused. An appeal was
thereupon taken to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia which by a unanimous
decision expressed itself to be bound by the Marshall case, and
consequently the appeal was dismissed. The Crown appealed from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be allowed and a
conviction entered.

[Page 526]

Per curiam: Evidence disbelieved by the trier
of fact is not ""evidence to the contrary"" within the meaning of s. 306(2) (a)
of the Criminal Code .

Per Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz
and Pratte JJ.: There should be no difference between the effect of a
presumption of fact and of a presumption of law which is not expressed in such
terms as to require the accused to ""establish"" or to
""prove"" a given fact or excuse. When a presumption of law is
expressed in such terms, it is settled that the burden on the accused is to
prove the fact or excuse on the preponderance of evi­dence or on a balance of
probabilities.

Such is not the situation when all the presumption
of law does is to establish a prima facie case. The burden of proof does
not shift. The accused does not have to ""establish"" a defence or an
excuse; all he has to do is to raise a reasonable doubt. If there is nothing in
the evidence adduced by the Crown from which a reasonable doubt can arise, then
the accused will necessarily have the burden of adducing evidence if he is to
escape conviction. However, he will not have the burden of proving his
innocence; it will be sufficient if, at the conclusion of the case on both
sides, the trier of fact has a reasonable doubt.

The change effected by subs. 92(2) of the Criminal
Law Amendment Act, 1968-69, including s. 306 of the Code, consisted
in substituting for the words ""is prima facie evidence"", the
words ""is, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, proof"".
There was no indica­tion that this change was meant to do more than replace
those two Latin words by equivalent English and French phrases. The new words
used are quite consistent with the preservation of the anterior meaning,
bearing in mind that the basic principle is guilt ""beyond a reasonable
doubt"", so that unless Parliament has enacted a presumption in terms which
require an accused to ""prove"" an excuse he has to do no more than
raise a ""reasonable doubt"" to escape conviction.

There is no substantial difference between
""evidence to the contrary"" and ""any evidence to the
contrary"". Both expressions are equally the converse of ""no evi­dence
to the contrary"" and there is no basis for a distinction depending on the
presence or absence of the word ""any"".

There are in our criminal law only three standards of
evidence: 1. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt which is the standard to be met by
the Crown against the accused; 2. Proof on a preponderance of the
evidence or a balance of probabilities which is the burden of proof

[Page 527]

on the accused when he has to meet a presumption
requiring him to establish or to prove a fact or an excuse; 3. Evidence raising
a reasonable doubt which is what is required to overcome any other presumption
of fact or of law.

The standard of evidence required for a conviction,
including the standard of the evidence required to overcome a prima
facie case against the accused, is just as basic a principle as the right
of the accused to remain silent. In fact, it may be considered as a
qualification of this principle. The accused may remain silent but, when there
is a prima facie case against him and he is, as in the instant
case, the only person who can give ""evidence to the contrary"" his
choice is to face certain conviction or to offer in testimony whatever
explanation or excuse may be available to him.

If the prima facie case is made up by the
proof of facts from which guilt may be inferred by presumption of fact, the law
is clear on the authorities that, because the case in the end must be proved
beyond a reasonable doubt, it is not necessary for the accused to establish his
innocence, but only to raise a reasonable doubt. This he may do by giving
evidence of an explanation that may reasonably be true, and it will be
sufficient unless he is disbelieved by the trier of fact, in which case his tes­timony
is no evidence. In any case, the evidence given by himself or otherwise, has to
be such as will at least raise a reasonable doubt as to his guilt; if it does
not meet this test the prima facie case remains and conviction will
ensue.

Ungaro v. R., [1950] S.C.R. 430, applied; Tremblay
v. R., [1969] S.C.R. 431; R. v. Newton, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 399;
Batary v. A.G. of Saskatchewan, [1965] S.C.R. 465, referred to.

Per Laskin C.J. and Spence and Estey JJ.: The
plain meaning of the phrase ""any evidence"" denies the validi­ty of
the suggestion that the Code imposes an, onus of proof or burden of
proof on the accused. Once the trial judge determines that the evidence is
admissible and relevant to the issue of intent, and the trier of fact does not
reject the evidence, there is evidence to the contrary within the meaning of s.
306(2) . There is no further standard to be met. Section 306(2)  and like
sections of the Code create no onus or burden on the accused to 'rebut'
a presumption of intent or to adduce evidence to show lack of intent 'beyond a
reasonable doubt' or on the balance of probabilities or otherwise. The accused
by the subsection has the right and is given the opportunity to introduce
evidence on the issue of intent and such evidence, if believed or accepted by
the trier of fact whether or not by itself such evidence is sufficient to

[Page 528]

determine the issue of intent, is sufficient for the
limited purpose of repelling the operation of subs. (2) because it necessarily
means that the accused has met the pre­sumption. The Crown must then prove the
charge including the element of intent against the accused as though subs. (2)
did not exist. Only in that sense of the term does the accused have a burden
under the subsection.

On the facts and in the circumstances of this
proceed­ing, the appeal must be allowed. The evidence advanced by the accused
on the issue of his intent was considered and disbelieved by the trial judge in
his role as the trier of fact. Therefore on the issue of intent there was no
evidence to the contrary and the presumption applied not because the accused
failed to prove his lack of intent to commit an indictable offence on the
premises 'beyond a reasonable doubt', or to a balance of probabilities or by a
prima facie case, but because the record contained no evidence on
the issue of intent 'to the contrary'.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia dismissing the

[Page 529]

Crown's appeal from the acquittal of the respond­ent on a
charge of breaking and entering a place with intent to commit an indictable
offence there-in, contrary to s. 306(1) (a) of the Criminal Code . Appeal
allowed.

M. R. V. Storrow, for the appellant. 

Peter Messner, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Spence and Estey JJ. was
delivered by

ESTEY J.—This appeal concerns the proper meaning of the
expression ""in the absence of any evidence to the contrary"" as it
appears in s. 306(2)  of the Criminal Code . The accused was
charged with breaking and entering a place with intent to commit an indictable
offence therein, under s. 306(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  of Canada. The
accused gave evidence about which the learned Provincial Court judge at trial
stated, ""To put the matter simply, I did not believe him"". The ques­tion
therefore before the Court was whether evi­dence given by the defence but
disbelieved by the trier of fact is ""any evidence to the contrary"" so
as to prevent the operation of subs. (2)(a) of s. 306 of the Code which
states:

(2) For the purposes of proceedings under this section, evidence
that the accused

(a) broke and entered a place is, in the absence of any
evidence to the contrary, proof that he broke and entered with intent to
commit an indictable offence therein; (emphasis added).

The circumstances in which the alleged offence occurred were
described at trial by the trial judge as follows:

There is no dispute concerning the essential facts.

Proudlock was residing temporarily with Mark Shields, above
the ""Coffee House Restaurant"", owned by Shields' mother. During the
evening of January 14th, there was a drinking party in these premises. Later
that same night Proudlock broke into the restaurant. To do this he placed a
ladder by a back window, broke the window, climbed inside and pulled the ladder
inside after himself.

Inside the restaurant Proudlock encountered the jani­tor and
upon being asked what he was doing, Proudlock told the janitor that Mark
Shields had given him the

[Page 530]

key, and sent him down to fetch a couple of cans of soup.
The janitor took some garbage outside and upon returning, observed that Proudlock
had departed. He left through the back door.

Proudlock made an accurate statement concerning these
matters to Cst. Tidsbury, and the fact that he broke into the restaurant was
admitted by him when he testified during his trial.

In the statement taken by Cst. Tidsbury, the following
appears:

""Q. Did you steal anything from inside the restaurant? 

A. No, I didn't.

Q. Why did you break into the restaurant? 

A. I don't know. I don't know why I did it.""

When he testified, Proudlock said that he did not have an
explanation and did not know what his motives had been. He acknowledged that it
was ""possible"" he had told the janitor he was looking for soup, but
said that would not have been a true statement of his purpose. He resolutely
denied any intention to steal.

The trial judge in commenting upon the facts stated:

I did not find Proudlock's evidence, when he was asked why
he broke and entered the restaurant to be convincing in the least degree. To
put the matter simply, I did not believe him. .. .

In my opinion, Proudlock broke and entered the res­taurant
purposefully, and I do not believe that purpose has escaped his memory. .. .

and finally:

I do not believe Proudlock.

The learned trial judge, however, considered himself bound by two
decisions of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, Regina v. Marshall[1]
and Regina v. Rivera[2], which
appear to require only testimony believed or unbelieved by the trier of fact on
the issue of intent to commit an indictable offence at the place in question in
order to rebut the statutory presumption of proof of intent. Accordingly, the
learned trial judge dismissed the charge and acquitted the accused.

[Page 531]

An appeal was thereupon taken to the Court of Appeal of British
Columbia which by a unanimous decision expressed itself to be bound by the Marshall
case, supra. McFarlane J.A. in giving his reasons for dismissal of
the appeal by the Crown stated:

For my part, I may say that my opinion is that the judgment
in the Marshall case was wrong. I am, never­theless, bound by it
and bound to follow it in the present case.

Maclean J.A. and McIntyre J.A. agreed with the comments of
McFarlane J.A.

At trial the defence of drunkenness was advanced and rejected by
the trial judge and this defence was mentioned by the Crown before the Court of
Appeal apparently for the purpose of keeping the defence open in case the
proceeding should go further. Before this Court the defence of drunkenness was
not advanced on behalf of the respondent and therefore we are now concerned
only with the issue arising under s. 306(2) .

History of Section 306(2) (a)

The presumption now appearing in s. 306(2) of the Code first
appeared in 1938 as s. 459(2) when it was introduced by s. 25 of
the Criminal Code Amendment Act being Chapter 44 of the Statutes of
Canada, 1938, which provided as follows:

(2) The breaking and entering by day of a dwelling house
shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to commit an indictable
offence therein.

Without the assistance of this provision, the Crown would have to
prove the requisite intent by some other positive means. As Roach J.A. said in Rex
v. O'Connell[3], at
p. 368, in connection with a related section of the Code:

This it may do by proving such circumstances as justify the
inference beyond reasonable doubt that the breaking and entering was with the
intent charged.

It is to be noted that the section did not provide any guidance
as to the threshold to be met by the Crown before it would have been allowed to
invoke the presumption. The subsection was silent as to whether or not the breaking
and entering must

[Page 532]

have been adjudged or found by a court to have occurred, or
whether there need only have been some evidence that the defendant had broken
and entered the premises. The presumption then of course only extended to the
making of the fact of the occurrence of the breaking and entering, prima facie
evidence of the requisite intent to commit an indictable offence in the
premises. The effect of presumptions which constitute evidence of one fact as prima
facie evidence of another was considered in R. v. Vitale[4],
and in Austin v. The Queen[5] specifically
with reference to this provision in its earlier form.

Section 459(2) was next amended by S.C. 1950, c. 11, s. 5 of
which repealed all of ss. 457, 458 and 459 and substituted therefor the
following provision:

457. (1) Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and
liable to imprisonment for life who

(a) breaks and enters a dwelling-house with intent to commit
any indictable offence therein; or

(b) breaks and enters any dwelling-house and com­mits any
indictable offence therein; or

(c) breaks out of any dwelling-house either after committing
any indictable offence therein, or after having entered such dwelling-house
with intent to commit an indictable offence therein.

(2) Every one convicted of an offence under this section who
when arrested, or when he committed such offence, had upon his person any
offensive weapon, shall, in addition to the imprisonment above prescribed, be
liable to be whipped.

(3) The breaking and entering of a dwelling-house or the
breaking out of a dwelling-house after having entered such dwelling-house shall
be prima facie evi­dence of an intent to commit an indictable offence
therein.

In 1954, s. 457(3) was replaced by s. 292(2)  of the Criminal
Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51:

(2) For the purposes of proceedings under this sec­tion,
evidence that an accused

(a) broke and entered a place is prima facie evidence
that he broke and entered with intent to commit an indictable offence therein;
or

[Page 533]

(b) broke out of a place is prima facie evidence
that he broke out after

(i) committing an indictable offence therein, or

(ii) entering with intent to commit an indictable offence
therein.

Fourteen years later by s. 92(2) of the Criminal Law Amendment
Act, 1968-69 being Chapter 38, Statutes of Canada 17-18 Eliz. II,
Parliament enacted the subsection in its present form. At the same time some 15
other sections of the Criminal Code  were amended to provide common
terminolo­gy for the statutory presumption in similar provi­sions. In substance
therefore the 1954 version pro­vided that the 'evidence' of the break and entry
constituted 'prima facie' evidence of the intent to commit an indictable
offence in the premises; whereas under the 1968 version of the section,
'evidence' of the break and entry is 'proof' of the secondary intent but only
in the absence of evi­dence to the contrary.

There have been numerous instances where the nature of the
'contrary evidence' is discussed and an examination of some of these
authorities will be helpful in determining the issue now raised. Before turning
to some of these decisions, it may be helpful to consider the present version
of s. 306. The offence is created in s. 306(1) (a) as follows:

(1) Every one who

(a) breaks and enters a place with intent to commit
an indictable offence therein, ... is guilty of an indictable offence .. .

Subsection (2)(a) then proceeds:

For the purposes of proceedings under this section, evidence
that an accused

(a) broke and entered a place is, in the absence of
any evidence to the contrary, proof that he broke and entered with intent to
commit an indictable offence therein;

Subsection (2)(a) may be contrasted to such provisions in the Code
as s. 237(1)(a) which provides in part:

... he shall be deemed to have had the care or control of
the vehicle unless he establishes that he did not enter or mount the vehicle
for the purpose of setting it in motion;

[Page 534]

A further variation is found in s. 247(3) which states:

… is not a defence unless the accused proves that the
failure to resist was not caused by threat ...

The proof of the offence under s. 306(1)  requires proof beyond a
reasonable doubt not only of the break and entry but also of the specific
intent to commit an indictable offence in those premises. The latter may be
proven by the statutory presumption if there is no 'evidence to the contrary'.
The word 'evidence' occurs twice in subs. (2)(a) and it is trite to observe
that ordinar­ily a word is assigned the same meaning where it appears in a
statute particularly where the word recurs in the same sentence as is the case
here. Thus it would follow that if the prosecution may lead 'evidence' which
shows that a break and entry has occurred, and that same evidence is also
'proof that the person who broke and entered the premises did so with ""the
intent to commit an indictable offence therein"", (subject to the condi­tion
""in the absence of any evidence to the con­trary""), the initial
evidence relating to the break and entry must constitute something in the
nature of conclusive evidence which establishes the fact of the break and
entry. Dubin J.A. in Regina v. Imrich[6], at
p. 91 (a dissenting opinion, the majori­ty opinion being confirmed by this
Court in the same report at p. 92) in dealing with a like provi­sion used the
word 'concluded' with reference to the initial act (here the break and entry)
in the sense that if the trier of fact, then a jury, accepted the evidence as
establishing that fact, then the presumption comes into play. The majority of
the Court of Appeal and this Court thereafter did not deal with this issue.

The word 'proof in the subsection adds a quality of decisiveness,
finality or judgment to the mean­ing or classification of 'evidence' where the
word first appears in the subsection. That is to say, evidence which amounts to
'proof' of intent, on the operation of the presumption, must when tendered on
the initial issue of break and enter, have the appropriate quality, weight and
decisiveness which will support a finding by the trier of fact that a

[Page 535]

break and entry has indeed occurred. The Oxford English
Dictionary, for example, assigns several meanings to 'proof', including
""evidence sufficient (or contributing) to establish a fact or produce
belief. Evidence such as determines the judgment of a tribunal.""

This leaves open the argument that, notwith­standing the finding
of the break and entry beyond a reasonable doubt and notwithstanding the
absence of any evidence negating the requisite secondary intent, the
presumption in subs. (2) only operates to the extent of establishing 'prima
facie evidence' of the secondary intent. As pointed out, the subsection was
amended in 1968 by the replacement of 'prima facie evidence' with 'proof
of intent. It is not without significance that Parlia­ment, in the 1968 omnibus
Criminal Law Amendment legislation, reduced the effect of a 'certifi­cate'
in five Code sections from ""prima facie evidence"" to
""evidence"" while at the same time substituting in s. 306(2)  and
fifteen other provi­sions the word ""proof"" for ""prima facie evidence""
with reference to the probative, secondary effect of the operation of the
presumption on the primary evidence. It is difficult to conclude that
Parliament was not thereby deliberately upgrading the eviden­tiary impact in s.
306(2) of the evidence of the break and entry, as applied to the issue of
intent. Notwithstanding writings to the contrary such as Chapter 3 of Salhany
and Carter, Studies in Canadian Criminal Evidence, (1972), and the
judgments of the County Court in Nova Scotia Regina v. Campbell[7],
and Regina v. Probert[8], as
well as the decisions in Regina v. Whitty[9] and
Regina v. Hipke[10], I
must, with great respect, conclude that Parliament did indeed deliberately
increase the impact of the presumption on the issue of the secondary intent.

It may well be that Parliament, in adopting this change of
terminology, has sought to accommo­date the phraseology of s. 306(2) of
the Code to s. 24(1)  of the Interpretation Act  of Canada being

[Page 536]

R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, which enacts that where a statute provides
that a document is evidence of a fact, such a document is admissible in
evidence ""and the fact shall be deemed to be established in the absence of
any evidence to the contrary"". The words ""deemed to be established""
clearly reveal a legislative intent to provide a different and strong­er
evidentiary impact than would be the case if the words employed were
""shall be prima facie evi­dence"". In the same way,
Parliament's replacement in s. 306(2) of ""is prima facie evidence""
by ""is, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, proof"",
reveals an intent to increase the impact of the presumption. The effect of the
change is to increase the level of impact of the evidence on the primary issue
by the upgrading of the secondary effect from ""prima facie evidence""
to ""proof"". This is but a further illustration of the intention of
the legislator to give a secondary effect to the primary evidence so that the
same testimony shall not only demonstrate the first element of the statutory
offence, but shall in the absence of contrary evidence be taken to demonstrate
the second element.

This brings one to the second use of the term 'evidence' in this
subsection. The sense in which the word is employed becomes clear if the provi­sion
is read in the following sequence:

Evidence that an accused broke and entered a place is proof
that he broke and entered with intent to commit an indictable offence therein,
in the absence of any evidence to the contrary. (Emphasis added.)

Obviously the 'contrary' evidence must relate to and be evidence
of the lack of intent. It is of course important to note the influence of the
word 'any' on the nature or quality of the requisite 'evidence'. It must be
accepted for the purpose of this analysis that 'any' connotes the smallest item
of evidence by weight or volume on the issue of intent, and that its presence
in the sentence indicates that such evidence on the issue of intent will
suffice to qualify as 'evidence' in the phrase ""any evidence to the
contrary"". It must of course be admissible testimony or documentary
evidence to become evi­dence at trial and this will be determined by the
presiding judge be it trial by judge and jury or by judge alone. The accused in
effect contends that

[Page 537]

evidence in the expression ""evidence to the con­trary""
refers to mere testimony or documentary materials which, once they are admitted
as evi­dence on the record, will suffice as ""evidence to the contrary""
whether such evidence be ultimately believed or accepted by the trier of fact
on the issue of the accused's intent to commit an indictable offence on the
premises. A different result may well obtain where the Legislature employs the
words ""in the absence of evidence to the contrary is proof ..."" as in
s. 6(8) of the Code. Section 9(1) of the Narcotics Control Act similarly
deletes the word ""any"" before the word ""evidence"". If mean­ing
is to be accorded to all words in a statute in its interpretation, the word
""any"" must indicate a legislative intent to reduce the
""evidence"" required to amount to ""evidence to the
contrary"".

The tendered testimony must, as the section provides, constitute
evidence bearing on the issue of the secondary intent, that is the intent to
commit an indictable offence on the premises, and whether it meets this threshold
test of being evidence relevant to the issue of intent and which might be
accepted by the trier of fact as evidence tending to prove or negate the
secondary intent, will be determined by the presiding judge. In the case of a
trial by a court composed of a judge and jury, it will be the function of the
judge to determine if the evidence is capable, if believed by the jury, of
being evidence on the issue of intent. It will be for the jury then to decide
if the evidence so tendered is believed. Vide Devlin J. in Regina v.
National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Commissioner[11],
at p. 856. Sometimes this is expressed as evidence ""tending to show
the accused did not have an intent ..."" . Vide Regina v. Hachey, Rideout
and Rideout[12]
per Hughes J.A., as he then was, at p. 244. In the final step of the
process, if the proffered testimony cannot be accepted by the trier of fact as
indicating the absence of intent, it is not 'evidence to the con­trary' on the
issue of intent although it will contin­ue to be evidence on the record.

[Page 538]

The foregoing steps of course involve the deter­mination of
whether the issue as to whether there be any evidence to the contrary raises a
question of law or fact. The Courts which have encountered this question to
date have found a variety of answers. Davis J. in the Court of Queen's Bench of
Saskatchewan in Regina v. Strain[13] decided
that whether any particular evidence qualified as 'any evidence to the
contrary' is a question of fact to be determined by the trier of fact when determining
whether the tendered evidence is ""acceptable evidence"" (p. 413), (Vide
R. v. Cairns[14]). McFarlane
J.A. of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Regina v. Watkins[15],
at p. 199, quite properly in my view drew a distinction between determining
whether evidence was capable of being 'evidence to the contrary' (which he
found to be a question of law) and whether the particular evidence tendered was
accepted by the trier of fact as evidence to the contrary on the issue of
intent (which the Court of Appeal considered to be a question of fact). Because
it was an appeal from a trial by judge alone, the Court was not called upon to
assign precisely the two functions but the clear inference is that the
application of the subsection and in the result, of the presumption, requires a
two-stage process in the last stage of which the trier of fact must determine whether
the evidence tendered is to be accepted on the issue of intent as 'evidence to
the contrary'.

The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta Regina
v. Kalan[16]
took a different view of a like provision in s. 233(3) of the Code. The judgment
of the Court was delivered by Lieberman J.A. who said at p. 314 that:

To state that there was nothing in the evidence to discharge
the onus when there was ample evidence, if accepted, to do so, is in my
respectful view an error of law alone.

As observed earlier the answer to the question whether there is
""any evidence to the contrary"" is in some circumstances (i.e. if the
issue is one of admissibility or relevancy) a question of law. On

[Page 539]

other occasions, where the issue raised is whether the testimony
is believed, the question is one of fact. (Vide R. v. Morse[17],
at p. 230.)

Returning to the interpretative issue at hand, the same
conclusion is reached by attributing the same persuasive quality to the word
'evidence' in each of the two instances where it appears in subs. (2)(a). The
evidence of the break and entry even without the parallel use of the word
'proof' must be such as to demonstrate the occurrence of the physical act of
breaking and entering. Without the break and entry being established, there is
no 'evidence' which is deemed to be 'proof' of the secondary intent. A mere
suspicion that breaking and entering have occurred could not set the pre­sumption
in subs. (2) in motion so as to bring about the 'proof' of the intent to commit
an indictable offence on the premises. Obviously the stand­ard of evidence
relating to the break and entry must be such as to produce 'proof' of that fact
before qualifying as 'proof of the 'intent' as well. To read the subsection
otherwise would be to convert the presumption into an amplifier which would
enhance evidence of any weight, quality or probative value of the act of
breaking and enter­ing, into 'proof of the intent to commit an offence once in
the premises.

These same words, 'evidence to the contrary' occur in the section
of the Code relating to the use of the breathalyzer evidence which was
before the Court in Regina v. Noble[18]. Ritchie
J. on behalf of the Court stated (at p. 638):

The effect of s. 237 both before and after the amendment is
to establish the conditions under which the certificate of a qualified
technician is admissible, without further evidence, as proof of the proportion
of alcohol in the blood of the accused. These provisions are obviously designed
to assist the Crown in proving its case, and as they serve to restrict the
normal rights of the accused to cross-examination and saddle him with the
burden of proving that the certificate does not accurately reflect his blood
alcohol content at the time of the alleged offence, they are to be strictly
construed and, where ambiguous, interpreted in favour of the accused.

[Page 540]

It is important to recall that in the Noble case, supra,
the Court was not dealing with any eviden­tiary question let alone the
meaning of 'evidence to the contrary' but rather with the interpretation of
that part of the section describing the procedure for the taking of breath
samples. The issue raised in this appeal takes one further into the analysis of
the meaning of the term 'evidence to the contrary', as here the trier of fact
has rejected as unbeliev­able the testimony of the accused offered in rebut­tal
on the issue of his secondary intent. Two questions necessarily arise at this
point; firstly, can rejected testimony still amount to 'evidence to the
contrary', and secondly, what is the burden, if any, on the accused to rebut
the presumption raised in s. 306?

The Court of Appeal of British Columbia faced this situation in Regina
v. Marshall, supra. The trial judge applied s. 306(2) (a) so as to
require the accused to rebut the statutory presumption ""on a balance of
probabilities"". Branca J.A, speaking for the Court appears to have reduced
the standard of testimony required to remove the presumption from the issue of
secondary intent. He put it this way (p. 507):

Once the appellant had testified, there was evidence in the
case ""to the contrary"" of the presumption contained in s. 292(2) (a) which
precluded the application of that section.

In support of this conclusion, the decision of the New Brunswick
Court of Appeal in Regina v. Hachey, supra, was cited. However, Hughes
J.A., as he then was, applied the wording of subs. (2) somewhat
differently (at pp. 243-4):

Consequently where evidence tending to show the absence of
an intent to commit an indictable offence is received in evidence ss. (2) has
no application.

The Court did not then have to meet the ques­tion raised here but
it is interesting to note that Hughes J.A. (at p. 244) stated:

It is to be noted that the learned Judge did not say he
disbelieved the evidence of Crown witnesses tending to show the absence of a
criminal intent on the part of the appellants. There was, I think, evidence
showing that the appellants did not have an intent to commit an

[Page 541]

indictable offence which was sufficient to displace the
presumption created by s. 293(2).

The Court of Appeal of Prince Edward Island considered this
problem in Regina v. Cairns, supra, and concluded that the accused by
subs. 306(2) carried a burden to satisfy the Court to the point of probability
that the 'contrary' on the issue of intent has been shown. In the end, the
Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from a trial judgment wherein the trial
judge rejected the evidence to the contrary on the simple ground that it was
disbelieved. To the same effect is the recent decision in R. v. Deitz[19],
in connection with the presump­tion prescribed in s. 233(3) of the Code.

In Regina v. Bernardi[20],
the Ontario Court of Appeal found that alibi evidence was not 'evidence to the
contrary' on the issue of intent to defraud under s. 391 of the Code. That
same Court in Regina v. Campbell[21] considered
a trial judgment in which the accused's testimony on intent was rejected, the
statutory presumption in consequence was applied, and the conclusion was
reached that the accused intended to commit an offence on the premises.
Inferentially, the Court found the trial judge to have correctly applied the
subsection to the circumstances where the evidence tendered 'to the contrary'
was disbelieved and thereby rejected as evidence to the contrary by the trial
judge. The Court of Appeal did in the end reverse the trial judge on the ground
that there was other evidence which had been accepted by the trial judge and
which was evidence to the contrary on the issue of intent. The Court, speaking
through Martin J.A., stated at p. 322:

In our view, when there is evidence to the contrary, in the
sense of evidence tending to negative the existence of the necessary intent,
the onus is then upon the prosecu­tion to prove the existence of the necessary
intent beyond a reasonable doubt.

In my view, a proper reading of the section requires the
recognition of a distinction between 'any evidence' in the sense of admissible
testimony, and 'any evidence of the intent of the accused'.

[Page 542]

The acceptance of the testimony as evidence on the issue of
secondary intent is to accept it as 'evidence to the contrary'. Conversely,
rejection of admis­sible evidence as 'evidence of intent' precludes such
evidence from being 'evidence to the con­trary' for the purposes of subs. (2)
although such evidence will remain a part of the record.

It follows therefore that if the trier of fact does not believe
the evidence so tendered, the statutory presumption operates and (there being
no other evidence on the issue) the evidence of the break and entry is 'proof
of the specific intent to commit an indictable offence on the premises. If on
the other hand the tendered evidence is believed, then the statutory
presumption does not operate and the trier of fact must then apply the ordinary
onus of proof and require the Crown to prove the charge beyond a reasonable
doubt including both the break and entry and the intent to commit a crime on
the premises. Where the trier of fact believes the testimony on the issue of
intent, the trier thereby finds that there is 'evidence to the con­trary' and
then must proceed to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused on all of
the evidence, and in this process, s. 306(2)  has no application, and the onus
of proof beyond a reasonable doubt remains upon the Crown.

We come then to the final issue in this appeal. Assuming that the
trial judge has ruled the tes­timony or written material proffered by the
accused as 'evidence to the contrary' to be admis­sible and relevant to the
issue raised by the pre­sumption, and assuming as well that the trier of fact
has not rejected the evidence as incapable of belief, is there any further onus
on the accused created by the section? There are, it seems, numer­ous decisions
which either expressly or by implica­tion support the view that the accused
must labour under an onus or burden of raising a reasonable doubt by his
contrary evidence. An examination of some of these authorities may be helpful.

In Regina v. Peterman[22],
Gansner Co. Ct. J. at p. 343 held that an accused confronted by a certifi­cate
under the breathalyzer provisions of the

[Page 543]

Criminal Code  must adduce evidence which is ""not only
capable of raising a reasonable doubt, but ... actually does so"". In R.
v. Rauckman[23], McLean
J.M.C. referred in connection with s. 237(1) (c) to 'possible' evidence to the
contrary which would make it unwise to accept the evidence of the certificate.
Similarly in Regina v. Beaulieu[24] a
reference is made to the evidence to the contrary raising a reasonable doubt as
to the suitability of the solution in the breathalyzer instrument. Darling Co.
Ct. J. in Regina v. Black[25], at
p. 189, spoke of evidence to the contrary which might reasonably be true, or
which is sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to intent. Other cases which
are to the same effect in suggesting that there is an onus on the accused to
rebut the presumption by adducing evidence to the contrary raising a reasonable
doubt are Regina v. Davis[26];
Regina v. Dygdala[27], where
reference is made to evidence which makes doubtful the accuracy of the
analysis of the accused's blood alcohol level; Regina v. Johnnie and Namox[28],
where 'any evidence to the contrary' was defined by Branca J.A, as that
which might have provided an effective defence that the accused was so drunk as
to be unable to form the specific intent to commit an indictable offence; R.
v. Pernfus[29], where
Cashman Co. Ct. J. refers to the benefit of the reasonable doubt aris­ing from
the evidence to the contrary; R. v. Prob­ert, supra; Regina v. Campbell,
supra; Regina v. Sikora[30];
R. ex rel. Webb v. Tarr[31];
Regina v. Westman[32], at
p. 357, where Culliton C.J.S. speaks of ""evidence that would render it
improper for the trial judge to accept the analysis as proof beyond a
reasonable doubt as to the proportion of alcohol""; R. v. Whitty, supra,
where Morgan J.A. speaks of evidence which ""might reasonably be true""
and ""therefore capable of raising a reasonable

[Page 544]

doubt as to guilty intent"".

Another line of cases appears to require not merely any evidence
to the contrary but evidence which is definite and positive in character
to rebut the presumption (vide R. v. Gaetz[33];
R. v. Falkenham[34]). Still
other cases merely refer to an ""onus"" on the accused (vide R. v. Kalan,
supra; R. v. Achilles and Kamperogianis[35]); or
speak of the accused proving a fact to rebut the presumption (vide Regina v.
Ryckman[36],
per McDermid J.A. at p. 296); or allude to the existence of a burden on the
accused (vide R. v. Noble, supra); or note that the accused must
demonstrate a ""reasonable possi­bility"" that the fact proved by the
presumption is not so (vide R. v. Warnock[37]); or
refer to the ""weight"" of evidence which as a matter of law is capable
of constituting ""evidence to the contrary"" (vide Regina v. Morse,
supra); or compel the accused to adduce ""sufficient [evidence] to
displace the presumption"" (vide R. v. Oliver[38]);
or imply that the accused must submit ""une preuve probante à l'effet
contraire"", (vide Regina v. Di Serio[39]); or
suggest that ""defence evidence in rebuttal of the statutory presumption
... must be weighed as to its effect on the presumption"", (vide R. v.
Reeves[40]),
per Clement J.A. at p. 95.

The decisions in R. v. Cairns, supra, and R. v. Deitz,
supra, in my view run contrary to the plain words of the Code. I cannot
see how the phrase ""any evidence to the contrary"" can be construed as
obliging the accused to prove on all of the evidence his lack of intent. It
would be entirely different if, as in R. v. Appelby[41],
the Code required the accused to establish a particular fact.
Here the record need include only any evidence adduced by the
prosecution or defence. The plain meaning of the words employed by Parliament
in s. 306(2) 

[Page 545]

leads me to reject any notion that the accused must rebut the
presumption in s. 306 by adducing evidence to the contrary demonstrating beyond
a reasonable doubt, or on the balance of probabili­ties his lack of intent, or
that the accused must make out a prima facie case that he had no such
intent. Other cases dealing with these statutory presumptions and their
reversal are gathered to­gether in McWilliams, Canadian Criminal Evi­dence (1974)
at pp. 401-2 where the learned author seems to conclude that the only 'burden'
on the accused is to adduce 'some' evidence to the contrary.

Yet the plain meaning of the phrase ""any evi­dence""
denies the validity of the suggestion that the Code imposes an onus of
proof or burden of proof on the accused. Once the trial judge determines that
the evidence is admissible and relevant to the issue of intent, and the trier
of fact does not reject the evidence, there is evidence to the con­trary within
the meaning of s. 306(2) . There is no further standard to be met. In my
respectful view, s. 306(2)  and like sections of the Code create no onus
or burden on the accused to 'rebut' a pre­sumption of intent or to adduce
evidence to show lack of intent 'beyond a reasonable doubt' or on the balance
of probabilities or otherwise. The accused by the subsection has the right and
is given the opportunity to introduce evidence on the issue of intent and such
evidence, if believed or accepted by the trier of fact whether or not by itself
such evidence is sufficient to determine the issue of intent, is sufficient for
the limited purpose of repelling the operation of subs. (2) because it
necessarily means that the accused has met the presumption. The Crown must then
prove the charge including the element of intent against the accused as though
subs. (2) did not exist. Only in that sense of the term does the accused have a
burden under the subsection.

On the facts and in the circumstances of this proceeding, the
appeal must be allowed. The evi­dence advanced by the accused on the issue of
his intent was considered and disbelieved by the trial judge in his role as the
trier of fact. Therefore on the issue of intent there was no evidence to the
contrary and the presumption applied not because

[Page 546]

the accused failed to prove his lack of intent to commit an indictable
offence on the premises 'beyond a reasonable doubt', or to a balance of
probabilities or by a prima facie case, but because the record
contained no evidence on the issue of intent 'to the contrary'.

The Crown before this Court asked that the ""Judgment of the
Court of Appeal of British Columbia be set aside"". This request is
ambiguous and would leave the underlying disposition of acquittal untouched. It
follows that the learned trial judge unburdened by authorities which he
properly interpreted as requiring him in the cir­cumstances to proceed without
regard to the pre­sumption of intent, would have been required to convict the
accused, all elements of the offence having been proved. In my view of the law
thereon,

(a) the appeal should be allowed, the disposi­tions below
set aside, and pursuant to s. 613(4) (b)(ii) of the Criminal Code , a conviction
entered; and

(b) this proceeding should be remitted to the court of first
instance for determination and imposition of the appropriate sentence.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and
Pratte JJ. was delivered by

PIGEON J.—I have had the advantage of read­ing the reasons
written by Estey J. in this case. He has fully stated the facts and I will not
repeat them. I agree with his conclusion that evidence disbelieved by the trier
of fact is not ""evidence to the contrary"" within the meaning of subs.
(2)(a) of s. 306  of the Criminal Code , as Rinfret C.J. said in Ungaro
v. The King[42], at
p. 431: ""If the trial judge does not believe the accused the result is
that no explanation at all is left, ..."" (emphasis added). However,
because I do not reach this conclusion on the same view of the effect of the
relevant provisions of the Criminal Code  as my learned brother, I find
it necessary to set down my own reasons in full.

[Page 547]

Prior to the enactment of the Criminal Law Amendment Act,
1968-69 (17-18 Eliz. II, c. 38) subs. (2)(a) of s. 306 of the Code
(then being s. 292) read:

(2) For the purposes of proceedings under this section,
evidence that an accused

(a) broke and entered a place is prima facie evidence
that he broke and entered with intent to commit an indictable offence therein;

The change effected by subs. 92(2) of the Amendment Act
in fifteen sections of the Code, including s. 306 (then known as s. 292),
consisted in substituting for the words ""is prima facie evi­dence"",
the words ""is, in the absence of any evi­dence to the contrary,
proof"". Subsection 92(1) amended five other sections by substituting the
single word ""evidence"" for the words ""prima facie evidence"".
The five sections so amended all provide that some document is evidence. I find
it clear that the words prima facie were thus deleted because they had
just been made unnecessary by subs. 24(1) of the Interpretation Act  of 1967
(16 Eliz. II, c. 7, now R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23):

24. (1) Where an enactment provides that a docu­ment is
evidence of a fact without anything in the context to indicate that the
document is conclusive evidence, then, in any judicial proceedings, the docu­ment
is admissible in evidence and the fact shall be deemed to be established in the
absence of any evidence to the contrary.

It will be noted that, in this provision, the concluding words
are exactly the same as those which subs. 92(2) substituted for prima
facie in the Criminal Code  sections dealing with presump­tions
arising from facts rather than with docu­ments. The only difference in the
substituted word­ing is that because a noun rather than a verb was needed, the
word ""proof"" was used instead of ""established"" in the Interpretation
Act . This is clearly a purely verbal difference of no interpreta­tive
significance. The change in wording effected by subs. 92(2) is therefore
merely the substitution of an equivalent expression in the English and in the
French languages for the Latin words prima facie. This equivalent
expression is precisely that which was adopted in s. 24  of the Interpretation
Act  to describe the evidentiary value of those

[Page 548]

documents which are generally known as constitut­ing prima facie
evidence.

In the Dictionary of English Law by Earl Jowitt one reads:

Prima facie evidence, that which, not being inconsist­ent
with the falsity of the hypothesis, nevertheless raises such a degree of
probability in its favour that it must prevail if believed by the jury unless
rebutted or the contrary proved; conclusive evidence, on the other hand, is
that which excludes or at least tends to exclude, the possibility of the truth
of any other hypothesis than the one attempted to be established.

In Tremblay v. The Queen[43], this
Court dealing with the presumption of fact arising out of the possession of
recently stolen goods, adopted as a correct statement of its burden on the
accused the following statement from Phipson on Evidence (10th ed. p.
53);

On charges of stealing or receiving, proof of recent
possession of the stolen property by the accused, if unexplained or not
reasonably explained, or if, though reasonably explained, the explanation is
disbelieved, raises a presumption of fact, though not of law, that he is the
thief or receiver according to the circumstances; and upon such unexplained, or
not reasonably explained, possession, or disbelieved explanation, the jury may
(though not must) find him guilty. It is not, however, for the accused to prove
honest dealing with the property, but for the prosecution to prove the reverse;
and if any explanation be given which the jury think may be true, though they
are not convinced that it is, they must acquit, for the main burden of proof
(i.e. that of estab­lishing guilt beyond reasonable doubt) rests throughout
upon the prosecution, and in this case will not have been discharged.

In my view there should be no difference be­tween the effect of a
presumption of fact and of a presumption of law which is not expressed in such
terms as to require the accused to ""establish"" or to
""prove"" a given fact or excuse as in subs. 237(1)(a) or subs. 247(3).
When a presumption of law is expressed in such terms, it is settled that the
burden on the accused is to prove the fact or excuse on the preponderance of
evidence or on a balance of probabilities.

Such is not the situation when all the presump­tion does is to
establish a prima facie case. The

[Page 549]

burden of proof does not shift. The accused does not have to
""establish"" a defence or an excuse, all he has to do is to raise a
reasonable doubt. If there is nothing in the evidence adduced by the Crown from
which a reasonable doubt can arise, then the accused will necessarily have the
burden of adduc­ing evidence if he is to escape conviction. However, he will
not have the burden of proving his inno­cence, it will be sufficient if, at the
conclusion of the case on both sides, the trier of fact has a reasonable doubt.
In reasons endorsed by a majori­ty of the Court in The Queen v. Newton[44],
at p. 411, the following passage from the judgment of the English Court of
Criminal Appeal in R. v. Spurge[45], at
p. 212, a dangerous driving case, was quoted with approval:

It has been argued by counsel for the Crown that even if a
mechanical defect can operate as defence, yet the onus of establishing this
defence is upon the accused. It is of course conceded by the Crown that this
onus is discharged if the defence is made out on a balance of probabilities. In
the opinion of this court, the contention made on behalf of the Crown is
unsound, for in cases of dangerous driving the onus never shifts to the
defence. This does not mean that if the Crown proves that a motorcar driven by
the accused has endangered the public, the accused could successfully submit at
the end of the case for the prosecution that he had no case to answer on the
ground that the Crown had not negatived the defence of mechanical defect. The
court will consid­er no such special defence unless and until it is put forward
by the accused. Once, however, it has been put forward it must be considered
with the rest of the evidence in the case. If the accused's explanation leaves
a real doubt in the mind of the jury, then the accused is entitled to be
acquitted. If the jury rejects the accused's explanation, the jury should
convict.

I can see no reason for applying a different test when the
presumption against the accused is enacted by Parliament instead of being some
pre­sumption of fact applicable in situations which are all pretty well defined
by a long series of cases, such as the presumptions arising out of possession
of recently stolen goods or dangerous driving. Otherwise, it would mean that
Parliament cannot make such presumptions statutory without altering them.

[Page 550]

In my view, there are in our criminal law only three standards of
evidence:

1. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt which is the stand­ard to
be met by the Crown against the accused;

2. Proof on a preponderance of the evidence or a balance of
probabilities which is the burden of proof on the accused when he has to meet a
presumption requiring him to establish or to prove a fact or an excuse;

3. Evidence raising a reasonable doubt which is what is required
to overcome any other presumption of fact or of law.

Although I strongly believe in adhering to literal construction
and in giving effect to every word of an enactment, I cannot find any
substantial differ­ence between ""evidence to the contrary"" and
""any evidence to the contrary"". Both expressions are equally the converse
of ""no evidence to the con­trary"" and there is no basis for a
distinction depending on the presence or absence of the word ""any"".
It is important to avoid unnecessary com­plexities and subtleties in the law of
evidence by undue emphasis on minor differences in the word­ing of enactments.
It would be especially unfortu­nate if this was the result of amendments
intended to replace two technical Latin words by plain English or French words.

In Batary v. Attorney General of Saskatchewan[46],
at p. 476, Cartwright J., as he then was, said speaking for the Court:

If I am right in the view, which I have already expressed,
that in 1870 the accused would not have been a compellable witness at such an
inquest, it would, in my opinion, require clear words to bring about so
complete a change in the law.

The standard of evidence required for a convic­tion, including
the standard of the evidence required to overcome a prima facie case
against the accused, is just as basic a principle as the right of the accused
to remain silent. In fact, it may be considered as a qualification of this
principle. The accused may remain silent but, when there is a prima facie case
against him and he is, as in the instant case, the only person who can give
""evi­dence to the contrary"" his choice really is to face certain
conviction or to offer in testimony whatever

[Page 551]

explanation or excuse may be available to him.

If the prima facie case is made up by the proof of facts
from which guilt may be inferred by presumption of fact, the law is clear on
the authorities that, because the case in the end must be proved beyond a
reasonable doubt, it is not necessary for the accused to establish his inno­cence,
but only to raise a reasonable doubt. This he may do by giving evidence of an
explanation that may reasonably be true, and it will be suffi­cient unless he
is disbelieved by the trier of fact, in which case his testimony is no
evidence. In any case, the evidence given by himself or otherwise, has to be
such as will at least raise a reasonable doubt as to his guilt; if it does not
meet this test the prima facie case remains and conviction will ensue.

I can find no indication that subs. 92(2) of the Criminal Law
Amendment Act, 1968-69 was meant to do more than replace those two Latin
words by equivalent English and French phrases. As there is no such thing as a
perfect translation, various interpretations of the new wording are possible,
but this is far from a clear indication of the intent of effecting a radical
change. On the contrary, the new words used are, it appears to me, quite
consistent with the preservation of the anteri­or meaning, bearing in mind that
the basic princi­ple is guilt ""beyond a reasonable doubt"", so that
unless Parliament has enacted a presumption in terms which require an accused
to ""prove"" an excuse he has to do no more than raise a
""reasonable doubt"" to escape conviction.

I would dispose of the appeal as proposed by Estey J.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Breathalyser test—Approved
instrument—Instrument’s margin of error—Evidence to the contrary—Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 236, 237.

Appeal—Summary conviction offence—Question
of law—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 771(1)(a)—Supreme Court
Act, R.S.C 1970, c. S-19 (as amended by 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 18, s. 5),
s. 41(3).

Respondent was found guilty, on summary
conviction, of driving a motor vehicle having consumed a quantity of alcohol
exceeding 80 milligrams in 100 millilitres of blood. The certificate of a
qualified technician, who had used a Borkenstein Breathalyser, an approved
instrument under s. 237(6)  Cr.C ., showed that respondent had 90
milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, and the latter was found
guilty by a municipal judge. On appeal to the Superior Court by way of trial de
novo an expert witness testified that Borkenstein Breathalysers were
subject to a possible margin of error of 10 milligrams, more or less, and the
judge was of the view that this uncontradicted testimony was “evidence to the
contrary” within the meaning of s. 237(1) (c) Cr.C. and
sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt justifying acquittal. The majority of
the Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court on the sole
ground that no question of law was involved and that consequently the Crown had
no right of appeal. This Court, having granted the Crown leave to appeal that
decision under s. 41(3) of the Supreme Court Act, must decide
whether the evidence of the expert witness is evidence to the contrary within
the meaning of the Code and whether a question of law is raised.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Estey JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be
allowed.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and Pratte JJ.: In order to comply with the wording of
s. 237(1)(c)

[Page 262]

Cr.C ., evidence
to the contrary has to be evidence which tends to establish that the proportion
of alcohol in the blood of the accused at the time when the offence was alleged
to have been committed was not the same as that indicated by the result of the
chemical analysis. The evidence adduced through the expert witness’s testimony
in the case at bar is not aimed at rebutting the presumption provided for in
the Code but at denying its very existence. Such evidence is not evidence to
the contrary when its only effect is to demonstrate in general terms the
possible uncertainty of the scheme or the inherent fallibility of instruments
which are approved under statutory authority. Instruments approved under
statutory authority cannot be assimilated to ordinary instruments. Parliament
must be taken to have made allowance for these limitations inherent in all
instruments when it provided for the analysis of breath samples by way of
approved instruments and to have wanted its precise prohibition to be exactly
enforceable.

Secondly, since the main issue hinges upon
the interpretation of a provision of the Criminal Code : what is capable
of being evidence to the contrary, it raises a question of law.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Estey JJ., dissenting: None of the Crown’s
submissions raises a question of law once it is accepted that the expert
evidence of the defence was admissible and relevant. The weight of evidence and
its sufficiency to raise a doubt are common instances of matters which do not
give rise to any question of law. On the other hand, the accused is not to be
condemned by an unchallengeable certificate based on the use of a fallible machine.
It must not be assumed in the absence of Crown evidence to this effect that the
qualified technician had taken into account the possible margin of error of the
instrument. It would require much more express words than are found in
s. 237(1)(c) Cr.C. to conclude that the accused cannot
challenge the results of the chemical analysis by challenging the accuracy of
the approved instrument which produced them.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal
of Quebec[1] affirming a
judgment of the Superior Court, Criminal side, allowing an appeal

[Page 263]

from a conviction by a municipal judge.
Appeal allowed, Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Estey JJ. dissenting.

Rémi Bouchard, for the appellant.

Gilles Garneau and Wildy Fontain, for the
respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson
and Estey JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—This is a
Crown appeal, by leave, from a judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal (Tremblay
C.J.Q. and Kaufman J.A., Bernier J.A. dissenting) which affirmed a judgment of
Fournier J. of the Quebec Superior Court setting aside, on a trial de novo, the
conviction of the respondent on a charge under s. 236(1) of the Criminel
Code. The respondent was charged, in terms of the section, with being in
control of a motor vehicle, having consumed alcohol of such a quantity that the
proportion thereof in his blood exceed 80 milligrams in 100 millilitres of
blood.

The Crown could not appeal as of right on the
basis of any dissent on a question of law by Bernier J.A., as is provided by
s. 621(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , because this provision
applies only to proceedings by indictment, and here the accused was charged
with a summary conviction offence. Moreover, the Crown’s appeal by leave under
s. 621 (1) (b) is also restricted to questions of law
and also relates back to proceedings by indictment, as is clear from
s. 605(1) (a) giving the Crown the right to appeal on
questions of law alone to the provincial Court of Appeal from a verdict of
acquittal. The present case, therefore, could only come here through an
invocation of s. 41(3) of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
S-19, as amended by 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 18, s. 5, to hear the appeal on
a question of law from a judgment of the provincial Court of Appeal acting
under s. 771(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .

[Page 264]

Counsel for the Crown urged three errors of law
by the majority of the Court of Appeal. Kaufman J.A., speaking for the
majority, did not think that any question of law was presented, as
s. 771(1) (a) required, and would have dismissed the appeal on that
ground alone. However, he went on to dismiss the appeal on the merits as well,
assuming that it presented a question of law.

The issues raised by the Crown arise on the
following facts. The Crown sought to prove the charge against the accused by
the certificate of a qualified technician who, using a Borkenstein breath
analyzer, indentified as No. 4799, and being an “approved instrument” under
s. 237(6) , found that the accused had 90 milligrams of alcohol in 100
millilitres of blood.

Section 237(1) (c) of the Criminal
Code  provides that evidence of the results of the analysis is, “in the
absence of any evidence to the contrary” proof of the proportion of alcohol in
the blood at the material time. It is not disputed in this case that the certificate
of analysis was admissible in conformity with s. 237(1) (f). The
accused, on his trial de novo before Fournier J., had adduced evidence
of an expert witness, whose qualification to testify as to the Borkenstein type
breath analyzer was not questioned, and who testified that there was a marging
of error of 10 milligrams, more or less, in the use of the type of approved
instrument in the present case. Fournier J., disagreeing on this point with the
judge at first instance, held that this being admissible evidence, and being
sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt, was “evidence to the contrary” under
s. 237(1) (c), and left the Crown in a position where the charge
against the accused was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In short, he held
that the accused did not have any larger burden than that of raising a
reasonable doubt by evidence tendered on his behalf.

In this Court, the admissibility of the expert’s
evidence as to the margin of error of the particular type of approved
instrument was not contested, but it was contended by the Crown that (1) the
Court of Appeal erred in law in deciding that the issue of

[Page 265]

the weight given by the judge on the trial de
novo to the defence evidence raised a question of fact; (2) the Court of
Appeal erred in law in deciding that the general evidence offered as to the
accuracy of the approved instrument was evidence to the contrary within
s. 237(1) (c); and (3) the Court of Appeal erred in law in deciding
that the aforesaid expert evidence was alone sufficient to give the accused the
benefit of a reasonable doubt. Put in the stark way in which I have enumerated
the Crown’s submissions as made in its factum and in argument, none raises a
question of law once it is accepted, as it has been, that the expert evidence
of the defence was admissible and hence relevant, relevant that is to the only
issue that was in contention, namely, whether there was proof beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused had exceeded the permitted limit of the
proportion of alcohol in the blood Certainly, there is no error of law in point
1 nor in point 3 of the Crown’s submissions. The weight of evidence and its
sufficiency to raise a doubt are common instances of matters which do not give
rise to any question law: see Sunbeam Corporation (Canada) Ltd. v. The Queen[2].

Point 2 seems to me to raise only a question of
the relevance of the expert evidence, and of this I have no doubt. The approval
of an instrument for breath analysis under s. 237(6)  is approval not of a
particular instrument but of a particular type. The Crown is given the
advantage under s. 237 of using a special form of proof of a fact
essential to conviction, and this proof involves use of a breath analysis
instrument of a type approved by the Attorney‑General of Canada. It must
surely be open to an accused to adduce evidence which, if accepted as was the
evidence tendered here, would go to show such a margin of error as to cast
doubt on the reading made by the qualified technician.

It follows that if there is here a question of
law it must rest on the contention that “evidence to the contrary” must mean
evidence that goes beyond the raising of a doubt and is sufficient to overcome
the certificate of analysis on a balance of

[Page 266]

probabilities. Yet this position was not taken
either by counsel for the Crown or by the dissenting judge, and I think they
were right in not taking it. It is enough to contrast the present provisions of
s. 237(1) (c), which speaks of “the absence of any evidence to the
contrary”, with s. 237(1) (a), which contains a deeming provision,
followed by the words “unless he establishes”, to illustrate in the latter case
a different and more onerous evidentiary burden on the accused: See R. v.
Appleby[3]. What
was said by Ritchie J. for this Court in R. v. Noble[4], at p. 638, with reference to
the “burden” on the accused under s. 237(1) (c), should not
be taken as obliging an accused to do more than raise a reasonable doubt. This
Court was concerned in that case with the question whether more than one breath
sample must be taken to enable the Crown to rely on a qualified technician’s
certificate, and Ritchie J. emphasized the necessity of strict construction of
statutory provisions which “restrict the normal rights of the accused”.

What Bernier J.A. fastens on (and so too Crown
counsel in supporting his view) is that the expert evidence offered by the
accused cannot be “evidence to the contrary”, for the purpose of raising a
doubt, because it is the results of the chemical analyses that are given
probative force “in the absence of any evidence to the contrary”, and the
justness or correctness of the results cannot be impeached by expert evidence
showing the margin of error that may exist in the use of the particular type of
approved instrument. In short, Bernier J.A. would have it that this margin of
error is subsumed in the qualified technician’s understanding and
qualifications in the use of the approved instrument. I am not prepared to
assume this in the absence of Crown evidence that this was taken into account in
arriving at the 90 milligram proportion.

The accused is not to be condemned by an
unchallengeable certificate based on the use of a

[Page 267]

fallible machine. I would require much more
express words than are found in s. 237(1) (c) to give so strong an
effect to a chemical analysis made through use of an approved instrument. The
accused is entitled, as I read the provisions of s. 237(1) (c), to
challenge the results by challenging the accuracy of the instrument which
produced them. The learned dissenting judge, in truth, takes his position on
the want of any relevance of the expert evidence of the defence to the issue
raised by the proof offered by the Crown. I read his reasons to say that the
advantage of proof available to the Crown under s. 237(1) (c) (in being
able to rely on a subsequent test to prove blood alcohol content at the prior
time of the alleged offence) can only be countered by evidence directed to the
temporal presumption. In my opinion, this is too narrow a view, and the
approach taken by Kaufman J.A. is the proper one in his adoption of what was
said on the matter by McFarlane J.A. in R. v. Davis[5], a decision of the British Columbia
Court of Appeal, and by McDermid J.A. in R. v. Ryckman[6], at p. 296, a decision of the
Alberta Appellate Division.

I would dismiss the appeal. In accordance with
the term imposed by this Court as a condition of granting leave, the Crown will
pay the costs of the respondent on a solicitor-client basis.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz
and Pratte JJ. was delivered by

BEETZ J.—Respondent was charged with an offence
punishable on summary conviction under s. 236  of the Criminal Code  in
that he drove a motor vehicle having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the
proportion thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams in 100 millilitres of
blood. He was tried by judge Cossette, a municipal judge. Apart from admissions
made by the defence with respect to the time and place respondent had driven
the

[Page 268]

motor vehicle, the only evidence consisted in
the certificates of an analyst and of a qualified technician pursuant to
s. 237(1) . The technician, using a Borkenstein Breathalyser of certain
model, an “approved instrument” under s. 237(6) , found that respondent had
90 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. Neither the analyst nor
the technician were required to be in attendance for the purpose of
cross-examination, under s. 237(4). The defence tendered no evidence.
Judge Cossette found respondent guilty and condemned him to pay a fine of $50
with costs or to fifteen days in gaol in default of payment.

Respondent appealed to the Superior Court by way
of trial de novo. The trial was held on the record of the evidence which
had been heard by judge Cossette. In addition however, an expert witness whom
the Superior Court found highly competent and objective was called by the
accused and, without being contradicted, testified in short as follows:

1) Borkenstein Breathalysers of the type or
model used in this case (Model 900 or 900A) were all subject to a possible
margin of error of 10 milligrams, more or less;

2) This possible margin of error was inherent in
these instruments, due to their design;

3) While this possible margin of error was
common knowledge, qualified technicians were not instructed to make allowance
for it; they were trained to consider their instrument as accurate for the
purpose of s. 237 provided that, in the chemical control test which they
were required to carry out in each case with a known quantity of alcohol, the
margin did not exceed 10 milligrams, more or less;

4) The particular Borkenstein Breathalyser used
in this case, serial number 4799, had not been examined or otherwise tested by
the expert witness who could not recall whether he had ever seen it.

It was further admitted in the course of the
trial de novo that the qualified technician had stated

[Page 269]

the exact reading of the breath analyser,
without taking into account the possible margin of error.

Fournier J. held that the testimony of the
expert witness was “evidence to the contrary” within the meaning of
s. 237(1) (c) and sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt. He
accordingly set aside the conviction and found respondent not guilty.

The Crown appealed to the Quebec Court of Appeal
with leave of that Court. Under s. 771(1)A), it could only do so on
grounds involving questions of law.

The Court of Appeal, (Tremblay C.J.Q. and
Kaufman J.A., Bernier J.A. dissenting) affirmed the judgment of Fournier J.
Tremblay C.J.Q. and Kaufman J.A. took the view that no question of law was
involved and would have dismissed the appeal on that sole ground. Kaufman J.A.
would also have dismissed the appeal on the merits, assuming that it involved a
question of law. His main reason was that an accused ought not to be
“restricted in his defence to evidence which would tend to show that he was not
impaired by non-consumption (or consumption of a small amount) of alcohol”.

The Crown now appeals by leave of this Court its
appeal being limited to a question of law or jurisdiction: s. 41(3) of the
Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. S-19, as amended by 1974‑75-76
(Can.),c. 18, s. 5.

At the relevant time, s. 237  of the Criminal
Code  read in part as follows:

237. (1) In
any proceedings under section 234  or 236 ,

…

(c) where a sample of the breath of
the accused has been taken pursuant to a demand made under
subsection 235(1) if

(i) (not proclaimed in force)

(ii) the sample was taken as soon as
practicable after the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed
and in any event not later than two hours after that time,

[Page 270]

(iii) the sample was received from the
accused directly into an approved container or into an approved instrument
operated by a qualified technician, and

(iv) a chemical analysis of the sample was
made by means of an approved instrument operated by a qualified technician,
evidence of the result of the chemical analysis so made is, in the absence of
any evidence to the contrary, proof of the proportion of alcohol in the blood
of the accused at the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed;

(6) In this section

“analyst” means a person designated by the
Attorney General as an analyst for the purposes of this section;

“approved container” means a container of a
kind designed to receive a sample of the breath of a person for chemical
analysis and that is approved as suitable for the purposes of this
section by order of the Attorney General of Canada;

“approved instrument” means an instrument
of a kind that is designed to receive and make a chemical analysis of a sample
of the breath of a person in order to measure the proportion of alcohol in the
blood of that person and that is approved as suitable for the purposes of this
section by order of the Attorney General of Canada;

“qualified technician” means a person designated
by the Attorney General as being qualified to operate an approved instrument.

The main issue is whether the evidence of the
expert witness is “evidence to the contrary” within the meaning of
s. 237(1) (c). There is another issue namely whether the main issue
raises a question of law. I propose to deal first with the main issue.

In the course of argument, counsel for the Crown
said that the evidence of the expert witness was admissible. However, I did not
understand this concession to have been unqualified: according to counsel, the
evidence of the expert witness was admissible as a general introduction which
should have been completed by specific evidence related to the particular facts
of this case, but it had not been so completed and had remained purely
theoretical or general in nature; Fournier J. had erred in law in taking it
into consideration.

[Page 271]

What is “evidence to the contrary” within the
meaning of this section has been the subject of some discussion in various
courts. I agree with what was said on the subject by McFarlane J.A. speaking
for the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Davis[7] at p. 516:

While not expressed too clearly, I think
the intention of Parliament becomes manifest when it is remembered that the
fact to be proved is the proportion of alcohol to blood at the time of the
offence. The result of the chemical analysis is one method of proving that
fact: and the certificates are evidence, inter alia, of that result. It
follows, in my opinion, that the concluding part of the subsection means
that the result of the chemical analysis is proof of the proportion of alcohol
to blood at the time of the offence in the absence of evidence that the
proportion at that time did not exceed 80 to 100. Any evidence, therefore,
tending to show that at the time of the offence the proportion was within
the permitted limits is “evidence to the contrary” within the meaning of
the subsection. (Underlining is mine)

In order to comply with the wording of the Code,
“evidence to the contrary” has to be evidence which tends to establish that the
proportion of alcohol in the blood of the accused at the time when the offence
was alleged to have been committed was not the same as that indicated by the
result of the chemical analysis. There is no such evidence in the case at bar.
Apart from the certificates, there is no evidence of any kind directed at
showing what was the proportion of alcohol in the blood of the accused at the
time when the offence was alleged to have been committed. What evidence there
is, tendered on behalf of the accused, is expert evidence from which Courts are
asked to conclude, contrary to what the Code explicitly prescribes, that the
result of the chemical analysis is not or ought not to be proof of the
proportion of alcohol in the blood of the accused at the time when the offence
was alleged to have been committed. This, in my opinion, is not evidence aimed
at rebutting the presumption provided for in the section but at denying
its very existence. “Evidence to the contrary” cannot be evidence solely
directed at defeating the scheme established by Parliament under ss. 236  and
237 .

[Page 272]

This elaborate legislative scheme contemplates
and provides for elements of positive certainty such as the official approval
of certain kinds of instruments, the designation of analysts and qualified
technicians, a maximum time period between the commission of the alleged
offence and the taking of a breath sample, and the reading by a qualified
technician on an approved instrument of a proportion of alcohol in the blood in
excess of a specified proportion. Once the conditions prescribed or
contemplated by this scheme are fulfilled, a presumption arises against the
alleged offender which he can rebut by tendering “evidence to the contrary”. But
in my opinion, no evidence is “evidence to the contrary” when its only effect
is to demonstrate in general terms the possible uncertainty of the elements of
the scheme or the inherent fallibility of instruments which are approved under
statutory authority. Thus, the proof by expert evidence that, for physiological
reasons of a general nature, the maximum time period of two hours between the
commission of an offence and the taking of a breath sample is too long would
not be “evidence to the contrary”. (See also R. v. Gaetz[8]).

In the case at bar, the evidence of the expert
witness was to the effect that Borkenstein Breathalysers of the kind used to
analyse respondent’s breath sample were all inherently subject to a possible
margin of error of 10 milligrams, more or less: the trial judge was asked to
infer that unless this approved type of instrument indicated a reading in
excess of 90 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, an accused
ought to be given the benefit of the doubt. Such an inference might perhaps be
drawn in other kinds of cases with respect to instruments other than
instruments which are approved under statutory authority. For instance, expert
evidence could probably be tendered to show that radars of a certain type used
by the police to measure the speed of motor vehicles are subject to an inherent
margin of error which would make their reading unreliable as evidence against
an accused unless the margin of error was taken into account. But radars are
not approved instruments under a statutory scheme. To admit

[Page 273]

the evidence of the expert witness in this case
is to concede that evidence gathered through the use of certain types of
approved instruments may be treated in the same manner as that obtained by
ordinary instruments. The same would be true, up to a point, of approved
instruments of any type since all instruments used for measurement or analysis
are necessarily subject to built-in limitations which affect their precision. I
think the assimilation of instruments approved under statutory authority to
ordinary instruments amounts to an error in law. It seems to me that when
Parliament provided for the analysis of breath samples by way of approved
instruments, it was aware of the limitations inherent in all instruments. Parliament
must be taken to have made allowance for these limitations in the provisions
relating to the approval of certain kinds of instruments as well as in those
setting the highest permissible level of alcohol in the blood at 80 milligrams
in 100 millilitres of blood.

If the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal
were right, no one could in effect be charged under s. 236  unless the
reading indicated a quantity of alcohol in excess of 90 milligrams in 100
millilitres of blood whenever the qualified technician used an approved
Borkenstein Breathalyser Model 900 or 900A. Similar practical results would
inevitably occur if other approved models of breath analysers were used, with
slight variations upwards or downwards; but whatever approved instrument be
used, the prohibition enacted in s. 236  would never be fully enforceable
in any given case by the means expressly provided for in the Code nor, for that
matter, by any other means. Yet, one of the reasons if not the only reason why
Parliament prescribed the use of approved instruments must have been that it
wanted its precise prohibition to be exactly enforceable. This intent would be
frustrated if approved instruments were treated as ordinary instruments.

The approval of instruments under s. 237(6) 
is approval of types of instruments, not of particular instruments. A
particular instrument may conceivably be subject to certain faults other than
those which are inherent in the type. The question

[Page 274]

whether such a particular instrument continues
to be within an approved class of instruments and whether the proof of such
faults is admissible does not arise in this case and does not call for comment.

I now briefly turn to the other issue, that is
whether the main issue raises a question of law. I think it does. It hinges
upon the interpretation of a provision of the Criminal Code : what is
capable of being “evidence to the contrary” within the meaning of
s. 237(1) (c)? The Courts of Appeal of Nova Scotia, British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan
have indicated that they consider the issue as a question of law: Shafer v. Regina[9]; R. v. Gaetz, (supra); R. v. Westman[10]; R. v. Davis (supra); R. v. Falkenham[11]. I agree with their approach on this point.

For the reasons stated above, I believe the
evidence tendered on behalf of respondent was not “evidence to the contrary”
within the meaning of s. 237(1) (c) of the Criminal Code . It
was the only evidence tendered on behalf of respondent and the sole possible
basis for his acquittal. His conviction must accordingly be restored.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal and of the Superior Court and restore respondent’s
conviction. Further to the terms imposed by this Court as a condition of
granting leave, the Crown will pay respondent’s costs in this Court on a
solicitor-client basis. Respondent should pay the costs in the Municipal Court
and the Superior Court. The Court of Appeal made no order as to costs; I would
not make any either as to costs in that Court.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Obstructing peace
officer—Cyclist seen committing traffic infraction—Police officer asking
cyclist for identification with intention of giving traffic ticket—Cyclist
refusing to give name—Motor-vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 253, ss. 2, 58, 63,
127, 128, amended 1975 (B.C.), c. 46, ss. 121, 173(1)—Police Act, 1974 (B.C.),
c. 64, ss. 17(1), 22, 30—Summary Convictions Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 373,
s. 101—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 450(2).

The accused went through an intersection, in
the City of Victoria, against a
red light on his bicycle. A peace officer employed with the Victoria City
Police, who was on duty and observed the infraction, stopped the accused and,
with the intention of giving him a traffic ticket, asked for identification.
The accused refused to give his name and address. As a result, he was charged
with unlawfully and wilfully obstructing a peace officer in the execution of
his duty, contrary to s. 118  of the Criminal Code . At trial, the
trial judge directed the jury that there was no evidence of obstruction of the
police officer and the jury, accordingly, returned a verdict of acquittal. On
appeal by the Crown, this verdict was reversed and a new trial directed. From
that decision the accused appealed to this Court.

Held (Dickson
and Estey JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per curiam: The
appellant was not in breach of s. 58 of the British
 Columbia Motor‑vehicle Act when he
refused to give his name and address to the constable. The argument that
although a bicycle is neither a “motor-vehicle” nor a “vehicle” under the
definitions in s. 2, nevertheless s. 58 of the Act applied thereto
because of other sections was rejected.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Spence, Pigeon and Beetz JJ.: A bicylce is a “cycle” within the
definition in s. 121 of the Motor-vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c.
253, as amended by 1975 (B.C.), c. 46, and, therefore, by the provisions of
s. 173(1) the appellant was under the same

[Page 196]

duties as the driver of a vehicle. The driver
of a vehicle, in reference to traffic signals, is governed by the provisions of
ss. 127 and 128 of the Motor-vehicle Act. Therefore, under the
provisions of ss. 127 and 128, the appellant was prohibited from proceeding
against the red light.

It being the duty of a municipality, under
s. 17(1) of the Police Act, 1974 (B.C.), c. 64, to provide policing
“for the purpose of adequately enforcing municipal by-laws, the criminal law,
and the laws of the Province, and of generally maintaining law and order,
within the municipality”, the constable was carrying out those duties on this
occasion, as directed by s. 30 of the said statute.

The actions of the appellant were not within
any of the four classes of actions set out in s. 63 of the Motor-vehicle
Act so that section gave no power to the constable to arrest the
appellant without a warrant. The provisions of the Criminal Code  as to
summary convictions are applicable in British Columbia by virtue of s. 101 of the Summary Convictions Act, R.S.B.C.
1960, c. 373. The said provisions of the Criminal Code  as to summary
convictions of relevance here are those contained in s. 450(2)  of the Criminal
Code .

In accordance with those provisions, the
constable could only have arrested the appellant for the summary conviction
offence of proceeding against a red light if it were necessary to establish his
identity. The constable, therefore, in requesting the appellant to identify
himself, was carrying out the duty of enforcing the law of the Province in this
summary conviction matter by attempting to identify the accused person so that
he might proceed to lay an information or take the more modern form permitted
under the said Summary Convictions Act of issuing a ticket.

Accordingly, the officer was under a duty to
attempt to identify this wrong-doer and the failure to identify himself by the
wrong-doer did constitute an obstruction of the police officer in the
performance of his duty.

Neither the provisions of the Bill of
Rights nor the topic of individual freedom generally were applicable in
this case. There is not even minimal interference with any freedom of a citizen
who is seen committing an infraction by a police constable in the police
constable simply requesting his name and address without any attempt to obtain
from that person any admission of fault or any comment whatsoever.

Rice v. Connolly, [1966] 2 All E.R. 649, distinguished.

Per Dickson
and Estey JJ., dissenting: Any duty to identify oneself must be found in
either common law or

[Page 197]

statute, quite apart from the duties of the
police. A person is not guilty of the offence of obstructing a police officer
merely by doing nothing, unless there is a legal duty to act. Omission to act
in a particular way will give rise to criminal liability only where a duty to
act arises at common law or is imposed by statute.

There was no statutory duty on a cyclist
caught committing a traffic infraction to divulge his name and address. While,
as held by the majority, the constable, under the relevant statutory
provisions, could have arrested the accused for the offence of proceeding
against a red light if it were necessary to establish his identity, it was not
accepted that as a consequence the accused was guilty of the further, and much
more serious, offence of obstructing the constable in the performance of his
duties by refusing to divulge his name and address.

There is no duty at common law to identify
oneself to police, and the refusal to so identify oneself cannot constitute
obstruction of the police. A person cannot “obstruct” by refusing to answer a
question unless he is under a legal duty to answer. The argument that because a
duty rested upon constables to investigate crime and enforce provincial laws,
an “implied” or “reciprocal” duty rested upon a person, suspected of an
infraction, to give his name and address, and refusal to do so amounted to such
frustration as to constitute the offence of obstructing the police in the
execution of their duty was rejected. Only if the police have a lawful claim to
demand that a person identify himself, does the person have a corresponding
duty to do so.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia[1], allowing an appeal
by the Crown from the accused’s acquittal on a charge of obstructing police
contrary to s. 118  of the Criminal Code . Appeal dismissed, Dickson
and Estey JJ. dissenting.

[Page 198]

B.A. Crane, Q.C., for the appellant.

R.M. Lang, for the respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Spence, Pigeon
and Beetz JJ. was delivered by

SPENCE J.—This is an appeal from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia pronounced on June 7, 1977.

The appellant had been acquitted after his trial
before His Honour Judge Millward and a jury upon an indictment charging him:

THAT at the City of Victoria, County of
Victoria, Province of British Coumbia, on the 19th day of April, 1976, he did
unlawfully and wilfully obstruct a Peace Officer, to wit, Constable Sutherland,
in the execution of his duty as such Peace Officer, contrary to the Criminal
Code  of Canada.

The appellant was acquitted by a verdict
directed by the learned trial judge at the close of the Crown’s case. The facts
are outlined in an admission by counsel for Moore which I quote:

If it please, your Honour, I have certain
admission of facts to make to expedite matters. Firstly, I am instructed to
admit that on or about the 19th of April 1976, at or about 9:10 a.m., the Accused, Richard Harvey Moore, was
southbound on Government Street
at Pandora and at that intersection proceeded through a light which had
not yet turned green and was, in fact red when he proceeded through on his
ten-speed bicycle. That is the extent of my admission of fact.

and are further dealt with by Carrothers J.A. in
his reasons for judgment as follows:

Constable Sutherland, a peace officer with
the Victoria City Police, in uniform and on a motorcycle, observed this
infraction on the part of Moore
and set about to “ticket” Moore.
The constable and Moore proceeded side by side on their respective cycles, with
Moore sometime taking elusive
action by riding his bicycle on the sidewalk, with the constable repeatedly
requesting Moore to “pull over and stop” and Moore lewdly rebuffing each such
request with an obscene demand to leave him alone as he was in a hurry. I
attach no importance to the particular salacious vulgarity used by Moore in
rejecting the policeman’s request to stop as it has been used by the
unimaginative so excessively and indiscriminately as to have lost its literal
quality, but

[Page 199]

there is no doubt that it constituted flat
refusals on the part of Moore to stop as requested by the policeman.

As a result of this occurrence, Moore was
charged upon an indictment, as I have said above, but he was not charged with
failing to stop at a stop light only with obstructing a peace officer in the
performance of his duty. The obstruction which the Crown put forward as
constituting the offence was the failure of the appellant to give his name when
requested to do so by the police constable.

The relevant sections of the provincial
statutes with which I shall deal hereafter are as follows: Firstly, the Motor-vehicle
Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 253. Section 2 contains definitions of “motor‑vehicle”
and “vehicle”, as follows:

“motor-vehicle” means a vehicle, not run
upon rails, that is designed to be self-propelled or propelled by electric
power obtained from overhead trolley-wires;

…

“vehicle” means a device in, upon, or by
which a person or thing is or may be transported or drawn upon a highway,
except a device designed to be moved by human power or used exclusively upon
stationary rails or tracks.

Section 58 of the said Motor-vehicle Act provides:

58. Every person driving or operating or in
charge of a motor-vehicle on any highway who refuses or fails

(a) to stop his motor-vehicle
when signalled or requested to stop by any police officer or constable who is
in uniform or who displays his police badge conspicuously on the outside of his
outer coat; or

(b) to state correctly his name
and address and the name and address of the owner of the motor-vehicle when
requested by any peace officer or constable to state the same

is guilty of an offence.

It will be seen plainly that a bicycle is
neither a “motor-vehicle” nor a “vehicle” of any kind under the provisions of
the aforesaid definition. A bicycle is plainly not self-propelled and,
therefore, cannot be a “motor-vehicle” and it is a device designed to be moved
by human power and, therefore, it cannot be a “vehicle” at all. Much argument
was

[Page 200]

spent in the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia and in this Court in an attempt to say that although a bicycle was
neither a “motor-vehicle” nor a “vehicle” s. 58 of the Motor-vehicle
Act applied thereto because of other sections with which I shall deal
hereafter. As the Courts below, I am quite unable to accept any such submission
and I have come to the conclusion, with respect, that the Court of Appeal for
British Columbia was quite correct in holding that the appellant was not in breach
of s. 58 of the Motor-vehicle Act when he refused to give his name
to the constable.

I turn next to the question of whether the
appellant was guilty of an offence when he proceeded into the
intersection of Government Street and Pandora when facing a red traffic
light. Section 121 of the Motor-vehicle Act, as amended by 1975 (B.C.),
c. 46, provides as follows:

“cycle” means a device having any number of
wheels that is propelled by human power and on which a person may ride

and s. 173(1) of the Motor-vehicle Act provides:

In addition to the duties imposed by this
section, a person operating a cycle upon a highway has the same rights and
duties as a driver of a vehicle.

The appellant Moore was riding a bicycle. A
bicycle is a device having any number of wheels, to wit, two, and
self-propelled by human power and a person may ride on it, as Moore was riding.
Therefore, it is a “cycle” within the definition and, therefore, by the
provisions of s. 173(1) Moore was under the same duties as the driver of a
vehicle. The driver of a vehicle, in reference to traffic signals, is governed
by the provisions of ss. 127 and 128 of the Motor‑vehicle Act, which
provide, in part:

127. Except where otherwise directed by a
peace officer, every driver of a vehicle and every pedestrian shall obey the
instructions of an applicable traffic-control device.

128. (6) When a red light alone is
exhibited at an intersection by a traffic-control signal,

(a) the driver of a vehicle
approaching the intersection and facing the red light shall cause the
vehicle to stop before entering the marked crosswalk on the near

[Page 201]

side of the intersection, or if there is no
such marked crosswalk, then before entering the intersection, and, subject to
the provisions of clause (b), shall not cause the vehicle to proceed
until a traffic-control signal instructs him that he is permitted to do so;

Therefore, the appellant Moore was, by the
provisions of the Motor-vehicle Act, prohibited from proceeding against
this red light.

Constable James Lawrence Sutherland was a peace
officer employed with the Victoria City Police. Sections 17(1), 22 and 30 of
the Police Act, 1974 (B.C.), c. 64, provide:

17. (1) Subject to subsection (3), it
is the duty of every municipality having a population of more than five thousand
persons to provide, in accordance with this Act and the regulations, policing
for the purposes of adequately enforcing municipal by-laws, the criminal law,
and the laws of the Province, and of generally maintaining law and order,
within the municipality.

…

22. (1) A board may establish a municipal
police force consisting of a chief constable and such other constables and
employees as the board considers necessary for the purpose of providing
policing within the municipality.

(2) The duties and functions of a municipal
force are, under the direction of the board,

(a) to enforce, within the
municipality, municipal by-laws, the criminal law, and the laws of the
Province; and

(b) to generally maintain law
and order within the municipality.

30. (1) Subject to subsection (2) and
section 24(2), a municipal constable and a special municipal constable
has, subject to the direction of the board, jurisdiction within the
municipality of the board that appointed him to exercise and carry out the
powers, duties, privileges, and responsibilities that a police constable or
peace officer is entitled or required to exercise or carry out at law or
under any Act.

It being the duty of a municipality to provide
policing “for the purpose of adequately enforcing municipal by-laws, the
criminal law, and the laws of the Province, and of generally maintaining law
and order, within the municipality”, the constable

[Page 202]

was carrying out those duties on this occasion,
as directed by s. 30 of the said statute.

Section 63 of the Motor-vehicle Act provides:

63. Every officer or constable of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police, or of the police force of any municipality, may arrest
without warrant

(a) any person driving a
motor-vehicle upon which no number-plate issued by the Superintendent under
this Act is displayed whom the officer or constable finds committing any act in
violation of any of the provisions of this Act or of the regulations;

(b) any person whom the
officer or constable finds committing any act in violation of section 138;

(c) any person whose driver’s
licence is under suspension or has been cancelled, or whose right to obtain a
licence is suspended under the provisions of this Act, and whom the officer or
constable finds driving a motor-vehicle on any highway;

(d) any person driving a
motor-vehicle who is not insured as required by this Act or who does not hold a
valid and subsisting motor-vehicle liability insurance card or financial
responsibility card,

and may detain the person arrested until he
can be brought before a Justice to be dealt with according to law.

The actions of Moore were not within any of
those four classes of actions so that s. 63 of the Motor-vehicle Act gave
no power to Constable Sutherland to arrest Moore without a warrant. The
provisions of the Criminal Code  as to summary convictions are applicable
in the Province of British Columbia by virtue of s. 101 of the Summary
Convictions Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 373, which provides:

101. Where, in any proceeding, matter, or
thing to which this Act applies, express provisions has not been made in this
Act or only partial provision has been made, the provisions of the Criminal
Code  relating to offences punishable upon summary conviction apply, mutatis
mutandis, as if the provisions thereof were enacted in and formed part of this
Act.

The said provisions of the Criminal Code  as
to summary convictions of relevance here are those contained in s. 450(2) 
of the Criminal Code  which provides:

[Page 203]

450. (2) A peace officer shall not arrest a
person without warrant for

(a) an indictable offence
mentioned in section 483,

(b) an offence for which the
person may be prosecuted by indictment or for which he is punishable on summary
conviction, or

(c) an offence punishable on
summary conviction,

in any case where

(d) he has reasonable and
probable grounds to believe that the public interest, having regard to all the
circumstances including the need to

(i) establish the identity of the person,
(ii) secure or preserve evidence of or relating to the offence, or

(iii) prevent the continuation or
repetition of the offence or the commission of another offence, may be
satisfied without so arresting the person, and

(e) he has no reasonable
grounds to believe that, if he does not so arrest the person, the person will
fail to attend in court in order to be dealt with according to law.

In accordance with those provisions, Constable
Sutherland could only have arrested Moore for the summary conviction offence of
proceeding against a red light if it were necessary to establish his identity.
The constable, therefore, in requesting the appellant Moore to identify
himself, was carrying out the duty of enforcing the law of the Province in this
summary conviction matter by attempting to identify the accused person so that
he might proceed to lay an information or take the more modern form permitted
under the said Summary Convictions Act of British Columbia of issuing a
ticket.

I am of the opinion that the Court of Appeal of
British Columbia was correct in finding that when the appellant Moore refused
to accede to the constable’s request for his identification he was obstructing
that constable in the performance of his duties. As did the members of the
Court of Appeal, I am confining my consideration of this matter to the actual
circumstances which occurred, that is, that a constable on duty observed the
appellant in the act of committing an infrac-

[Page 204]

tion of the statute and that that constable had
no power to arrest the accused for such offence unless and until he had
attempted to identify the accused so that he might be the subject of summary
conviction proceedings.

I also agree, with respect, with the learned
members of the Court of Appeal that this conclusion in no way opposes or
ignores the judgment of the Queen’s Bench in Rice v. Connolly[2]. In that case, the appellant was
seen by police officers behaving suspiciously. On being questioned, he refused
to say where he was going or where he had come from. He refused to give his
full name and address, although he did give a name and the name of a road which
were not untrue. He refused to accompany the police to a police box for
identification purposes saying, “if you want me, you will have to arrest me”.
He was acquitted by the Court of Appeal upon a charge of obstructing the
police. It is paramount to note that the appellant there had not committed any
offence in the presence or view of a police officer. He had simply been acting
in what the constable regarded as a suspicious manner. I view the situation
very differently when a person is actually seen by the constable committing an
offence.

Therefore, for the reasons which I have outlined
above, I am of the opinion that the officer was under a duty to attempt to
identify the wrong-doer and the failure to identify himself by the wrongdoer
did constitute an obstruction of the police officer in the performance of his
duties.

I add that in coming to this conclusion I have
not forgotten the provisions of the Bill of Rights nor the topic of
individual freedom generally but I am of the opinion that there is not even
minimal interference with any freedom of a citizen who is seen committing an
infraction by a police constable in the police constable simply requesting his
name and address without any attempt to obtain from that person any admission
of fault or any comment whatsoever. On the other hand, the refusal of a citizen
to identify himself under such circumstances causes a major inconvenience and
obstruction to the police in carrying out their proper duties. So that if
anyone were engaged in

[Page 205]

any balancing of interest, there could be no
doubt that the conclusion to which I have come would be that supported by the
overwhelming public interest.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Dickson and Estey JJ. was
delivered by

DICKSON J. (dissenting)—These proceedings
originated in a minor traffic infraction in the City of Victoria, British
Columbia. The issue raised, however, is an important one having to do with
police power of interrogation and the right of citizens to remain silent. That
right has always been regarded as absolute and as being firmly anchored to two
fundamental common law principles: the presumption of innocence and the
privilege against self-incrimination. Explicit statutory provisions may impose
a duty upon a person to identify himself to police officers in certain
situations, but in this appeal the Court is being asked to impose such a duty
in the absence of any statutory underpinning whatever. In more stark terms, the
question is whether a person committing a petty traffic offence exposes himself
to a criminal charge of “obstructing” and a maximum penalty of two years’
imprisonment, if he refuses to give his name and address to a police officer.

The appellant went through an
intersection against a red light on his bicycle. A motorcycle policeman,
observing the infraction, stopped the appellant and, with the intention of
giving him a traffic ticket, asked for identification. The appellant refused to
give his name and address. As a result, he was charged with unlawfully and wilfully
obstructing a peace officer in the execution of his duty. The point is whether
the failure of the accused to identify himself when requested to do so by the
constable was evidence to go to the jury of the offence of wilfully obstructing
a police officer in the execution of his duty, contrary to s. 118  of the Criminal
Code .

The General Principle

Any duty to identify oneself must be found in
either common law or statute, quite apart from the

[Page 206]

duties of the police. A person is not guilty of
the offence of obstructing a police officer merely by doing nothing, unless
there is a legal duty to act. Omission to act in a particular way will give
rise to criminal liability only where a duty to act arises at common law or is
imposed by statute: 11 Hals. (4th ed.) p. 15. This idea was
expressed by Mr. Justice Schroeder in Regina v. Patrick[3], at p. 343:

Counsel for the appellant submitted that to
sustain a charge of obstructing a peace officer in the execution of his duty,
it was necessary for the Crown to prove either a positive act of interference,
or a refusal to perform some act required to be done by a statute. …It not
having been shown that the appellant was under any duty or obligation to
communicate to the peace officer the information required of him under the
provisions of either s. 221(2)  of the Criminal Code , or
s. 110(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, the Crown has failed to bring
home to the appellant the commission of a criminal offence. This is sufficient
to dispose of the appeal.

The point under discussion is dealt with at some
length by Dr. Glanville Williams in an article entitled “Demanding Name
and Address” appearing in (1950), 66 Law Quarterly Review, at p. 465. The
general principle of the common law is stated:

…neither a private person nor a constable
has any effective power to demand the name and address of a person on the
ground that he has committed an offence or is under a civil liability.

Dr. Williams refers to the case of Hatton
v. Treeby[4] as
an illustration of this principle. The head-note reads:

A constable who sees a person riding a
bicycle at night without a proper light, contrary to the provisions of
s. 85 of the Local Government Act, has no power to stop him for the
purpose of ascertaining his name and address.

The constable in that case called on the rider
to stop, in order to ascertain his name and address. On the rider failing to do
so, the constable caught hold of the handlebar of the bicycle, whereby the

[Page 207]

rider was thrown to the ground. The rider
summoned the constable for assault. The justices found that the constable did
not know the name or address of the rider, and could not have ascertained his
name or address in any other way than by stopping him, and that in so stopping
him he used no more force than was necessary. They were of opinion that, as the
rider was committing an offence punishable on summary conviction within view of
the constable, the latter was justified in stopping him as he did in order to
prevent a continuance of the offence and to ascertain his name and address.
They accordingly dismissed the complaint, subject to a case for the opinion of
the Court. The appellate Court held that the constable had no power to stop the
bicycle rider at common law and the only question was whether he had statutory
authority to do so. It was found that there was no statutory authority for the
constable acting as he did. In the result the constable was convicted of
assault.

No Statutory Duty

It appears to me impossible to extract from the
statutory provisions of the British Columbia Motor-vehicle Act, R.S.B.C.
1960, c. 253, a duty on a cyclist, caught riding through a red light, to
identify himself. Section 58 of the Act specifically places a duty on a person
driving a “motor-vehicle” to state correctly his name and address when
requested to do so by a peace officer. This in itself appears to recognize the
absence of any such duty where there is no statutory requirement. Section 58
does not apply to persons operating either “vehicles” (as defined in s. 2)
or bicycles, and there is no other provision in the Motor-vehicle Act, or
any other relevant statute, placing such a duty on a cyclist caught committing
a summary conviction offence under the Motor-vehicle Act.

I have had the advantage of reading the reasons
of Mr. Justice Spence and I am in full agreement, for the reasons stated
by him and by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, that the accused was not
in breach of s. 58 of the Motor-vehicle Act, when he refused to
give his name and address to the constable.

[Page 208]

At trial, the Crown took the position that the
obligation on the part of the accused to respond to the police officer’s
questions lay within the confines of the Motor-vehicle Act. That
argument was pursued unsuccessfully in the British Columbia Court of Appeal and
in this Court. There is simply no statutory duty on a cyclist committing a
traffic infraction to divulge his name and address.

Power of Arrest

But law enforcement, for that reason, does not
grind to a halt. There is no possibility of frustrating the enforcement of
provincial law by refusing to identify oneself since the police have the clear
power of arrest in these circumstances for the primary offence, to establish
the identity of the accused or to assure his attendance in court. It is beyond
dispute that the accused was prohibited by the provisions of the Motor-vehicle
Act from proceeding against the red light, an act which he has admitted.
Constable Sutherland was carrying out his duties under the Police Act, 1974
(B.C.), c. 64, when he stopped the accused and asked his name and address.
Although Constable Sutherland had no power under s. 63 of the Motor-vehicle
Act to arrest the accused without a warrant, additional powers of arrest
contained in s. 450(2)  of the Criminal Code  were available. These
provisions of the Code are made applicable by virtue of s. 101 of
the Summary Convictions Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 373. The most important
result follows, as Mr. Justice Spence concludes, that Constable Sutherland
could have arrested the accused for the offence of proceeding against a red
light if it were necessary to establish his identity. However, with great
respect, I cannot agree that, as a consequence, the accused was guilty of the
further, and much more serious, offence of obstructing the constable in the
performance of his duties by refusing to divulge his name and address.

No Common Law Duty

There is no duty at common law to identify
oneself to police. As was stated by Lord Parker in Rice v. Connolly[5], at p. 652:

[Page 209]

It seems to me quite clear that though
every citizen has a moral duty or, if you like, a social duty to assist the
police, there is no legal duty to that effect, and indeed the whole basis of
the common law is the right of the individual to refuse to answer questions put
to him by persons in authority, and to refuse to accompany those in authority
to any particular place, short, of course, of arrest.

The case stands for the proposition that refusal
to identify oneself to the police could not constitute obstruction of the police.
The Court distinguished a refusal to answer, which is legal, from a “cock and
bull” story to the police, which might constitute obstruction. No other
distinction was made. Lord Parker said, p. 652:

In my judgment there is all the difference
in the world between deliberately telling a false story, something which on no
view a citizen has a right to do, and silence or refusing to answer, something
which he has every right to do.

In Ingleton v. Dibble[6], a distinction was drawn between a
refusal to act, on the one hand, and the doing of some positive act, on the
other. Bridge J. (with whom Lord Widgery C.J. and Ashworth J. concurred) said,
at p. 279:

In a case, as in Rice v. Connolly, where
the obstruction alleged consists of a refusal by the defendant to do the act
which the police constable has asked him to do—to give information, it might
be, or to give assistance to the police constable—one can see readily the
soundness of the principle, if I may say so with respect, applied in Rice v.
Connolly, that such a refusal to act cannot amount to a wilful obstruction
under s. 51 unless the law imposes on the person concerned some obligation
in the circumstances to act in the manner requested by the police officer.

The legal position in England and Wales has been
described in these terms in Police Powers in England and Wales (1975),
by Leigh, at p. 195:

And in general it still remains the rule
that a citizen has a right to be as unco-operative as he pleases, provided that
he does not impede the course of justice by knowingly giving false information
to the police.

[Page 210]

In the Ontario case of Regina v. Carroll[7], the facts, as disclosed in the
headnote, were these. The accused was charged with unlawfully and wilfully
obstructing a police constable while engaged in his duties as a peace officer,
contrary to s. 100 (a) of the Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.),
c. 51. The accused, in company with three other men, was proceeding along a
highway at an early hour in the morning. The constable heard them whistling and
yelling and he advised them to be quiet and go home. Three of the party
followed his advice. The accused remained. The constable asked him to produce
his identification but the accused refused to do so and proceeded on his way.
The constable caught up to him and again asked accused to identify himself. An
argument and struggle followed and the accused was arrested. He was later
charged with obstructing a police officer and was convicted. He appealed. The
conviction was quashed. It was held that under the circumstances, the accused
was not under any duty to identify himself as requested.

The Crown conceded in this Court that no such
obligation was to be found in the common law. From whence then comes such a
duty? Where does one find the legal compulsion to answer? A person cannot
“obstruct” by refusing to answer a question unless he is under a legal duty to
answer.

An “Implied” or “Reciprocal” Duty?

It was strongly urged in argument before us that
because a duty rested upon constables to investigate crime and enforce
provincial laws, an “implied” or “reciprocal” duty rested upon a person,
suspected of an infraction, to give his name and address, and refusal to do so
amounted to such frustration as to constitute the offence of obstructing the
police in the execution of their duty.

The Crown perforce had to fall back upon the
proposition that because there was duty upon the police officer to inquire
before exercising the power to arrest under s.450 of the Code, there was
a reciprocal duty upon the alleged culprit to respond. The alleged duty, as I
understand the

[Page 211]

argument, is to be limited to divulging name and
address, when caught in the commission of an offence and prior to arrest.

The notion of “found committing” or “within his
view” is not unknown. The concept has been resorted to on occasion to give a
power of arrest where the offence is committed in the presence of the arrester.
But even here the application of the concept is not without problems. In an
article “Arrest: a General View”, [1966] Crim. L.R. 639, at p. 645, the
following appears:

The difficulty with this formula is two
fold—first, there has been no consistency in the judicial approach to the
interpretation of the section, courts holding variously that reasonable
suspicion that an offence has been committed is sufficient, or that in fact the
arrested person must be guilty to justify the arrest. The second problem is
that to confine the power in this way deprives the officer of a power in many
situations where it is necessary to arrest, for no apparent reason. Thus a
person who, having caused an accident by his dangerous driving, refuses to
stop, cannot be arrested unless the accident has actually been witnessed by the
officer. It seems equally absurd that a person who throws a brick through a shop
window can be arrested if the officer sees him do it, but not if the officer is
around the corner and hearing the crash of the glass, sees the offender,
perhaps the only possible culprit, or if the offence is witnessed by a private
person who calls the police.

Although the idea of “within his view” has been
applied to arrests, its application is relation to a duty to disclose identity
is novel and bizarre. It runs counter to all authority. The right to remain
silent, enunciated in Rice v. Connolly, does not admit of such erosion.
There is nothing in the language nor in the facts of that case to suggest that
the broad principle ceased to have application in the event of a police officer
witnessing an infraction.

A limited obligation to respond, effective only
when the policeman is an eyewitness, introduces into the criminal law, which
should rest upon

[Page 212]

“broad, plain, intelligible” principles a
qualification unsound in principle and unworkable in practice.

The fact that a police officer has a duty to
identify a person suspected of, or seen committing, an offence says nothing
about whether the person has the duty to identify himself on being asked. Each
duty is entirely independent. Only if the police have a lawful claim to demand
that a person identify himself, does the person have a corresponding duty to do
so. As McFarlane J.A. said in R. v. Bonnycastle[8], at p. 201, the duty of a peace
officer to make inquiries must not be confused with the right of a person to
refuse to answer questions in circumstances where the law does not require him
to answer.

The Legislature deliberately imposed a duty to
identify upon the drivers of motor vehicles—perhaps because of their more
lethal nature—but chose not to impose such duty on the drivers of other
vehicles such as bicycles. The Legislature must be taken to have intended to
relieve bicycle riders of the duty. To require the riders of bicycles to give
their names and addresses would be tantamount to amending the Motor-vehicle
Act. It would also appear that Parliament, in providing in ss. 450(2)  and
452(1) (f)(i) of the Criminal Code  for arrest and detention for
the purpose of establishing identity, did not recognize a duty to identify
oneself existing apart from statute, breach of which would expose the offender
to a charge of “obstructing”. Examples from English legislation of statutory
obligation to disclose identity to police constables, unnecessary if the
obligation existed otherwise, are to be found in the Protection of Birds
Act, 1954, 2 & 3 Eliz. 2, c. 30, s. 12(1) (a); Dangerous
Drugs Act, 1965, 13 & 14 Eliz. 2, c. 15, s. 15 ; Representation
of the People Act, 1949, 12 & 13 Geo. 6, c. 68, s. 84(3) ; Road
Traffic Act, 1960, 8 & 9 Eliz. 2, c. 16, s. 228 ; Prevention of
Crime Act, 1953, 1 & 2 Eliz. 2, c. 14, s. 1(3) .

[Page 213]

The criminal law is no place within which to
introduce implied duties, unknown to statute and common law, breach of which
subjects a person to arrest and imprisonment.

The “reciprocal duty” argument advanced by the
Crown in this case was considered by Dr. Glanville Williams in the article
to which I have referred. Dr. Williams effectively disposed of the
argument in words which I should like to adopt, p. 473:

The question may be asked whether the power
of the police to demand name and address is in effect generalized by the
statutes creating the offence of obstructing the police in the execution of
their duty—so that refusal to comply with the demand amounts to an obstruction.
At first sight it would seem that a good case could be made out for an
affirmative answer. Although it is not the duty of the police to prosecute
every crime, it can be said to be their duty to make inquiries into crimes with
a view to prosecution. The courts have held that interference with the police
when they are collecting evidence of an offence constitutes an obstruction.
Moreover, it has been decided that an obstruction may take place merely by a
nonfeasance, where there is a refusal to comply with the lawful orders of the
police. Notwithstanding these authorities, it is submitted that the refusal by
an offender to give his name and address does not constitute an obstruction,
for at least two reasons. First, if it were an obstruction, all the statutes
making it an offence to refuse to give name and address in specific situations
would have been unnecessary. When, for example, Parliament passed the Public
Order Act in 1936, it must have been thought that the police had no general
power to demand name and address. Secondly, it is a fundamental principle of
English law that an accused person cannot be interrogated or at least cannot be
forced to answer questions under a legal penalty if he refuses; this principle
is absolute, and does not admit of exception even for a demand of name and
address, unless a statute has expressly created an exception. To say that the
police have a duty to gather evidence, and therefore that a criminal’s refusal
to give his name and address is an obstruction, is far too wide, because the
same premise would yield the conclusion that a criminal’s refusal to confess to
the crime is an obstruction.

The views expressed by Dr. Williams were
adopted in the New Zealand case of Elder v. Evans[9].

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Theft and possession—Recent
possession—Evidence of similar acts—Admissibility—Evidence of previous
conviction under appeal—Defences—Res judicata—Criminal code , s. 318 —Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10,
s.12.

Appellant was charged with (1) breaking,
entering and theft at premises of Allan Crawford and Associates Limited in
Mississauga (2) possession of electronic equipment and computer parts of a
value exceeding $200, knowing that they were obtained by the commission in
Canada of an offence punishable by indictment, namely theft, and (3) unlawful
possession of a computer and a teletype machine contrary to s. 312(1) (b)
of the Criminal Code . The electronic equipment and computer parts were
allegedly stolen by appellant from Allan Crawford and Associates Ltd. by whom
he had been employed prior to his discharge. The computer and teletype machine
were allegedly stolen from a company in the United
 States with whom appellant had been employed and
although he was not charged with the theft of the goods the Crown case was
founded on evidence from which it could be inferred that he had stolen them.
Appellant was convicted on counts 1 and 3 and acquitted on count 2. The Court
of Appeal dismissed his appeal without written reasons. Leave to appeal further
was granted on four questions namely (first) whether the trial judge should
have charged the jury on the doctrine of recent possession, (second) whether
appellant was prejudiced by the improper admission of similar fact evidence,
(third) whether appellant was prejudiced by the improper admission of a
previous conviction which was under appeal and subsequently set aside and
(fourth) whether there was lack of direction by the trial judge on the
explanations of appellant.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Estey JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be
dismissed.

[Page 83]

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and Pratte JJ.: Since the case for the prosecution on
the counts of unlawful possession rested upon evidence that the appellant had
in fact stolen the property and the Crown did not purport to rely upon the
doctrine of recent possession but rather sought to prove that the goods had
been stolen by appellant, recent possession was not squarely in issue and the
judge was not bound to direct the jury to the doctrine. The jury having found
the appellant guilty of theft (count 1) quite properly found him not guilty of
unlawful possession of the same goods (count 2). As to count 3 the judge
repeatedly referred to the doctrine of reasonable doubt as to whether appellant
had an honest belief in his right to retain the goods.

As to the second question the evidence of
similar facts introduced was admissible to show the possession by the appellant
of the goods was not innocent. The judge properly made it clear to the jury
that the similar fact evidence did not apply to the theft libelled in
count 1.

There has been no judicial determination in Canada on the right to adduce evidence of a
conviction under appeal. Appellant referred to a number of American authorities
to support his contention that the conviction in question, being under appeal,
was inadmissible but the preponderance of judicial opinion seems to support the
view that evidence of such a conviction is indeed admissible notwithstanding a
pending appeal. The fact that the appeal against the conviction here at issue
was subsequently allowed and a new trial directed cannot affect the
admissibility of the evidence respecting it.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Dickson, Spence and Estey JJ. dissenting: While appellant’s
appeal as to the admission of similar fact evidence cannot be supported in
reference to count 3 and its application to count 2 is irrelevant in view of
the verdict of not guilty, the statement made by the trial judge that this
similar fact evidence was admissible on counts 2 and 3 only was made in the
absence of the jury. In her address, the judge failed to make any detailed
application of the evidence to each count or counts. Failure to exclude this
similar fact evidence from the consideration of appellant’s guilt on the count
of theft constituted misdirection as also did failure to charge the jury on the
doctrine of recent possession, whether or not the Crown purported to rely upon
the doctrine.

[Page 84]

Further where an appeal is pending aginst a
previous conviction it is not proper to examine the accused on that conviction
[Campbell v. U.S., 176 F. (2d) 45]. Moreover in this case the permitting
of such evidence was particularly damaging and, even if the evidence was
correctly admitted, the trial judge should have made it very clear in her
charge that if this accused had not, in law, been properly convicted, then the
evidentiary value in regard to his credibility was nil. Failure so to do
amounted to further misdirection.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissing an
appeal from conviction for break, enter and theft and possession of stolen
goods. Appeal dismissed, Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Estey JJ.
dissenting.

J. Lockyer and M. Winter, for the
appellant.

Douglas Hunt, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson
and Estey JJ. was delivered by

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on March 23, 1977. By that judgment, the Court of Appeal
dismissed an appeal from a conviction of the appellant by a judge and jury
pronounced on June 25 and July 29, 1975.

The appellant was charged in an indictment
containing three counts as follows:

1. The Jurors of her Majesty the Queen
present that JON HEWSON, between the first day of August, 1974, and the thirty
first day of August, 1974, unlawfully did, at the City of Mississauga, in the
Judicial District of Peel, and the Province of Ontario, break and enter a
certain place, to wit; the business premises of Allan Crawford and Associates
Limited, 6427 Northam Drive, Mississauga, and commit the indictable offence of
theft

[Page 85]

therein, contrary to Section 306 -1 (b)
of the Criminal Code  of Canada;

2. The Jurors of Her Majesty the Queen
further present that JON HEWSON, between the first day of April, 1974, and the
seventeenth day of August, 1974, at the City of Mississauga, in the Judicial
District of Peel, and at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, in the
Judicial District of York, both in the Province of Ontario, unlawfully did have
in his possession electronic equipment, and computer parts of a value exceeding
Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) knowing that they were obtained by the commission
in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment, namely theft, contrary to
Section 312 -1  (a) of the Criminal Code  of Canada;

3. The Jurors of Her Majesty the Queen
further present that JON HEWSON, between the first day of April, 1974, and the
seventeenth day of August, 1974, at the City of Mississauga, in the Judicial
District of Peel, and the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, in the Judicial
District of York, both in the Province of Ontario, unlawfully did have in his
possession a computer and a teletype machine of a value exceeding Two Hundred
Dollars ($200.00), knowing them to have been obtained by the commission of the
crime of theft, in the State of Massachusetts in the United States of America,
which if it had occurred in Canada, would have constituted an offence
punishable by indictment, contrary to Section 312 -1 (b) of the Criminal
Code  of Canada.

After a lengthy and complicated trial, the jury
found the accused guilty on counts 1 and 3 and not guilty on count 2. The
appeal of the accused to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed without written or oral reasons. Leave to appeal to
this Court was granted upon the following questions.

1. Did the Supreme Court of Ontario err in
not finding that in the circumstances of this case it was incumbent on the
trial judge to charge the jury on the doctrine of recent possession?

2. Did the Supreme Court of Ontario err in
finding that the applicant was not prejudiced in his right to a fair trial by
the improper admission of similar fact evidence?

3. Did the Supreme Court of Ontario err in
finding that the applicant was not prejudiced in his right to a fair trial by
the improper admission of a previous conviction of the applicant which was at
the time of trial under appeal and which was set aside subsequently?

4. Did the Supreme Court of Ontario err in
not finding lack of direction by the trial judge on the explanations of the
applicant?

[Page 86]

I shall first refer to the second question, that
is, the question dealing with the admission of similar fact evidence. Such
evidence was admitted by the learned trial judge and submitted to the jury only
after a very careful consideration upon a voir dire and after the learned trial
judge had given reasons in which she cited and analyzed many relevant
authorities. At the conclusion of the argument, this Court came to the view
that the evidence produced as evidence of similar fact was admissible on
charges 2 and 3 but was quite inadmissible on charge 1. It is not my intention
at the present time to discuss the question of the admissibility of similar
fact evidence at any length and I confine myself to stating very shortly that
the evidence was admissible to show that the possession by the accused of the
goods referred to in count 2 and count 3 was not innocent and that such similar
fact evidence did fall within the well known classifications outlined
particularly in Makin v. Attorney General for New South Wales[1], Brunet v. The King[2], and D.P.P. v. Boardman[3].

The evidence was submitted in the form of an
agreed statement of facts as follows:

On Friday, February 23rd, 1973, the Bell
Canada Service Centre at 1090 Shaw Street, Toronto, received an emergency order
for a view-com C.R.T. unit for installation on the following Monday. As a
result of that order, a view-com C.R.T. unit, serial number 3 0 8 was hooked up
for testing. This unit was seen on a service bench by Bell Canada employees at
4:00 o’clock p.m. Friday, February 23rd, 1973. This unit was missing from its location on the service bench at
8:00 a.m., Monday, February 26th, 1973. The Metropolitan Toronto Police Department was called and they
began to look for the view‑com unit. Acting on information received, the
detectives obtained a search warrant for apartment 356 at 20 Cassandra Boulevard, Toronto, the apartment of Jon Hewson.

On Saturday, March 10th, 1973, Metropolitan
Toronto Police detectives, along with Bell Canada Security Department employees
went to this particular apartment. They knocked several times on the door. No
answer was received, although they heard someone

[Page 87]

speaking on the telephone. On an earlier
day, the previous week, they had attempted to gain entry to the apartment, but
it appeared a lock had been changed. On this particular Saturday, after the
detectives heard the voice inside the apartment, one detective looked through
the letterbox and saw Jon Hewson standing inside. The officer yelled to
Mr. Hewson and saw Mr. Hewson enter the kitchen area and
Mr. Hewson made no reply. The detective gained access to the apartment by entering
the adjacent apartment and climbed from the balcony of the other apartment to
the balcony of Mr. Hewson’s apartment. They then smashed the window,
reached in, and unlocked the door. Jon Hewson asked to see the search
warrant and indicated that he was talking on the phone to someone. The search
warrant was shown to him. The detectives observed a view-com C.R.T. unit
sitting on the end table in the apartment. On top of the view-com was a
non-impact printer. This property was taken back to the police station and a supervisor
of Bell Canada came to the police station to
examine the property. He checked the view-corn C.R.T. unit and found the serial
number had been removed from the back of the unit. He removed the back shield
of the unit and on the frame of the unit was the serial number 3 0 7. The Bell
Canada employee was able to identify this view‑com unit as the property
of Bell Canada Limited. He examined the non-impact printer and found a serial
number 1 4 4. Upon checking with Bell Canada Service Centre at 1090 Shaw Street, Toronto, he was able to
determine that the item known as the non-impact printer had gone missing from 1090 Shaw Street, the Bell Service Centre.

Such evidence indicated a possession by the
accused of goods which were the property of a previous employer, i.e., Bell Canada. These goods were electronic equipment, and the accused and his
various employers had all been in the electronic field. In the case of both
similar fact evidence and the goods with which the accused was charged with
possession in counts 2 and 3 aforesaid, the explanation of the accused was that
he had some sort of a colour of right to possess the goods although the reasons
advanced by the accused were many and varied.

I, therefore, have come to the conclusion that
the appellant’s appeal as to the admission of this similar fact evidence cannot
be supported in reference to count 3. Count 2 is irrelevant as the jury’s
verdict upon that count was one of not guilty.

[Page 88]

It was the view of the learned trial judge
expressed at the end of the voir dire as to the admission of this similar fact
evidence that the evidence was admissible on counts 2 and 3 only. This
statement, of course, was made in the absence of the jury. When the state of
the trial was finally arrived at where Her Honour addressed the jury, she did
not make any detailed application of the evidence to one particular count or
counts but rather she spoke of the admissibility of the evidence and its
availability to the jury in considering “the question of honesty of the belief
of the accused with respect to the goods that he had with him on
August 15th, 1974” and then continued “but that similar act evidence can
be used by you to assist you in reaching your conclusions as to whether he
honestly believed that he had the right to retain the goods which he claimed he
retained”.

The goods which were found in the premises of
the accused on August 15, 1974,
were the goods as to which the accused was charged with stealing in the break,
enter and theft count, #1, and as to which he was charged with possession
in counts 2 and 3. Surely, as Her Honour realized, similar fact evidence was
inadmissible in support of the break, enter and theft count, #1, and the
exclusion of such evidence from the consideration of the accused’s guilt on that
count 1 should have been made very clear to the jury. Failure to do so, in my
opinion, constituted serious misdirection.

Question 1 in the order for leave to appeal
granted by this Court dealt with the failure of the trial judge to charge the
jury on the doctrine of recent possession. As counsel for the Crown pointed out
in his argument before this Court, the Crown did not purport to rely upon the
doctrine of recent possession of goods knowing them to have been obtained by
crime but rather sought to prove that the goods which were the subject matter
of the three counts, that is, the goods, the property of Allan Crawford and
Associates Limited, alleged in count 1 to have been stolen from that owner, the
same goods dealt with in the possession count, #2, and the goods allegedly
stolen from the Gould Corporation, the subject of count 3, had all been the
subject of theft by the appellant. It is to be

[Page 89]

noted, however, that there was only indirect and
circumstantial evidence of both the theft from Allan Crawford and Associates
Limited and from the Gould Corporation, and there can be no doubt that the
adducing of the evidence that the goods allegedly stolen were found in the
actual possession of the accused would be very telling evidence against him in
the minds of the jury. I am of the opinion that whether or not the Crown
purported to rely upon the doctrine of recent possession, it was incumbent upon
the learned trial judge to cite that presumption and particularly to warn the
jury that they could not rely upon the presumption to convict the accused of
either the break and enter count or the other two possession counts if they
were of the opinion that his explanation reasonably could be true whether or
not they were ready to accept that story. This has been said very frequently by
authorities and particularly by Fauteux C.J.C. in Tremblay v. The Queen[4]. Again, I regard the failure to so
charge the jury as a major misdirection.

I turn now to the third question upon which
leave to appeal was granted. The Crown had given notice to the appellant or his
counsel of its intention to produce evidence of previous convictions. This was
evidently an attempt to proceed under the provisions of s. 318  of the Criminal
Code  which, in sub. (1), provides:

318. (1)
Where an accused is charged with an offence under section 312  or paragraph
314(1) (b) and evidence is adduced that the subject-matter of the
proceedings was found in his possession, evidence that the accused was, within
five years before the proceedings were commenced, convicted of an offence
involving theft or an offence under section 312  is admissible at any stage
of the proceedings and may be taken into consideration for the purpose of
proving that the accused knew that the property that forms the subject-matter
of the proceedings was unlawfully obtained.

Counsel for the appellant at trial objected to
the production of evidence as to one conviction of the accused for the theft of
articles from Bell Canada which were the subject of similar
fact evidence. It was the submission of counsel for the accused that when that
conviction had been appealed and the

[Page 90]

appeal was pending then the conviction should
not be submitted under the provisions of s. 318  of the Criminal Code  and
the learned trial judge should rule that the Crown could not, in its case,
produce evidence of that conviction.

The appellant gave evidence in his own defence
and, in answer to his counsel, admitted two previous convictions—one for
placing harassing telephone calls and the second for causing a disturbance. The
first conviction, the accused explained was in connection with his telephone
service where he had run into repeated failures and the second when he had
attended a garage to have his automobile serviced. The garage operator refused
to do so, a disturbance resulted, and the accused was charged with causing a
disturbance. It is said that the accused pleaded guilty to both of those
charges. On cross-examination, counsel for the Crown asked “Did you leave out
one conviction?” and when the appellant asked for further elucidation, counsel
for the Crown reminded the accused that he had been convicted in December 1974
for possession of stolen property. The accused admitted that conviction and,
after an interruption in which the right of the Crown to put that question was
debated and the ruling made in favour of permitting the question, the accused
said that that charge was then under appeal and that was the reason he had made
no mention of it.

The learned trial judge in her charge to the
jury said:

Now, there has been evidence given by the
accused,—he was in the witness box with respect to previous convictions, and I
want to give you a specific warning about this evidence. It may be considered
by you only in respect of the credibility of the accused. You may take it into
consideration, then decide how much of his evidence you believe. There was, in
this case, a rather peculiar circumstance in that when the accused was asked
about his convictions, he left out one conviction which was brought to his
attention on cross examination. I wish to advise you at this time that it was
quite clear that that was not deliberate, but it was done on the wrong advice
of counsel, so that you may consider his answer as if he had originally said,
“I was convicted of three offences”,—which he did outline. Now, I want to warn
you that you are not entitled to regard the fact that he was convicted of those
criminal offences or any of them

[Page 91]

as indicating a propensity on his part to
commit other acts, and take into account in determining his guilt or innocence,
but you should consider that evidence solely and exclusively for the purpose of
determining the degree of credibility which might be attached to his evidence.

Her Honour, therefore, corrected any impression
that the accused had sought to deliberately avoid mention of the conviction for
possession of goods stolen from Bell Canada but Her
Honour did allow the jury to hear of the conviction despite the fact that it
was, at the time of this trial, under appeal. It is not without interest that
such appeal was subsequently allowed and a new trial directed.

There has been no judicial determination in Canada as to the right to adduce against an
accused person evidence of a previous conviction which was under appeal. There
have been decisions in the United States in the federal appeal courts and in the highest of the state
courts, and those decisions have gone both ways. It is said that the very
considerable majority of the decisions in the courts in the United States
permit the adducing of evidence as to a conviction despite the fact that an
appeal is pending and that several of them have even gone so far as to permit
the adducing of such evidence despite the fact that at the time of the
subsequent trial the earlier conviction had been reversed on appeal. I find
much virtue in the pronouncement made by Miller, Circuit Judge, in Campbell
v. U.S.[5], at p.
47:

But it seems wholly illogical and unfair to
permit a defendant to be interrogated about a previous conviction from which an
appeal is pending. If the judgment of conviction is later reversed, the
defendant has suffered unjustly and irreparably, the prejudice, if any, caused
by the disclosure of the former conviction. We therefore, hold that the
pendency of an appeal prevents the prosecution from proving a previous
conviction for impeachment purposes; and that the District Court erred in
admitting evidence concerning Campbell’s conviction when his appeal therefrom had not been determined. It
is noteworthy that the trial judge, himself a former United States Attorney who
served with distinction, expressed grave doubt as to the admissibility of the
conviction, repeatedly warned government counsel of the

[Page 92]

risk of reversible error involved in asking
the question, and was persuaded to permit it only by authorities from state
courts which were submitted to him.

That position has been upheld in other United States federal courts of appeal and
in Jennings v. Texas[6]. In Suggs v. State of Maryland[7], however, Murphy, Chief Judge, said at
p. 672:

The eliciting of impeaching evidence that a
witness had previously suffered a conviction from which an appeal was pending
has been held proper even where, as here, the appeal subsequently resulted in
the reversal of the previous conviction. See Latikos v. State, 17
Ala.App. 655, 88 So. 47; People v. Braun, 14 Cal. 2d 1, 92 P.2d 402; In re Abrams, 36 Ohio App. 384, 173 N.E. 312; State v. Crawford, 60 Utah 6, 206 P. 717. In Manning v. State,
7 Okl.Cr. 367, 123 P. 1029, a case upholding the use of a conviction
pending appeal despite its subsequent reversal on appeal, it was indicated that
where a witness had been tried for a felony, and the case submitted to a jury
which found from the evidence that he was guilty, this fact could in any event
be shown in evidence for the purpose of affecting his credibility since the law
presumes that the jury, as an intelligent and impartial body, would not find
the accused guilty upon mere suspicion or accusation. The Manning court,
in concluding that the prior conviction was properly admissible, held that it
was the verdict of the jury upon such an accusation that affects the
credibility of the witness (without regard to the subsequent reversal of the
conviction).

In my view the fact that a jury has found that
an accused was guilty cannot be accepted as an important finding by an
intelligent and impartial body when the basis upon which that jury reached its
verdict was upon a subsequent appeal found to be faulty. Let us presume that
the jury had, as a result of the error of the court, heard hearsay evidence and
that error had been reversed in the Court of Appeal. The finding of a jury, no
matter how impartial and intelligent, based on such an unreliable foundation as
that would certainly not give any evidence of the accused’s guilt or indicate

[Page 93]

his lack of credibility, the sole purpose for
which a record may be adduced. It is highly possible that a jury would
disregard strenuous denials by an accused relying on evidence which an
appellate court might find later to be unreliable. How then could a jury’s
finding of guilt reflect on the credibility of that accused?

I have come to the conclusion that in Canada we should accept the principle as
enunciated in Campbell v. U.S., supra, and not adopt the course as
enunciated in, inter alia, Suggs v. Maryland, supra. Moreover, in this particular
case, the permitting of the evidence as to the conviction under appeal was
particularly damaging. As I have pointed out, the only other record was of two
very inconsequential convictions not in any way connected to the sort of charge
which faced the accused on this occasion. On the other hand, the record of the
conviction for possession of stolen goods, the property of Bell Canada, was a record connected with the very evidence adduced on the
evidence of similar facts. Nothing could be more conclusive in the mind of the
jury against the accused than that he was, according to the Crown’s evidence,
proceeding in a fashion similar to that in which he had proceeded as to the
property of Bell Canada and that he had been convicted for such actions. Even
if we are not to rule out all convictions which are subject to pending appeals
as being admissible in cross‑examination of an accused, this conviction
certainly should have been ruled out.

There is much debate as to whether s. 12 of the Canada
Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10, gives to the court a discretion to
refuse to permit the production of any part of the accused’s record. I am
presently of the opinion that the initial words of subs. (1) of s. 12, “a
witness may be questioned as to whether he has been convicted of any offence.”
do not give a discretion to the court but rather to the Crown. I am, therefore,
of the view that the exclusionary rule must be adopted and it should not be left
to the discretion of individual trial judges. However, in this particular case,
Her Honour the learned trial judge had

[Page 94]

determined that the question was admissible.
Even if that decision had been correct, I am of the view that she should have
made it very clear in her charge to the jury that if this accused had not, in
law, been properly convicted, then the evidentiary value in regard to his
credibility was nil, and I find Her Honour’s failure to take that position in
her charge was again misdirection.

For these reasons, I would allow the appellant’s
appeal and direct a new trial on counts 1 and 3.

Another matter must be referred to. The accused
had been charged with an unrelated theft of goods of a value of under $200 and
had been convicted on July 12, 1977. On his appeal to the Court of Appeal, the
sentence of that offence had been amended to provide that it should be
“twenty-nine days consecutive to time now being served”. If the “time then
being served” were the sentences imposed by Her Honour Judge Dymond in the
appeal we are now considering, then those twenty-nine days have long passed and
cannot be considered as being consecutive to a sentence which is now being
quashed by these reasons, and this matter should be considered by the
appropriate authorities.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz
and Pratte JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought with leave
of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Province of Ontario
rendered without written reasons in dismissing an appeal from the appellant’s
conviction at trial before Her Honour Judge S. Dymond, sitting with a jury.

I have had the privilege of reading the reasons
for judgment of my brother Spence, wherein he has accurately reproduced the
charges contained in the indictment laid against the appellant which can be
summarized as follows:

1. Breaking and entering the business
premises of Allan Crawford and Associates Limited at the City of Mississauga in the Province of Ontario.

2. Having possession of electronic
equipment and computer parts of a value exceeding Two Hundred Dollars

[Page 95]

($200.00) “knowing that they were obtained
by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment,
namely theft...”

3. Unlawfully having in his possession “a
computer and a teletype machine of a value exceeding Two Hundred Dollars
($200.00) knowing them to have been obtained by the commission of the crime of
theft in the State of Massachusetts in the United States of America, which
if it had occurred in Canada, would have constituted an offence punishable by
indictment, contrary to Section 312 -1 (b) of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

The electronic equipment and computer parts
referred to in the second count were allegedly the property of Allan Crawford
and Associates Limited by whom the appellant had been employed prior to his
discharge and from whose premises, situated at the City of Mississauga, the
appellant had allegedly stolen them. If these goods were in fact found to have
been stolen by the appellant, it is obvious that he must have known them to
have been obtained by theft within the meaning of the second count, and this
was the basis upon which the Crown founded its case.

The computer and teletype machines referred to
in the third count were allegedly stolen from a company in the United States by
whom the appellant had formerly been employed, and although he was not charged
with stealing these goods, the Crown’s case on this count was also founded on
evidence from which it could be inferred that he had stolen them.

The appellant was convicted of the first and
third counts and acquitted of the second count, and the grounds upon which
leave to appeal was granted to this Court are also reproduced in the reasons
for judgment of my brother Spence, but I think it convenient to repeat them for
the purposes of clarity:

1. Did the Supreme Court of Ontario err in
not finding that in the circumstances of this case it was incumbent on the
trial judge to charge the jury on the doctrine of recent possession?

2. Did the Supreme Court of Ontario err in
finding that the applicant was not prejudiced in his right to a fair trial by
the improper admission of similar fact evidence?

3. Did the Supreme Court of Ontario err in
finding that the applicant was not prejudiced in his right to a fair

[Page 96]

trial by the improper admission of a
previous conviction of the applicant which was at the time of trial under
appeal and which was set aside subsequently?

4. Did the Supreme Court of Ontario err in
not finding lack of direction by the trial judge on the explanations of the
applicant?

As to the first question, the instructions
required to be given to a jury by a trial judge where an accused is charged
with “receiving recently stolen property” have been accepted in this Court in
the terms first stated by Lord Reading in R. v. Schama and Abramovitch[8], at p. 49, which have been
summarized by Chief Justice Duff in Richler v. The King[9] at p. 103 as follows:

The question, therefore, to which it was
the duty of the learned trial judge to apply his mind was not whether he was
convinced that the explanation given was the true explanation, but whether the
explanation might reasonably be true; or, to put it in other words, whether the
Crown had discharged the onus of satisfying the learned trial judge beyond a
reasonable doubt that the explanation of the accused could not be accepted as a
reasonable one and that he was guilty.

See also Tremblay v. The Queen[10], R. v. Newton[11], and the many cases there cited.

As I have indicated, the case for the prosecution
on the second and third counts rested upon evidence that the accused had in
fact stolen the property, and it is significant that Crown counsel stated in
this Court that the Crown did not purport to rely upon the doctrine of recent
possession of goods knowing them to have been obtained by theft, but rather
sought to prove that the goods had been the subject of theft by the appellant
himself. In this latter regard, I share the view expressed by Bull J.A. in R.
v. Hart[12] at
p. 245 where he said:

In this case the doctrine of recent
possession was not raised in the Court below, either by the Crown or by the
defence. The Crown did not rely on any presumption stemming from the
unexplained possession of recently

[Page 97]

stolen goods, nor did the learned Provincial
Court Judge in any way base his decision on such a presumption. It was simply
not in issue, and hence he was not bound to direct himself as to whether the
appellant’s explanation might or might not reasonably be true. It follows he
did not err as submitted.

The Hart case was one which had been
tried by a judge sitting alone but the same considerations apply in the case of
a trial by a jury.

In the present case, however, the jury, having
found the accused guilty of theft under the first count, quite properly found
him not guilty of the possession count (count 2). This is in accord with the
law as stated by MacKay J.A. in R. v. Siggins[13], at p. 285 where he said of an
indictment charging both theft and possession of the stolen goods:

The Crown is entitled to lay both charges
against him, but at the trial if the jury convicted of theft they should not
convict on charges of unlawful possession.

The cases of R. v. Quon[14] and R. v. Hogg[15] are to the same effect.

The third count which related to the unlawful possession
of goods allegedly stolen in the United States of
 America can have had no bearing on the guilt or
innocence of the appellant in relation to the goods allegedly stolen in Canada which are the subject of the first
count.

In the course of the charge to the jury, the
learned trial judge repeatedly referred to the doctrine of reasonable doubt in
relation to the question of whether the appellant had an honest belief in his
right to retain the goods.

In dealing with the second count the learned
trial judge summarized the explanations given by the accused as follows:

The accused says, ‘I had these goods, those
marked, ‘R’,—the company owes me money, I am holding them until the company
pays me. I believe I can do that’. The accused also says, ‘Certain goods I
found in the garbage,

[Page 98]

certain goods I bought out of my own money
and certain goods were given to me in payment for overtime’.

You will consider the evidence for and
against these allegations when you go to your jury room.

At another stage in her charge, the trial judge
gave this direction:

The unreasonableness of a belief when
objectively considered does not necessarily destroy the honesty of the belief,
but the unreasonableness may be considered along with other evidence in
determining whether the Crown has established that these articles were taken
without colour of right.

In all the circumstances I can find no error in
the trial judge having failed to charge the jury on the doctrine of recent
possession and I would accordingly answer the first question in the negative.

As to the second question, I am in agreement
with Mr. Justice Spence in finding that the evidence of similar facts
introduced in this case was admissible to show the possession by the accused of
the goods referred to in counts two and three was not innocent and that such
similar facts did fall within the principles outlined in Makin v. Attorney
General for New South Wales[16] and
D.P.P. v. Boardman[17].

This evidence was introduced to rebut the
defence that the defendant honestly believed that he had a right to have the
goods in question in his possession and it is admissible solely on the issue of
“honest belief” and it is therefore not relevant or admissible as to the first
count of theft. This latter view was expressed by the learned trial judge on a
voir dire but was not expressed in the same terms in the charge to the jury.

It was contended on behalf of the appellant that
the learned trial judge failed to make it plain to the jury that this evidence
was to be excluded in their consideration of the guilt or innocence of the

[Page 99]

appellant on the first count. In this regard it
is appropriate to quote the following paragraph of the charge to the jury:

There was evidence read into Court to you
which I will come to later on of similar acts committed by the accused relating
to the two pieces of equipment owned by Bell Canada and found on the accused’s
premises. Now, that evidence only goes to the question of honesty of the
belief of the accused with respect to the goods that he had with him on August
15th, 1974. All other evidence about the character of the man, that is, of
Mr. Hewson, must be used only to determine whether he is a man you can
believe, and must not be used to decide that he is a man who is likely to
commit the act complained of, but that Similar Fact Evidence can be used by you
to assist you in reaching your conclusions as to whether he honestly believed
that he had the right to retain the goods which he claimed he retained.

With the greatest respect, I am of opinion that
in directing the jury that the “similar fact evidence” “only goes to the
question of honesty of the belief of the accused with respect to the goods that
he had with him on August 15th, 1974” the learned trial judge made it plain
that this evidence was only to be considered in relation to the second and
third counts in the indictment. The question of “honesty of belief” was not at
issue in relation to the first count, and I am satisfied that the jury was made
aware of this by the paragraph of the charge which I have just quoted which
can, in my view, only be construed as meaning that the “similar fact evidence”
did not apply to that count.

The third question is concerned with the
admissibility of evidence of a previous conviction of the accused which was under
appeal at the time of the trial and was subsequently set aside. This evidence
was obviously admitted in compliance with s. 318(1)  of the Criminal Code  which
reads as follows:

318. (1)
Where an accused is charged with an offence under section 312  or paragraph
314(1) (b) and evidence is adduced that the subject-matter of the
proceedings was found in his possession, evidence that the accused was, within
five years before the proceedings were commenced, convicted of an offence
involving theft or an offence under section 312  is admissible at any stage
of the proceedings and may be taken into consideration for the purpose of
proving that the accused knew that the

[Page 100]

property that forms the subject-matter of
the proceedings was unlawfully obtained.

In the course of his evidence, the appellant was
asked the following questions by his own counsel:

Q. Now, before I ask you the next question,
I believe you have a previous conviction?

A. I do.

Q. And you have a conviction for harrassing
phone calls?

A. That was in connection with my telephone
service failing continually.

Q. And you also have a previous conviction
for causing a disturbance?

A. In 1969, I went to get my car serviced
and the garage refused to and they laid charges against me.

Q. That charge of harrassing arose out of
some dispute between you and these garage people, is that correct?

A. No, the garage incident was, I believe,
causing a disturbance.

No other previous convictions were drawn to the
appellant’s attention in his direct examination nor did he volunteer any
evidence in this regard.

In the course of his cross-examination the
appellant however, admitted to having been convicted in 1974 for the possession
of stolen property. This evidence was brought out in the following series of
questions:

Q. Mr. Hewson, sir, when your counsel,
Mr. Raman, was asking you questions about previous convictions, you
mentioned that you had been convicted for causing a disturbance at one time and
I believe causing a disturbance at one time,—did you not leave out one conviction?

A. Could you remind me please?

Q. Yes, I’d like to remind that you were
convicted in 1974, in December, for possession of stolen property.

A. Yes.

Q. Any reason that one slipped your mind
when counsel asked you?

[Page 101]

This question was followed by argument in the
absence of the jury and on the jury’s return the following ensued:

Q. We agree in December, ’74 you were
convicted of possession of stolen property?

A. No, in October ’74.

Q. Is there anything you’d like to say
about that?

A. Yes, the matter is under appeal and that
is the reason I made no mention of it.

It became apparent that the appellant’s initial
failure to mention this conviction was a result of his counsel’s advice and in
this regard the learned trial judge, in my opinion properly, instructed the
jury in the following terms:

Now, there has been evidence given by the
accused,—he was in the witness box with respect to previous conviction, and I
want to give you a specific warning about this evidence. It may be considered
by you only in respect of the credibility of the accused. You may take it into
consideration, then decide how much of his evidence you believe. There was,
in this case, a rather peculiar circumstance in that when the accused was asked
about his convictions, he left out one conviction which was brought to his
attention on cross-examination. I wish to advise you at this time that it was
quite clear that that was not deliberate, but it was done on the wrong advice
of counsel, so that you may consider his answer as if he had originally
said—’I was convicted of three offences’,—which he did outline. Now, I want to
warn you that you are not entitled to regard the fact that he was convicted of
those criminal offences or any of them as indicating a propensity on his part to
commit other acts, and take that into account in determining his guilt or
innocence, but you should consider that evidence solely and exclusively for the
purpose of determining the degree of credibility which might be attached to his
evidence. (The italics are my own).

As the learned trial judge pointed out, the
evidence of previous convictions could only be considered by the jury in
respect of the issue of the accused’s credibility and it appears to me that as
the omission of the third conviction was the result of counsel’s advice rather
than any deliberate attempt to mislead, it is not to be treated as affecting
the appellant’s credibility.

[Page 102]

It is contended, however, on behalf of the
appellant that the fact that the conviction in question was under appeal
resulted in any evidence relating to it being inadmissible. In support of this
contention reference is made to a number of American authorities, but it will
be found that the great weight of judicial opinion in that country is to the
contrary effect. In the course of his reasons for judgment, Mr. Justice
Spence refers to the case of Suggs v. State of Maryland[18], and I quote from the reasons for
judgment of the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland in that case in the
paragraph immediately preceding that which is cited by my learned brother. It
is there said:

It appears to be the majority rule that it
is permissible to attack the credibility of a witness by showing the fact of a
previous criminal conviction even though an appeal therefrom is then pending.
The rule is bottomed upon the premise that unless and until the judgment of the
trial court is reversed, the defendant stands convicted and may properly be
questioned regarding that conviction. The cases are collected in an Annotation
at 16 A.L.R. 3d. 726-738.

The 1974 conviction here at issue was under
appeal at the time of the hearing of the present case and in my view the fact
that the appeal was subsequently allowed and a new trial directed cannot affect
the admissibility of the evidence respecting it.

It is true that there has been no express
judicial determination in Canada as to the right to adduce evidence against an accused person of a
previous conviction which was the subject of appeal at the time of the trial.
In this regard every consideration must be given to the provisions of s. 318(1) 
of the Criminal Code  which is quoted above.

In my view a previous conviction cannot be
excluded from the operation of this section on the sole ground that a
notice of appeal had been entered against it. If it were otherwise it would
only be necessary for a convicted person to file a notice of appeal in order to
sterilize his conviction from the operation of the section at least until
such time as his appeal was disposed of, and with all respect, I am unable to
accept a proposition which

[Page 103]

could lead to such a result. I would accordingly
answer the third question in the negative.

It will be apparent from the observations which
I have made concerning the second question that I find no lack of direction by
the trial judge concerning the explanations given by the appellant and would
accordingly answer that question in the negative also.

For all these reasons I would dismiss this
appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Evidence—Witness’s prior
inconsistent statement to police—Admissibility—No error on part of trial judge
in permitting cross-examination of witness concerning statement—Credibility—Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. E-10, s. 9(2).

The majority of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia dismissed the appellants’
appeals from their convictions on charges of murder. The appellants appealed to
this Court pursuant to s. 618(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  upon
a question of law on which Robertson J.A. had dissented.

A Crown witness, S, testified that she had a
conversation with the appellant M but she could not recall it. The Crown
applied under s. 9(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act  to cross‑examine
S on a previous statement that she had given to the police. It was alleged that
this statement was inconsistent with the evidence that she gave at the trial.
In her statement to the police, S said that M told her he had killed “a snitch”
who had put four people in jail and that he was being paid for the killing.

Following a voir dire, the trial judge
initially rejected the Crown’s application to cross‑examine S, but,
subsequently, after reconsideration, he reversed himself and decided to permit
a cross-examination of the “adverse witness”, limited to those portions of her
statement which pertained to conversations with the accused M. S was
cross-examined before the jury in relation to the statement. Again she said she
could not recall making the statement to the police, or if she made the
statement whether or not it was true.

The Court of Appeal unanimously held that the
trial judge had erred in permitting Crown counsel to cross-examine S concerning
the statement. The Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge was in error
in ruling that the witness could be cross-examined by the Crown as an adverse
witness.

[Page 589]

The majority of the Court of Appeal having
held that the trial judge was in error in permitting cross-examination of S
under s. 9(2) , went on to hold that the statement of S to the police could
properly be placed before the jury under the doctrine of past recollection
recorded because she had testified that her statement represented what she
believed to be true at the time she gave it even though she said she did not
recollect her conversation with M at the time of the trial. The majority held
that the statement was admissible as probative of the matter asserted in it. It
was on the issue of the admissibility of the statement based on this ground
that Robertson J.A. dissented and on the basis of that dissent the appellants
appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Spence, Pigeon, Beetz and Pratte JJ.: Section 9(2)  of the Canada
Evidence Act  is not concerned with the cross-examination of an adverse
witness. The subsection confers a discretion on a trial judge where the
party producing a witness alleges that the witness has made, at another time, a
written statement inconsistent with the evidence being given at the trial. The
discretion is to permit, without proof that the witness is adverse,
cross-examination as to the statement.

The granting of the Crown’s application was a
matter for the sole discretion of the trial judge and he had adequate grounds
for exercising that discretion as he did. Having granted the application the
Crown was entitled to cross-examine S before the jury. The trial judge was
careful to explain the limited extent to which that cross-examination might be
considered by the jury.

In view of the conclusion that there was no
error on the part of the trial judge in permitting the cross-examination of S
under s. 9(2) , it was unnecessary to express any conclusion respecting the
opinion of the majority of the Court of Appeal as to the legal basis upon which
the statement of S could be placed before the jury and from which opinion
Robertson J.A. dissented.

Section 9(2) of the Evidence Act and the common law relating to the
admissibility of prior inconsistent statements entitled the jury to take into
their consideration the contents of the prior inconsistent statement not only
on the issue of determining credibility of the witness, S, but also in
determining the issues of fact arising in the trial to which the contents of
the prior statement may be relevant. Put another way, once the prior
inconsistent statement has been proven, either through the witness who has made
the statement or by

[Page 590]

other evidence, the contents of the prior
inconsistent statement become evidence before the tribunal of fact in the same
way as the testimony during the trial by the witness in question forms a part
of the record; and it is left to the trier of fact to determine which, if
either, of the statements by the witness, that is the testimony in court or the
prior statement, sets out the truth partially, totally, or not at all. It is
both an error in law and an offence against common sense to instruct the jury
that the witness’s prior statement, particularly when given in the
circumstances of this case, may be considered by the jury only on the issue as
to credibility of the witness, S, and must be disregarded on the issues of fact
arising in this statement; and more precisely, that the jury must be told that
the prior statement may not be considered by them as proof or even as some
evidence relating to the matters asserted in that statement.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia[1] dismissing, by a
majority, the appellants’ appeals from their convictions on charges of murder.
Appeal dismissed.

T.L. Robertson, D. Acheson and R. Jatko,
for the appellants.

M.R.V. Storrow, for the respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Spence,
Pigeon, Beetz and Pratte JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—The appellants appeal to this Court
pursuant to s. 618(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  upon a
question of law on which Robertson J.A., had dissented in the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia. The majority of that Court dismissed the appellants’
appeals from their convictions on charges of murder.

[Page 591]

The facts are stated in the judgment of Chief
Justice Farris, who delivered the reasons of the majority, and are as follows:

The principal witness for the Crown was
Donald Jordan, a 17-year old boy who is black. His colour is material to the
corroborative evidence. He testified that on the night of February 16th, 1975,
he lived at 5195 Hoy Street in Vancouver, the residence of one Kathy St. Germaine and her five
children, and one Eddie Wilson. On this particular evening Jordan was at home babysitting the five
St. Germaine children. At about 9:00 or 10:00 p.m. the appellant McInroy came to the house to see Kathy
St. Germaine and came in for a visit. During the visit McInroy told Jordan that Garnet Cameron had “snitched”
on somebody. Jordan had known
Cameron for some ten years. McInroy asked Jordan if he would go with him to the house where he believed Cameron to
be to assist in getting him out of the house because he knew that Cameron was
scared and would not come out of the house alone. Jordan agreed to go. Before they left McInroy went into the kitchen where
there was a crossbow hanging in an open cupboard in plain view. He asked Jordan whether there were any arrows and Jordan produced some. McInroy took the
arrows and the bow outside and fired two of the arrows into a shed outside the
back door. The arrows were yellow and red with red feathers.

At about 10:30 p.m. Jordan and McInroy left the
premises at Hoy Street; McInroy
carried the cross-bow and Jordan carried the arrows and some wine. At that time Jordan was wearing blue and white shoes,
green pants, white shirt and a brown long jacket. They drove in a black Ford to
premises known as The Dairy Queen at Lakewood and Hastings in Burnaby. They parked in a parking stall and
after a short while another man came to the car. McInroy got out of the car
with the cross-bow. He introduced this person by the name of Eddie to Jordan. The person was the appellant Rouse.

After some conversation the three of them
left the Dairy Queen in the car and went to another parking lot on Lakewood. They then went to McInroy’s place
with a bottle of wine and the cross-bow and quiver of arrows and spent about a
half to three-quarters of an hour there. They left McInroy’s apartment, taking
with them the cross-bow and the arrows and went to Rouse’s apartment which was
located across the street from McInroy’s. After a short time there they got
into a blue Plymouth car, Rouse driving, McInroy in the front seat and Jordan
in the back seat. They endeavoured to figure out a way to get Cameron out of
the house where they believed him to be. The three of them concocted a story

[Page 592]

that Jordan was to tell to Cameron to
persuade him to come outside.

They proceeded to Cameron’s house where he
was with Linda Colwell. Jordan went in and told Cameron the concocted story
with the result that Cameron came outside. There Cameron was confronted by
McInroy and Rouse. McInroy pointed the cross-bow at him and asked him what he
had told the police and Cameron replied that he had no other choice. Finally
the four of them proceeded in the Plymouth car to the house on Hoy Street to
check on the children. After doing so Jordan asked if he had to go too and
McInroy said he did.

They then left in the car with Cameron on
the floor in the back and with either McInroy or Rouse pointing the cross-bow
at him. They proceeded to a location on Tillicum Road in Burnaby, went up to
the railroad tracks and parked for a few minutes to have a conversation. They
then forced Cameron out of the car, who at this time was dressed only in his
shorts, McInroy having previously told him to take off his clothes. McInroy
told Cameron to lie on the ground. Rouse moved the car because he said he
didn’t want to get blood on it. McInroy then fired an arrow into Cameron’s
neck. He got up and McInroy kicked him and he fell down. McInroy loaded another
arrow and shot it into Cameron’s side. Cameron stumbled around and fell into
the ditch, where he was subsequently found dead.

The three men, Jordan, McInroy and Rouse,
then drove off. They threw out Cameron’s clothes from the car and after taking
Cameron’s papers out of his wallet, threw it out the window. The cross-bow was
taken apart and also thrown out.

They proceeded to Rouse’s house, spent some
time there, and then drove to a bootlegger’s where they bought some whisky
before returning to the Hoy Street house where the witness Kathy
St. Germaine by this time was with Eddie Wilson.

Mrs. St. Germaine was called as a witness
by the Crown. Her testimony leading to the application made by Crown counsel to
the trial judge is described by Chief Justice Farris as follows:

Mrs. St. Germaine, a woman of thirty
years of age, testified that on February 16th, 1975, she was living at 5195 Hoy
Street with her five small children; her sister Maureen Young, Ronnie Jordan,
his brother Donnie Jordan and Eddie Wilson. She said that on the evening of
February 16th she went to a moving picture show

[Page 593]

with one Richard Jackson and left Donnie
Jordan at home babysitting. She arrived home from the theatre at 1:30 a.m. and
found only the small children there. Eddie Wilson came in about two o’clock and
Donald Jordan and McInroy came in about 2:30 a.m. She testified that she had a
conversation with Howie McInroy in the kitchen but she couldn’t recall it.
Following the conversation she went for a ride with McInroy in a station wagon
and took with them on the ride a brown paper bag and somewhere between Kingsway
and Rupert Street, on the instruction of McInroy, she threw the bag out the
window. Subsequently, she took the police to the location where she threw out
the bag. She denied any knowledge of the contents of it.

It was at this stage that Crown counsel
applied under s. 9(2) of the Evidence Act to cross-examine the witness
St. Germaine on a previous statement that she had given to the police. It
was alleged that this statement was inconsistent with the evidence that she had
given at the trial. In the statement she said that when she and Howie were out
in the kitchen he told her that he had killed “a snitch” who had put four
people in gaol. He also said that he was being paid for doing it. On the voir
dire and on her evidence in the presence of the jury, Mrs. St. Germaine
claimed she could not recall making these statements.

Section 9 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. E-10, provides as follows:

9. (1) A party producing a witness shall
not be allowed to impeach his credit by general evidence of bad character, but
if the witness, in the opinion of the court, proves adverse, such party may
contradict him by other evidence, or, by leave of the court, may prove that the
witness made at other times a statement inconsistent with his present
testimony; but before such last mentioned proof can be given the circumstances
of the supposed statement, sufficient to designate the particular occasion,
shall be mentioned to the witness, and he shall be asked whether or not he did
make such statement.

(2) Where the party producing a witness
alleges that the witness made at other times a statement in writing, or reduced
to writing, inconsistent with his present testimony, the court may, without proof
that the witness is adverse, grant leave to that party to cross‑examine
the witness as to the statement and the court may consider such cross‑examination
in determining whether in the opinion of the court the witness is adverse.

[Page 594]

The procedure to be followed in respect of an
application under s. 9(2)  has been recommended by Chief Justice Culliton
in Regina v. Milgaard[2], at
p. 221:

(1) Counsel should advise the Court that he
desires to make an application under s. (2) of the Canada Evidence Act .

(2) When the Court is so advised, the Court
should direct the jury to retire.

(3) Upon retirement of the jury, counsel
should advise the learned trial Judge of the particulars of the application and
produce for him the alleged statement in writing, or the writing to which the
statement has been reduced.

(4) The learned trial Judge should read the
statement, or writing, and determine whether, in fact, there is an
inconsistency between such statement or writing and the evidence the witness
has given in Court. If the learned trial Judge decides there is no
inconsistency, then that ends the matter. If he finds there is an
inconsistency, he should call upon counsel to prove the statement or writing.

(5) Counsel should then prove the
statement, or writing. This may be done by producing the statement or writing
to the witness. If the witness admits the statement, or the statement reduced
to writing, such proof would be sufficient. If the witness does not so admit,
counsel then could provide the necessary proof by other evidence.

(6) If the witness admits making the
statement, counsel for the opposing party should have the right to
cross-examine as to the circumstances under which the statement was made. A
similar right to cross-examine should be granted if the statement is proved by
other witnesses. It may be that he will be able to establish that there were
circumstances which would render it improper for the learned trial Judge to
permit the cross‑examination, notwithstanding the apparent
inconsistencies. The opposing counsel, too, should have the right to call
evidence as to factors relevant to obtaining the statement, for the purpose of
attempting to show that cross-examination should not be permitted.

(7) The learned trial Judge should then
decide whether or not he will permit the cross‑examination. If so, the
jury should be recalled.

This procedure was followed by the trial judge
in the present case. A voir dire was held during which Mrs.
St. Germaine gave evidence. In consid-

[Page 595]

ering this evidence it is significant that Mrs.
St. Germaine’s statement to the police was given on February 22, 1975. The
trial, at which she gave evidence, occurred only about seven months later,
between September 29 and October 6 of the same year.

What had led to the application to cross-examine
Mrs. St. Germaine were the answers which she gave when being examined by
counsel for the Crown:

Q. Did you have a conversation with Donnie
Jordan and Howard McInroy?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you recall what that conversation
was?

A. No, I don’t.

Q. All right. Did there come a time when
you went into the kitchen?

A. Yes.

Q. Who entered the kitchen with you?

A. Howard McInroy.

Q. Howard McInroy?

A. Yes.

Q. Was Donnie Jordan present in the
kitchen?

A. No.

Q. Did you have a conversation with Howie
McInroy in the kitchen?

A. Yes.

Q. Would you tell the court what
conversation you had with him?

A. I don’t recall.

Q. Can you recall any of it?

A. No.

The following extracts from her evidence given
on the voir dire are of importance:

Q. Mrs. St. Germain, do you recall
giving a statement to Constable Ross of the Burnaby R.C.M.P. on the 22nd of
February, 1975 in the morning?

A. Yes.

Q. I am showing you a statement—or a
document consisting of eleven pages. I would ask you first if you recognize the
document. Would you examine that—all eleven pages, please?

[Page 596]

At this point you could just look through
the document and see if your initials appear on all of those pages. Does your
initials appear on each of those pages?

A. (Witness nods)

THE COURT: Would you answer please, madam?

A. Yes, it does.

MR. ROWAN:

Q. And does your signature appear on the
bottom of the eleventh page?

A. Yes, it does.

Q. Just hold on to that still, please. Now,
yesterday you will recall that you stated that you went into the kitchen in the
early morning of February 17th, and Howie was in the kitchen of your home with
you—do you recall giving that evidence yesterday?

A. Yes.

Q. And you gave evidence that you did not
recall the contents or the substance of the conversation—do you recall giving
that evidence yesterday?

A. Yes.

Q. And I would ask you if you would read
the first page, particularly the paragraph:

“Last Monday morning about 2:30 a.m. or
thereafter…”

—would you just read that now, please.

Now, would you also read the paragraph that
starts at the bottom of the page commencing:

“Later Howie and I went out…” and down to
the middle of the second page. Now, does that—reading those paragraphs that you
read, does that assist your memory whatsoever in being able to tell us what
conversation took place in the kitchen?

A. No.

Q. Pardon me?

A. No.

Q. Alright. I direct your attention
specifically to the top of page two, and particularly the phrase:

“Howie told me that he had killed
somebody”.

Now, you read that—I just want to ask you
about the statement when you made it—whose handwriting is it in?

[Page 597]

A. I don’t know—Constable Ross, I think.

Q. You do recall giving a statement to
Constable Ross and reading it over, and signing it?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, could you tell us why you don’t
remember now the statement:

“Howie told me that he had killed
somebody”.

A. I don’t know why—I don’t remember.

THE COURT: I’m sorry, I cannot hear you.

A. I don’t know why—I don’t remember. When
I am going back on the conversation in the house, I can’t remember what
conversation I had because I talked to Donny and I talked to Howie and I talked
to Eddie Wilson, and I don’t remember now looking back on it.

MR. ROWAN:

Q. And did Howie say words to you on that
occasion that he had killed somebody or not?

A. I don’t know.

Q. You don’t know. Do you recall saying
anything to Howie about—“I don’t want to hear about it”?

A. I don’t recall that.

Q. You don’t remember—

THE COURT: I’m sorry, I can’t hear you.

A. I don’t recall that either.

MR. ROWAN:

Q. Do you recall Howie on that occasion
saying to you that it was some snitch that was the victim of the crime?

A. No, I don’t remember Howie saying it.

Q. Do you recall in the conversation, any
reference to the weapon being a cross-bow?

A. Not in that particular conversation.

…

MR. ROWAN:

Q. Back to your statement—the one you have
before you, it is clearly said there in that statement:

“Howie told me that he had killed
somebody.”

didn’t you—you clearly said that in that
statement?

A. Yes, that’s correct.

Q. Now, was that or was that not true? You
are under oath now. Was that or was that not true that Howie told you he had
killed somebody?

[Page 598]

A. I don’t know.

Q. You don’t know because you forget?

A. I don’t remember the conversation I had
with Howie.

Q. But you can remember this very simple
thing—whether or not he told you that he had killed somebody?

A. No, I cannot remember him saying that.

Q. Do you recall him saying as follows:

“He went on to tell me that it was some
snitch.”

You don’t recall that either, do you?

A. No, I don’t.

Q. Where did you get that information?

A. In the conversation of the three of us,
I think—Donny Jordan—

THE COURT: I am sorry—the conversation of
the three of us? Is that what you said?

A. Donny Jordan and Howie McInroy and I.

Q. Donny Jordan, Howie McInroy and
yourself.

A. Yes.

Q. I see, and that’s when you learned about
this word ‘snitch’—is that the idea? Is that what you are saying? Or that this
snitch was—

A. Yes.

Q. From Howie and Donny—when you were
talking to them?

A. Yes.

MR. ROWAN:

Q. I’m sorry, I didn’t hear that question
and answer.

A. Yes.

THE COURT: When she was talking to them, I
put it to her—Howie and Donny, she heard this expression.

MR. ROWAN:

Q. And that was in the living room then,
was it? On the morning of Monday the 17th?

A. Yes.

Q. So it was known at that time that
someone had been killed?

A. I don’t know if at that time—

Q. Well, obviously in that conversation the
word snitch was used, and it must have been used in some connection. I suggest
to you it was used in connection with the death of this man, Cameron.

A. Not necessarily.

[Page 599]

Q. Alright. What other explanation do you
have?

A. I have no explanation except that they
were talking about Garnet Cameron, and the word snitch came up, but I don’t
remember whether at that time anything was said about anybody being killed—

THE COURT: I cannot hear you, madam.

A. I said at that time I don’t remember any
conversation about him being killed.

Q. About who being killed?

A. Garnet Cameron.

Q. Well, didn’t you just say a moment ago, with
reference to the snitch that Garnet Cameron was one and the same person?
Perhaps I misheard you. Tell me if I heard you properly.

THE COURT: Read back the answer will you,
Madam Reporter.

(REPORTER COMPLIED)

MR. ROWAN:

Q. Alright. So, this statement that Howie
told you he killed somebody is something that you would remember, isn’t it?
That’s something that a person cannot forget.

A. Well, I cannot remember him telling me
that.

Q. Well, how can you forget it? You
obviously said it here on February 22nd, and it—you obviously remembered it on
the 22nd of February did you not? Did you remember it on February 22nd?

A. I don’t know—it’s in the statement, so
at that time I had heard many things, and it was all very confusing—I don’t
remember.

Q. Was what you said on the statement of
February 22nd:

“Howie told me that he had killed somebody”

—untrue? Were you lying in that statement?

A. No, I wasn’t lying.

Q. Then it was true when you said it then,
but you just don’t remember it now?

A. I don’t remember saying it in the
statement.

Q. You wouldn’t have lied in the statement
though?

A. No, I wouldn’t have lied.

Q. Would you turn over to page seven?

[Page 600]

THE COURT: That might be marked for
identification on this voir dire.

MR. ROWAN: The witness has it. Perhaps it
could be marked after, my Lord.

THE COURT: Alright.

MR. ROWAN:

Q. Now, towards the bottom of the page when
you were being questioned—there is a following question:

“Q. Did Howie say anything about being paid
for the killing?

A. Yes, he did. I don’t remember what he
said, but he told me that he was getting paid for it.”

Now, do you recall being asked that
question by Constable Ross and that being reduced to writing?

A. No, I don’t, I don’t recall.

Q. You don’t recall that at all, but that
is your signature at the bottom of the page?

MR. JATKO: It is not a signature.

MR. ROWAN:

Q. I’m sorry, your initials at the bottom
of the page?

A. Yes.

Q. And the next question:

“Q. Did he say how much?

A. No.”

Do you recall being asked that question by
Constable Ross?

A. No, I don’t.

Q. You don’t recall giving that answer.

A. No.

Q. Now, after—assuming you had been asked
that question, do you now recall whether or not Howie said anything about being
paid for this killing?

A. No, I don’t.

Q. Now, is it—you just don’t recall having
been asked those questions and having given those answers at all?

A. No, I don’t.

Q. I would just like you to have a look at
the—have a look at page ten, the question there—a question was put to you at
the top of that page:

“Q. Did they tell you where the crossbow
and arrows had gone?

[Page 601]

A. Howie told me the crossbow was broken
into pieces and thrown away. He didn’t say anything about the arrows. This was
on Sunday night or early Monday morning.”

Now, do you recall being asked that question
and giving that answer?

A. No, I don’t.

Q. You don’t remember that at all? You may
have been asked that question and you may have given that answer, but you just
plainly don’t remember it?

A. That’s right.

Q. Now, did Howie ever tell you about the
crossbow being broken into pieces?

A. I don’t know.

Q. And if so, you don’t remember—is that
right?

A. That’s right.

Q. And then at the bottom of page eleven,
is written as follows:

“I have read this statement and it is true
and correct.”

You read that and signed that, did you not?

A. Yes.

These questions and answers are very similar to
those which are cited in the Milgaard case, at p. 218. The Court in
that case held that cross-examination of a witness pursuant to s. 9(2)  of
the Canada Evidence Act  was proper in respect of an eleven page
statement which she had given to the police, which she admitted having given
and which she admitted she had signed.

Following the voir dire, the trial judge
in the present case initially rejected the Crown’s application to cross-examine
Mrs. St. Germaine, but, subsequently, after reconsideration, he granted
the application and Mrs. St. Germaine was cross-examined generally along
the line of that pursued on the examination on the voir dire. He said:

I have concluded that I have exercised my
discretion incorrectly, and I tell you now that I propose to reverse myself,
and if Crown counsel wishes, I will permit a cross‑examination of the
adverse witness, limited to her statement which was marked Exhibit “B” in the
voir dire, to those portions of her statement only which pertain to
conversations with the accused McInroy.

[Page 602]

I do not propose that the statement, as it
is marked now, will go before the jury, and I simply propose that the Crown may
put the statement to the witness, ask her if it refreshes her memory, and if
she says, as she did yesterday, that it does not, then I will permit the Crown
to put those portions to the witness pertaining to the conversations with
McInroy, and if it does not refresh her memory, as it did not yesterday, she
will simply have to be asked if it is true or not, and she will have to give
whatever answer she gives.

Mrs. St. Germaine was cross-examined before
the jury in relation to the statement. Again she said she could not recall
making the statement to the police, that the appellant McInroy told her about
the killing, about his being paid for the killing or as to who was with him
when they had killed “the snitch”. At the conclusion of her
examination-in-chief she gave the following answers to the following questions:

Q. Now, Mrs. St. Germaine, would you
look over to the very bottom of the last page, that’s 11. Would you read the
words that are just before your signature, and just after the last answer on
that page. Would you read that to the jury, please?

A. “I have read this statement and it is
true and correct.”

Q. And you read that particular statement
there, “I have read this statement and it is true and correct,” and you signed
your name, did you not?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Now, in any of the questions, or in any
of the answers I have read to you, were you lying?

A. No.

Q. If you weren’t lying, Mrs.
St. Germaine, then you were telling the truth, weren’t you, at that time?

A. I was telling what I believed at that
time.

Q. And you believe it to be the truth?

A. I’m sorry, I didn’t—

Q. And you believed it to be the truth?

A. Yes.

The statement to the police itself was not put
in evidence.

In his charge to the jury the trial judge said:

Now, as to evidence concerning what she
said in the statement, I must ask you to bear in mind that the only evidence
you can consider from her is the evidence she

[Page 603]

gave in this courtroom. She has had
questions and answers put to her that were made at some earlier time and she
has, in most cases, rejected them in the sense that she says she simply cannot
remember them. Those questions and answers put to her which she could not
remember, do not constitute evidence because she has not accepted what has been
said to her, and I must expressly direct you that those portions of that prior
statement are not to be taken as evidence of the truth of the statements
contained therein, but merely serve to test her credibility as a witness, so
once again I repeat that in light of her continued inability to remember those
questions and answers, they do not form part of her evidence and accordingly
are not to be taken as evidence of the truth of what is contained therein, but
are only to be considered by you in testing or determining her credibility as a
witness.

The Court of Appeal unanimously held that the
trial judge had erred in permitting Crown counsel to cross-examine Mrs.
St. Germaine concerning the statement. The reason given by Chief Justice
Farris is as follows:

In my view, the Judge was in error in
ruling that the witness could be cross-examined by the Crown as an adverse
witness. At the stage when the application was made initially to cross-examine
on the basis of s. 9(2) , the evidence of the witness can be summarized as
follows:

(1) That McInroy and Jordan had returned to
her house at approximately the same time as Jordan said they did.

(2) That she had a conversation in the
kitchen with McInroy.

(3) That she had gone for a ride with
McInroy and he had instructed her to throw a paper bag out of the window.

There could be no reason for the Crown to
challenge these three items of evidence. The Crown’s purported purpose in using
the previous statement was on the issue of her credibility. But credibility was
not in issue. Mrs. St. Germaine had testified to nothing damaging to the
Crown’s case. She had simply disclaimed any present relevant testimonial
knowledge of the conversation with McInroy. In such a case a prior inconsistent
statement of facts favourable to the proponent of the witness may not be used
to impeach her.

With great respect, I am not in agreement that
there was error in this case on the part of the trial judge. The basis for the
Court’s conclusion that

[Page 604]

there was error is stated in the first sentence
of the passage quoted “in ruling that the witness could be cross-examined by
the Crown as an adverse witness”. Following this statement reference is made to
the evidence given by Mrs. St. Germaine prior to questions and answers
leading to the Crown’s application. Her earlier evidence was not adverse to the
Crown’s position. The inference is that this prevents her from being regarded
as an adverse witness.

Section 9(2)  is not concerned with the
cross-examination of an adverse witness. That subsection confers a
discretion on a trial judge where the party producing a witness alleges that
the witness has made, at another time, a written statement inconsistent with
the evidence being given at the trial. The discretion is to permit, without
proof that the witness is adverse, cross-examination as to the statement.

The task of the trial judge was to determine
whether Mrs. St. Germaine’s testimony was inconsistent with her statement
to the police. In my opinion he was properly entitled to conclude that it was.
At trial Mrs. St. Germaine swore that she could not recall any part of the
conversation with McInroy in the kitchen of her house on the night of the
killing, although only some seven months earlier she had given to the police,
in her written statement, the details of that conversation, including McInroy’s
admission that he was the murderer. If her statement at trial as to her
recollection was true, inconsistency would not arise, but the trial judge saw
Mrs. St. Germaine and heard her evidence on the voir dire. It was
quite open to him to conclude that she was lying about her recollection and to
form his own conclusions as to why she was refusing to testify as to her true
recollection. Chief Justice Farris says in terms that “the trial judge clearly
did not believe her when she said she had a lack of recall”. This being so
there was evidence of an inconsistency between what she said at the trial, i.e.
that she had no recollection of a conversation, and what was contained in
her written statement, i.e. a detailed recollection of it.

[Page 605]

In Wolf v. The Queen[3], this Court upheld a conviction for
perjury against a person who had been the complainant on a charge of unlawfully
causing bodily harm. He had given a signed statement to the police in
connection with that charge. At the preliminary hearing he said that he could
not remember the events described in the statement. The issue before this Court
was as to whether his evidence at the preliminary hearing was given “with
intent to mislead” within s. 120  of the Criminal Code . This Court
held that the case was not one of mere error, honestly made, but that the
circumstances justified the conclusion that the failure of memory was dishonest
and deliberately asserted to prevent the Court from arriving at a decision on
credible evidence.

The granting of the Crown’s application was a
matter for the sole discretion of the trial judge and in my view he had
adequate grounds for exercising that discretion as he did. Having granted the
application the Crown was entitled to cross-examine Mrs. St. Germaine
before the jury. The trial judge was careful to explain, in the passage I have
already quoted, the limited extent to which that cross-examination might be
considered by the jury.

The majority of the Court of Appeal, having held
that the trial judge was in error in permitting cross-examination of Mrs.
St. Germaine under s. 9(2) , went on to hold that the statement of
Mrs. St. Germaine to the police could properly be placed before the jury
under the doctrine described by Wigmore as “past recollection recorded” because
she had testified that her statement represented what she believed to be true
at the time she gave it even though she said she did not recollect her
conversation with McInroy at the time of the trial. Reference was made to
English authority permitting the receiving in evidence of a memorandum by a
witness who, by the aid of it, can only recall that some event occurred and
that he made a truthful memorandum of it. The majority held that the statement
was admissible as probative of the matter asserted in it.

[Page 606]

It was on the issue of the admissibility of the
statement based on this ground that Robertson J.A. dissented and it is on the
basis of that dissent that the appellants appealed to this Court.

In view of the conclusion which I have already
expressed that there was no error on the part of the trial judge in permitting
the cross-examination of Mrs. St. Germaine under s. 9(2) , it is
unnecessary to express any conclusion respecting the opinion of the majority of
the Court of Appeal as to the legal basis upon which the statement of Mrs.
St. Germaine could be placed before the jury and from which opinion
Robertson J.A. dissented.

In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.

ESTEY J.—I have had the opportunity of reading
the reasons for judgment by my brother, Mart-land J., and with respect concur
in his conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed. I differ only from the
position taken by Martland J. in that, in my view of s. 9 of the Evidence
Act and of the common law relating to the admissibility of prior
inconsistent statements, the jury is entitled, and should have been so
instructed here, to take into their consideration the contents of the prior
inconsistent statement not only on the issue of determining credibility of the
witness, St. Germaine, but also in determining the issues of fact arising
in the trial to which the contents of the prior statement may be relevant. Put
another way, once the prior inconsistent statement has been proven, either
through the witness who has made the statement or by other evidence, the
contents of the prior inconsistent statement become evidence before the
tribunal of fact in the same way as the testimony during the trial by the
witness in question forms a part of the record; and it is left to the trier of
fact to determine which, if either, of the statements by the witness, that is
the testimony in court or the prior statement, sets out the truth partially,
totally, or not at all. It is in my respectful view both an error in law and an
offence against common sense to instruct the jury that the witness’s prior
statement, particularly when given in the circumstances of this case, may be
considered by the jury only on the issue as to credibility of the witness,
St. Germaine, and must be disregarded on the issues of fact arising in
this statement; and, more precisely,

[Page 607]

that the jury must be told that the prior
statement may not be considered by them as proof or even as some evidence
relating to the matters asserted in that statement.

My brother, Martland J., has set out the salient
facts and therefore, for my purposes, only the following short portion of the
evidence of the witness, St. Germaine, need be reproduced:

Q. Did you have a conversation with Howie
McInroy in the kitchen?

A. Yes.

Q. Would you tell the court what conversation
you had with him?

A. I don’t recall.

Q. Can you recall any of it?

A. No.

together with:

Q. Now, Mrs. St. Germaine, would you
look over to the very bottom of the last page, that’s 11. Would you read the
words that are just after the last answer on that page. Would you read that to
the jury, please?

A. “I have read this statement and it is
true and correct.”

Q. And you read that particular statement
there, “I have read this statement and it is true and correct”, and you signed
your name, did you not?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Now, in any of the questions, or in any
of the answers I have read to you, were you lying?

A. No.

Q. If you weren’t lying, Mrs.
St. Germaine, then you were telling the truth, weren’t you, at that time?

A. I was telling what I believed at that
time.

Q. And you believed it to be the truth?

A. I’m sorry, I didn’t—

Q. And you believed it to be the truth?

A. Yes.

The rule is of long standing in the law of
evidence that documentary evidence will be admitted through a witness in the
witness box who, although the witness cannot recall the substance of the
document or perhaps the precise event

[Page 608]

described or recorded therein, is able to swear
to its truth at the time of the trial. Such documents may take the form of
business records or deeds where the witness has either made the entry in the
document or signed the instrument, acknowledging execution or other event.
Where time has elapsed or where the witness in his daily life participated in a
large number of such events or transactions, it is entirely unrealistic to
expect a witness to say, or indeed to believe him if he did say, that upon
examining the instrument he was able to recall his entry or the event. The law
in acknowledging these realities has long recognized the procedure whereby the witness
may incorporate in his testimony the contents of such deeds or documents when
he adopts those contents as part of his testimony.

Here, however, we do not have a witness who
adopts the contents of the prior statement signed by her; she simply acknowledges
the fact that she signed the statement but has not (the Court of Appeal
respectfully to the contrary) adopted it in the witness box as being the truth
as she now sees it. The stone wall erected by the witness between herself and
the questioner is epitomized in the following excerpt from the transcript:

Q. Can you read the next question:

“Q. Did Howie say anything about being paid
for the killing”—or “this killing”?

A. Yes he did. I don’t remember what he
said but he told me that he was getting paid for it.”

Were you asked that question and did you
give that answer?

A. I don’t ever remember being asked that
question.

Q. If you had given that answer, would that
answer be true?

A. I don’t know.

For whatever reason, the witness clearly
indicates that she does not adopt the prior statement although she acknowledges
signing it, and indeed initialing every page; her simple recourse is that she
doesn’t know. Robertson J.A., dissenting in the Court of Appeal of British
Columbia, concluded that the statement not being adopted in the testimony of
the witness St. Germaine by her expres-

[Page 609]

sion of belief in it, cannot be admitted. He
would have directed a new trial on the simple ground that the admission of the
statement offends the basic rule of evidence that “no evidence is receivable in
any Court except that given upon oath or affirmation”. Some authorities have
indeed gone further and rejected prior sworn statements on the simple principle
that admissible evidence is only that which is given under oath in court. (R.
v. Golder[4].)

The majority of the Court of Appeal also
concluded that the prior statements of the witness St. Germaine should not
have been admitted in evidence pursuant to s. 9(2)  of the Canada
Evidence Act  even for the limited purpose of determining the credibility of
the witness by the jury. The majority reached this conclusion because the
evidence of the witness was not hostile to the case for the Crown and the
credibility of the witness was not in issue. The majority went on to find the statement
to be admissible, however, under the doctrine of past recollection recorded.

The prior recorded statement of the witness was
here admitted into evidence following the procedure prescribed in s. 9(2) 
of the Canada Evidence Act . The procedure followed at trial here was
described in Regina v. Milgaard by Culliton C.J.S.[5] In refusing leave (1972) 4 C.C.C. (2d)
566, this Court declined to express “a view as to whether, before granting the
leave to cross-examine provided for in s. 9(2)  of the Canada Evidence
Act , the Court is required to conduct a voir dire as to the
circumstances in which the statement in writing was obtained”. In my respectful
view, the analysis of s. 9(2)  by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal is both
correct in law and practical in its result. The trial judge followed such
practice here and in doing so, correctly applied s. 9(2) . The question now
directly raised is what is the effect to be given in law to the contents of the
prior inconsistent statement made by the witness, St. Germaine. Section
9(2)  was added to the Canada Evidence Act  in 1968 (1968-69 (Can.),
c. 14, s. 2).

[Page 610]

It comes into the Act without legislative
history. The subsection has not been subjected to judicial analysis to my
knowledge from the side of the question raised in this appeal. The subsection,
while providing a procedural mechanism for the admission of the prior
contradictory statement, is silent as to the substantive use, if any, to which
such evidence may be put. Taken by itself and in isolation from the judicial
and academic debates of the past, the section in my view supports the
simple interpretation that, given their plain meaning, the words adopted by
Parliament reveal an intention that the evidence is, upon compliance with the
prescribed procedure, admitted to the record for application by the tribunal in
the same way as other evidence and without any specific limitation.

In other provisions in the Canada Evidence
Act , as for example s. 30(1) , evidence of a particular kind or from a
specific source is made admissible without any assertion as to the use, limited
or unlimited, to which it may on proper admission be put. Such provisions have
not been construed by the courts so as to curtail the usefulness or the extent
of the application of such evidence. It remains then to be seen whether
s. 9(2)  must, in its proper interpretation, be influenced by the
terminology of s. 9(1)  and perhaps by its judicial interpretation in the
past. Subsection (1) creates a two-stage process:

(a) Should the witness, in the opinion of
the Court, ‘prove adverse’ to the party ‘producing’ the witness, such party may
contradict the witness by ‘other evidence’; and,

(b) ‘By leave of the Court’ that party may
also prove prior statements inconsistent with the witness’s testimony, after
the witness is acquainted with the prior statements and the circumstances in
which made and after the witness has been asked whether or not the witness made
such statement.

(Notwithstanding the presence of “or” in the
subsection prior to the reference to the need for the leave of the court
relating to the prior inconsistent statements, it is clear that in subs. (1)
all this must follow a determination that the witness is adverse. The
transposition or interchangeability of “and” and “or” has plagued legislative
draftsmen before.

[Page 611]

(Vide Maxwell, The Interpretation of
Statutes (12th ed.) p. 232. Vide also Greenough v. Eccles[6], (per Williams J.
p. 802.)) The only link between the two subsections of s. 9 is
the concluding provision in subs. (2) enabling the Court to take into
consideration in the process of forming an opinion as to whether a witness is
‘adverse’ under subs. (1), any cross‑examination permitted under subs.
(2).

Section 9(1)  of the Canada Evidence Act  is
the present day version of s. 22 of the Common Law Procedure Act of
the United Kingdom, 1854, and has formed part of the laws of evidence in
criminal proceedings in this country since its enactment in 1869 in the Criminal
Law Procedure Act (S.C. 32-33 Vict., c. 29, s. 68). Since the
passage of this legislation, the courts have been repeatedly engaged in
attempts to determine whether the statute simply codified the then existing
common law or whether the statute went further and established additional
rights of cross-examination and new sources of substantive evidence. It is at
least clear that where a witness is declared to be adverse and has denied the
truth of the prior statement, the prior statement may be admitted into evidence
for the purpose of determining the credibility of the witness. However, the
effect of the section as it has been interpreted is to allow the statement
to be put before the trier of fact for the limited purpose of negating the
witness’s credibility so that in substance, the jury is left with nothing if
they believe the prior statement was in fact made by the witness and that it
countermands the testimony given in open court. Rex v. Leonard Harris[7], at p. 149, which is discussed
in Rex v. Kadeshevitz[8], per
Riddell J. at p. 219; R. v. Golder, supra, p. 457; R. v.
Duckworth[9]. In
this Court the effect of s. 9(1)  was discussed by Kerwin J., as he then
was, in Deacon v. R.[10], at
p. 534:

The fact that the sketch was put in as an
exhibit, and therefore the writing, does not take the exhibit out of the
category of something merely going to the credibility of the witness and raise
it to the status of something that as

[Page 612]

against the accused is to be taken as
evidence of the truth of the statements contained in the writing. A contrary
proposition would be entirely foreign to our criminal law.

Rand J. spoke to the same effect at pp. 537-538:

That such statements generally are limited
to credibility and cannot be used as evidence of the truth of the facts to
which they relate, is well established: R. v. Dibble,
1 Cr. App. R. 155; R. v. Harris, 20 Cr. App. R. 144; R.
v. Francis & Barber, [1929] 3 D.L.R. 593, 51 Can. C.C. 343. It is
quite true that it may be difficult to dissociate the matters of such
statements from the facts brought before the jury by the witness and to nullify
the influence they may have on the minds of the jurors in dealing with the
evidence as a whole; but anything short of this would expose a person to a
fabricated account of events, too dangerous to risk. But the whole field of
cross-examination, in the discretion of the court, is opened and the matters of
the statement can thus be brought within the test of the testimonial response
of the witness. This might be taken as a reason for leaving all the facts,
including the statement, to the consideration of the jury, but the long
experience of the courts is against it.

Twenty years prior to the introduction of the Common
Law Procedure Act, Denman C.J. in Wright v. Beckett[11], at p. 419, discussed the
common law rule under which a witness on being found hostile by the court,
could be cross-examined by the party calling the witness, and then observed in
connection with prior inconsistent statements:

The other danger is, that the statement,
which is admissible only to contradict the witness, may be taken as substantive
proof in the cause. But this danger equally arises from the contradiction of an
adverse witness: it is met by the Judge pointing out the distinction to the
jury, and warning them not to be misled. It is not so abstruse but that Judges
may explain it, and juries perceive its reasonableness; and it is probable that
they most commonly discard entirely the evidence of him who has stated
falsehoods, whether sworn or unsworn.

Following the Common Law Procedure Act and
its criminal law parallel, the courts continued to apply the rule of Wright
v. Beckett, supra, without any critical analysis of what is now
s. 9(1) ;

[Page 613]

although at least one judge in Greenough v.
Eccles supra, acknowledged that the status of prior inconsistent statements
was “to some extent an unsettled point” at common law. (Williams J. at
p. 802).

Before dealing in detail with the phraseology of
s. 9, it may be helpful to consider the basic evidentiary principles. The
primary test of admissibility is, of course, relevance, and as Lord Simon said
in D.P.P. v. Kilbourne[12], at
p. 756: “Evidence is relevant if it is logically probative or disprobative
of some matter which requires proof; or in the negative sense, in the words of
Duff C.J., evidence which has “no real pertinency as to any issue between the
Crown and the accused…” is to be excluded. Picken v. R.[13], at p. 458. In this appeal the
evidence in issue consists of a statement by the witness, St. Germaine,
that the accused had told her:

(a) he had killed somebody;

(b) it was a ‘snitch’ who had put four
people in jail;

and

(c) the accused had been paid to do the
killing.

It must surely pass without debate that such
testimony is relevant and hence, admissible, subject to whatever exclusionary
principles which may apply. The basic exclusionary rule is of course the rule
against hearsay evidence which has been defined by Cross in his textbook on
evidence (4th ed., 1974, at p. 6) as “a statement other than one made by a
person while giving oral evidence in the proceedings”. It has been said by many
learned authors that the exclusionary rule is based upon a denial of an
opportunity to cross-examine the maker of the statement and the absence of the
oath at the time of the making. Vide Phipson on Evidence, 12th ed.,
1976, para. 636, at p. 273 and Cross on Evidence, supra, p.
415. The hearsay rule is generally illustrated in cases where the statement in
question is made by a third party not in the witness box to the witness; hence
the discussion

[Page 614]

in Teper v. The Queen[14], at p. 486 in the judgment of
Lord Normand:

The rule against the admission of hearsay
evidence is fundamental. It is not the best evidence and it is not delivered on
oath. The truthfulness and accuracy of the person whose words are spoken to by
another witness cannot be tested by cross-examination, and the light which his
demeanor would throw on his testimony is lost.

There are many instances where the courts have
ruled out statements by third parties to the witness where the statement has
been recorded and made under oath so that the presence or absence of the oath
on the occasion of the prior statement does not appear to be the critical test;
see for example R. v. Campbell[15]. Here,
however, the speaker of the “hearsay” is indeed in the witness box available
for cross-examination and subject to the scrutiny of the trier of fact. If
anything more need be said, attention could be drawn to several exceptions to
the hearsay rule where necessity, such as the death of the maker of a statement
has led to the invention of a series of exceptional rules. I have in mind dying
declarations, declarations against interest, and the res gestae exception.

Much has been written over the last 50 years on
the proper characterization in the law of evidence of prior inconsistent
statements and the position of these statements under the hearsay rule. In
Arch-bold, Pleading, Evidence & Practice in Criminal Cases (39th
ed., 1976) at pp. 692-3 it is stated:

It is submitted that the rule has been
correctly formulated by Professor Cross: “Express or implied assertions of
persons other than the witness who is testifying, and assertions in documents
produced to the court when no witness is testifying are inadmissible as
evidence of that which is asserted” (Cross, Evidence, 4th ed., p. 387). A
witness’s own previous statements are not excluded in this formulation of the
rule. A statement by witness X when narrated by witness Y may however fall
within the prohibition.

The observations of Lennox J.A. in Rex v.

[Page 615]

Duckworth[16], at p. 253,
are on point:

It has often been said, and might be
repeated in this case: “Once the statements are repeated in Court they cannot
be effaced from the mind of the jury.” It is all true; and no caution, and no
explanation of the law of evidence, that any Judge could give, could make it
otherwise. But, all the same, it is express statutory law that inconsistent
statements of adverse witnesses may be disclosed, and the preponderance of
judicial opinion was only crystallised in the statute, after almost centuries
of discussion and with clear apprehension and full notice and knowledge that
when disclosed it must sometimes happen, and sometimes with a measure of rough
justice too, and none the less, perhaps, because the Judge has learnedly and
laboriously dwelt upon the fine distinction between evidence of the statement
and evidence of the facts stated, that some alert juryman, unlearned in the
law, will say: “I can’t just make it out, the Judge says it’s evidence and
it isn’t evidence, and there was a mighty lot of fuss about it, so it must be
important, but I tell you we know this much anyway, it just fits snugly with
things we all know are true.”

The English Criminal Law Revision Committee,
under the chairmanship of Davies L.J., in its Eleventh Report on Evidence
(General), 1972, at p. 149 observed that the rule permitting the use of
the prior inconsistent statement on the issue of credibility of the witness but
prohibiting the use of the statement for the proof of the matters therein
asserted is “wholly unrealistic and difficult for a jury to appreciate”. The
American judicial view is predominantly to the same effect. In Di Carlo v.
United States[17], Justice
Learned Hand wrote at p. 368 of the situation as it prevailed under the
common law where the court has granted permission to cross-examine upon finding
a witness to be hostile:

Not only may the questions extend to
cross-examination, but, if necessary to bring out the truth, it is entirely
proper to inquire of such a witness whether he has not made contradictory
statements at other times. He is present before the jury, and they may gather
the truth from his whole conduct and bearing, even if it be in respect of
contradictory answers he may have made at other times…

[Page 616]

The possibility that the jury may accept as
the truth the earlier statements in preference to those made upon the stand is
indeed real, but we find no difficulty in it. If, from all that the jury see of
the witness, they conclude that what he says now is not the truth, but what he
said before, they are none the less deciding from what they see and hear of
that person and in court. There is no mythical necessity that the case must be
decided only in accordance with the truth of words uttered under oath in court.

Certiorari was
denied by the United States Supreme Court, 368 U.S. 706. Friendly J., giving
the judgment of the Court in United States v. De Sisto[18] (certiorari denied, 377 U.S. 979)
makes the same point:

The rule limiting the use of prior
statements by a witness subject to cross-examination to their effect on his credibility
has been described by eminent scholars and judges as ‘pious fraud’,
‘artificial’, ‘basically misguided’, ‘mere verbal ritual’, and an anachronism
‘that still impede(s) our pursuit of the truth.’ …The sanctioned ritual seems
peculiarly absurd when a witness who has given damaging testimony on his first
appearance at a trial denies any relevant knowledge on his second; to tell a
jury it may consider the prior testimony as reflecting on the veracity of the
later denial of relevant knowledge but not as the substantive evidence that
alone would be pertinent is a demand for mental gymnastics of which jurors are
happily incapable. Beyond this the orthodox rule defies the dictate of common
sense that ‘The fresher the memory, the fuller and more accurate it is…
Manifestly, this is not to say that when a witness changes his story, the first
version is invariably true and the later is the product of distorted memory,
corruption, false suggestion, intimidation, or appeal to sympathy… [but] the
greater the lapse of time between the event and the trial, the greater the
chance of exposure of the witness to each of these influences.’

It is of course anomalous that a witness may
upon cross-examination contradict his evidence‑in-chief whereupon a jury
or a judge sitting alone will take the evidence of the witness both in chief
and on cross-examination under advisement in ascertaining the truth. However,
if the witness denies a prior proven statement, the trier of fact, according

[Page 617]

to the observations of the Court in Wright v.
Beckett, supra, may, in attempting to discern the truth, make use of the
prior inconsistent statement only in determining whether to believe the
witness’s evidence in court. The trier may then find that the testimony of the
witness given in court is not credible and none of his statements will then be
applied in the determination of the truth.

In Cross on Evidence, supra, the learned
author at pp. 416-7 makes this observation concerning the restricted use of the
prior statement:

The objections to the reception of prior
inconsistent statements as evidence of the facts stated are that the statements
were not made on oath and the witness swears that they are untrue. The court
and jury will generally be well advised to ignore both the statement and the
testimony, but, in rare cases, such as those in which the witness has been “got
at” since he made the statement, there may be excellent reasons for accepting
it as true.

In Wigmore on Evidence, vol. 3A
(Chadbourn rev. 1970) para. 1018(b), after setting out the rule in Deacon
v. R., supra, the author goes to the heart of the issue:

It does not follow, however, that Prior
Self-Contradictions, when admitted, are to be treated as having no affirmative
testimonial value, and that any such credit is to be strictly denied them
in the mind of the tribunal. The only ground for doing so would be the Hearsay
rule. But the theory of the Hearsay rule is that an extrajudicial statement is
rejected because it was made out of Court by an absent person not subject to
cross‑examination (post, 1362). Here, however, by hypothesis the
witness is present and subject to cross-examination. There is ample opportunity
to test him as to the basis for his former statement. The whole purpose of the
Hearsay rule has been already satisfied. Hence there is nothing to prevent the
tribunal from giving such testimonial credit to the extrajudicial statement as
it may seem to deserve. Psychologically of course, the one statement is as
useful to consider as the other; and everyday experience outside of court-rooms
is in accord.

To the same effect, vide Professor E.M.
Morgan, “Hearsay Dangers and the Application of the

[Page 618]

Hearsay Concept” 62 Harv. L. Rev. 177, at
p. 196. As in the case of Wigmore on Evidence, the learned author
goes on to conclude: “Consequently there is no real reason for classifying the
evidence as hearsay”. Finally, McCormick on Evidence (2nd ed. 1972)
joins the almost unanimous parade of legal writers when the author states at
pp. 603-604:

It is hard to escape the view that evidence
of a previous inconsistent statement, when declarant is on the stand to explain
it if he can, has in high degree the safeguards of examined testimony. Allowing
it as substantive evidence pays an added dividend in avoiding the ritual of a
limiting instruction unlikely to be heeded by a jury. Accordingly,
jurisdictions which shy away from admitting prior statements of witnesses
generally may not hesitate to admit when the statement is inconsistent with
already-given testimony.

As I have pointed out, the common law rule
permitted the cross-examination of a witness called by the party if the court
found the witness to be hostile. Such cross-examination included prior
inconsistent statements. At least one authority in the prestatute period considered
the cross-examination to be evidence admissible on the issue of the truth of
the matters asserted in the prior statement rather than being merely admissible
on the limited issue of credibility of the witness. Chief Baron Pollock, with
the concurrence of Baron Parke, stated, in discussing the common law rule in Attorney
General v. Hitchcock[19], at
p.261:

If you ask a witness whether he has not
made a certain statement which would be material, and opposed to part of his
testimony, you may then call witnesses to prove that he has made the statement,
and the jury are at liberty to believe either the one account or the other.
(Emphasis added.)

Whatever may be the correct interpretation of
s. 9(1)  (in these proceedings it is not necessary to determine that question),
there is nothing contained in subs. (1) which has any controlling influence
over the provisions of subs. (2). Furthermore, there is nothing in the wording
employed in subs.

[Page 619]

(2) which limits the use or application of the
contents of prior inconsistent statements admitted in the manner prescribed in
s. 9(2) , in the determination of the truth of the matters therein
asserted. Put more specifically, in the context of these proceedings, there is
nothing in subs. (2) which indicates that the subsection is procedural
only and that evidence thereby adduced is inadmissible on the substantive
issues in the proceedings.

Section 9(2) of the Evidence Act then
falls to be examined not in the light of the old common law rule and the cases
decided thereunder, but as to what the proper interpretation of the statutory
provision may be. Nowhere does the legislature reveal an intention to limit the
impact of s. 9(2) to procedural or mechanical matters only. Certainly
nothing emerges from the terminology of the two subsections to indicate a
positive intention to preclude the application of these provisions to
substantive law or principle. It follows therefore that, unencumbered by the
earlier cases under the common law, the proper interpretation of the statute
emerges, that is to say matters elicited on cross-examination including the
existence of the prior inconsistent statement form part of the evidence going
to the trier of fact for such application as that tribunal might make of all
such evidence in reaching conclusions on the facts.

The evidentiary question here to be answered is
very narrow. The prior statement has been recognized by the witness,
St. Germaine, as her own and the statement has been proven in accordance
with the standards of evidence applicable thereto. The issue is simply what
effect may be given to this statement by the jury. In my view, the law as
enunciated in Deacon v. R., supra, appears to flow from the state
of affairs prevailing under the common law and, as adopted in the United Kingdom
authorities, as being the continuing principle to be applied after the advent
of what is now s. 9(1) . Section 9(2)  did not come into the law until 1968,
long after the Deacon case was settled. In my view, the proper
interpretation of s. 9(2)  permits the trier of fact, once the procedural
requirements of the subsection have been met, to take into its
appreciation all the testimony given by the witness including his explanations
and denials with

[Page 620]

reference to the proven prior inconsistent
statements. Any other conclusion not only lacks the ring of reality but is
transparently a rule adopted for comfort in the full awareness by the Court
that regardless of the instructions to the jury, the content of the prior
inconsistent statement will be weighed by the jury along with the testimony of
the witness given in court in the process of determining which statements and
evidence of the witness (if any) are to be believed and incorporated in their
findings or conclusions on the facts.

As I have said at the outset, I would agree with
the disposition of this appeal as proposed by my brother, Martland J.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Demand for breath
sample—Request by motorist to consult with lawyer by telephone—Call made in
presence of police officers—No objection or request for greater privacy—Refusal
to submit to breathalyzer test—No reasonable excuse for refusal—No denial
of right to retain and instruct counsel—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, s. 235(2)—Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960, c. 44,
s. 2.

The appellant was convicted on a charge of
failing, without reasonable excuse, to comply with a demand by a peace officer
to submit to a breathalyzer test contrary to s. 235(2)  of the Criminal
Code . An appeal from the conviction to the Manitoba Court of Appeal was
dismissed, Freedman C.J.M. dissenting. An appeal to this Court followed.

A demand had been made, when the accused was
brought to the police detachment office, that he provide a breath sample
through the apparatus that had been set up in the office. Either then, or after
he stated that he wished to consult with his lawyer by telephone, the demand
was repeated and then a warning was given of the consequences of refusing to
give a breath sample. The accused’s request to call his lawyer was granted but
the call was made in the presence of police officers. The accused did not
object nor did he request greater privacy. After the termination of the
telephone conversation, which lasted not more than five minutes, there
was a repetition of the demand that the accused provide a breath sample, which
demand the accused refused.

The defence advanced was that the appellant
had a “reasonable excuse” for refusing to comply with the demand made to him
under s. 235(1) of the Code in that he was denied the right to
privacy while telephoning to his lawyer and was thus denied “the right to
retain and instruct counsel without delay” contrary to s. 2(c) (ii)
of the Canadian Bill of Rights. The majority of the Court

[Page 487]

of Appeal concluded that there were two
refusals, that the first refusal was without reasonable excuse, and the offence
under s. 235 was then complete even though the second refusal would be
excusable by reason of a denial of privacy in respect of the accused’s
telephone call to his counsel. The trial judge, although stating that there
were two refusals held that the first refusal, which was made before the
accused’s telephone call to his lawyer, was “perhaps understandable”, but his
second refusal, following the telephone call was without reasonable excuse.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be
dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon and de Grandpré JJ.: The majority in the Court of
Appeal were in error in holding that the conviction could be upheld on the
basis of what they called the “first refusal” to provide a breath sample. What
was called the “first refusal” was not taken by the officer as a refusal but as
a request for the opportunity to obtain legal advice, a request with which the
officer complied. After the accused had completed his telephone conversation
with his lawyer, the demand for a breath sample was reiterated and a definite
refusal recorded. The trial judge was correct in basing his decision on the
“second refusal”.

It could not be accepted that the accused had
a reasonable excuse for his refusal because he had not been given the
opportunity to communicate with his lawyer, otherwise than by using the
telephone in the main room of the police station where the breathalyzer machine
was set up and the police officers stood. When the accused asked to be allowed
to consult his lawyer he raised no objection and made no request for any
greater degree of privacy than was afforded to him, such as it may have been.
He could not say that he was “deprived” of that for which he did not ask.

Stirland v. Director of Public
Prosecutions, [1944] A.C. 315; Bertrand v. The
Queen (1953), 17 C.R. 189, referred to.

Per Ritchie
and de Grandpré JJ.: The evidence disclosed only one refusal expressed in a
single conversation with the police commencing at the time when the appellant
was first asked to use the breathalyzer machine and only interrupted by the
appellant’s short talk with his lawyer. This conversation was characterized
throughout by a consistently unco-operative attitude on the part of the
appellant which remained unaltered in any way by the telephone call. The
evidence of the presence of the

[Page 488]

police officers in the room where the
telephone was situated had no bearing on the attitude which the appellant had
displayed from the time when he first entered the police office. The telephone
conversation resulted in no more than a further affirmation of that attitude
and the circumstances under which it was made could not be treated as
constituting a “reasonable excuse” for refusing to take the breathalyzer test.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz JJ., dissenting: There was only one
refusal within the meaning of that term in s. 235(2) of the Code. It
was unreal to segment a single occurrence (which took place over a time span of
not more than ten minutes) into a series of separate incidents and then isolate
one of them for the purpose of founding a charge upon it under s. 235(2) .

As to the crucial issue, it could not
reasonably be made a condition that an accused be shown to have asked for privacy
before consideration is given to providing it. Once an accused has requested
that he be permitted to consult counsel, that should carry with it, to the
knowledge of the police, a right to have the consultation in private, so far as
circumstances permit. The right to counsel is diluted if it can only be secured
by adding request to request. The police should not be put in an adversary
position on this question; they are better placed than the ordinary person (who
has been detained or arrested and is in police custody) to recognize what the
right to counsel imports, and they should be alert to protect that right as an
important element in the administration of justice through law, for which they
are as much accountable as any others involved in the judicial process.

APPEAL by the accused from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], dismissing his
appeal from conviction on a charge of failing to provide a breath sample
contrary to s. 235(2)  of the Criminal Code . Appeal dismissed,
Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz JJ. dissenting.

[Page 489]

S.A. Cohen, for the appellant.

S. Nozick, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson
and Beetz JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—The appellant
was charged with failing, without reasonable excuse, to comply with a demand by
a peace officer to submit to a breathalyzer test. He was convicted of the
charge, laid under s. 235(2)  of the Criminal Code , and the
conviction was affirmed on appeal after a trial de novo before a County
Court judge. On further appeal, by leave, to the Manitoba Court of Appeal, the
conviction was again affirmed but by a majority judgment, with Freedman C.J.M.
dissenting. The accused was acquitted on a related charge of driving while
impaired, arising out of the same incident, but that matter is not in issue
here.

The important question in this Court is whether
the appellant was deprived of “the right to retain and instruct counsel without
delay”, within s. 2(c)(ii) of the Canadian Bill of Rights. If
so, that would, admittedly, provide a reasonable excuse for the failure to
submit to the breathalyzer test, within the very terms of s. 235 and apart
from the larger view that I took of the effect of the Canadian Bill of Rights
in my reasons in Brownridge v. The Queen[2].

The Manitoba Court of Appeal was unanimous in
the view that the right to retain and instruct counsel (no question of delay
arose here) involved the right to consult privately and confidentially with
counsel. The majority did not reach this issue for the purposes of its actual
decision because they concluded that there were two refusals to take a
breathalyzer test, that the first refusal was without reasonable excuse, and
the offence under s. 235 was then complete even though the second refusal
would be excusable by reason of a denial of privacy in respect of the accused’s
telephone call to his counsel. The County Court judge, although stating

[Page 490]

that there were two refusals, held that the
first refusal, which was before the accused’s telephone call to his lawyer, was
“perhaps understandable”, but his second refusal, following the telephone call
was without reasonable excuse. The County Court judge took the view (for which
he was held to be in error by the Court of Appeal) that the accused was not
inhibited by the presence of police officers (who could overhear everything he
said) from speaking freely and hence, inferentially, there was no denial of the
right to retain and instruct counsel.

In the light of the facts on the record, and as
they were assessed by the trial judge, there was only one refusal within the
meaning of that term in s. 235(2)  of the Criminal Code . I agree
fully with the view of Freedman C.J.M. that it is unreal to segment a single
occurrence (which took place over a time span of not more than ten minutes)
into a series of separate incidents and then isolate one of them for the
purpose of founding a charge upon it under s. 235(2) .

The County Court judge’s reasons indicate quite
clearly that the accused first “refused” to give a breath sample because he
wished to consult his lawyer. Although the County Court judge described this as
a refusal, it was nothing more than a deferring of a decision pending the
requested opportunity to consult with a lawyer by telephone. A demand had been
made, when the accused was brought to the police detachment office, that he
provide a breath sample through the apparatus that had been set up in the
office. Either then, or after he stated that he wished to call his lawyer, the
demand was repeated and then a warning was given of the consequences of
refusing to give a breath sample. The police, in short, were treating the
sequence of events as part of one occurrence relating to a demand for a
breathalyzer test, and this was clear as well from the repetition of the actual
demand (a standard formula being used) after the accused spoke to his
lawyer by telephone. It only became realistic to speak of a refusal following
the repetition of the demand made after the termination of the telephone
conversation, which had lasted not more than five minutes.

[Page 491]

In my opinion, the majority of the Manitoba
Court of Appeal were wrong in the view that they took of this matter. There was
an uninterrupted flow of events that ended with the telephone conversation and
with a refusal thereafter to submit to a breath test. The statutory meaning of
a refusal cannot be made to depend on whether an accused says “no, I wish to
consult my lawyer” rather than “please wait until I consult my lawyer”. On any
reasonable construction, there is no refusal in either case.

This brings me to the crucial issue, the one on
which the County Court judge founded his affirmation of the conviction, and of
which the Manitoba Court of Appeal took a different view. There is no doubt
that the trial judge, consciously it appears, refused to follow existing
judgments of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Penner[3] and R. v. Maksimchuk[4]. These cases are at the heart of
Chief Justice Freedman’s judgment. They carry on from the judgment of this
Court in Brownridge v. The Queen, supra, which itself did not spell out
what is involved in the right to retain and instruct counsel, other than
recognizing a right of the accused to try and reach counsel and to use a telephone
in the police station for that purpose. Penner merely restated, in the
context of a breathalyzer situation, the well-established principle of privacy
of communication between lawyer and client. In that case, police officers
refused to leave the room in which the accused was telephoning his lawyer,
saying that regulations required that he be under constant observation. That
could have been done there, as it could have been done here, without denying
privacy. There, as here, the police officers could overhear what was said by
the accused. There, as here, the police officers could have maintained
observation from an adjoining room.

[Page 492]

The difference between the Penner case
and the present one is that in Penner the accused requested the officers
to allow him to converse with his lawyer privately, and he refused on the
advice of his lawyer to give a breath sample because of the denial of privacy.
In Maksimchuk the accused did not ask for privacy, as he did in Penner,
but the Manitoba Court of Appeal, affirming the trial judge on the point,
was of the opinion that failure to provide privacy, although not requested,
stood on the same footing as a refusal to provide it. That Court also drew on
the majority judgment of the Alberta Appellate Division in R. v. Balkan[5], where counsel for the accused was not
allowed to interview him in private after counsel attended in person at the
police station following a telephone call from the accused. Counsel’s request
for privacy was refused, and a police officer stayed and listened to the talk
between counsel and the accused. Prowse J.A., speaking for himself and Allen
J.A. said (at p. 492) that “prejudice [to the accused] must be inferred
when [he] is not permitted to communicate confidentially with his counsel…”.
There are, moreover, other passages in the reasons of Prowse J.A. which have a
direct bearing on some of the considerations raised during the argument of the
present appeal, and I reproduce them here, with approval (at p. 494):

In my view, the rights of an arrested or
detained person should not be limited when they are exercised bona fide and
when there is no undue delay or hinderance to the police in investigating a
crime or in the administration of justice. There may well be a point at which
the rights of a person who has been arrested and detained come into conflict
with the rights of the community as a whole to have a crime investigated
without delay. When such a conflict arises this question will have to be
resolved by the Courts. It is sufficient to say, at the present time, that such
a conflict does not arise in this case.

The privilege afforded confidential
communications between a client and his counsel supports the conclusion that
the common law attaches a great deal in importance to the right of a person
instructing counsel to

[Page 493]

make a full and frank and confidential
disclosure to him in so doing. In my view, the suggestion that a detained
person must waive that privilege in order to exercise his rights under the Canadian
Bill of Rights in such a manner as to make the police witnesses to his
conversations with his solicitor is not in accord with the law.

I am of the opinion that when a detained
person requests the right to converse with his counsel in private in the course
of retaining and instructing him, his rights at common law and under s. 2(c)
(ii) of the Canadian Bill of Rights are denied when the police
insist in being in a position to overhear the communication between them. If
the police were of the view that the respondent might attempt to take a drink
of liquor, mouth wash or other substance which might affect the proposed test
then it may well be that they were justified in keeping their eyes on the
accused. However, this did not require them to stand in relation to the
respondent and his counsel so as to destroy that degree of privacy required to
permit the respondent to communicate in confidence with his counsel while
making a full frank disclosure to him.

The views expressed by Prowse J.A. were approved
by the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appeal Division, in R. v. Doherty[6], and Macdonald J.A., speaking for
the Court, reaffirmed the right of an accused (whose counsel came to see him)
to speak to and instruct him in private, at least in the sense of being
entitled to consult with counsel out of the hearing of other persons, but
without necessarily being out of sight of persons in authority.

The Manitoba Court of Appeal reaffirmed in R.
v. Irwin[7], what
it said in Penner and Maksimchuk and noted that “Crown counsel
concedes that the right to consult and instruct counsel given by s. 2(c)(ii)
of the Canadian Bill of Rights carries with it the right to do so in
private and that the privacy in these cases does not need to be asked for, but
arises as a natural adjunct to the right to instruct counsel”. In Irwin, however,
accused waived the right to privacy and could not raise it as a bar to a
conviction under s. 235(2)  of the Criminal Code .

[Page 494]

R. v. Bond[8], a judgment of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appeal Division,
illustrates how related considerations may properly affect and qualify the
extent to which the right to retain and instruct counsel may be asserted.
There, the accused was allowed to reach first one counsel and then another by
telephone, the second one indicating that he would be coming to the police
station, which was some 25 miles away from where he was. In view of the
two-hour time limit in s. 235(1), the police officer refused to wait for
him, and after the police officer and then the accused spoke to the counsel
again, the accused, on counsel’s advice, refused to give a breath sample. It
was held that in these circumstances, there was no deprivation of the right to
retain and instruct counsel.

There was some discussion on the argument of the
appeal about the dimensions of the room in which the accused was detained (it
was 20 feet by 30 feet, according to the evidence), and from which he
telephoned his lawyer. There was an adjoining office in the building which had
a movable telephone but, at the material time, it was in the barrack room of
the detachment, a short distance away. No effort at all was made to ensure
privacy for the accused when speaking to his counsel, privacy to the extent at
least that was reasonable in the circumstances. The police officers could
easily have observed the accused from the adjoining room (either through the
door or through a glass partition) even assuming that the movable telephone
could not have been brought back. The evidence shows that while the accused was
speaking to his counsel, not only was he overheard but the police officers were
making notes. The testimony was, “I was making my notes and observing him, you
know, making my notes, of anything out of the ordinary”. There was no follow-up
to determine whether there was any recording of the accused’s conversation.

Certainly, as was said in Balkan, in Bond
and in Doherty, all circumstances must be considered in determining
how far privacy can go; but the fact that it may have to be limited in some
cases does not call for an unqualified denial of any privacy in

[Page 495]

all cases. I do not think that it can reasonably
be made a condition that an accused be shown to have asked for it before
consideration is given to providing it. Once an accused has requested that he
be permitted to consult counsel, that should carry with it, to the knowledge of
the police, a right to have the consultation in private, so far as
circumstances permit. The right to counsel is diluted if it can only be secured
by adding request to request. I would not put the police in an adversary
position on this question; they are better placed than the ordinary person (who
has been detained or arrested and is in police custody) to recognize what the
right to counsel imports, and they should be alert to protect that right as an
important element in the administration of justice through law, for which they
are as much accountable as any others involved in the judicial process.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the
judgments below and direct an acquittal.

The judgment of Martland, Judson and Pigeon JJ.
was delivered by

PIGEON J.—The Chief Justice has stated the
facts. I agree with him that the majority in the Court of Appeal were in error
in holding that the conviction could be upheld on the basis of what they called
the “first refusal” to provide a breath sample. The exact words spoken by the
accused upon the demand made by the officer for the breathalyzer test are not
important. What is decisive, in my opinion, is that what is called the “first
refusal” was not taken by the officer as a refusal, but as a request for the
opportunity to obtain legal advice, a request with which the officer complied.
After the accused had completed his telephone conversation with his lawyer, the
demand for a breath sample was reiterated and a definite refusal recorded. In
my opinion, the trial judge was quite correct in basing his decision on the
“second refusal” which is what, I think, he meant when he said:

There were undoubtedly two refusals, not
just one. I would agree that a refusal before the phone call is, perhaps,
understandable. Whatever conversation the accused had with his counsel, we
don’t know and we are not entitled to know. That is privileged. But he again
refused after that—refused “to blow”, as he said. And I

[Page 496]

don’t know how many opportunities one is
supposed to have to take the test. He had two chances. And although he didn’t,
to use the vernacular, “blow the hose”—I perhaps shouldn’t say “vernacular”,
but he refused to blow, and I don’t see any reasonable grounds for his so doing.

I cannot accept that the accused had a
reasonable excuse for his refusal because he had not been given the opportunity
to communicate with his lawyer, otherwise than by using the telephone in the
main room of the police station where the breathalyzer machine was set up and
the police officers stood.

The fact is that when the accused asked to be
allowed to consult his lawyer he raised no objection, he made no request for
any greater degree of privacy that was afforded to him, such as it may have
been. It was easy for him to say, at the trial, that he was inhibited when his
statement could not be challenged or tested because his communication was
privileged. This statement was therefore properly disregarded by the trial
judge.

What is important is that the accused accepted
the facilities offered to him by the police officers, as they were, without
question. It is quite true that the omission of an accused, or of his counsel,
to make an objection in the course of a trial does not always prevent the point
being raised in appeal. However, this is true only when the objectionable
course of conduct was such as to occasion a miscarriage of justice.

In Stirland v. Director of Public
Prosecutions[9], Viscount
Simon L.C. said at p. 328:

The failure of counsel to object may have a
bearing on the question whether the accused was really prejudiced. It is not a
proper use of counsel’s discretion to raise no objection at the time in order
to preserve a ground of objection for a possible appeal, but where, as here,
the reception or rejection of a question involves a principle of exceptional
public importance, it would be unfortunate if the failure of counsel to object
at the trial should lead to a possible miscarriage of justice.

[Page 497]

In the instant case, I fail to see on what basis
it could be said that the accused was really prejudiced in the way he exercised
his right to obtain legal advice. It appears to me that he really did more than
fail to object, he accepted the facilities offered to him as they were and,
therefore, what was said in Stirland would apply a fortiori (Bertrand
v. The Queen[10], at
p. 204).

It would be very detrimental to the proper
administration of the breathalyzer legislation, to allow a motorist suspected
of impairment to accept without objection the facilities offered to him for
seeking legal advice and later to complain of the adequacy of those facilities
in order to justify his refusal. Just as I consider it would be unfair to the
accused to treat as a definite refusal to take the test what the police
officer, at the time, treated as a request for an opportunity to seek legal
advice, I would consider it wrong to allow him later to question the adequacy
of the opportunity given to him after he had availed himself of it without
complaining. The provision of the Bill of Rights on which the appellant
relies is that “no law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as to…
deprive a person who has been arrested or detained… of the right to retain and
instruct counsel without delay…” I cannot see how the appellant can say he was
“deprived” of that which he did not ask for.

At the hearing in this Court as at the trial,
counsel for the accused made various submissions in respect of the layout of
the main room of the police station and also of the sergeant’s office. In view
of what I have just said, I see no reason in this case for going beyond what
the decision of the question before the Court actually requires in my opinion.
However, I think I should point out that there would be serious difficulties
involved in allowing persons in the situation of the accused to have the free
use, unsupervised for any length of time, of a private room such as a
sergeant’s office. It would also be a serious matter to require the provision
of safe and adequate facilities for private

[Page 498]

communication with legal counsel wherever
breathalyzer test is to be performed, failing which everyone would have a
reasonable excuse for refusing it.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Ritchie and de Grandpré JJ. was
delivered by

RITCHIE J.—I have had the advantage of reading
the reasons for judgment prepared for delivery by the Chief Justice and by
Mr. Justice Pigeon, and while I am in agreement with the latter, I
subscribe also to an additional ground upon which I think that the appeal
should be dismissed.

The defence advanced in the present case was
that the appellant had a “reasonable excuse” for refusing to comply with a
demand made to him by a police officer under s. 235(1)  of the Criminal
Code  in that he was denied the right to privacy while telephoning to his
lawyer and was thus denied “the right to retain and instruct counsel without
delay” contrary to s. 2 (c)(ii) of the Canadian Bill of Rights. My
brother Pigeon has accurately described the circumstances under which the telephone
call was made and I agree with him that they do not amount to a deprivation of
the right guaranteed to the appellant to retain and instruct counsel without
delay.

In my view the evidence in fact only discloses
one refusal expressed in a single conversation with the police commencing at
the time when the appellant was first asked to use the breathalyzer machine and
only interrupted by the appellant’s short talk with his lawyer. This
conversation was characterized throughout by a consistently uncooperative
attitude on the part of Jumaga which remained unaltered in any way by the
telephone call. In my opinion, the evidence of the presence of the police
officers in the room where the telephone was situated had no bearing on the
attitude which the appellant had displayed from the time when he first entered
the police office. The telephone conversation resulted in no more than a
further affirmation of that attitude and the circumstances under which it was
made cannot, in my view, be

[Page 499]

treated as constituting a “reasonable excuse”
for refusing to take the breathalyzer test.

Apart from the above observations, I wish to
make it plain that I am in complete accord with the reasons for judgment of my
brother Pigeon.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Trial before judge sitting
alone—Testimony of accused on voir dire—Restriction of
cross-examination—Evidence on voir dire not part of trial evidence—Criminal
Code , s. 502 .

Respondent was acquitted on two counts of
robbery by a judge sitting without a jury. At the trial the Crown first
submitted evidence on a voir dire to have certain statements made by the
accused out of court declared admissible. The accused, who was not represented
by counsel, then testified that no promises or threats had been made to him,
but that he had never made a statement. Having heard this evidence, the judge
held that the statements had been obtained freely and voluntarily and were
therefore admissible. Subsequently respondent called some witnesses in defence
but did not testify himself. At the conclusion of the trial the judge, in view
of all the evidence, in particular the accused’s deposition on the voir
dire, concluded that he had a reasonable doubt in his mind as to whether
the accused participated in the offence, and that he would give him the benefit
of the doubt. The Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed the appeals by the
Crown. Hence the appeal to this Court.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and a new trial
ordered.

Per Martland,
Judson, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: On the voir dire, the
trial judge did not have to decide whether the statement that the prosecution
sought to introduce in evidence had actually been made, and whether it was
true. In a trial by jury, it is for the jury to answer such questions.
Consequently, the judge who hears the evidence on the voir dire gives a
ruling only on the admissibility of the statement in question. When there is no
jury and the same judge has to rule on both the admissibility of the evidence
and its probative value, he must necessarily withhold his conclusion on the
second point until the end of the trial, that is, after hearing the whole case.

[Page 442]

Since a voir dire is necessary in a
trial without a jury, as in a trial with a jury, it cannot be maintained that
the rules are different. Given that the prosecution is restricted in its cross‑examination
of the accused who is testifying on a voir dire, to consider this
deposition as part of the evidence in a trial without jury would give the
accused a singular advantage and the prosecution an extraordinary disadvantage.
This would allow the accused to testify on the voir dire on a portion of
the case that suited his purposes, while avoiding cross-examination on the
rest.

There is nothing in the record at bar to
suggest a consent on the part of the prosecution that the evidence introduced
on the voir dire be used as evidence at the trial. Without this consent,
and in view of the fact that the deposition of the accused on the voir dire was
the very basis for the conclusion as to a doubt on which the acquittal was
based, there are grounds for granting a new trial.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence J., dissenting: The voir dire evidence cannot be
read into the trial without the concurrence of counsel. In the present appeal
it would appear that the trial judge, the accused, who was not represented by
counsel, and the Crown were all ready to accept the evidence given on the voir
dire as part of the evidence in the trial upon the merits. The trial judge
did not err in law in using the evidence given by the accused on the voir
dire.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal
for Quebec, affirming the acquittal of respondent by a judge without a jury.
Appeal allowed and a new trial ordered.

G. Girouard, for the appellant.

G. Dansereau, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence J. was
delivered by

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—I have read the reasons
for judgment written by Mr. Justice Pigeon and I adopt the statement of
facts set out in those reasons except as I shall add to them hereafter.

[Page 443]

I am in agreement with Mr. Justice Pigeon’s
opinion that the judge trying a charge without the intervention of a jury and
who found it necessary to conduct a voir dire as to the admissibility of
a statement by an accused must, when he has ruled that statement admissible in
law and proceeded with the main trial, exclude from his mind, in determining
the guilt or innocence of the accused, all evidence given in that voir dire and
especially the evidence of the accused if he has himself testified upon the voir
dire. I am, however, of the view that this is subject to the exception
noted by Chief Justice Miller in R. v. Bannerman[1], at pp. 114-115, which
Mr. Justice Pigeon has cited, i.e., “unless leave is given, with
the concurrence of counsel, to have voir dire evidence read into the
trial for the purpose of saving time”.

It must be noted that in the present appeal the
accused at trial was not represented by counsel and that the learned trial
judge was most meticulous in informing the accused of his rights and
particularly of the effect of testifying. As noted by Mr. Justice Dubé in
his reasons for the Court of Appeal of Quebec, the respondent was entitled to be under the impression that the
evidence which he gave in the course of voir dire was also part of his
defence, and it would appear that counsel for the Crown was under a similar
impression. The experienced trial court judge quite evidently assumed, in
giving reasons, that he was entitled to have regard for the evidence given
during the voir dire in determining whether or not he should convict the
accused.

Under these circumstances, it would appear that
the learned trial judge, the accused and the Crown were all ready to accept the
evidence given on the voir dire as part of the evidence in the trial
upon the merits.

In view of those circumstances, I am in
agreement with the view expressed by judges in the Court of Appeal for Quebec and particularly by Dubé J.A. when
he said:

[TRANSLATION] It seems to me clear that the
trial judge did not err in law in using the evidence given by the accused on
the voir dire when he delivered his final

[Page 444]

judgment, even though this evidence was not
repeated in defence; I think that the reverse would be a serious ground of
appeal.

For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Pigeon,
Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

PIGEON J.—This appeal is from a judgment of the
Quebec Court of Appeal affirming respondent’s acquittal at a trial without a
jury. The trial was on three counts of robbery and began with a voir dire on
which the accused testified. After an adjournment, the judge ruled as follows:

[TRANSLATION]… at the hearing of May 4
last, the Crown revealed its intention to produce statements made by the
accused out of court when he was arrested, and the Crown requested a voir
dire, that is, a trial within a trial, to establish that the statements had
been obtained freely and voluntarily.

Under the Criminal Code , the Crown
must establish beyond any reasonable doubt that the statements were obtained
freely and voluntarily, without promises or threats.

For the evidence on the voir dire, the
Crown called the following witnesses: Det. Alfred
Maccarone, Det. Jacques Grondines, Det. Maurice Fleurent, Det. Yvon Beaulieu,
Const. Pierre Tétreault, Const. Wilkofsky, Const. Roger
Deschamps, Const. André Yvon and Const. Pierre Morin, and all these persons,
who had been in contact with the accused from the time of his arrest until the
statements were given to Det. Maccarone and Det. Jacques Grondines, on May 13,
1972, testified that no promises or threats were made in their presence to
induce the accused to make any statement whatever.

The accused testified in his own defence
and admitted that the officers made no promises or threats: neither the
detectives nor the constables who were present when he was arrested and who
later kept him in the detention area. The accused said that he made no
statement and also that no promises or threats were made to him.

On the voir dire, the fact of
whether or not the accused made a statement must not be taken into
consideration,

[Page 445]

but is used mainly for, and may affect, the
evidence that will be introduced as to whether or not he made a statement; the
evidence given on the voir dire, however, must be used only to determine
whether the statement was given freely and voluntarily.

Having heard all the evidence, the Court
comes to the conclusion that the statements are admissible in evidence, since
the Crown proved beyond any reasonable doubt that the statements were obtained
freely and voluntarily.

Following this decision, the Crown called Det. Maccarone,
who had taken the statements made to him by respondent and had them recorded in
writing. The statements were then filed and received in evidence. The accused
called some witnesses in defence, but did not testify himself. The trial judge
acquitted him in two judgments, the essential of which is as follows:

[TRANSLATION] The extra-judicial statement
was not signed by the accused. Can it be used as evidence against the accused
despite this fact? On the basis of the decision in R. v. VAUPOTIC, 70
W.W.R. 128, it seems that this question can be answered in the affirmative…

The accused testified on the voir dire and
categorically denied making any statement to Dets. MACCARONE and GRONDINES.
Does this evidence introduced on the voir dire constitute evidence at
the trial? The answer must be in the affirmative if we consider the decision of
the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. MILNER, 11 C.R.N.S. 178…

Where an extra-judicial confession is
admitted in evidence, it is for the jurors or the judge sitting alone to assess
the truth or falsity of the statement. The courts have long recognized that a
confession made out of court could be the basis of a conviction. In this regard
see a decision of the Court of Appeal of Quebec in FORD v. THE QUEEN, 17
C.R. 26. That case involved an extra-judicial statement signed by the accused,
which the latter tried to repudiate at the trial…

In the record at bar, in view of the
testimony of Mrs. Marcelle LAVOIE, the fact that the extra-judicial
statement was not signed by the accused, and that he denies having made it, the
Court has a reasonable doubt in its mind as to whether the accused participated
in the robbery committed in the FELIPE cocktail lounge on March twenty-first
(21), one thousand nine hundred and seventy-two (1972).

[Page 446]

ACCORDINGLY, the accused must be given the
benefit of this doubt, and he must be acquitted of the charge as laid in No.
72-3756.

With respect to record No. 72-3754, namely
a robbery perpetrated on the person of Mr. Claude ST-AMOUR on March
twenty-first (21), one thousand nine hundred and seventy-two (1972), except for
the extra-judicial statement of the accused submitted as Exhibit P-5, the Crown
had no direct evidence of the robbery. With regard to the extra‑judicial
statement, for the reasons above stated, the Court comes to the same
conclusion, namely that there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused
participated in a robbery committed on the person of Mr. Claude ST-AMOUR
on March twenty-first (21), one thousand nine hundred and seventy-two
(1972).

ACCORDINGLY, the Court acquits him of the
charge as laid.

Appeals by the Crown were unanimously dismissed,
the Chief Justice saying inter alia:

[TRANSLATION] On the voir dire, the
trial judge had to rule only on the admissibility of the confession submitted
by the prosecution, namely whether it was free and voluntary. In my opinion, he
did not have to decide at that time whether it was actually made by respondent
and whether it was true. By admitting it in evidence, the judge ruled that the
Crown had proved beyond any reasonable doubt and to his satisfaction that
respondent had not been subjected to undue pressure before the time at which
the Crown contends the confession was made. By subsequently acquitting the
accused, the judge in no way contradicted himself. He found that the additional
evidence introduced during the trial created a reasonable doubt in his mind.

With respect to the Crown’s contention that
the trial judge could not, for his final decision, take into account respondent’s
testimony during the voir dire, this is in my opinion excessive
formalism. To require the judge to hear the accused and, if we are to be
logical, all the other witnesses on the voir dire, a. second time, is in
my view an unjustified waste of time.

For his part, Turgeon J.A. said, inter alia:

[TRANSLATION] I am not convinced that in a
trial where a judge is sitting alone, he may, without the consent of the
parties, take into account the testimony of the accused on the voir dire when
deciding on the merits, because in principle the prosecution is restricted at
that time in its cross-examination of the accused…

[Page 447]

However, in this case, as my brother has
shown, the accused, counsel for the prosecution and the trial judge all took it
for granted that the accused’s testimony on the voir dire was part of
the evidence at the trial. This was done without any objection or protest on
the part of counsel for the Crown. There was thus tacit consent on this point
and it is too late to raise the objection on appeal.

Dubé J.A., with the concurrence of Bélanger
J.A., said inter alia:

[TRANSLATION] In a trial before a judge
sitting alone, it is not necessary to treat the voir dire as a trial
within the trial, since it is the same judge who has to rule on the admissibility
of the confession and also on its probative value.

The commonly accepted expression in our
case law, that the voir dire is a trial within a trial, is only an
expression, not a fact. There is in fact only one trial, but in the portion
which takes place before a jury, it is the judge’s duty to take all possible
precautions to ensure that the jurors are not influenced by unlawful or
inadmissible elements of evidence…

However, in trials before a judge sitting
alone, these formalities become completely pointless. The evidence heard by the
trial judge on the voir dire is as much a part of the trial as any other
evidence. It is not even necessary for the parties to agree for this evidence
to be included in the record, because it is there already.

In my opinion, this rule also applies to
the testimony of the accused if he chooses to testify during the voir dire. Clearly,
the judge should not then take into account questions, which the accused may
have been asked in order to test the truth of his testimony, regarding his
criminal record or even his confession (DE CLERCQ, Supreme Court, reported in 4
C.R. N.S. p. 205; a majority decision, three dissents). He must disregard
these “side issues” in the case and keep strictly to the proven facts…

Moreover, in the instant case it is clear
that the accused, who presented his own defence, was always under the
impression that the testimony he gave on the voir dire was also part of
his defence (J.R. Vol. 3, p. 480):

No, but Your Lordship, I would like to make
it clear that this evidence, since it is voir dire evidence and applies
to the three (3) counts, that I will use it in future in the other cases.

[Page 448]

Counsel for the Crown also gave the
impression that he considered the voir dire evidence as part of the
evidence throughout the entire proceedings, in particular at p. 312 J.R.
Vol. 2, when he said:

I object, Your Lordship, not to the
accused’s arguments, but to the manner in which he is presenting them, because
I would like to know in which record a motion for a nonsuit is being made. At
the beginning of the trial, I stated that we would proceed in record 3756, and
I also said that the voir dire evidence would be included in the other
two records because it is the same voir dire evidence; these are
statements which were taken successively; the accused is now making a motion
for a nonsuit.

It should first be noted that the Court of
Appeal correctly held that, on the voir dire, the trial judge did not
have to decide whether the statement that the prosecution sought to introduce
in evidence had actually been made, and whether it was true. In a trial by
jury, it is for the jury to answer such questions. Consequently, the judge who
hears the evidence on the voir dire gives a final ruling only on the
admissibility of the statement in question: R. v. Mulligan[2], (Ontario Court of Appeal). When
there is no jury and the same judge has to rule on both the admissibility of
the evidence and its probative value, he must necessarily withhold his
conclusion on the second point until the end of the trial. In fact, with regard
to the question as to whether the statement was actually made and whether it is
true, the judge presiding over a voir dire in a trial by jury is
required to decide only whether there is evidence to be submitted to the jury;
it is not for him to weigh such evidence. There is no provision authorizing a
judge sitting alone to do otherwise or to make a final ruling on these
questions before hearing the entire case. It is true that in DeClercq v. The
Queen[3], Hall
J., dissenting, appears to say at the foot of p. 921 that on a voir
dire, it is the judge’s duty to decide whether the statement was actually
made by the accused. However, this must be read with the categorical statement
at the top of the same page:

[Page 449]

Once admitted, the statement goes to the
jury who alone may decide whether the statement was in fact made, whether it
was true and who may give it such weight as they see fit.

The important question in the case at bar is
whether, in a case where there is no jury, the evidence on the voir dire is
part of the trial evidence like any other evidence, as Dubé J.A. maintains. In
my opinion, this statement cannot be supported. No provision of the Criminal
Code  was cited in support, and I can see no other legal basis for it. Part
XVI of the Criminal Code , headed Indictable Offences—Trial
without Jury, under which the trial was held, ends with the following
section:

502. The
provisions of Part XIV, the provisions of Part XV relating to transmission of
the record by a magistrate where he holds a preliminary inquiry, and the
provisions of Parts XVII and XX, in so far as they are not inconsistent with
this Part, apply, mutatis mutandis, to proceedings under this Part;

Provisions concerning trials by jury are in Part
XVII, headed Procedure by Indictment. Although the rules concerning the
admissibility of confessions, including those for voir dire, are not
spelled out there, they definitely form part of the provisions to be followed
in the procedure by indictment. In my opinion, it can therefore be stated
without risk of error, that those same rules should be applied mutatis
mutandis in a trial without jury, “in so far as they are not inconsistent”
with the provisions of Part XVII. I find nothing that might be said to be inconsistent.
Consequently, we need only consider what changes may be necessary because there
is no jury. I fail to see how it could be argued that one of such necessary
changes would be the exclusion of any voir dire. There is definitely
nothing which prevents a judge sitting alone from proceeding in this regard
exactly as if there were a jury. Of course, the result will be that he will
also have to decide at the end of the trial whether the confession was actually
made, after previously deciding whether it is admissible in evidence. But there
is nothing to prevent him from dealing with these two stages separately and
from holding on the admissibility of the confession in evidence the “trial
within the trial”, which is held

[Page 450]

as a voir dire when there is a jury. Mutatis
mutandis means making all necessary changes, but necessary changes only.
For this reason I fail to see how it could be decided that in a trial without a
jury, a voir dire is unnecessary, and statements made by the accused may
be admitted in evidence without a preliminary decision as to whether or not
they were freely and voluntarily made. Furthermore, no one appears to suggest
that in a trial without a jury a voir dire is unnecessary. But if this
is so, how can it be maintained that the rules are different?

I must also add, with respect, that Dubé J.A.’s
position appears contradictory. On the one hand he says that if the accused
testifies on the voir dire but not at the trial proper, his deposition
may be used to his benefit, however he adds:

[TRANSLATION]… of course, the judge should
not at that time take into account questions, which the accused may have been
asked in order to test the truth of his testimony, regarding his criminal
record or even the truthfulness of his confession (DE CLERCQ, Supreme
Court, reported 4 C.R. N.S. at p. 205).

For all practical purposes, in my opinion this
is tantamount to maintaining that in a trial without a jury, the deposition of
an accused on a voir dire may later be used for him but not against him.
Nothing of the sort was decided by this Court in DeClercq. In that case
the accused was convicted by the trial judge sitting without a jury, and the
only question before this Court was whether the judge had erred in asking the
accused, who was testifying on the voir dire, whether the statement he
had signed was true. Martland J., speaking for the majority, said
(at p. 910):

…The sole issue before this court is as to
whether the learned trial judge erred in law when he asked the appellant
whether the statement which he had signed was true.

In conclusion, he said (at pp. 911-912):

There was no attempt by the learned trial
judge in the present case to use the voir dire as a means of determining
the guilt of the appellant. He stated at the outset of the inquiry that he had
seen the statement and that he

[Page 451]

did not propose to look at it. When it was
produced it was handed to the witness for identification and he was questioned
concerning it. Had he been satisfied that the statement was not voluntary, the
trial judge would not have become aware of its contents. The inquiry as to its
truth was related solely to the weight to be given to the evidence on the issue
as to whether or not it was voluntary.

In my opinion it is important to consider, as
Turgeon J.A. did, that when the accused testifies on a voir dire the
prosecution is restricted in its cross-examination of the accused. As Kaufman
J.A. states in his book The Admissibility of Confessions (second ed.,
p. 30), “this should be limited to testing credibility and to the matter
in issue”. Thus, if it is held that in a trial without jury the accused’s
deposition on a voir dire is part of the evidence and may be used on his
behalf, but may not be used against him to the extent indicated above, the
accused has a singular advantage and the prosecution suffers an extraordinary
disadvantage. This runs counter to the general rule established by the Canada
Evidence Act , namely that the accused is not required to testify and his
silence cannot be used against him, but, if he chooses to testify, he is
treated as an ordinary witness. He may therefore be cross-examined on all facts
of the case as well as on anything that may affect his credibility, subject to
the one generally admitted exception that he cannot be cross-examined on a
statement that was held inadmissible on the voir dire.

In deciding as it did in the case at bar, the
Court allowed the accused to testify on the voir dire on a portion of
the case that suited his purposes, while avoiding cross-examination on the rest
and preventing the prosecution from referring to it. This can hardly be
described as formalism; it touches one of the most basic aspects of the
administration of justice, namely the rule that any judgment must be based
exclusively on the evidence presented at the trial. If it were to be held that
in a trial without a jury it is not essential to hold a voir dire, and
the judge may admit evidence of statements made by the accused, provided he
rules on their admissibility at the end of the trial, I would not

[Page 452]

agree, but I would consider it less
objectionable than a voir dire that does not respect the basic rule,
namely that it is a trial within a trial, and accordingly the evidence produced
therein is to be used on the voir dire only, even though the same judge
presides at the voir dire and decides on the merits.

In my opinion, the correct rule was stated by
Kelly J. in Re R. v. Shepherd[4], namely
that even in a trial without a jury, the evidence presented on the voir dire
is not part of the evidence to be considered on the merits. With respect, I
do not find the opposite approach, as adopted by the British Columbia Court of
Appeal in R. v. Milner[5], convincing
or logical. In that case Davey C.J.B.C. said (at p. 180):

…where the trial is before a judge sitting
alone. There, the judge is the trier of the fact; he hears the evidence which
is given on the voir dire; the voir dire is part of the
trial and, regardless of the finding of the learned trial judge in those
circumstances on the admissibility of the evidence, any evidence which is given
on the voir dire is given as in the course of the trial itself and, if
it is relevant, it is admissible in favour of or against the parties. Of
course, it goes without saying that the evidence on the voir dire must
be confined to what is material to and admissible on the question to be decided
upon it.

If the voir dire is an integral part of
the trial without a jury, why should the evidence be restricted to a particular
question?

On the other hand, I see no objection to the
judgment of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Bannerman[6]. In that case the accused, who was
found guilty, contended that the judge sitting alone should have heard a second
time the evidence introduced on the voir dire concerning the free and
voluntary nature of the statement. He maintained that the judge having ruled,
at the end of the voir dire, that the statement was admissible, it was
not enough for the person who had taken the statement to be called upon to
introduce the statement in evidence, as was done in the case at bar. In my
opinion, the Manitoba Court of Appeal was correct in saying (at pp. 114-115):

[Page 453]

The admission of the statement was allowed
only after a voir dire. The learned trial judge held it was a voluntary
statement and properly admissible, so after the voir dire it was filed
in the trial as Exhibit 3. Counsel did not raise any objection as to
voluntariness when the trial resumed after the voir dire, before the
statement was filed as Exhibit 3. Mr. Walsh now contends that evidence
should have been produced at the trial after the conclusion of the voir dire
to show the voluntariness of the statement. I am unable to accept this
contention. It is true that after a voir dire in a jury trial the trial
resumes and the admission or confession must be proved, including the voluntary
aspect, in the ordinary way in the presence of the jury. This is done
necessarily because a jury is excluded during the voir dire, and,
furthermore, it is part of the jury’s function to assess the truth, and the
voluntariness or otherwise, of the statement. However, it is not reasonable to
require a repetition in the trial proper, before the judge alone, of all the
evidence taken on the voir dire in order to establish whether the
statement was or was not made voluntarily. I realize that the voir dire must
be kept separate from the trial and that certain evidence on the voir dire must
be completely excluded from the mind of the trial judge—such as evidence
that might be given by the accused and others—unless leave is given, with
the concurrence of counsel, to have voir dire evidence read into the
trial for the purpose of saving time. The judge’s function is to decide whether
a statement is or is not admissible, and he decides that after hearing the voir
dire. Then the statement, if ruled admissible instead of being an exhibit
for identification as in the voir dire, becomes an exhibit in the trial,
and once it becomes an exhibit in the trial it is part of the evidence by
virtue of the ruling of the learned trial judge that it is admissible.

I have underlined the passage in this quotation
where the Court refused to allow the accused’s deposition on the voir dire to
be considered part of the evidence at the trial. It is possible that only the
question whether such a deposition may be used as evidence against the accused
was considered, but once again, I fail to see how a distinction can be made and
how it can be said that without being evidence against him, it becomes evidence
for him. The rule is that what is evidence against a party is also evidence for
him. If a statement made by the accused is introduced in evidence, the accused
is obviously entitled to rely on everything in the statement that may be
favourable to his case. This is not doubtful.

[Page 454]

It only remains to consider whether in the
record at bar, there was a consent on the part of the prosecution that the
evidence introduced on the voir dire be used as evidence at the trial.
In my opinion, Dubé J.A. was completely mistaken with regard to the meaning of
the statements made by counsel for the prosecution which he cited. In order to
properly appreciate the meaning of these statements, it must be remembered that
the accused was on trial on three different indictments, that is, three
different cases before the same judge. The statements made by counsel for the
prosecution were only that he intended that the evidence introduced on the voir
dire in the first case should also be used in the other two cases. It is
clear that there was no question of using it otherwise than as evidence on the voir
dire in those other cases. In fact, in each case, the prosecution relied on
a separate statement made at the same time before the same witness, Det.
Maccarone.

In view of these facts, it is clear that when
the accused referred to three “counts”, he actually meant three indictments.
After carefully examining the record in this regard, I must come to the
conclusion that the statements quoted by Dubé J.A. meant only that the evidence
introduced on the voir dire in the first record was to be used for the
same purpose in each of the other two records. The accused’s comments on this
show that he understood these statements and there is nothing from which one
can conclude that the prosecution consented that evidence introduced on the voir
dire should be used as evidence at the trial. Without such consent, this
evidence could not be used on the merits, any more than could a deposition
taken at a preliminary inquiry that had not been introduced as evidence at the
trial in the prescribed manner, in cases where, exceptionally, this is
permitted or agreed upon. It no doubt often happens that on appeal from a
judgment on summary conviction, the parties agree to use the evidence
introduced before the magistrate rather than having a trial de novo. However,
without such consent, the evidence introduced in the first trial is not part of
the record when an appeal is taken, and this cannot be regarded as unnecessary
formalism.

[Page 455]

In conclusion, it should be noted that the
judgment of the trial judge shows that the reference to the accused’s
deposition on the voir dire is the very basis for the conclusion as to a
doubt on which the acquittal was based. Consequently, in my opinion, the
prosecution has shown the existence of the condition required for the granting
of a new trial in accordance with the principles laid down in White v. The
King[7].

I conclude that the appeal should be allowed,
the judgments of the Court of Appeal and the acquittals by the trial judge on
the two charges mentioned therein should be set aside and a new trial on these
charges should be ordered.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Possession of goods recently
stolen—No explanation advanced—Charge to jury—Evidentiary effect of proof of
recent possession—Proper instruction to jury does not constitute comment on
failure of accused to testify—Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑10,s.
4(5).

The respondent was charged with breaking,
entering and theft. Goods which had been recently stolen were found in his
possession. At the trial counsel for the Crown urged the trial judge to
instruct the jury as to the inference to be drawn from the accused being found
in possession of recently stolen goods, but, after argument, the judge made an
express ruling that he “would decline to charge the jury as requested by the
Crown with respect to the doctrine of recent possession.” He was of the view
that it was incumbent upon the Crown to adduce evidence as to whether or not
the accused had offered any explanation for his possession of the stolen goods.
An appeal from the accused’s acquittal was dismissed by a majority of the Court
of Appeal on the ground that an instruction to the jury in accordance with the
rule as to recent possession would constitute a comment on the failure of the
accused to testify contrary to the provisions of s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act . The Crown appealed further to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Dickson J.: The trial judge erred. There is no duty upon the Crown to
lead negative evidence. It would be better to continue the existing practice in
this matter. If the accused has offered an explanation to the police, it is
open to his counsel, if the accused does not wish to testify, to cross-examine
the police witnesses for the purpose of bringing forth evidence of the
explanation.

[Page 400]

The argument respecting s. 4(5)  of the Canada
Evidence Act  was not persuasive. Explanations can be given inside or
outside the court-room. When the trial judge speaks to the jury about absence
of explanation, the reasonable inference for the jury to draw is that the
accused did, or did not, as the case may be, offer an explanation at the time
one would expect an explanation, that is, when the accused was found in
possession of the goods alleged to have been stolen.

R. v. Graham, [1974]
S.C.R. 206, referred to.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Spence, Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: The instruction
which should be given to a jury in a case involving possession by the accused
of recently stolen goods is described by Lord Reading in R. v. Schama; R. v.
Abramovitch (1941), 11 Cr. App. R. 45, at p. 49. The essence of the
matter is that in a case such as the present one where it has been established
that the accused was in possession of recently stolen goods and where no
explanation whatever has been advanced, the jury shoud be instructed that the
evidence of such possession standing alone raises a prima facie case
upon which they are entitled to bring in a verdict of guilty.

The trial judge was wrong in thinking that
some evidence relating as to whether or not there was an explanation must be
adduced by the Crown if it seeks to rely on the above rule. Under the
circumstances of this case, there was no onus upon the Crown to produce
evidence of an explanation which might have been made by the respondent out of
Court. Any other conclusion would have fixed the Crown with an untenable burden
and made the rule as to the evidentiary effect of proof of recent possession
almost completely unworkable.

The contention that an instruction to the
jury in accordance with this rule would constitute a comment on the failure of
the accused to testify contrary to the provisions of s. 4(5)  of the Canada
Evidence Act  was rejected. There was no evidence of any explanation of the
stolen goods being found in the respondent’s possession and the provisions of
s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act  do not alter the instructions
which a judge should give to the jury in such a case.

R. v. Schama; R. v. Abramovitch, supra;
Richler v. The King, [1939] S.C.R. 101; Ungaro
v. The King, [1950] S.C.R. 430; Graham v. The Queen, [1959] S.C.R.
652; Tremblay v. The Queen, [1969] S.C.R. 431; R. v. Graham, [1974]
S.C.R. 206; R. v. Hill (1973), 10 C.C.C. (2d) 541, referred to.

[Page 401]

Per Martland,
Judson, Spence, Pigeon and Beetz JJ.: R. v. Graham, supra, is conclusive
against the view that, in order to rely on the doctrine of recent possession,
the Crown must give some evidence as to whether or not there was an explanation
given.

Assuming for the purposes of this case that,
under the circumstances, a direction to the jury in the exact words of Lord
Reading in Schama, 11 Cr. App. R. 45, at p. 49, would, in view of
what was decided in Bigaouette v. The King, [1927] S.C.R. 112, be apt to
be understood by a jury as a comment on the failure of the accused to testify
(contrary to the provisions of s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act ),
all the trial judge had to do was to give the direction omitting the words:
“in the absence of any reasonable explanation”. There was no necessity for
stating the rule with the qualification when, on the evidence, it was to be
applied without qualification.

When the Crown has put in evidence facts from
which guilt may be inferred, the accused may be convicted unless there is an
explanation that may reasonably be true. When such an explanation appears,
whether in the evidence tendered by the Crown or brought by the defence, it
must be considered and will justify an acquittal if it raises a reasonable
doubt. This is what distinguishes facts from which guilt may be inferred from
facts giving rise to a legal presumption where the defence has the onus of
proving any admissible excuse on a balance of probabilities.

R. v. Spurge, [1961]
2 Q.B. 205, referred to.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for
 British Columbia[1],
dismissing the Crown’s appeal from the acquittal of the accused on charges of
breaking, entering and theft. Appeal allowed.

G.L. Murray, Q.C., for the appellant.

P.R. Lawrence, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Dickson J. was
delivered by

DICKSON J.—The short question in this appeal is
whether the Crown is obliged to adduce evidence of any explanation given by the
accused, or

[Page 402]

absence of explanation, before relying on what
has come to be called the “doctrine of recent possession”. It has generally
been understood that all the Crown need establish in the first instance is that
the goods were recently stolen and that they were found in the possession of
the accused. Then the jury must be told that they may, not that they must, in
the absence of any reasonable explanation, find the accused guilty. In the
instant case, the trial judge refused so to instruct the jury being of the view
that it was incumbent upon the Crown to adduce evidence as to whether or not
the accused had offered any explanation for his possession of the stolen goods.
With respect, the judge erred.

There is no duty upon the Crown to lead negative
evidence in these circumstances. The issue now before the Court was decided in R.
v. Graham[2]. Consider
the implications of what has been suggested. Let us assume that no explanation
was given by the accused. To establish this, it would presumably be necessary
for the Crown to call all police officers with whom the accused had spoken
during investigation of the offence or after arrest. Each officer would be
questioned as to whether the accused had made any explanation to him. Apart
from the obvious practical difficulties this would present, a more serious
concern is that the jury could obtain, indeed could hardly escape, the
impression that a duty to explain rested upon the accused. Let us assume, on
the other hand, that the accused had given several explanations. Nothing could
be more damaging than evidence adduced by the Crown of a series of inconsistent
explanations by the person charged. For these reasons, I should think it would
be better to continue what I have understood to be the practice in this matter.
If the accused has offered an explanation to the police, it is open to his
counsel, if the accused does not wish to testify, to cross-examine the police
witnesses for the purpose of bringing forth evidence of the explanation.

[Page 403]

The argument respecting s. 4(5)  of the Canada
Evidence Act , I do not find persuasive. Explanations can be given inside or
outside the court-room. When the trial judge speaks to the jury about absence
of explanation, the reasonable inference for the jury to draw is that the
accused did, or did not, as the case may be, offer an explanation at the time
one would expect an explanation, that is, when the accused was found in
possession of the goods alleged to have been stolen.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal and the verdict of acquittal, and order a new trial on
the second and third counts of the indictment.

Martland and de Grandpré JJ. agreed with the
reasons of Ritchie J.

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought pursuant to
the provisions of s. 621(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  from a
judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia dismissing
an appeal by the Attorney General from a verdict of acquittal rendered at
trial. The respondent was charged and acquitted on an indictment containing
four counts of breaking, entering and theft but, in the Court of Appeal the
Attorney General abandoned the appeal on the first and fourth counts and the
judgment from which this appeal is taken is thus concerned only with counts two
and three.

The dissenting opinions of Mr. Justice
Taggart and Mr. Justice Mclntyre are recorded in the formal order of the
Court of Appeal in the following terms:

AND BE IT RECORDED that the Honourable
Mr. Justice Taggart and the Honourable Mr. Justice Mclntyre dissent
from the judgment of the Court on the ground that in law the learned trial
judge was in error in refusing to charge the jury on the inferences they might
draw from the possession by the Respondent of recently stolen goods.

The issue before this Court is accordingly
limited to the question of law so recorded.

One of the counts which was the subject of
appeal related to breaking into a hardware store from which two walkie-talkie
radios and a 22-calibre rifle were stolen, and the other count

[Page 404]

arose out of the breaking and entering of a
garage where tires were stolen.

It is not seriously contested at this stage that
the goods which had been recently stolen were found in the possession of the
respondent and it seems unnecessary to recount the details of the circumstances
under which they were found, having regard to the following admission contained
in the respondent’s factum:

It is conceded by the Respondent that the
“fact of possession of goods recently stolen” was before the Jury. That “fact”
will hereinafter be referred to as “THE FACT”.

At the trial counsel for the Crown urged the
learned trial judge to instruct the jury as to the inference to be drawn from
the accused being found in possession of recently stolen goods, but after
lengthy argument and on consideration of the authorities, the learned trial
judge made an express ruling that he “would decline to charge the jury as
requested by the Crown with respect to the doctrine of recent possession.” The
instruction which should be given to a jury in such a case is described by Lord
Reading in R. v. Schama; R. v. Abramovitch[3], at p. 49, in a passage which
has been approved by this Court on many occasions and particularly in Richler
v. The King[4];
Ungaro v. The King[5], per
Estey J. at p. 436; Graham v. The Queen[6]; Tremblay v. The Queen[7], at p. 437; and more recently
in R. v. Graham[8]. The
passage in question reads as follows:

Where the prisoner is charged with
receiving recently stolen property, when the prosecution has proved the
possession by the prisoner, and that the goods had been recently stolen, the jury
should be told that they may, not that they must, in the absence of any
reasonable explanation, find the prisoner guilty. But if an explanation is
given which may be true, it is for the jury to say on the whole evidence
whether the accused is guilty or not; that is to say, if the jury think that
the explanation may reasonably be true, though they are not convinced

[Page 405]

that it is true, the prisoner is entitled
to an acquittal, because the Crown has not discharged the onus of proof
imposed upon it of satisfying the jury beyond reasonable doubt of the
prisoner’s guilt. That onus never changes, it always rests on the
prosecution. That is the law; the Court is not pronouncing new law, but is
merely restating it, and it is hoped that this re-statement may be of
assistance to those who preside at the trial of such cases.

This statement has come to be referred to by
text writers and by many judges as the statement of a “principle” or a
“doctrine”, but I prefer to think of it in terms of a rule of evidence as to
which all judges should charge a jury. The rule has been variously stated in
different cases, but in my view the essence of the matter is that in a case
such as the present one where it has been established that the accused was in
possession of recently stolen goods and where no explanation whatever has been
advanced, the jury should be instructed that the evidence of such possession
standing alone raises a prima facie case upon which they are entitled to
bring in a verdict of guilty.

In refusing to instruct the jury in the present
case as to the evidentiary effect of proof that the appellant was found in
possession of recently stolen goods, the learned trial judge had occasion to
say:

It seems to me to be incumbent upon the
Crown if it seeks to rely on the presumption to give some evidence relating as
to whether or not there was an explanation…

With the greatest respect for those who may hold
a different view, I am of opinion that the learned trial judge erred in
thinking that it was incumbent upon the Crown to call such evidence before it
could invoke the rule to which I have referred. To make proof as to whether or
not there was an explanation, a prerequisite to the application of the rule
might entail requiring the Crown to prove a negative before the rule could be
invoked and might indeed involve questioning all the persons with whom the
accused might have been in contact between the time of the theft and his
apprehension.

[Page 406]

It was, however, argued before us on behalf of
the respondent that the learned trial judge was right in thinking that some
evidence relating as to whether or not there was an explanation must be adduced
by the Crown if it seeks to rely on the rule. In this regard it should be noted
that the majority of the Court of Appeal rejected this proposition. Branca
J.A., while he dismissed the appeal on another ground, concluded that under the
circumstances of the present case there was no onus upon the Crown to produce
evidence of an explanation which might have been made by the respondent out of
Court and this opinion was obviously shared by the two dissenting judges. In my
view any other conclusion would have fixed the Crown with an untenable burden
and made the rule as to the evidentiary effect of proof of recent possession
almost completely unworkable.

In the case of R. v. Graham[9], the following passage occurs in the
reasons for judgment of the majority of this Court at p. 213:

There is nothing in any of these
authorities to suggest that in relying upon the presumption of guilt flowing
from possession of recently stolen goods, the Crown has the burden of proving
that no explanation has been given by the accused at any time prior to his
trial, or that if such an explanation has been given, it could not reasonably
be true.

The majority of the Court of Appeal, however,
dismissed this appeal on the ground that an instruction to the jury in
accordance with the rule which I have stated would constitute a comment on the
failure of the accused to testify contrary to the provisions of s. 4(5) of
the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10, which provides that:

The failure of the person charged, or of
the wife or husband of such person, to testify, shall not be made the subject
of comment by the judge, or by counsel for the prosecution.

This contention is based on the use of the words
“in the absence of any reasonable explanation” as they were employed by Lord
Reading in the Schama case, supra, and it is said that to tell a
jury that recent possession of stolen goods which is

[Page 407]

unexplained raises a prima facie case
upon which “the jury may, not that they must ….find the prisoner guilty” is
tantamount to commenting on the failure of the accused to testify.

This argument assumes that in using the words
“in the absence of any reasonable explanation” as he did, Lord Reading must be
deemed to have been referring to the failure of the accused to give evidence as
to a reasonable excuse for his possession. Mr. Justice Seaton, with whom
the majority of the Court of Appeal agreed in this regard, appears to have
adopted the view that this Court and the Court of Appeal of Ontario have both
accepted this approach when he says:

R. v. Graham, [1974] S.C.R. 206, and R. v. Hill, (1973) 10 C.C.C. (2d) 541,
have shown that the explanation properly in question is the explanation given
in the witness box by the accused.

In subscribing to this view, Branca J.A.
abstracts the following paragraph from a judgment of the majority of this Court
in the Graham case, supra.

“In cases such as that of Schama where
the accused has given an unsworn explanation before the trial and a later
explanation from the witness box in the presence of the jury, I think, with all
respect for those who take a different view, that when the Court of Appeal
refers to the result ‘if the jury think that the explanation may reasonably be
true’ they are to be taken to be referring to the sworn explanation which the
jury has heard and seen delivered in the Court rather than any unsworn
statement made before the trial.”

In the present case no evidence was adduced as
to any explanation given by the respondent before trial and he gave no evidence
himself, so that the circumstances which existed in the Schama case are
not present here. The fact that in a case where there is an explanation under
oath and one which is unsworn, the explanation under oath is the one to which
the judge is to be taken as referring when he states the rule, has no relevance
in a case where there is no explanation whatever.

[Page 408]

In the case of R. v. Hill, supra, to which
Mr. Justice Seaton referred, Gale C.J.O. said, at p. 542:

In our view, there is no obligation on the
Crown to show that no explanation was given prior to trial. If the accused is
found in the position where the doctrine of recent possession is applicable,
then it is encumbent upon him to give any explanation available to him and then
let the Court decide whether it reasonably could be true. In this respect I
will make reference to just one decision, that of the Court of Appeal of Quebec
in Messina v. The King (1926), 42 Que. K.B. 170, where this was said:

“Where the doctrine of recent possession is
applicable, all that the Crown need establish in the first instance is that the
goods were stolen and that they were in the accused’s possession…”

I do not think that the above passage is to be
construed as meaning that where recent possession has been established, the
accused is required to testify or that a verdict of guilty must necessarily
ensue from his failure to do so.

With the greatest respect for the contrary
opinions advanced in the Court of Appeal, I do not think that there is anything
in that case or in the Graham case, supra, to suggest that a
judge is commenting on the failure of an accused to testify when he instructs a
jury that evidence of recent possession, standing alone, raises a prima
facie case upon which they may but not must bring in a verdict of guilty of
theft.

It has been suggested that the effect of
instructing the jury in accordance with the rule is to place the burden of
proof on the accused, but as Lord Reading said in the Schama case “That
onus never changes, it always rests on the prosecution”, and it is not
inconsistent with this fundamental principle of our criminal law to say that
when the prosecution has proved facts beyond a reasonable doubt which
constitute a prima facie case against the accused, the jury is entitled
to bring in a verdict of guilty.

Here as I have said, there was no evidence of
any explanation of the stolen goods being found in the respondent’s possession
and in my view the

[Page 409]

provisions of s. 4(5)  of the Canada
Evidence Act  do not alter the instructions which a judge should give to a
jury in such a case. As Mr. Justice Taggart said in the present case, that
provision

is not a reason for the judge to not make
reference to the possession by the respondent of recently stolen goods as a
circumstance from which the jury might infer guilt because the inference of
guilt arises from possession alone.

As I stated at the outset, this appeal is
brought pursuant to the provisions of s. 621 (1)  (a) which
read as follows:

621. (1)
Where a judgment of a court of appeal sets aside a conviction pursuant to an
appeal taken under section 603 or 604 or dismisses an appeal taken
pursuant to paragraph 605 (1) (a) or subsection 605 (3), the
Attorney General may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada

(a) on any question of law on which
a judge of the court of appeal dissents, or…

The question of law which was the subject of
dissent in this case is whether “the learned trial judge was in error in
refusing to charge the jury on the inferences they might draw from the
possession by the respondent of recently stolen goods.”

As I have indicated, I am of opinion that the
learned trial judge was in error in this regard and I would accordingly allow
this appeal and direct that there be a new trial on counts two and three of the
indictment.

Martland, Judson, Spence and Beetz JJ. agreed
with the reasons of Pigeon J.

PIGEON J.—I have had the advantage of reading
the reasons written by Ritchie J. with whom I agree. I wish however to make the
following observations.

In my opinion, our judgment in R. v. Graham[10] is conclusive against the view that, in
order to rely on the doctrine of recent possession, the Crown must give some
evidence as to whether or not there was an explanation given.

[Page 410]

The neat point requiring consideration for the
first time in this Court, as far as I know, is as to what the instructions to
the jury should be when there is no evidence of an explanation and the accused has
not testified. How is this to be done so as to avoid saying anything that might
constitute a comment on the failure of the accused to testify contrary to the
provisions of s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act ? In all the
previous cases mentioned by Ritchie J., the accused had testified or there was
evidence of an explanation. Thus, the problem did not arise as it does here.

For the purposes of the present case, I will
assume that, under the circumstances, a direction to the jury in the exact
words of Lord Reading in Schama[11],
at p. 49, would, in view of what was decided in Bigaouette v. The King[12], be apt to be understood by a jury
as a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.

In the Court of Appeal[13], Branca J.A. thought that, on such view of
the matter, the trial judge’s refusal to give the direction to the jury was
justified. With respect, this is where I think he was in error. All the trial
judge had to do was to give the direction omitting the words: “in the absence
of any reasonable explanation”. In the circumstances of this case, those words
were unnecessary, there was no evidence of an explanation. If the trial judge
had given a direction to the jury in those terms, it would have been
unobjectionable and adequate in the circumstances.

As Seaton J.A. pointed out at p. 569: “It
must be kept in mind that an English Judge may comment upon the failure of an
accused to testify.” Therefore, in Schama, Lord Reading did not have to
worry about possible implications in a case where no explanation had been given.
Anyway, it was a case where explanations had been given. In the present case,
however, there was no evidence of

[Page 411]

any explanation. Therefore, the jury did not
have to be bothered with how they should be dealing with it if an explanation
had been offered. Only such instructions need be given as the case being tried
actually requires. There was absolutely no necessity for stating the rule with
the qualification “in the absence of any reasonable explanation”, when, on the
evidence, it was to be applied without qualification. In this connection, I
would direct attention to the manner in which the onus of proof was approached
by the English Court of Criminal Appeal in R. v. Spurge[14], at p. 212, a dangerous driving case:

It has been argued by counsel for the Crown
that even if a mechanical defect can operate as defence, yet the onus of
establishing this defence is upon the accused. It is of course conceded by the
Crown that this onus is discharged if the defence is made out on a balance of
probabilities. In the opinion of this court, the contention made on behalf of
the Crown is unsound, for in cases of dangerous driving the onus never shifts
to the defence. This does not mean that if the Crown proves that a motor-car
driven by the accused has endangered the public, the accused could successfully
submit at the end of the case for the prosecution that he had no case to answer
on the ground that the Crown had not negatived the defence of mechanical
defect. The court will consider no such special defence unless and until it is
put forward by the accused. Once, however, it has been put forward it must be
considered with the rest of the evidence in the case. If the accused’s
explanation leaves a real doubt in the mind of the jury, then the accused is
entitled to be acquitted. If the jury rejects the accused’s explanation, the
jury should convict.

In short, when the Crown has put in evidence
facts from which guilt may be inferred, whether it be possession of recently
stolen goods or driving objectively dangerous, the accused may be convicted
unless there is an explanation that may reasonably be true. When such an
explanation appears, whether in the evidence tendered by the Crown or brought
by the defence, it must be considered and will justify an acquittal if it
raises a reasonable doubt. This is what distinguishes facts from which guilt
may be inferred from facts giving rise to a

[Page 412]

legal presumption where the defence has the onus
of proving any admissible excuse on a balance of probabilities.

I would accordingly allow the appeal, set aside
the judgment of the Court of Appeal and the verdict of acquittal, and order a
new trial on counts 2 and 3 of the indictment.

Appeal allowed; new trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Motor vehicles—Civil rights—Breathaliser
demand—Reasonable excuse—Criminal Code , ss. 234 , 235(1) , (2) .

Appellant was given a breathaliser demand by
a police officer, who had reasonable and probable grounds for believing that he
had care or control of a motor vehicle, but he refused to give a sample of his
breath. He was acquitted in respect of the same occurrence of a charge under s.
234  but convicted of failing or refusing without reasonable excuse to comply
with the breathaliser demand. This conviction was affirmed on appeal.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

That a person is subsequently acquitted of a
charge under s. 234  or that a person was not in fact impaired or did not while
impaired have care or control of a motor vehicle is not a reasonable excuse for
refusing to provide a breath sample under s. 235(1) . Such a construction would
wipe out the difference between culpability under s. 234  and s. 235 . Reasonable
excuse under s. 235(2)  refers to matters which stand outside of the
requirements under s. 235(1)  which must be met before a s. 235(2)  charge can be
supported.

Brownridge v. The Queen, [1972] S.C.R. 926; R. v. Downey, [1970] R.T.R. 257; R. v. Richardson,
[1975] R.T.R. 173 referred to; R. v. Canstone (1971), 3 C.C.C. (2d)
539 (B.C.); R. v. Mitchell (1973), 11 C.C.C. (2d) 12 (B.C.) overruled; R.
v. Nadeau (1974), 19 C.C.C. (2d) 199 (N.B.); R. v. Nicholls, [1974]
1 W.W.R. 97 (Man.); R. v. Yuzicappi, [1975] W.W.D. 56 (Sask.) approved.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] affirming a
judgment of Fraser J. affirming, on a case stated by Waisberg Prov. Ct. J., a
conviction under s. 235  of the Criminal Code . Appeal dismissed.

R. Murray, for the appellant.

E.J. Hachborn, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The question in this appeal is
whether a person charged with an offence under s. 235(2)  of the Criminal
Code  is entitled to an acquittal by invoking as a reasonable excuse
thereunder the fact that he was acquitted, in respect of the very occurrence,
of a charge under s. 234 . Put another way, the issue raised is whether a charge
under s. 235(2)  may be defeated if on the trial thereof the Court concludes
that the accused was not in fact impaired or did not while impaired have care
or control of a motor vehicle, although the charge was the result of a proper
demand by a peace officer, under s. 235(1) , for a breath sample.

Sections 234  and 235  of the Criminal
Code  read as follows:

234. Every one who, while his ability to
drive a motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol or a drug, drives a motor vehicle
or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not,
is guilty of an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary
conviction…

235. (1) Where a peace officer on
reasonable and probable grounds believes that a person is committing, or at any
time within the preceding two hours has committed, an offence under
section 234 , he may, by demand made to that person forthwith or as soon as
practicable, require him to provide then or as soon thereafter as is
practicable a sample of his breath suitable to enable an analysis to be made in
order to determine the proportion, if any, of alcohol in his blood, 

[Page 387]

and to accompany the peace officer for the
purpose of enabling such a sample to be taken.

(2) Every one who, without reasonable
excuse, fails or refuses to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer
under subsection (1) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary
conviction and is liable to a fine of not less than fifty dollars and not more
than one thousand dollars or to imprisonment for not more than six months, or
both.

The present proceedings arose out of a charge
and conviction of failing or refusing without reasonable excuse to comply with
a demand by a peace officer for a breath sample. A case was stated by
Provincial Court Judge Waisberg and para. 1 thereof was as follows:

Did I err in law in holding that having
found as a fact that the appellant was not in the care or control of a motor
vehicle at the time and place alleged, that this was not a reasonable excuse to
fail or refuse to comply with the demand made by a Police Officer under Section 235 
of the Criminal Code  to provide a sample of breath suitable to enable analysis
to be made in order to determine the proportion, if any, of alcohol in his
blood, and to accompany a Peace Officer for the purpose of enabling such a
sample to be taken.

Fraser J. answered this question in the negative
and his judgment was affirmed in a unanimous judgment of the Ontario Court of
Appeal in comprehensive reasons delivered by Martin J.A.

I agree with the Courts below. The present case
is unembarrassed by any issue as to whether the peace officer who made the
demand here had reasonable and probable cause within s. 235(1) . Counsel for the
appellant conceded this. Two sentences from the reasons of Martin J.A. are
relevant on this point, and they are as follows:

In the present case it was not and could
not be contended that the officer did not have a belief based on reasonable and
probable grounds that the accused had the care or control of the motor vehicle.

[Page 388]

There was no suggestion that the officer
did not entertain a belief based on reasonable and probable grounds that the
accused’s ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired.

The contention of the appellant is that a
reasonable excuse, ex post facto so to speak, arises on a charge under
s. 235(2)  if the accused did not in fact have care or control or was not
impaired. This contention invites a self-defeating construction of s. 235  and
would wipe out the difference, clearly made in ss. 234  and 235 , between
culpability under the one and under the other. Counsel would have it that a
person who cannot be found guilty under s. 234  becomes immune to guilt under s.
235(2) , although the requirements for a proper demand for a breath sample have
been met. Reasonable excuse, under s. 235(2) , refers, in my view, to matters
which stand outside of the requirements which must be met (i.e. those
under s. 235(1) ) before a charge can be supported under s. 235(2) . See,
for example, Brownridge v. The Queen[2].

I do not find it necessary for the purposes of
this appeal to consider the differences between the comparable English
legislation, canvassed in R. v. Downey[3],
and in R. v. Richardson[4], and
the Canadian legislation. The single issue in the present case has no relation
to those differences. It follows from my opinion that I regard R. v. Canstone[5] (B.C.S.C.) and R. v. Mitchell[6] (B.C.S.C.) as wrongly decided and
that I regard R. v. Nadeau[7] (N.B.C.A.),
R. v. Nicholls[8], (Man.
C.A.) and R. v. Yuzicappi[9], (Sask.
C.A.), as correctly decided.

[Page 389]

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Evidence—Oral statement by
accused to police officer—Failure to hold voir dire—Error on part of trial
judge in admitting evidence with respect to oral statement—Miscarriage of
justice.

Appellant was charged with two counts arising
out of the same incident, one of indecent assault and one of assault causing
bodily harm. At his trial by a judge without a jury the central question was
that of identity.

The complainant was attacked in a parking lot
and shortly thereafter a man was seen standing over her with his hand up as if
to strike her. After shouting at the man, the complainant’s common-law husband
pursued him to a parking lot in the next block. He there lost sight of him but
subsequently saw a man he was sure was the same man, near a truck. This man,
later identified as appellant, was removed with some difficulty to a building
in front of the parking lot and police were summoned.

Two police constables arrived and they spoke
first to the complainant. During this conversation she pointed to appellant who
was seated in plain view some 15 feet away, and stated that he was her
attacker. As a result, the constables took appellant into the street and there
charged and cautioned him and challenged him with the information they had
received from the complainant. Appellant denied being in the area and denied
being with any woman. At this point he was placed in the cruiser car and one of
the constables sat with him while the other constable attended to other duties.

While in the cruiser car, the constable again
asked appellant about his connection with the incident. Appellant then said he
had been helping the woman. However, after being removed to the Public Safety Building,

[Page 363]

where he was questioned by detectives, the
appellant twice repeated having no knowledge of the occurrence.

As part of its case, the Crown offered the
evidence of the oral statement made by the accused to the police officer while
they were both seated alone in the cruiser. The statement was admitted without
a voir dire. The accused was found guilty at trial under both counts and
his appeal to the Court of Appeal was unsuccessful. With leave, the appellant
then appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial ordered.

The proposition could not be accepted that if
a trial judge directs himself to the question of the voluntariness of a
statement and is satisfied on the whole of the evidence of the guilt of the accused,
there is no need for a voir dire. Nor could it be accepted that, in the
case at bar, the accused “volunteered the statement”. The onus at all times
remains with the prosecution to establish that any statement by an accused
offered in evidence against him is voluntary in the fullest sense of the word,
and that onus was not discharged here.

The further submission that the evidence as
to the oral statement having been received without any objection by counsel for
the accused, this silence amounted to an admission that the statement was
voluntary, was not well founded. While it might be accepted in a proper case
that counsel for an accused may well waive the holding of a voir dire, there
is a considerable difference between an expressed waiver surrounded by all the
precautions indicating that the question has been examined in depth and mere
silence on counsel’s part. The heavy onus resting on the Crown certainly cannot
be displaced in such an informal fashion.

On the question of miscarriage of justice, the
statement that the accused was at the scene, albeit only to help the
complainant, was of major importance. The admission of the statement without a voir
dire was a fundamental error which may have affected the outcome of the
trial, and, accordingly, contrary to the opinion of the Court of Appeal, the
provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  had no
application.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Manitoba[1], dismissing an
appeal by the accused from his conviction on charges of indecent assault and
assault causing bodily harm. Appeal allowed.

G.G. Brodsky, for the appellant.

J.G. Dangerfield, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DE GRANDPRÉ J.—Appellant was charged with two
counts arising out of the same incident, one of indecent assault and one of
assault causing bodily harm. Tried by a judge without a jury, he was found
guilty under both counts and sentenced to five years imprisonment. His appeal
to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba was unsuccessful. By order of this Court, he was granted leave on
the following questions of law:

1. Was the learned trial judge wrong in law
in admitting the evidence of Police Constable Llewellyn Fisher with respect to
an oral statement made by the Appellant when in custody, when no voir dire was
held concerning the admissibility of such statement and no ruling was made as
to the voluntariness of such statement?

2. Did the Court of Appeal for Manitoba err in dismissing the Appeal of
the Appellant by applying the provisions of Section 613(1) (b)(iii) of the
Criminal Code ?

The facts established by the Crown witnesses are
simple and uncontradicted, no evidence having been tendered by the defence.

In the early morning hours of August 16, 1972,
the complainant, Mrs. Olive Genaille and her common-law husband, John
Peters, were walking on Main Street, in Winnipeg,
accompanied by Peters’ dog. As they approached the Occidental Hotel, Peters
went into the restaurant to get a cup of coffee. Mrs. Genaille remained
outside with the dog. The dog got loose and went into a parking lot on the
south side of the hotel. Mrs. Genaille followed the dog, and, as she moved
toward the back of the lot she was grabbed from behind and thrown to the
ground. Her attacker then kicked

[Page 365]

her in the face and stomach and tried to pull
her slacks down.

About this time, Peters became concerned about
the complainant and the dog and sent Douglas Michelle, a young boy employed in
the restaurant, into the street to look for her. When Michelle returned, both
he and Peters ran into the street and to the parking lot. Peters’ attention was
attracted by the dog and someone crying. He saw a man standing over
Mrs. Genaille with his hand up as if to strike her. When Peters shouted at
him, the man ran down the lane. Both Peters and Michelle pursued him to a
parking lot behind a building in the next block occupied by an organization
known as the “Main Street Project”. There Peters lost sight of the man he was
pursuing, but did subsequently see a man he was sure was the same man, near a
truck. This man, later identified as appellant, was removed with some
difficulty to the “Main Street Project” building and police were summoned.

When Constables Fisher and Melvin arrived, they
spoke first to Mrs. Genaille. During this conversation she pointed to
appellant who was seated in plain view some 15 feet away, and stated that he
was her attacker. As a result, Constables Fisher and Melvin took appellant into
the street and there charged and cautioned him and challenged him with the
information they had received from Mrs. Genaille. Appellant denied being
in the area and denied being with any woman. At this point he was placed in the
cruiser car and Constable Fisher sat with him while Constable Melvin arranged
for the other people involved to be driven to the Public
 Safety Building.

While in the cruiser car, Constable Fisher again
asked appellant about his connection with the incident. Appellant then said he
had been helping the woman. This part of the evidence is the relevant one for
the purpose of this appeal and I will return to it shortly.

[Page 366]

Appellant was removed to the Public Safety
 Building where he was seen by Detectives Hutcheon and
Law. Under charge and caution and after the circumstances had been given him
again, appellant told Hutcheon and Law that he had not been in the area and had
not been involved with any woman.

As pointed out by the trial judge, the only true
issue was that of identity. I have already underlined that, as part of its
case, the Crown offered the evidence of an oral statement made by the accused
to police officer Fisher when both were seated alone in the cruiser car for
three or four minutes. Fisher testified:

Mr. Powell was asked again about his
presence, his connection with the incident and at that time he informed me he
had been helping the woman, Mrs. Genaille, chasing away another woman.

Fisher then indicated that Powell might have
stated that he was chasing someone away. I do not attach any importance to the
fact that the statement is not as clear as it could be. If admissible, it
would, in my view, support the conclusion of the trial judge.

Was the statement admissible without a voir
dire? It must first be remembered that the conversation reported in the
above quotation took place in a context. When the police officers first made
the accused aware of the purpose of their investigation, they were met with a
flat denial that he had been in the vicinity of the hotel. Again, a few minutes
later, upon being charged and cautioned by the police officers, he denied
involvement. It is only when Constable Melvin was busy attending to some other
duties that the impugned conversation took place. Later on, that same night, when
questioned by detectives, the accused twice repeated having no knowledge of the
occurrence.

It is conceded by the Crown that in principle
before a statement of any kind can be admitted in evidence against a person
accused, it must be shown by the prosecution to the satisfaction of the trial
judge to have been freely and voluntarily made by that accused person. This
principle, of

[Page 367]

course, has been repeatedly stated by this
Court, particularly in Sankey v. The King[2];
Piché v. The Queen[3];
John v. The Queen[4], and
R. v. Gauthier, a judgment of June 26, 1975, still unreported.

But adds counsel for the Crown, the Court of
Appeal was right when it concluded (p. 22):

In our view, it would have been preferable
for the trial Judge to have conducted a formal voir dire, then ruling on
the voluntariness of the statement which placed the accused at the scene of the
alleged offence; but it is perfectly plain from his reasons for judgment that
he directed himself to that question and considered the statement to be voluntary.

In the course of his reasons, he said:

He volunteered the statement that he tried
to help her and then, later on when he is questioned at the Public Safety
Building by two sets of detectives, he denies knowing anything again.

On the whole of the evidence, the trial
Judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.

I am unable to accede to the proposition that if
a trial judge directs himself to the question of the voluntariness of a
statement and is satisfied on the whole of the evidence of the guilt of the
accused, there is no need for a voir dire. Nor am I ready to accept
that, in the case at bar, the accused “volunteered the statement”. The fact
that Powell, prior to making the impugned statement to Constable Fisher, had
twice denied to the police officers his presence in the vicinity of the
Occidental Hotel at the time of the incident and that this denial was repeated
to the detectives who subsequently took over the investigation of this case
clearly shows that the rule had to be applied without question. The trial judge
was therefore wrong in law in admitting the evidence of police officer Fisher
with respect to the oral statement quoted above. The onus at all times remains
with the prosecution to establish that any statement by an accused offered in
evidence against him is voluntary in the fullest sense of the word, and that
onus was not discharged here. Accordingly, there is no need for me to examine
the following decisions relied upon by

[Page 368]

the Crown: R. v. Spencer[5]; R. v. Sweezey[6]; R. v. Rushton[7]. It is sufficient to note that these
cases deal with facts quite different from ours.

The Crown further submits that, the evidence of
Constable Fisher having been received without any objection by counsel for the
accused, this silence amounts to an admission that the statement was voluntary.
Although the point was mentioned by Hall J.A., it was not dealt with in the
Court of Appeal. For my part, I do not believe that this submission is well
founded. While I might be ready to accept in a proper case that counsel for an
accused may well waive the holding of a voir dire, I see a considerable
difference between an expressed waiver surrounded by all the precautions
indicating that the question has been examined in depth and mere silence on
counsel’s part. The heavy onus resting on the Crown certainly cannot be
displaced in such an informal fashion.

I now turn to the second question, namely
miscarriage of justice. On this aspect, Hall J.A. stated (p. 22).

In our opinion, his failure to conduct a
formal voir dire may have been in error, but in the circumstances we
would invoke s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code and dismiss the
appeal on that ground, being of the opinion that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice occurred.

I note that for the second time the learned
appeal judge uses the expression “formal voir dire”. I assume that this
is a slip of the pen because no voir dire at all was held and, in any
event, I cannot see any difference between an informal voir dire and a formal
one.

On the conclusion that no substantial wrong
occurred in the present instance, I find myself with respect in complete
disagreement with the Court of Appeal. The statement that the accused was at
the scene, albeit only trying to help Mrs. Genaille,

[Page 369]

was of major importance. The following paragraph
taken from the trial judgment makes it clear:

I am faced with two kinds of evidence. Most
of it is circumstantial which by itself would not, applying the Rule dealing
with circumstantial evidence, lead me irresistably only to one conclusion, one
reasonable explanation—that is, that the accused was responsible. But we also
have one bit of direct evidence from the accused himself when he places himself
at the scene. This removes any doubt that leeds me to the conslusion that he
was there and responsible for the assault.

The admission of the statement without a voir
dire was a fundamental error which may have affected the outcome of the
trial so that the provisions of s. 613 of the Code have no application,
Colpitts v. The Queen[8].

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal,
quash the conviction and order a new trial.

Appeal allowed; new trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Criminal negligence causing
death—Mens rea—Breach of the Aeronautics Act —Evidence—Admissibility of similar
facts—Sufficiency of explanations given to the jury—Aeronautics Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. A-3—Criminal Code , ss. 191 , 192  (now 202 - 203).

On July 3, 1968 appellant, who was at the
control of his aircraft in an uninhabited region of northern Quebec, was flying
very low over two persons on the ground whom he was supposed to take back to
civilization, and one of them (Giguère) was hit by a part of the aircraft and
fatally injured. There was no need for appellant to act in this manner, and his
manoeuvre, which consisted in diving toward the men on the ground to frighten them,
was described in aeronautical terms as a “pass”. Appellant was charged under
s. 191  of the Criminal code  (now s. 202 ) with criminal
negligence causing death, and a jury convicted him. He was sentenced to two
years’ imprisonment.

The conviction and sentence were affirmed by
a majority in the Quebec Court of Appeal. Hence the appeal to this Court.
Appellant relied on two arguments: (1) evidence of so-called “similar” facts
(three “passes” before Giguère’s death) was not admissible; (2) the trial judge
did not make it sufficiently clear to the jury that a mere breach of the
federal Aeronautics Act  and the regulations made thereunder did not, in
itself, constitute criminal negligence.

Held (Laskin
C.J., Dickson and Beetz JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Spence, Pigeon and de Grandpré JJ.: Appellant’s grounds of
appeal should be examined in the light of the decisions which examined the
notions of recklessness and advertent negligence contained in ss. 191  and 192  (now
202 and 203) of the Criminal Code , which are new law (1953-54).

With respect to the admissibility of “similar
facts”, it must be remembered that in a case such as the one before the Court,
the Crown is required to prove: (a) the

[Page 340]

breach of an obligation imposed by law; (b)
that the breach indicated wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or
safety of other persons. Although in most cases, the fact itself proves the
intent, and that was the situation in this case, this would in no way prevent
the Crown from going one step further and proving by the similar conduct of
appellant in other circumstances of the same type that the mens rea definitely
existed. The Privy Council recognized the admissibility of this evidence if it
be relevant to an issue before the jury, and held that it may be so relevant if
it bears upon the question whether the acts alleged were designed or
accidental, or to rebut a defence which would otherwise be open to the accused.
The evidence of similar facts is admissible, not to prove commission of the
crime mentioned in the indictment but to establish guilty intent. The trial
judge’s charge shows that he clearly made the necessary distinction regarding
similar facts and gave the jury the necessary instructions.

Although the trial judge did not make it
clear to the jury that a mere breach of the Aeronautics Act  was not
necessarily proof of the “wanton or reckless disregard” required by the
definition of the crime of criminal negligence, he presented the point at issue
squarely to the jurors and made it clear that the Crown must prove each and all
of the points of the crime, the essential element of which was that the accused
had shown wanton or reckless disregard.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Dickson J., dissenting: In examining the admissibility of
similar fact evidence, our highest courts have applied the general exclusionary
rule that the accused has only to answer the specific charge contained in the
indictment. However, the courts have recognized the need to make an exception
to the rule and admit evidence of similar acts, not to prove the accused’s
disposition to commit the crime charged but where it is relevant to prove
identity or intent or to negative accident or mistake or to rebut a defence
otherwise open to an accused. However, evidence of other offences is admissible
to negative a defence of innocent intent or accident only if such a defence is
raised by an accused or it can be said from the facts that it will be open to
the accused. In these circumstances, the judge should have awaited some
intimation that accident was going to be raised as a ground of defence before
admitting similar fact evidence to rebut a possible but improbable defence of
accident. The Crown does not have the right to “credit the accused with fancy

[Page 341]

defences”.

After this evidence was admitted to rebut a
defence which was never advanced, it became at the very least the duty of the
trial judge to instruct the jury to disregard that evidence. Not only did he
fail to do so, but he used the similar fact evidence to condemn the accused in
the strongest terms. Although advising the jury to make a distinction between
the offence charged and similar acts, the judge instructed the jury that the
evidence of similar acts gave accuracy to the testimony of a Crown witness.
This was error. It was also reversible error on the part of the judge to tell
the jury that, notwithstanding the failure of the accused to establish any
facts supporting a defence which the evidence of similar acts could rebut, the
similar fact evidence nonetheless retained all of its validity. By describing
in detail the three incidents, which were considered as similar facts, and
stating that the evidence of these incidents helped to confirm the act of the
accused on July 3, 1968, the judge led the jury to decide the culpability of
the accused not only for his act of July 3 but also for his conduct in these
three incidents. The accused was placed in the position of having to defend
four separate acts and not one. These errors go to the very root of the case
and are of such nature and gravity as to entitle appellant to a new trial.

Beetz J., (dissenting): Even if
it were conceded that the evidence of similar acts was admissible, the trial
judge had to distinguish clearly between the similar acts and the act with
which appellant was charged. He attempted to do so but he definitely did not
succeed.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal
of Quebec[1] which affirmed the verdict of guilty delivered by a jury. Appeal
dismissed, Laskin C.J. and Dickson and Beetz JJ. dissenting.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Dickson J. was
delivered by

DICKSON J. (dissenting)—The appellant
accused was convicted by a jury on a charge of criminal negligence causing
death, contrary to ss. 191  and 192  of the Criminal Code  (now ss. 202  and
203 ) in these words:

[TRANSLATION] On or near July 3, 1968 at Lake Hendry, county of Duplessis, district of Hauterive,
Jean-Paul Leblanc, of Baie-Comeau, did unlawfully and by criminal negligence
cause the death of another person, namely Patrick Guy Giguère, ss. 191 and 192
of the Criminal Code .

The trial judge sentenced the accused to two
years’ imprisonment. The conviction and sentence were affirmed by a majority in
the Quebec Court of Appeal (Owen and Salvas JJ.A., Rivard J.A. dissenting) and
the appeal to this Court comes as of right on a question of law in respect of
which there was a dissent in the Court of Appeal.

The basic facts are few and straightforward. On
July 3, 1968 Evariste Normand and Patrick Guy Giguère, employees of the
Province of Quebec, were flying to Fort Chimo aboard a Beaver aircraft, the
property of the Department of Transport and Communications of Quebec and
piloted by the accused, Jean-Paul Leblanc. The day was warm and sunny with
no wind. En route the aircraft landed at Lake Hendry at 8:30 a.m. as Normand and Giguère
had work to do in that area. The pilot agreed to return for them at about 2:00 p.m. At the appointed hour, their work
completed, Normand and Giguère walked to the middle of a clearing, facing the
sun, amid the heat and flies, to await the aircraft. Normand testified that
they saw it approaching at an altitude of 500 feet when it was about 2,000 feet
away. The aircraft made a complete circle to the left and then came toward
them, in a dive. Normand escaped injury by throwing himself upon the ground.
Giguère, not as fortunate, was struck by an underpart of the air-

[Page 343]

craft and killed. Aboard the aircraft was a
passenger by the name of Joseph Tremblay who testified that the pilot, for
amusement, had decided to dive toward the two men on the ground in order to
frighten them. This is what is termed “making a pass” and it was, it would
seem, a common practice of the accused and some of the other bush pilots flying
in that remote region. On this occasion, as the accused and Tremblay flew
overhead above Normand and Giguère, the accused tapped Tremblay on the
shoulder, pointed to the two men on the ground below, and laughing, said in
French, “I think we ought to make a pass—let us frighten them”; he then put the
aircraft into a dive. The accused miscalculated the distance between ground and
aircraft, and the tragic accident resulted. At about 7:00 p.m. the same evening
the accused visited the widow of Giguère to ask her pardon for causing the
death of his good friend, her husband. He explained that he had wanted to make
a “pass”, being in the habit of doing this. At the trial the accused testified
on his own behalf. He limited himself to saying he was a licensed pilot but he
did not offer any explanation or excuse for his act. There was just one simple
issue to put before the jury—in making the “pass”, did the accused show “wanton
or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons”?

The appellant raises two principal grounds of
appeal, (i) the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of similar facts,
adduced by the Crown, showing that during the weeks preceding the fatality the
appellant had made several low “passes” over persons on the ground and over
boats on a lake; (ii) the trial judge erred in his charge to the jury by not
sufficiently explaining that a violation of the regulations passed pursuant to
the federal Aeronautics Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. A-3, did not by itself
constitute criminal negligence.

Neither counsel has cited any case in which
similar fact evidence has been admitted on a crimi-

[Page 344]

nal negligence charge; the issue usually arises
in murder, abortion or gross indecency cases. The principles to be applied,
however, in considering the admissibility of similar facts are reasonably well
established. The general rule was stated by Lord Herschell L.C. in the leading
case of Makin v. Attorney-General for New South Wales[2], at p. 65:

…It is undoubtedly not competent for the
prosecution to adduce evidence tending to shew that the accused has been guilty
of criminal acts other than those covered by the indictment, for the purpose of
leading to the conclusion that the accused is a person likely from his criminal
conduct or character to have committed the offence for which he is being tried.

The same general rule found expression in Rex
v. Bond[3], in
the judgment of Kennedy J., at pp. 395-396, in words which seem to me
particularly apt in the case at bar:

When a prisoner is charged with an offence
it is of the utmost importance to him that the facts laid before the jury
should consist exclusively of the transaction which forms the subject of the
indictment which alone he can be expected to come prepared to answer. It is
therefore a general rule that the facts proved must be strictly relevant to the
particular charge and have no reference to any conduct of the prisoner
unconnected with such charge; therefore it is not allowable to shew on the
trial of an indictment that the prisoner has a general disposition to commit
the same kind of offence as that for which he stands indicted: Russell on
Crimes, 6th ed. (1896) vol. 3, p. 403. Thus it was resolved by all the
judges nearly one hundred years ago in Rex v. Cole, ((1) Mich. T. 1810. Cited from M.S., Russell on
Crimes, 6th ed. vol. 3, p. 403, note (n).)

This passage by Kennedy J., equally apt,
follows, at p. 398:

Nothing can so certainly be counted upon to
make a prejudice against an accused upon his trial as the disclosure to the
jury of other misconduct of a kind similar to that which is the subject of the
indictment, and, indeed, when the crime alleged is one of a revolting
character, such as the charge against Bond in the present case, and

[Page 345]

the hearer is a person who has not been
trained to think judicially, the prejudice must sometimes be almost
insurmountable.

Rex v. Bond was
followed in this Court in R. v. Barbour[4],
at p. 467. Also in this court one finds the observation of Taschereau
J. in Koufis v. The King[5] at
p. 490, to this effect:

When an accused is tried before the
Criminal Courts, he has to answer the specific charge mentioned in the
indictment for which he is standing on trial, “and the evidence must be limited
to matters relating to the transaction which forms the subject of the
indictment” (Maxwell v. Director of Public Prosecutions, (1935) A.C.
309). Otherwise, “the real issue may be distracted from the minds of the jury,”
and an atmosphere of guilt may be created which would indeed prejudice the
accused.

The general exclusionary rule, fundamental to
our law of evidence, has thus found acceptance by our highest courts and for
very good reasons, cogently stated by Wigmore, Evidence (3rd ed., 1940),
art. 194: (1) The over-strong tendency to believe the defendant guilty of
the charge merely because he is a likely person to do such acts; (2) The
tendency to condemn, not because he is believed guilty of the present charge,
but because he has escaped unpunished from other offences; (3) The injustice of
attacking one necessarily unprepared to demonstrate that the attacking evidence
is fabricated.

There is, however, a limited but legitimate area
of exception to the general exclusionary rule that the accused has only to
answer the specific charge contained in the indictment. The exception was
formulated in Makin’s case where, after stating the exclusionary rule,
Lord Herschell continued with this passage:

On the other hand, the mere fact that the
evidence adduced tends to shew the commission of other crimes does not render
it inadmissible if it be relevant to an issue before the jury, and it may be so
relevant if it bears upon the question whether the acts alleged to constitute
the crime charged in the indictment were designed or

[Page 346]

accidental, or to rebut a defence which
would otherwise be open to the accused.

Over the years some gloss has been put upon the words
of Lord Herschell in such well‑known cases as Thompson v. The King[6], R. v. Sims[7], Noor Mohamed v. R.[8] and Harris v. D.P.P.[9] The result has been that the courts
have admitted evidence of similar acts, not to prove the accused’s disposition
to commit the crime charged but where it is relevant to prove identity or
intent or to negative accident or mistake or to rebut a defence otherwise open
to an accused.

On a charge of criminal negligence, evidence
adduced by the Crown disclosing that by his conduct the accused showed wanton
or reckless disregard for the lives and safety of other persons is prima
facie evidence of criminal negligence. Laskin J., as he then was,
dissenting in Arthurs v. The Queen[10],
at pp. 306-307, commented on the mens rea of criminal negligence:

Although the question of the type of mens
rea involved in criminal negligence, as defined in s. 191(1), was not
directly in issue in the judgments of this Court in O’Grady v. Sparling,
Binus v. The Queen, and Peda v. The Queen, these cases support the
conclusion that subjective intent is not a necessary ingredient of criminal
negligence.

That is to say, the mens rea of criminal
negligence is determined by an objective standard. The majority of the Court in
that case did not disagree with the statement by Laskin J. It is doubtful that
similar fact evidence would be admissible to prove subjective intent—proof of
subjective intent not being a requisite of the offence.

[Page 347]

In any event, the Crown contends in this case
that the similar fact evidence was properly adduced in anticipation of a
“defence” of accident caused, for instance, by the mechanical failure of the
airplane or other circumstance beyond control of the appellant. Evidence of
other offences is admissible to negative a defence of innocent intent or
accident only if such a defence is raised by an accused or it can be said from
the facts of the case that such a defence was rationally open to the accused. A
question also arises as to when such evidence should be introduced. In Brunet
v. The King[11] at
p. 85, Idington J. said:

Whether such proof should in all cases be
tendered in support of the case for the prosecution or only be given by way of
rebuttal must depend upon the particular circumstances of each case.

The English rule would seem to be that evidence
as to other occasions should not be admitted “unless and until the defence of
accident or mistake, or absence of intention … is definitively put forward”: Perkins
v. Jeffery[12], at
p. 709. As appears from the headnote in Brunet v. The King, supra, the
accused was charged with having unlawfully used means to procure a miscarriage.
His defence was that of innocent and lawful purpose. The evidence of other
women that he had previously practised abortion on them by a similar method was
held to be admissible in rebuttal. Anglin J. said, at p. 108:

Nor have I any doubt that the evidence was
properly received in rebuttal. It was offered to meet the defence of innocent
purpose put forward by the accused. While such a defence was always open, there
was no probability of its being set up until the prisoner gave his testimony.
It was then actually in issue.

There are several Canadian authorities to the
effect that it is not necessary to withhold evidence of similar acts until the
defence puts forward a

[Page 348]

case of innocent or lawful purpose: Rex v.
Anderson[13]; R.
v. Cline[14]. The
argument in support of this latter position is that a plea of not guilty puts
everything in issue and that the Crown should not split its case by giving in
rebuttal, instead of in chief, confirmatory evidence in its possession. There
is no hard and fast rule: Holmes v. The King[15]. Much will depend upon the course
which the proceedings take. It would seem to me, however, that the Crown should
not adduce evidence of other similar acts unless it appears from what was said
at the time of arrest or from the evidence presented by the Crown at trial or
from the cross-examination of Crown witnesses or from the evidence of defence
witnesses that the defence which the evidence of similar acts is intended to
refute is really in issue; otherwise the accused may be gravely prejudiced by
evidence introduced ostensibly to meet a possible defence but in truth to
bolster the case for the Crown.

In Brunet v. The King, supra, Anglin J.,
at p. 99, adopted Darling J. who said in Rex v. Bond, supra, that
Lord Herschell did not mean:

…that such evidence might be called to
rebut any defence possibly open but of an intention to rely on which there was
no probability whatever.

To be admissible the evidence must be relevant
to some issue before the jury in respect of the act charged in the indictment.
Mere similarity is not of itself enough.

I do not think the evidence of similar acts
introduced in this case was admissible on the ground suggested or on any other
ground. The accused did not intend to kill Giguère or to cause him bodily harm,
otherwise he would have faced a murder charge. He intended to make a
“pass” with the aircraft; his real intent, his identity and the actus reus were
never in doubt or an issue. There was nothing in the evidence of Tremblay or

[Page 349]

of Normand or of Mrs. Giguère to suggest
mechanical failure or aircraft defect which might support a defence of
accident. The aircraft was inspected two days later and found to be in good flying
condition. In these circumstances, I incline to the view, with great respect,
that the judge should have awaited some intimation that accident was going to
be raised as a ground of defence before admitting similar fact evidence to
rebut a possible but improbable defence of accident.

The Crown does not have the right to “credit the
accused with fancy defences”: Lord Sumner in Thompson v. The King, supra. Viscount
Simon in Harris v. D.P.P., supra, said that what Lord Sumner meant by
this expression was that “evidence of similar facts involving the accused ought
not to be dragged in to his prejudice without reasonable cause”. The evidence
of “passes” made by the accused at other times served only to brand him as a
reckless character with a disposition for dangerous acts and little concern for
his own life or the lives of others. He was surrounded by an aura of guilt that
might well have prejudiced the chance of the jury fairly trying the case.

I am further of the opinion that when the
similar fact evidence was admitted to rebut a defence which, as it transpired,
was never advanced, it became at the very least the duty of the trial judge to
instruct the jury to disregard that evidence. He failed to do so. Instead he
used the similar fact evidence to condemn the accused in strongest terms. Early
in the charge the judge said:

[TRANSLATION] YOU must forget for the
moment the evidence of similar acts, because he is not on trial for having
committed those acts. Thus, you must make a distinction. That evidence was only
admitted in order to support evidence of the accused’s intention to act as he
did on July 3, 1968, with respect to Normand and Giguère, and to preclude a
defence that the descent towards the persons on the ground was due to
mechanical failure, or to fortuitous causes beyond the pilot’s control.
Accordingly, as I shall explain to you in due

[Page 350]

course, the evidence of similar acts gives
the testimony of Tremblay, who took part in those similar acts, an appearance
of exceptional accuracy, in that, having… being a passenger, he was in the
aircraft at the time of what were described as “three passes”.

Although advising the jury to make a distinction
between the offence charged and the similar acts, the judge instructed the jury
that the evidence of similar acts gives exceptional accuracy to the testimony
of the Crown witness Tremblay. This was error.

Later in the charge the judge referred to the
evidence of similar acts at length, describing the minutiae of each incident.
To appreciate the gravity of the misdirection, it becomes necessary to quote
further extracts from the charge. The judge said:

[TRANSLATION] Similar acts are acts of the
same type as one of the essential elements of the crime charged. For there to
be a crime in the case at bar it is necessary for the death to have been caused
by criminal negligence within the meaning of s. 191. These acts, then, are
acts of the same type, evidence of which was designed to refute a defence that
the accused might otherwise have put forward.

He continued by telling the jury of the defences
the accused might have advanced:

[TRANSLATION] An important means of defence
which the accused might have put forward in the present case, would be to
establish the facts and circumstances showing that the accused had started the
descent in a dive because it was necessary for him to do so because of… a
mechanical defect, or that he did not act voluntarily, and that he did not act
freely, …that he did not undertake the nose dive, flying near the ground above
the persons he was to meet, through wanton or reckless disregard or by failing
in his duty.

The judge then, improperly in my view,
instructed the jury on the failure of the accused to establish any of those
defences:

[TRANSLATION] NOW that the hearing is
concluded, it can be said that the defence did not succeed in establishing this
point. The point was one which the defence did not establish. Accordingly, the
evidence of similar acts still retains all its validity, and the need to
authorize it is now apparent, as it was during the voir dire.

[Page 351]

I am of the opinion it was reversible error on
the part of the judge to tell the jury that notwithstanding the failure of the
accused to establish any facts supporting a defence which the evidence of
similar acts could rebut, the similar fact evidence nonetheless retained all of
its validity. Why? By the end of the trial and prior to the charge by the judge
it was apparent to all that the anticipated defence which the evidence was
intended to rebut had not been raised. The only possible justification for the
evidence had disappeared.

The judge once more instructed the jury that the
similar fact evidence supported the evidence of the Crown witness Tremblay:

[TRANSLATION] In effect, it supports the
testimony of Tremblay, as a passenger, during the incident. Tremblay was a
passenger during the nose dive over Fauchon and Proulx, and he was a passenger
during the nose dive over Mrs. Giguère’s group at Whales Head. The
evidence of these distinct but similar occurrences served to confirm the
testimony of Tremblay, during the event, since he had then acquired standards
of comparison for judging the speed and angle of descent. When he made the
passes, over Fauchon, over Mrs. Giguère’s group, two passes witnessed by
Tremblay, since the latter was a passenger at the time, and when… when he came
to the last pass, the fatal pass, which was to kill Giguère, Tremblay, having
undergone the two earlier experiences, was in a position to compare, and to
tell the Court, from the comparison made by him, of the disregard and
foolhardiness of the accused.

The judge then narrated the first of the similar
acts in respect of which evidence was adduced, in which the accused had passed
at low altitude over the heads of Cpl. Proulx and Cpl. Fauchon and concluded
his review of this incident in these words:

[TRANSLATION] Here again, we have direct
evidence of the occurrence, evidence given by Fauchon, and evidence given by
Tremblay, we have direct evidence of the intention not to do his duty, to fly
his aircraft with wanton and reckless disregard for the lives or safety of
other persons, and when he fails to do his duty, he is flying recklessly within
the meaning of the Aeronautics Act .

The judge used the evidence of Fauchon, who was
not involved in any way in the incident giving rise

[Page 352]

to the charge against the accused, as direct
evidence of the intention of the accused not to do his duty, to fly his
aircraft with wanton and reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other
persons, adding that when he fails to do his duty he is flying recklessly
within the meaning of the Aeronautics Act . The judge erred in my view in
speaking at one and the same time of the imprudence with which the Aeronautics
Act  is concerned and with the recklessness which is an ingredient of a
charge of criminal negligence. A jury might well gain the impression that if
the accused was in breach of the duty owed by him under the Aeronautics Act  he
could be guilty of the type of recklessness prescribed by the Criminal Code .
This is error of the nature of that which earned the accused a new trial in
R. v. Titchner[16], a
decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in a highway traffic fatality case.

The judge then reviewed an incident in which the
accused had made a “pass” over two men who had been sport fishing and concluded
this review with the following instruction to the jury:

[TRANSLATION] In this incident, we again
have direct evidence of his wanton and reckless disregard, contrary to what was
his duty, endangering the lives and safety of other persons.

With respect, the conduct of the accused on this
occasion was irrelevant to the charge which the accused faced and the jury
should have been so instructed. Instead they were told to regard it as direct
evidence of wanton and reckless conduct by the accused.

A third incident was then canvassed and the
judge concluded with these words:

[TRANSLATION] YOU can ask yourselves
whether he was in fact endangering the lives and safety of these persons. The
very fact of the accident involving Giguère proves that such an accident could
have occurred at any time, on any of the three occasions described above, if,
that is, turbulence was encountered, the engine faltered for any of a number of
reasons, he was unable to maintain his low altitude and descended below it, or
if he committed the error referred to by an expert witness for the defence,
namely that when you are a certain

[Page 353]

distance from the ground it is almost
impossible to calculate the distance between the ground and the plane.

These similar facts help to confirm, though
we now know evidence of them was not necessary, the voluntary act committed by
him on July 3, 1968, when he nosedived over Giguère and Normand, with the
result that he caused the death of Giguère.

It was neither the duty nor the right of the
jurors to ask themselves whether the accused was endangering the lives of the
group of persons involved in the third incident which occurred on some earlier
date between June 24th and July 3rd over the Koksoak River. Again, with respect,
in my opinion the judge gravely erred when he instructed the jury that the
similar fact evidence helped to confirm the act of the accused on July 3, 1968.
This bald statement and all of the disquisition relating to similar acts which
preceded it in the charge could only have left the jury with the impression
that the acts of the accused on the three earlier occasions were all to go into
the scale, and be given great weight, in determining the guilt or innocence of
the accused. The result was that the jury in this case was not deciding only
the culpability of the accused for his act of July 3rd; they were assessing the
quality of his conduct on that date and on three separate and disconnected
occasions. The cumulative effect could not have been other than highly
prejudicial. The accused was placed in the position of having to defend four
separate acts and not one. These errors are not mere blemishes on the face of
an otherwise acceptable charge. They go to the very root of the case and are of
such nature and gravity as, in my opinion, to entitle the appellant to a new
trial. The majority of the Court of Appeal for Quebec did not consider it
necessary to pass upon the legality of the evidence of similar acts, being of
opinion that even if that evidence were excluded, a properly instructed jury
would be justified in bringing in a guilty verdict. With great respect, I do
not share that view. I am not satisfied that the jury would have brought in the
verdict they did, in the absence of that evidence.

[Page 354]

I do not think it necessary to elaborate on the
other grounds of appeal.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal and direct a new trial.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Spence, Pigeon and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

DE GRANDPRE J.—Appellant was convicted by a jury
of the crime stated as follows in the indictment:

[TRANSLATION] On or about July 3, 1968, at
Lake Endry, county of Duplessis, district of Hauterive, Jean-Paul Leblanc, of
Baie-Comeau, did unlawfully and by criminal negligence, cause the death of
another person, namely Patrick Guy Giguère, ss. 191 and 192 of the Criminal
Code .

This verdict was affirmed by a majority of the
Court of Appeal[17].

With respect to the facts, it is sufficient to
note that when the incident took place appellant, who was at the control of an
aircraft in an uninhabited region of northern Quebec, was flying very low over
two persons on the ground whom he was supposed to take back to civilization,
and that one of them was hit by a part of the aircraft and fatally injured. The
evidence showed that there was no need for appellant to act in this manner, and
his manoeuvre was described in aeronautical terms as a “pass”.

Appellant has asked the Court to quash the
judgment of the Court of Appeal for the following two reasons:

(1) evidence of so-called “similar” facts (three
“passes” in the weeks which preceded Giguère’s death) was not admissible here;

(2) the trial judge did not make it sufficiently
clear to the jury that a mere breach of the federal Aeronautics Act  and
the Regulations made thereunder does not, in itself, constitute criminal
negligence.

Sections 191  and 192  of the Criminal Code  (now
202 and 203) read as follows:

[Page 355]

191. (1)
Every one is criminally negligent who

(a) in doing anything, or

(b) in omitting to do
anything that it is his duty to do,

shows wanton or reckless disregard for the
lives or safety of other persons.

(2) For the purpose of this section, “duty”
means a duty imposed by law.

192. Every
one who by criminal negligence causes death to another person is guilty of an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.

Before we consider appellant’s grounds of
appeal, a few preliminary comments should be made.

The above sections are new law (1953-54). They
must be read against the background of earlier precedents, particularly R.
v. Baker[18]. In
that case, Duff J., as he then was, speaking for the whole Court, stated that
culpable negligence exists in criminal law when there is “a want of ordinary
care in circumstances in which persons of ordinary habits of mind would
recognize that such want of care is not unlikely to imperil human life” (at
p. 358).

In addition, in Arthurs v. The Queen[19], Ritchie J., speaking for a
majority of the Court, emphasized at p. 292 that in cases where the
indictment is based on s. 191  of the Criminal Code , the evidence

is to be tested in accordance with the
provisions of the last-quoted section which is to say that conduct
disclosing wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of others
constitutes prima facie evidence of criminal negligence.

Later, at p. 298, he added, still with
reference to the sections in question here, that “deliberation is not, in
my opinion, a necessary ingredient of the offence”.

[Page 356]

The nature of the offence had been considered
previously in O’Grady v. Sparling[20].
Although the point at issue in that case was the constitutionality of a
provincial statute, there are two passages from the reasons of Judson J.,
speaking for the majority, which are very relevant. At p. 808, he quotes
the following comments from the 17th edition of Kenny’s Outlines of Criminal
Law (at p. 34):

There are only two states of mind which
constitute mens rea, and they are intention and recklessness. The
difference between recklessness and negligence is the difference between
advertence and inadvertence;

Further on, he adds (at p. 809):

What the Parliament of Canada has done is
to define “advertent negligence” as a crime under ss. 191(1) and 221(1).

Section 221 is not relevant to this case.

Appellant’s grounds of appeal must be examined
in the light of the above principles.

With respect to the first of the grounds, that
is the admissibility of “similar” acts, it must be remembered that according to
the terms of the relevant sections the Crown, in a case such as that
before the Court, is required to prove

(a) the breach of an obligation imposed by law;

(b) that the breach indicated wanton or reckless
disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.

In most cases, the fact itself proves the
intent. See in this regard the reasons of Pigeon J. in Peda v. The Queen[21].

However, even if it could be said that that was
the situation in this case, this would in no way prevent the Crown from going
one step further, and proving by the similar conduct of appellant in other
circumstances of the same type that the mens rea definitely existed in
the case at bar. The admissibility of such evidence was recognized by the Privy
Council in Makin v. Attorney General

[Page 357]

for New South Wales[22], which includes the following extract
from the reasons of the Lord Chancellor, at p. 65:

It is undoubtedly not competent for the
prosecution to adduce evidence tending to shew that the accused has been guilty
of criminal acts other than those covered by the indictment, for the purpose of
leading to the conclusion that the accused is a person likely from his criminal
conduct or character to have committed the offence for which he is being tried.
On the other hand, the mere fact that the evidence adduced tends to shew the
commission of other crimes does not render it inadmissible if it be relevant to
an issue before the jury, and it may be so relevant if it bears upon the
question whether the acts alleged to constitute the crime charged in the
indictment were designed or accidental, or to rebut a defence which would
otherwise be open to the accused.

The last sentence of the above passage has been
examined closely in many English cases. We need mention only two of them here.

In Thompson v. The King[23], which held to be admissible
evidence of similar facts which had been submitted to demonstrate the
propensity of the accused, and thereby exclude beforehand an alibi defence,
Lord Sumner gave the following warning, at p. 232:

Before an issue can be said to be raised,
which would permit the introduction of such evidence so obviously prejudicial
to the accused, it must have been raised in substance if not in so many words,
and the issue so raised must be one to which the prejudicial evidence is
relevant. The mere theory that a plea of not guilty puts everything material in
issue is not enough for this purpose. The prosecution cannot credit the accused
with fancy defences in order to rebut them at the outset with some damning
piece of prejudice.

The question was considered again by the Privy
Council in Noor Mohamed v. The King[24].
In this decision involving a charge of murder by poisoning, evidence that
more than two years earlier the accused’s wife had died in similar
circumstances (without criminal proceedings having been taken, however) was
excluded. After citing the relevant

[Page 358]

passages from Makin and Thompson, Lord
du Parcq made the following comments (at p. 191):

Their Lordships respectfully agree with
what they conceive to be the spirit and intention of Lord Sumner’s words, and
wish to say nothing to detract from their value. On principle, however, and
with due regard to subsequent authority, their Lordships think that one
qualification of the rule laid down by Lord Sumner must be admitted. An accused
person need set up no defence other than a general denial of the crime alleged.
The plea of not guilty may be equivalent to saying ‘Let the prosecution prove
its case, if it can,’ and having said so much the accused may take refuge in
silence. In such a case it may appear (for instance) that the facts and
circumstances of the particular offence charged are consistent with innocent
intention, whereas further evidence, which incidentally shows that the accused
has committed one or more other offences, may tend to prove that they are
consistent only with a guilty intent. The prosecution could not be said, in
their Lordships’ opinion, to be ‘crediting the accused with a fancy defence’ if
they sought to adduce such evidence. It is right to add, however, that in all
such cases the judge ought to consider whether the evidence which it is
proposed to adduce is sufficiently substantial having regard to the purpose to
which it is professedly directed, to make it desirable in the interest of
justice that it should be admitted. If, so far as that purpose is concerned, it
can in the circumstances of the case have only trifling weight, the judge will
be right to exclude it. To say this is not to confuse weight with
admissibility. The distinction is plain, but cases must occur in which it would
be unjust to admit evidence of a character gravely prejudicial to the accused
even though there may be some tenuous ground for holding it technically
admissible. The decision must then be left to the discretion and the sense of
fairness of the judge.

(The emphasis is my own).

In my opinion, this is the rule that this Court
adopted in R. v. Wray[25], in
which Martland J., speaking for the majority, said at p. 295:

In my opinion, the recognition of a
discretion to exclude admissible evidence, beyond the limited scope recognized
in the Noor Mohamed case, is not warranted by authority, and would be
undesirable. The admission of relevant admissible evidence of probative value
should

[Page 359]

not be prevented, except within the very
limited sphere recognized in that case.

It is true that in that case the issue was the
admissibility of facts discovered through a statement of the accused held to be
inadmissible, and not the admissibility of similar facts. However, the long
citations from Thompson and Noor Mohamed, and the indirect
reference to Makin, convince me that evidence of similar facts is
admissible, not to prove commission of the crime mentioned in the indictment
but to establish guilty intent.

Did the trial judge in the case at bar make the
necessary distinction and give the jury the necessary instructions? The answer
to this question must be in the affirmative, if we consider for example the
following passages from the judge’s charge to the jury:

[TRANSLATION] YOU must forget for the
moment the evidence of similar acts, because he is not on trial for having
committed those acts. Thus, you must make a distinction. That evidence was only
admitted in order to support evidence of the accused’s intention to act as he
did on July 3, 1968, with respect to Normand and Giguère, and to preclude a
defence that the descent towards the persons on the ground was due to
mechanical failure, or to fortuitous causes beyond the pilot’s control.

…

Similar acts are acts of the same type as
one of the essential elements of the crime charged. For there to be a crime in
the case at bar it is necessary for the death to have been caused by criminal
negligence within the meaning of s. 191 . These acts, then, are acts of the
same type, evidence of which was designed to refute a defence that the accused
might otherwise have put forward.

An important means of defence that the
accused might have put forward in the case at bar would be to establish facts
and circumstances showing that the accused had started the descent in a dive
because it was necessary for him to do so because of… a mechanical defect, or
that he did not act voluntarily and that he did not act freely, and that he did
not undertake the nose dive, flying near the ground above the persons he was to
meet, through wanton or reckless disregard or by failing in his duty.

[Page 360]

Thus appellant’s first ground of appeal cannot
be accepted.

With respect to the second ground, appellant
does not question the trial judge’s right to quote to the jury the relevant
sections of the Aeronautics Act  and the Regulations made under it.
Moreover, this is consistent with almost unanimous precedents and reference
need only be made to the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v.
Titchener[26]. However,
appellant, on the basis of the decision in Titchener, submitted that the
trial judge did not make it sufficiently clear to the jury that a mere breach
of the Act and Regulations was not necessarily proof of the “wanton or reckless
disregard” required by the definition of the crime of criminal negligence. In
this regard, I have nothing to add to the following comments of Salvas J.A.,
speaking for the majority of the Court of Appeal (at p. 63):

[TRANSLATION] The trial lasted
approximately three weeks. The investigation included evidence of many facts
not related, or not important, to the point at issue, as well as statements of
hypotheses also without significance. Under these circumstances, it was
particularly important to present the point at issue squarely to the jurors,
and especially to avoid any prejudice to the accused. In my opinion, the judge
did this in his instructions to the jurors. He told them that, in order to
establish the guilt of the accused, the Crown “must prove to your satisfaction,
beyond any reasonable doubt, each and all of the… points”, which he listed on
two occasions, and he added that if the Crown did not prove “any one” of these
points, they must acquit the accused. On each occasion, the judge mentioned the
essential element of the crime with which the accused was charged, namely, that
he “showed wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other
persons”.

Thus the second ground of appeal must also be
dismissed.

I would dismiss the appeal.

BEETZ J.—I have had the advantage of reading the
reasons of Dickson and de Grandpré JJ.

Even if it were conceded that the evidence of
similar acts was admissible in the circumstances to support the evidence
of wanton or reckless disre-

[Page 361]

gard for the lives or safety of other persons,
the trial judge had to distinguish clearly between the similar acts and the act
with which appellant was charged. He attempted to do so but, as in my view can
be seen from certain passages of his address to the jury cited by Dickson J.,
he definitely did not succeed.

I would dispose of the appeal as proposed by
Dickson J.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Obscenity—Distribution of
obscene material—Whether certain articles publications—Test of
obscenity—Whether statutory test exclusive—Criminal Code , ss. 8 , 159(1) ,
159(8) , 163 , 164 .

The appellant operated a “sex shop” where he
exhibited for sale to the public certain items known as “sex devices” or “sex
stimulators”. The store had two large signs on either side of its entrance
reading “Erotique Ltd.” and there were two window displays of books and
assorted paraphernalia. Inside the store, a number of items were displayed in
glass cases with a framed description under each one in addition to the price.
The appellant was charged under s. 159(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  that
he had in his possession “for the purpose of distribution obscene material
consisting of written matter, books, models, preparations, tape recordings and
other devices, equipment and paraphernalia.” The appellant was found guilty at
trial and his conviction was upheld in the Court of Appeal.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per: Laskin
C.J. and Judson, Spence and Dickson JJ.: An associated description of an
article of commerce does not transform that article into a publication where it
would not be one standing alone. The articles in question are not publications.
A dilemma has arisen because of the existence of two definitions of obscenity,
one found in s. 159(8)  and the other existing at common law (R. v. Hicklin
(1868), L.R. 3 Q.B. 360). This dilemma is that articles not “publications”
within s. 159(8)  could only with difficulty be dealt with under the test in
that provision and consideration of them as “publications” would be a
distortion of the meaning of that word.

Section 159(8)  lays down the exhaustive test
of obscenity in respect of a publication which has sex as a theme or
characteristic. The theory of the Criminal Code  is that substantive
criminal law is found in the Code itself and it would be strange for
Parliament to

[Page 952]

give a prescription for obscenity and get be
taken to have preserved the larger common law definition. The test in s. 159(8) 
should be applied in all other provisions of the Code where the
obscenity revolves around sex considerations and the Hicklin test should
not be applied when the test prescribed in s. 159(8)  is not met. The Hicklin
rule cannot be maintained consistently with the prescription of s. 159(8) 
because it goes much beyond that prescription.

The judicial approach should be to give a
consistent meaning to the same word used by Parliament where that word is a
designation of an offence which is of generic character or distributive by
reason of the specification of different situations in which it may be
committed.

Per: Martland,
Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: Section 159(8)  refers only to
publications and not to any other form of expression. The issue here therefore
turns on the meaning to be given to the word “publication”. This meaning is not
to be derived from the verb “to publish” but from the noun itself which may be
defined as “that which is published”.

The appellant made the character of his wares
publicly known. This he did by making it publicly known by the two large signs
at the entrance of his shop that it dealt in erotic material and by displaying
the articles in glass cases plainly visible to the visiting public, such
articles being accompanied by descriptions phrased in language the dominant
characteristic of which was the undue exploitation of sex. The articles in
question were therefore publications within the meaning of s. 159(8) . It was
established in Brodie v. The Queen, [1962] S.C.R. 681, that in
relation to a “publication” the statutory provisions regarding obscenity are
exclusive.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of

[Page 953]

Appeal for Ontario[1]
dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Scott Co. Ct. J.[2] on trial de novo upholding
convictions on charges involving unlawful possession for distribution of obscene
materials. Appeal dismissed.

E.W. Trasewick, for the appellant.

David H. Doherty, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Judson, Spence
and Dickson JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The appellant was convicted on
a charge, laid under s. 159(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  that,
within a specified period of time, he “unlawfully did have in his possession,
for the purpose of distribution, obscene materials consisting of written
matter, pictures, models, preparations, tape recordings and other devices,
equipment and paraphernalia”. The information containing this charge also
included three other counts, being another one under s. 159(1) (a) and
two under s. 159(2) (a), but these were withdrawn. The conviction was
upheld after a trial de novo before Judge D.H. Scott, and leave to
appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal was given by that Court on the question
“[whether] the test of obscenity laid down in s. 159(8)  of the Criminal Code 
[applies] to the articles which were the subject matter of the charge in
this case”. The contention before that Court was that s. 159(8)  was confined to
printed material only. Gale C.J.O., speaking for the Court in giving leave in
the light of that contention, observed that “no Court of Appeal in Canada has held that articles and devices
such as the ones in question here are embraced by. section 159(8) .”

Having given leave, the Ontario Court of Appeal,
in the words of Gale C.J.O. disposed of the appeal as follows:

Turning to the merits of the appeal on that
point, we have no difficulty whatever in coming to the conclusion that the
subsection does extend to objects such as these. In Regina v. Cameron, [1966]
4 C.C.C. 273, a judgment of our Court, and in Regina v. Fraser, [1966]
1 C.C.C. 110, a decision of the Court of Appeal of British

[Page 954]

Columbia, it was
held that section 159(8) of the Code applies to paintings, pictures and motion
picture films. It appears to us that to conclude that this subsection does not
extend to articles such as these would be quite illogical. In other words, it
would be nonsensical to hold that while pictures of the articles would be
included in the terms of section 159(8) of the Code, the subjects of the
pictures themselves would not come within that subsection.

Leave to come to this Court was given on the
following question of law:

Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that
s. 159(8)  of the Criminal Code  applied to the articles found by the trial judge
to be obscene and that consequently the trial judge did not err in holding that
s. 159(8)  provided the sole test of obscenity in respect to those articles?

The articles alleged to be obscene in this case,
and so found by Judge Scott on the trial de novo, may comprehensively be
called sex devices or sex stimulators. They embraced a wide range, as indicated
by the fact that more than seventy were filed as exhibits. Some had been
displayed in the accused’s shop window where they were accompanied by a framed
written description of their character and use. Catalogues showing these items
and containing identical descriptions in respect of the items in the shop
window were among the exhibits at the trial de novo. It does not appear,
however, that the catalogues themselves were the subject of the charge on which
the accused was convicted. Judge Scott divided the articles into two groups and
found those in one group obscene and those in the second group not obscene.
What is important in this case is not an examination and assessment of the
articles put by the trial judge into the one group or the other, but rather
whether he and the Court of Appeal erred in applying to those articles the test
of obscenity found in s. 159(8)  of the Criminal Code . In approaching
this question, I put to one side (because there was no issue raised on these
points) the question of possession and the fact that distribution of the
articles was contemplated by the accused; nor was there any claim in this Court
of the defence of public good, within s. 159(3) (4).

[Page 955]

It will be sufficient to reproduce s. 159(1)  and
(8)  to provide a basis for considering the legal question posed by this Court
and dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal. These provisions are as follows:

159. (1)
Every one commits an offence who

(a) makes, prints, publishes,
distributes, circulates, or has in his possession for the purpose of
publication, distribution or circulation any obscene written matter, picture,
model, phonograph record or other thing whatsoever, or

(b) makes, prints, publishes,
distributes, sells or has in his possession for the purpose of publication,
distribution or circulation, a crime comic.

(8) For the purposes of this Act, any
publication a dominant characteristic of which is the undue exploitation of
sex, or of sex and any one or more of the following subjects, namely, crime,
horror, cruelty and violence, shall be deemed to be obscene.

In his reasons for conviction, the trial judge
concluded, after canvassing various cases including the judgment of this Court
in Brodie v. The Queen[3], that
s. 159(8)  provided an exhaustive test of obscenity, displacing the common law
test of R. v. Hicklin[4]. The
authorities that he cited made it evident, however, that the test of obscenity
under s. 159(8)  had theretofore been applied, following the reasons of Judson
J. in the Brodie case, only to undue exploitation of sex and, moreover,
that the statutory test had theretofore depended on showing that this
exploitation was a dominant characteristic of a “publication”, a word not
defined in s. 159.

What appears to be new in Judge Scott’s decision
was the application of the test to a charge of distribution which did not
involve a “publication”. I point out, however, that one of the submissions of
counsel for the Crown was that the noun “publication” in s. 159(8)  should be
taken to embrace articles or contrivances of the kind in question here when
associated with the written descriptions thereof and that in such an
association they could fall within the proscription of the charge of posses- 

[Page 956]

sion for the purpose of distribution. Whether,
on this view of the matter, they could also be caught on a charge of publishing
or of having in possession for the purpose of publication under s. 159(1) (a)
was left at large.

The factual basis for the foregoing position was
not clearly reflected in Judge Scott’s reasons, although in assessing whether
certain contrivances were obscene he did refer to their descriptions. The
descriptions, admitted by the accused to be his or, at least, adopted by him,
were in the nature of evidence of the character or use of the articles; and it
is their character or use that brought them within the scope of obscenity under
the trial judge’s finding. The descriptions merely identified their purpose
and, in my opinion, it would be stretching the word “publication” beyond reason
to find that because of an associated description an article of commerce, not
being written or visual matter, became a publication when it would not be one
if it stood alone. Displaying wares is not publishing them, nor can a
manufactured article, having no communicative character, be termed a
“publication” without a statutory enlargement of the ordinary meaning of that
word.

The reasons given by the Court of Appeal in no
way indicate that the Court brought the particular articles within s. 159(8)  by
reason of the associated descriptions. It does appear, rather, that the Court
considered them to fall within s. 159(8)  per se. I take this view by
reason of the Court’s reference to R. v. Cameron[5], and to R. v. Fraser[6], dealing respectively with paintings and
with books and moving pictures. I would observe, however, that the Cameron case
did not decide that paintings were “publications” within s. 159(8) . The Court
there proceeded on the basis of the agreement of counsel that they should be so
regarded. In the Fraser case, where the charge was one of possession of
obscene matter (books and moving pictures) for the purpose of publication,
distribution or circulation, the British Columbia Court of Appeal held that the
motion pictures, which the

[Page 957]

convicting magistrate found to be obscene, were
publications within what is now s. 159(8) . This issue does not appear to have
been raised when the Fraser case came to this Court but, even if I was
satisfied that the British Columbia Court could properly characterize the motion
pictures as publications, it does not follow that the articles in the present
case may be so characterized.

I prefer the view that the articles in question
here are not “publications”. Crown counsel took the alternative position that,
accepting this view, it was still proper for the trial judge and the Court of
Appeal (if that is what it did) to apply the test of obscenity in s. 159(8)  to
the charge of possession for the purpose of distributing under s. 159(1) (a).
He thus joined issue with the appellant on the central point in the latter’s
case, namely, that the formulation of s. 159(8)  (and especially the concluding
words “shall be deemed to be obscene”) pointed to a particular definition in
respect of publications, leaving the common law Hicklin rule to apply to
the undefined word “obscene” in s. 159(1) (a). Counsel for the appellant
also laid emphasis on the fact that s. 159(8)  could not appropriately be
applied to the articles in question here when regard was had to the association
therein of “sex and any one or more of the following subjects, namely, crime,
horror, cruelty and violence”. I do not find this submission in itself
persuasive when among the subjects associated with sex are cruelty and
violence. The issue lies in the general formulation of a “publication” which
“shall be deemed to be obscene”.

Counsel for the respective parties agreed that
it was undesirable to have two definitions of obscenity, here two definitions
where the obscenity related to exploitation of sex, but counsel for the appellant
contended that the facts of this case revealed a failure of Parliament to
establish a uniform test and the Courts could not come to it without
legislating. They could not establish uniformity (so it was alleged) merely
through interpretation, which was their only role where statutes are concerned.

It is doubtful, in my opinion, that the
appellant would find any solace if his culpability was deter-

[Page 958]

mined under the Hicklin rule. In R. v.
Carty[7], where
a charge of possession for purpose of distribution related to articles of a
kind similar to those involved here, District Court Judge Kidd in Alberta held that the accused was liable to
conviction under either test of obscenity. He realized the dilemma that
confronted him, namely, that if the articles were not “publications” within s.
159(8)  it was doubtful that the issue of obscenity could be determined under
the test in that provision, and to consider them as “publications” would be a
distortion of the meaning of that word. He took comfort in the reasons of
McFarlane J. in R. v. Lambert[8],
at p. 15 who noted that the Brodie case was concerned with
“publications” which were deemed to be obscene if they possessed certain
characteristics, and that where the charge did not relate to publications,
there was no binding decision requiring the application of the test prescribed
by s. 159(8) . McFarlane J. also escaped the dilemma by holding that the charge,
being one of mailing obscene matter under what is now s. 164 , was established,
whether the Hicklin test or that under s. 159(8)  was applied.

Another instance of the same dilemma, referable
to a charge under s. 163 of presenting and appearing in an obscene performance,
is evident in R. v. Small[9], where
the majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal distinguished the act of
publishing under s. 159(1) (a) and “publication” under s. 159(8) , noting
that the Brodie case was concerned with a book as a publication under
the latter provision. The majority judgment refused to apply the test in
s. 159(8)  to determine whether the theatrical performance was obscene
under s. 163 , holding that it was not a publication. At the same time, the
majority held that the Hicklin test, developed in relation to books,
should not be applied to a theatrical performance. In the result, Robertson
J.A., speaking for the majority, having by his reasoning (as he himself said)
left himself

[Page 959]

without either a statutory or judicial
definition of obscene performance, concluded that he should interpret the words
“obscene performance” in s. 163  “in their natural and ordinary sense”. He then
propounded a number of matters to be considered for that exercise and ordered a
new trial accordingly.

Nemetz J.A. (as he then was), in a concurring
judgment, concluded that performance of a play in public was a publication,
enabling him to apply the test of obscenity under s. 159(8) , but he joined in
the order for a new trial because the trial judge rejected uncontradicted
evidence of the defence on the question of community standards and made a finding
unsupported by the evidence. He seemed to be apprehensive that otherwise a
producer of a play based on a book would escape prosecution when the
distributor of the book would be liable to conviction. I do not think that this
follows, but the learned judge’s concern again points up the dilemma of which I
have spoken.

The dilemma has resulted, in my opinion, in
Courts pressing on the meaning of publication in s. 159(8)  in order to be able
to apply the test of obscenity which that provision prescribes rather than the Hicklin
rule, a judge-made rule which has been extensively criticized in both
judicial decisions in this country and in periodical literature: see, Mackay, The
Hicklin Rule and Judicial Censorship (1958), 36 Can. Bar Rev. 1. Judson J.
in the Brodie case considered the Hicklin definition of obscenity
to be “vague, difficult and unsatisfactory to apply”: see [1962] S.C.R. 681, at
p. 702. Illustrative of the cases pressing on the term “publication” in
s. 159(8)  are R. v. Goldberg and Reitman[10] (movies); R. v. Times Square
Cinema[11] (video
tape); R. v. O’Reilly[12], (play);
R.

[Page 960]

v. Campbell[13]
(theatrical performance); Daylight Theatre Co. Ltd. v. The Queen[14] (movies).

This Court should resolve the dilemma revealed
by the case law and say whether s. 159(8)  exhaustively defines obscenity where
exploitation of sex is concerned, regardless of whether or not a “publication”
is involved. I take the Brodie case as the proper starting point for the
consideration of this matter because there the Court was divided on the
question whether s. 159(8)  established the exhaustive test of obscenity
even in respect of what was clearly a publication. Thus, Fauteux J., as he then
was, and Ritchie J. thought that s. 159(8)  merely expanded the definition of
obscenity without displacing the Hicklin rule. Three other members of
the Court, Kerwin C.J.C., Taschereau J., as he then was, and Locke J., applied
s. 159(8)  without saying that it was exhaustive and, indeed, Taschereau J.
expressly reserved his opinion on that question. Cartwright J., as he then was,
also reserved his view on the exhaustiveness of s. 159(8) , being content to
proceed on counsel’s agreement that it was. On the other hand, Judson J.,
speaking for Abbott and Martland JJ. as well as for himself, was of the firm
opinion that s. 159(8)  laid down the exhaustive test of obscenity in respect of
a publication. He said this (at p. 701):

…A writer who faces a charge of obscenity
is entitled to know by what standard his work is to be judged and what defence,
if any, he is called upon to make. Under the Criminal Code , as amended
in 1959, there is no double standard, that is to say (1) the statutory
definition intended to strike down the obvious, and (2), the Hicklin test
still in the background, although unstated in the Code, for those works that
are not within the statutory definition. If there is to be a double standard,
it must be expressly set out in the Code and I would disapprove of R. v.
Munster (1960), 129 C.C.C. 277, where, in sending the case back for a
new trial, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco held that there was
error when the magistrate directed himself exclusively according to
s. 150(8)  (sic) on the ground that the subsection does not purport to be a
definition of what is obscene and because matter not

[Page 961]

included with its provisions may be obscene
under the Hicklin test.

If a result such as this is to be brought
about the legislation must define the two standards of obscenity and tell the
Court that the charge is proved if the work offends either standard. I note
that this is the way that the New Zealand legislation is framed, Re Lolita, [1961]
N.Z.L.R. 542 and also the Australian legislation, although not so clearly, as
considered in Wavish v. Associated Newspapers Ltd., [1959] V.R.
57; MacKay v. Gordon & Gatch (Australasia) Ltd., [1959] V.R.
420; and Kyte-Powell v. Heinemann Ltd., [1960] V.R. 425.
Otherwise, why define obscenity for the purposes of the Act, if it is still
permissible for the Court to take a definition of the crime formulated 100
years ago and one that has proved to be vague, difficult and unsatisfactory to
apply?

In contrast, I think that the new statutory
definition does give the Court an opportunity to apply tests which have some
certainty of meaning and are capable of objective application and which do not
so much depend as before upon the idiosyncrasies and sensitivities of the
tribunal of fact, whether judge or jury. We are now concerned with a Canadian
statute which is exclusive of all others.

I agree with him that it would be incongruous to
have a double standard for obscenity in respect of publications which exploit
sex, especially when, in my opinion, the Hicklin rule can be said to be
more comprehensive than s. 159(8) , leaving this provision as a particular
illustration of what is obscene under the Hicklin rule and thus as
having no independent force. I would not construe this statutory provision in
such a dependent sense.

The theory of the Criminal Code , reflected
in s. 8  thereof is that the substantive criminal law is found in the Code itself.
There are, of course, situations where words in the Code either express
or require a reference back to the common law, as, for example, in the case of
forgery, but where the Code has also brought within the definition of
the offence acts which were not offences at common law: see Gaysek v. The
Queen[15]. The
present case is different because s. 159(8)  does not lie outside

[Page 962]

the common law but reflects a definition which
would be within it, if the common law test was to be applied; and I would
regard it as strange, as did Judson J., for Parliament to give a prescription
for obscenity and yet to be taken to have preserved a larger definition. I do
not regard the phrase in s. 159(8)  “shall be deemed” as detracting from what I
have said. It must be taken in context with the opening phrase in s. 159(8) 
“for the purposes of this Act”, and I read this as meaning for all the purposes
of the Criminal Code . The term “Act” was used when s. 159(8)  and the
present s. 160  were introduced into the Criminal Code  by 1959 (Can.), c.
41 which embodied a large number of amendments and in which the Criminal
Code  was referred to as “the Act”. That designation in the original of s.
159(8)  has remained.

I am not only satisfied to regard s. 159(8)  as
prescribing an exhaustive test of obscenity in respect of a publication which
has sex as a theme or characteristic but I am also of the opinion that this
Court should apply that test in respect of other provisions of the Code, such
as ss. 163  and 164 , in cases in which the allegation of obscenity revolves
around sex considerations. Since the view that I take, in line with that
expressed by Judson J. in the Brodie case, is that the Hicklin rule
has been displaced by s. 159(8)  in respect of publications, I would not bring
it back under any other sections of the Code, such as ss. 159 , 163  and
164 , to provide a back-up where a sexual theme or sexual factors are the basis
upon which obscenity charges are laid and the charges fail because the test
prescribed by s. 159(8)  has not been met.

The Hicklin rule was established in a
case which dealt with a pamphlet, with a “publication”, as that word is
ordinarily understood. Although it was an attack upon the Roman Catholic
Church, and especially upon the confessional practice of that Church, the basic
allegation was the depravity of the priesthood, a depravity having sexual
aspects. In my opinion, the Hicklin test cannot be maintained
consistently with the prescription of s. 159(8)  because it goes much beyond
that prescription.

[Page 963]

It is reasonable for a Court to apply the
statutory standard, prescribed by Parliament as a definition of an offence of a
generic character, when it is called upon to determine, in allied provisions of
the Criminal Code , the sense in which the expression of some offence,
made punishable in other circumstances, should be taken. Where no
constitutional considerations are involved but only the interpretation and
application of the words of Parliament, the judicial approach should be in the
direction of consistency of meaning of the same word used by Parliament where
that word is a designation of an offence which is a distributive one by reason
of the specification of different situations in which it may be committed. So
it is with obscenity in the various provisions of the Code under which
it is an offence. If the issue under any of those provisions is sexual
exploitation, either alone or in association with any of the subjects mentioned
in s. 159(8) , then I think it the proper course for this Court to apply in all
such cases the standard or test that s. 159(8)  prescribes for publications.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz
and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—I have had the advantage of reading
the reasons for judgment prepared for delivery by the Chief Justice and while I
agree with him that this appeal should be dismissed, I reach this conclusion
for such materially different reasons that I find it necessary to express my
views separately.

The Chief Justice has discussed the
circumstances giving rise to this appeal at some length and I will endeavour to
avoid repetition except in so far as I find it necessary in order to make my
views clear.

The appellant operated a business of the type sometimes
described as a “sex shop” where he exhibited for sale to the public certain
items which were obviously designed for, and could in fact only be used for,
unnatural sexual practices. The manner in which these items were presented to
the public is described by the trial judge as follows:

[Page 964]

According to Exhibit 1 (p) the store had
two large signs on either side of the entrance, in large letters reading,
‘Erotique Ltd.’. There are two window displays of various books and assorted
paraphernalia. A number of photographs admitted in evidence show the interior
of the store. Briefly, a quantity of articles was displayed in glass cases
plainly visible to anyone attending at the premises, while under each item was
a framed description of the article with its price…

The framed description to which the trial judge
refers was identical in wording with those contained in a catalogue which was
one of the exhibits before this Court, and in this regard the trial judge made
the following finding in the concluding portion of his reasons for judgment:

In any event, having considered the
articles (and more particularly their description) which I have found to be
obscene, I am of the opinion that their dominant characteristic is the undue
exploitation of sex and taking a general average of community thinking and
feeling, they are a clear and unequivocal offence against community standards.

The Court of Appeal, in a judgment delivered by
Chief Justice Gale on behalf of himself and Evans and Martin, JJ.A., limited
the issue before it to one point which was expressed as follows:

The only point to which we gave
consideration was the first one argued, namely, that the test of obscenity laid
down in section 159(8)  of the Criminal Code  does not apply to the articles
which were the subject matter of the charge in this case, the contention being
that the subsection is confined to printed material only. We agree that there
is a question of law involved in that issue and that leave ought to be granted
in respect thereto.

Gale C.J., after having considered the merits of
the appeal, dealt with this point succinctly in the following sentence:

Turning to the merits of the appeal on that
point, we have no difficulty whatever in coming to the conclusion that the
subsection does extend to objects such as these.

And having referred to the cases of R. v.
Cameron[16] and R.
v. Fraser[17], concluded
by saying:

[Page 965]

Accordingly, we decide the point of law
against the appellant.

Leave to appeal to this Court was granted on a
slightly broader issue than that which was considered by the Court of Appeal.
The question is stated in the reasons for judgment prepared by Chief Justice
Laskin, but I think it desirable to reproduce it here:

Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that
s. 159(8)  of the Criminal Code  applied to articles found by the learned
trial judge to be obscene and that consequently the trial judge did not err in
holding that s. 159(8)  provided the sole test of obscenity in respect of those
articles.

It will be seen that while the Court of Appeal
confined itself to the question of whether or not the test of obscenity laid
down in s. 159(8)  was confined to printed material only, the question posed in
this Court raises the issue as to whether the test so laid down is the sole
test of obscenity in respect of the articles found to have been obscene.

The charge upon which the appellant was
convicted was that he had in his possession “for the purpose of distribution
obscene material consisting of written matter, books, models, preparations, tape
recordings and other devices, equipment and paraphernalia”. This charge is
clearly laid under the provisions of s. 159(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code  which is reproduced in the reasons for judgment of Chief Justice
Laskin and need not be repeated except to point out that the offence thereby
created relates to “possession for the purpose of publication, distribution or
circulation”. Both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal found that the
appellant had a large number of items in his possession which were obscene
within the meaning of 159(8) of the Criminal Code , and I find it
necessary to reproduce that subsection:

159. (8) For
the purposes of this Act, any publication a dominant characteristic of
which is the undue exploitation of sex or of sex, and any one or more of the
following subjects, namely, crime, horror, cruelty and violence, shall be
deemed to be obscene. [The italics are my own.]

[Page 966]

It was contended on behalf of the appellant that
none of the materials of which he was found to be in possession was a
“publication” so that the provisions of s. 159(8)  could not apply and there
being no other statutory standard of obscenity, resort must be had to the
common law.

With the greatest respect for those who may hold
a different view, I am of opinion that, when the plain and ordinary meaning is
given to the language used in s. 159(8)  it is to be construed as referring only
to publications, nothing else is mentioned in that section, and it appears to
me to be straining the language there used to construe it as being directed to
any other form of expression. The issue in my view must therefore turn on the
meaning to be given to the word “publication”. In the Shorter Oxford English
Dictionary this word is defined in part as follows:

The action of publishing or that which is
published.

1. The action of making publicly known;
public notification or announcement; promulgation. Notification or
communication to those concerned, or to a limited number regarded as
representing the public…

2. The issuing, or offering to the public,
of a book, map, engraving, piece of music, etc.; also the work or business of
producing and issuing copies of such works…b. a work published; a book or the
like printed or otherwise produced and issued for public sale…

We are not concerned here with the meaning
derived from the verb “to publish” but rather with the noun, i.e.,
“publication”, and in this latter sense the given meaning is “that which is
published” and this is made manifest by the example given under 2. b. in the
definition, namely, “a work published; a book or the like printed or otherwise
produced and issued for public sale.” This latter definition was adopted by
Maclean J.A. in writing the reasons for judgment for the majority of the Court
of Appeal of British Columbia in R. v. Fraser[18], at p. 121, where the statutory
definition was held to apply to moving pictures, and in the case of R. v.
Cameron[19], Laskin,
J.A., as he then was, in the course of his dissenting reasons for

[Page 967]

judgment wherein he found that the pictures
there in question were not obscene, had occasion to observe, at p. 301,
speaking of the counsel in that case, that:

They also agree that the term
‘publication’, awkward as it is to embrace paintings or drawings, should be
taken as being comprehensive enough to do so. In the result, the inquiry to be
made is whether in the case of each picture ‘a dominant characteristic…is the
undue exploitation of sex’.

It is apparent therefore that although the
conclusion that the word “publication” applied to paintings or drawings was
founded on an agreement of counsel, it was nevertheless the basis upon which
all judges in that case treated the problem before them.

I cannot escape the conclusion that in making it
publicly known by two large signs on either side of the entrance to his store,
that it was dealing in erotic material and by displaying the articles in
question in glass cases plainly visible to the public who entered his store and
which were accompanied in each case by framed printed descriptions of the articles
phrased in language the dominant characteristic of which was the undue
exploitation of sex, the appellant was making the character of his wares
publicly known and they therefore fell into the category of articles that were
published and that were “printed or otherwise produced and issued for public
sale…”. The articles in question were, therefore, in my opinion, publications
within the meaning of s. 159(8)  of the Criminal Code .

In the course of the argument in this Court,
reference was of course made to the case of Brodie v. The Queen[20], which was cited as authority for the
proposition that the test established by s. 159(8)  was exhaustive and that
resort could not be had to the common law rule sometimes said to have been
established in the much criticized case of R. v. Hicklin[21]. In considering the Brodie case, I
think it is to be remembered that it was accepted on all sides in that case
that the novel which was the subject of the prosecution was in fact a
“publication” and I have no doubt that it was there

[Page 968]

established that in relation to a “publication”
the statutory provisions regarding obscenity exclude the application of the
test suggested in the Hicklin case or any other test.

I agree with the courts below that the articles
here in question, displayed as they were in conjunction with the printed
explanations of their use, were to be judged by the standard laid down in s.
159(8) , and as I find this to be the sole test of obscenity in relation to
“publications”, I do not find it necessary to consider what test is to be
applied in determining whether or not matters other than publications are
obscene.

For these reasons, as well as those delivered by
Chief Justice Gale on behalf of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, I would
dismiss this appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL DIVISION

Criminal law—Murder—Evidence—Admissibility
of evidence of similar acts—Defence of drunkenness—Terms of judge’s
charge—Criminal Code , s. 613(1) (b)(iii).

Appellants in appealing their convictions of
murder bring in issue three main grounds viz. the admissibility of
evidence as to similar acts, the trial judge’s charge as to intoxication, and
the application of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  in
all circumstances of the case. The Court had during argument by appellants’
counsel expressed the view that ss. 572(3) and 598 of the Code deprived
the grounds of appeal in reference to empanelling the jury of any validity and
further that the trial judge had not deprived the appellants of their
opportunity of challenge for cause. The Court also agreed with the admission by
the trial judge as to the admissibility of all statements, oral as well as
written, made by both accused.

Appellants had been charged with murder
during the course of robbery in a hotel. The Crown introduced evidence to prove
that they had the next evening, aided by the sister of one of them, robbed and
assaulted persons in two other hotels in startlingly similar circumstances. The
issue of drunkenness was dealt with by the trial judge but he failed to allude
to that so‑called defence upon outlining to the jury the theory of the
defence, though the jury was later recalled and recharged. The Court of Appeal
however held that the charge itself was defective, being erroneous on the issue
of drunkenness, omitting to detail “specific intent” in relation to drunkenness
and seeming to imply that some burden lay on the accused to prove that their
intoxication prevented them from forming the necessary intent. After noting
these faults the Court of Appeal concluded that there was no evidence on
which a jury could reasonably conclude that the accused might not have the
capacity to form the necessary intent.

[Page 560]

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Martland, Judson, Pigeon, Dickson and Beetz JJ.: The evidence as to
the similar acts was admissible. Both these incidents occurred the very next
day, they were remarkably similar and well nigh contemporaneous. The statements
by the accused in reference to them having been found voluntary, in the
jurisprudential sense, were also admissible.

On the issue of drunkenness the faults in the
charge quoted by the Court of Appeal were serious. It should have been
accurately stated that “all that is needed is for the jury to have a reasonable
doubt as to the accused having such capacity” i.e. as to form the
necessary intent. The further conclusion of the Court of Appeal, that there was
no evidence on which the jury could conclude lack of capacity to form
the necessary intent, was however in error. There was evidence of some degree
of intoxication, and allegations in the statements of both accused of heavy
intoxication, and it was for the jury to weigh the evidence on this point. The
appeal was nonetheless one in which s. 613(1) (b)(iii) had to be
considered. The test in Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 739, of
“whether the jury charged as it should have been could, as reasonable men, have
done otherwise than find appellants guilty” should be applied and the appeals
dismissed.

Per Ritchie
and de Grandpré JJ.: On the defence of drunkenness the opinion of the Court of
Appeal was correct. There was no evidence on which a jury, properly instructed,
could have found such intoxication as to negate criminal intent.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick,
Appeal Division[1],
dismissing an appeal from convictions upon a joint charge of murder. Appeal
dismissed.

Brian Neill and Brian Malone, for the
appellants.

[Page 561]

Barry Athey and William Kearney, for the
respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Martland,
Judson, Spence, Pigeon, Dickson and Beetz JJ. was delivered by

SPENCE J.—This is an appeal from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for New Brunswick pronounced on September 14, 1976 by which it dismissed an appeal by
the appellants from their conviction by a judge and jury on September 17, 1975 upon a joint charge of murder
punishable by imprisonment for life. The reasons for judgment given by Limerick
J.A. for the Court of Appeal as to the appellant Michael Alward have been
reported in (1976), 32 C.C.C. 416. Since these reasons contain a very complete
statement of the facts, I shall confine my references thereto to only such
facts as are relevant to the issues which I shall be discussing.

Counsel for the appellants submitted a very
considerable number of grounds for appeal but at the close of their argument
counsel for the respondent, the Crown, was only called upon to reply in
reference to three grounds, i.e., the admissibility of evidence as to similar
acts, the learned trial judge’s charge as to intoxication, and the application
of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  in all the
circumstances of the case. The Court had, during the argument by the appellants’
counsel, expressed the view that the provisions of s. 572(3)  and
s. 598  of the Criminal Code  deprived the grounds of appeal in
reference to the empanelling of the jury of any validity and further that the
learned trial judge in his ruling, in which he said:

Well, that is my ruling, and I want to make
it clear to you that you still have the right to challenge for cause in a
particular case, but I am not going to permit a blanket challenge.

had not deprived the accused of their
opportunity to challenge for cause in a proper manner.

The learned trial judge, after a very lengthy voir
dire, had admitted as voluntary all statements, oral as well as written,
made by both accused. Limerick J.A., in his reasons for the Court of Appeal,
restated the reasons advanced by the

[Page 562]

learned trial judge for admitting those
statements into evidence as follows:

a. One reason is that the statements given
by the accused, if you accept those statements, couldn’t have been understood
by you because all three incidents were so involved in the statements, that you
never could have appreciated the significance of them nor could you have
understood them unless you knew what these other two incidents were to which
the statements refer. That is one reason.

b. A second reason is that there is a
certain amount of evidentiary value as far as the Crown is concerned, I
suppose, or as far as you’re concerned, in the fact that these two accused a
day later were involved together. They were friends in other words. There is no
other proof in the trial except them being at the Lord Beaver-brook Hotel
together that they were friends. They were friends and they were operating
together.

c. A third reason why that evidence
has been permitted here is that there are certain statements made in those
incidents which you may feel or may have some value in determining whether the
accused are guilty of this offence, or at least the Crown feels or would have
us believe that it would be of some value. I refer to the statement attributed
to one or other of the accused—it makes very little difference who said it
because it was in the presence of the other one if you accept the evidence—the
statement made to Mr. Bardsley, ‘Well, we’ve already murdered one man’.
This was the first instance on Monday evening. ‘We have already murdered one
man and we don’t mind killing a second one,’ or ‘We don’t give a damn if we
kill a second one,’ words to that effect, which suggested there had been some
killing before. Now, Mr. Willet actually wasn’t dead at that time and perhaps
the accused thought he had died or perhaps if they had beaten him, perhaps they
felt they had beaten him so badly that he died, or perhaps they intended to
beat him so badly that he wouldn’t recover and would die so he couldn’t be able
later to identify them, but he wasn’t in fact dead at that time, but they may
not have known that. Perhaps this was just idle boasting on their part. You
have to decide what weight to attach to that statement they made there.

Limerick J.A. concluded after discussing the
evidence as to the statements in detail:

The true test, therefore, is did the
evidence adduced by the Crown establish that nothing, said or done by any
person in authority, could have induced the accused to make a statement which
was or might be untrue because thereof. The Crown met that test.

[Page 563]

This Court agreed with that conclusion.

I now turn to the ground of appeal dealing with
the admission of evidence dealing with similar facts.

The accused had been charged with the murder of
the late D. Gordon Willet during the course of robbing him in his room at the
Lord Beaverbrook Hotel in Fredericton on February 16, 1975. The Crown
introduced evidence tending to prove that the same two accused accompanied and
aided by Linda Alward, the sister of one, had, the very next evening, robbed
and assaulted another person in his room at Keddy’s Motor Lodge and a third
person in his room at the Oromocto Hotel in Oromocto, New Brunswick. With the
exception that in these last two hotel room robberies and assaults Linda Alward
was used to gain entry to the room on the pretext of desiring to use the
telephone, the similarity between the three incidents was so marked as to be
properly styled as startling. Counsel for the Crown has listed fourteen
similarities between the three incidents; although some of them were of slight
evidentiary value, others are important. Crown counsel could have added another
most significant one: both the accused in statements which the courts below
have rightly found were admissible, made detailed admissions of their part in
all three incidents. It was the latter fact which Limerick J.A. viewed as
making unnecessary any decision as to the admissibility of the similar fact
evidence, saying:

It is unnecessary for this Court to
determine the admissibility of the evidence relating to the two similar
robberies at Keddy’s Motel and at Oromocto as there was no miscarriage of
justice occasioned thereby, the accused having admitted in their written
statements their complicity in the robbery of Mr. Willet. I would apply
the provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code in respect of this
ground of appeal if necessary.

With respect, I am unable to agree with that
reasoning. If the evidence as to similar facts had not been admissible as being
excluded by the well known rule against proof of the bad character of the
accused then the admission by the accused of their part in the last two
incidents would have been

[Page 564]

equally inadmissible. In such event, I would
have been firmly opposed to the use of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code  to cure the introduction of such gravely prejudicial and inadmissible
evidence. The statements of the accused were, however, admissible on the
determination by the judge of the issue of whether or not the evidence as to similar
facts was admissible. That evidence provided the proof that these two other
robberies had been committed by the accused and then if the evidence thereof
came within the similar fact rule they were admissible and the Court of Appeal
did not have to call in aid the provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code .

In view of the circumstances that the three
incidents were so very close in time and the robberies were carried out in such
a startlingly similar manner, I am of the opinion that evidence on the other
two incidents was admissible within the jurisprudence as to similar facts. I
realize that it was said in Brunet v. The King[2], that evidence as to the accused
having performed an illegal operation on another woman was inadmissible to
identify the accused as the person who had committed the offence, no question
of intent being involved. However, the alleged similar act in Brunet had
occurred in the previous year and the lapse of time was most relevant in
determining whether the necessary “nexus” between the offence charged and the
alleged similar act was present. Moreover, all these abortion cases are subject
to the suspicion that the prosecution is really seeking to obtain a conviction
on the basis that the accused is an evil abortionist and must be convicted on
one act or the other. I find of considerable interest and relevance the
decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R. v. Straffen[3], which dealt with the question of
the accused’s admission that he had strangled two other little girls in circumstances
remarkably like those proved to exist in the strangling of a third with which
he was charged. There Slade J. said:

Mr. Elam said: How far, then, does the
admissibility of such evidence go; does it go to a burglar, housebreaker,
thief, and so on? Lord Sumner, in THOMPSON’S CASE (supra), pointed out that
they were merely examples of persons who fell within the genus of dishonest

[Page 565]

persons; but, speaking for myself, I think
that if the question of identity arose in a case of house-breaking and it were
possible to adduce evidence that there was some peculiarity in relation to
earlier housebreakings, which was apparent also in the case of the
housebreaking charged, so as to stamp the accused man not only with the
housebreaking charged but with the earlier housebreakings, and there was
evidence that he had committed the earlier housebreakings, that would fall
within the same principle of admissibility, not to prove his propensity for
housebreaking, but to prove that he was the person who committed the
housebreaking charged.

So that Court was of the opinion that similar
fact evidence was admissible to prove the very fact of identity.

Evidence of similar facts showing “modus
operandi” was admitted specifically in R. v. Giovannone[4], upon a charge of false pretences
and the Court, in ruling the evidence admissible, cited a series of cases in
the English courts to like effect.

Nor is the fact that the incidents recounted in
the similar fact evidence occurred after that upon which the charge was based
any bar to admission of evidence upon reference to such incidents. Phipson, On
Evidence, 12th ed., para. 462, states citing authorities therefor:

Generally, evidence of similar facts not
only prior to, but subsequent to, that in question may be given, as well as the
defendant’s conduct and demeanour in connection and of any surrounding facts
showing his motive or intention. However, the similar facts must have occurred
within a reasonable limit of time; although where by statute a charge has to be
brought within a limited period after the offence, evidence of similar offences
committed beyond that limit is not thereby inadmissible.

In the present case, both incidents as to which
evidence was adduced occurred the very next day. I have, therefore, concluded that
the evidence as to these two remarkably similar and well nigh contemporaneous
robberies was admissible. The statements of the accused in reference thereto,
having been found voluntary, as that word is used in the jurisprudence, are
therefore also admissible. For

[Page 566]

these reasons, the application of
s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  upon the question
need not be considered.

I turn next to the issue of drunkenness. The
trial judge in his charge did deal with drunkenness but failed to allude to
that so-called defence upon outlining to the jury the theory of the defence. It
would appear that defence counsel objected, during a conference in chambers, to
such omission and so the trial judge recharged the jury as follows:

I listed the theories of the defence and
the Judge in charge of a Jury is required to state the different theories of
the defence and to review briefly what the defendants contend is the case, and
I enumerated those, you recall, toward the end of my address. There was one I
overlooked to mention, and I simply want to say now that both defendants also
contend that the fact that they were drinking, they contend, would warrant
reducing the charge from murder to manslaughter. This is their contention. I am
not telling you that this is the law that must be applied, but I neglected to
point out that that is one of the things. I think, if I understand it
correctly, they both rely on this, perhaps Mr. Mooney more so than
Mr. Alward. As his counsel pointed out, the statement given by
Mr. Mooney was shorter. The written statement was shorter, and he wound up
with the words, “That’s all I can remember about what happened there”, or
something to that effect, which might have indicated that perhaps he had more
to drink.

I am not going to explain to you again the
degree of intoxication or the degree of drunkenness that would be required to
reduce it from murder to manslaughter, because I dealt with that very fully
earlier in my charge. The reason for calling you back now is merely to remedy
the technical omission, or the omission I made in my charge. That is all. Will
you go out now, please?

Had the only error been the failure to refer to
drunkenness in outlining the theory of the defence, such recharge would have
been curative. However, as Limerick J.A. points out, the charge itself was
erroneous on the issue of drunkenness. As the learned justice of the Court of
Appeal points out, and it need not be repeated here in detail, there was error
in failure to detail what “specific intent” was so as to clarify whether
drunkenness would be a bar to conviction for murder. Moreover, several
references in the charge would seem to imply that some burden lay upon the
accused to prove that

[Page 567]

their intoxication prevented them from forming
the necessary intent while, of course, the Crown must prove every essential
element of the charge beyond reasonable doubt. One of these elements is intent
and, therefore, the evidence must leave no reasonable doubt that the accused
were not so intoxicated as to have prevented them from forming the necessary
intent. Limerick J.A. stated:

All the accused must do is raise a
reasonable doubt as to his capability of forming the specific intent necessary
to constitute the offence of murder.

With deference, I think it may be more accurately
stated that all that is needed is for the jury to have a reasonable doubt as to
the accused having such capacity. Thus any implied onus on the defence is
avoided.

Lemerick J.A. having noted these faults in the
charge, which I regard as serious, proceeded to cite the judgment of this Court
in R. v. Squire[5], at
p. 19 (S.C.R.):

It is, however, equally plain that a trial
judge is under no duty to invite the jury to consider defences of which there
is no evidence or which cannot reasonably be inferred from the evidence.

And then considering the evidence in some
detail, he came to the conclusion that there was no evidence on which a
jury could reasonably conclude that the accused might not have the capacity to
form the necessary intent.

With respect, I am of the opinion that Limerick
J.A. was in error in this course. There was evidence from the witness James
McNeil and the witness Linda Alward that both the accused were to some degree
intoxicated. There was, moreover, in the statements of both accused, submitted
by the Crown, strong allegations that they had been heavily intoxicated. It was
for the jury, properly instructed, to determine, whether on the above and all
the other evidence, they had any reasonable

[Page 568]

doubt that the accused had the capacity to form
the necessary intent. This, in my opinion, was not a problem of determining
whether or not there was any evidence, a task for the judge, but rather of
weighing the evidence, a task for the jury.

Limerick J.A. concluded his reasons as follows:

As there was no evidence on which a jury
could reasonably conclude the appellant might not have had the ability to form
the intents which it was necessary for the Crown to establish, it was not
necessary for the trial judge to charge the jury as to the effect of
intoxication and his directions relating thereto were surplusage and, though
erroneous, occasioned no miscarriage of justice as the jury, on the evidence,
was not required to consider that defence. I would apply s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code .

I would dismiss the appeal.

I have expressed a different conclusion above
but I am of the opinion that s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code  must be considered. Although I have concluded that there was evidence
of intoxication which should have been left to the jury, properly instructed,
as I have outlined, the problem remains whether the failure to properly charge
the jury caused any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. In Colpitts
v. The Queen[6], at
p. 755, this Court set out the test, i.e., whether the jury charged
as it should have been could, as reasonable men, have done otherwise than find
the appellant guilty. Limerick J.A. applied that test in Ambrose v. The
Queen[7], saying:

In my opinion, the massive weight of the
circumstantial evidence against Hutchison and his co-accused Ambrose is so
over-whelming that no reasonable jury properly instructed and acting judicially
could have come to any conclusion other than that both of the accused were
guilty of the murders of the two police officers as charged in the indictment,
notwithstanding the cumulative effect of the five errors referred to above.

That statement was approved in this Court: 30
C.C.C. (2d) 97 at pp. 105-6. Applying that test here, I am unable to see how
any jury, properly charged, could as reasonable men have failed to

[Page 569]

convict these appellants or specifically could
have concluded that there was any reasonable doubt that each of them had the
capacity to form the specific intent to rob and assault the late
Mr. Willet. It is not necessary to outline that evidence, sufficient to
say that it did convince a jury, a fact which cannot be ignored, despite the
faults in the charge; it convinced the Court of Appeal and it has convinced
this court.

I would dismiss the appeals.

The judgment of Ritchie and de Grandpré JJ. was
delivered by

DE GRANDPRÉ J.—My brother Spence, in his
reasons, concludes that the appeals should be dismissed. I agree with that
conclusion and I also agree with his reasons, except as to the defence of
drunkenness.

On that issue, I share the opinion of the Court
of Appeal that there was no evidence on which a jury, properly instructed,
could find that there existed such intoxication as to negate criminal intent.
To my mind, there did not exist any evidence capable of that interpretation, so
that the errors that the trial judge possibly committed when directing the jury
on that issue have no relevance. That particular defence in the circumstances
was non-existent.

If I held the opinion that there was some basis
for a defence of intoxication, I, like my brother, would without hesitation
apply art. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .

Appeals dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO

Criminal law —Breathalizer test —Statutes
—Interpretation —Number of breath samples to be taken —Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, ss. 235, 237(1)(f) as amended by the Criminal Code 
Amendment Act 1975, 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 93—Interpretation Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, s. 26(7).

Respondent was acquitted at trial on a charge
of driving a motor vehicle contrary to s. 236  of the Criminal Code 
(i.e. while having a blood alcohol level in excess of .08). The only
evidence of the blood alcohol level of the respondent introduced at his trial
was a certificate of a qualified technician pursuant to s. 237(1)(f)
of the Code showing the result of one analysis of a breath sample. The
Crown appealed by way of stated case on the basis that the trial judge had
erred in law by holding, first, that the certificate tendered pursuant to
s. 237(1) (f) was inadmissible as only one sample of breath was
taken and, second, that s. 26(7)  of the Interpretation Act had no
application to the interpretation of ss. 235  and 237  of the Criminal Code . The
Appeal Division dismissed the appeal and held that at least two breath samples
had to be taken under s. 237(1)(c) of the Code before
certificate can be admitted into evidence.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

While prior to the amending legislation [Criminal
Code Amendment Act 1975, 1974‑75‑76 (Can.), c. 93] a
certificate based on the analysis of only one sample of breath constituted of
itself evidence of the blood alcohol level of a person charged under
s. 236  and was sufficient to create a rebuttable presumption,
consideration of the wording of the sections before and after the
amendment makes it clear that the rebuttable presumption now arises only where samples
of the breath of the accused have been taken. That requirement is not
satisfied by showing that only one sample has been taken. Section 26(7)  of the Interpretation
Act has no application as it is not necessary to give the apparent
legislative intent to s. 237(1)(f) which taken in context clearly
applies only

[Page 633]

where more than one breath sample has been
taken. Further s. 237(1)(c)(ii), in providing for an “interval of
at least fifteen minutes between the time when the samples were taken”, clearly
establishes that more than one sample is required.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of New Brunswick, Appeal Division[1],
discussing a Crown appeal by way of stated case from an acquittal at trial by
Harper, Prov. Ct. J. on a charge of driving a motor vehicle contrary to
s. 236  of the Criminal Code . Appeal dismissed.

Barry Athey, for the appellant.

John G. Beaton, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal, brought with leave
of this Court, from a judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of
New Brunswick dismissing an appeal by way of stated case from the acquittal of
the respondent at his trial before Provincial Court Judge Harper, on a charge
of driving a motor vehicle contrary to s. 236  of the Criminal Code  which
provides, in part, that:

Every one who drives a motor vehicle or has
the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not, having
consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the proportion thereof in his blood
exceeds 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres… of blood is guilty of an
indictable offence or an offence punishable by summary conviction…

The case stated by the learned trial judge at
the instance of the Attorney General, pursuant to s. 762  of the Criminal
Code , is set out in full in the reasons for judgment delivered by
Mr. Justice Limerick in the Appeal Division and it reveals that

A certificate of a qualified technician
pursuant to Section 237(1) (f) of the Criminal Code  of Canada showing the
result of one analysis of a breath sample….

[Page 634]

was the only evidence of the blood alcohol level
of the respondent introduced at his trial in proof of the offence charged.

The following grounds of appeal are stipulated
in the “stated case”:

1. The Learned Trial Judge erred in law by
holding that a Certificate of a Qualified Technician tendered in evidence
pursuant to section 237(1) (f) of the Criminal Code  of Canada is
inadmissible if only one sample of breath is taken.

2. The learned Trial Judge erred in law by
holding that section 26(7)  of the Interpretation Act  of Canada
R.S.C. 1970 has no application to the interpretation of Section 235  and Section
237  of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

It is contended on behalf of the appellant that
the combined effect of ss. 235  and 237  of the Criminal Code  as amended
by the Criminal Code Amendment Act 1975, 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 93,
is that the certificate of a qualified technician based on the analysis of only
one sample of breath, constitutes of itself evidence of the blood alcohol
content of a person charged under s. 236  at the time of the alleged
offence.

I have no doubt that, before the amendment above
referred to, such a certificate was sufficient to create a rebuttable
presumption as to the blood alcohol content of the blood of such a person but
the question here at issue is whether the amendment has had the effect of
requiring the certificate to be based on the analysis of two or more such
samples before it can be acceptable as evidence of its contents without further
proof.

It appears to me that this question can best be
answered by a consideration of the wording of the relevant parts of these
sections before and after the amendment and these are reproduced hereunder
side by side for the purpose of comparison:

[The italics
throughout are my own]

Sections (d) and (e) of
s. 237(1)  remain as they were before the amendment.

The central contention advanced on behalf of the
appellant is that under the wording of s. 235  as amended, the number of
samples of his breath which a suspected person may be required to provide is
dependant entirely upon the opinion of the qualified technician as to what is necessary
to enable a proper analysis to be made and that

[Page 638]

accordingly as there is nothing to preclude the
acceptance by the technician of only one sample for analysis, it must follow
that one sample so analyzed is acceptable at trial as evidence of the blood
alcohol content of a person charged under s. 236 . This argument is said to
be strengthened by the further contention that the words “such samples of his
breath” as they occur in the amended s. 235(1) are to be construed as
meaning “such sample or samples” in accordance with s. 26(7)  of the Interpretation
Act , 1967-68 (Can.), c. 7 which provides that:

Words in the singular include the plural
and words in the plural include the singular.

The questions raised by this stated case are,
however, in no way dependant on whether or not the technician was satisfied
that only one sample was necessary for his analysis; what is at issue here is
whether or not a technician’s certificate based on the analysis of only one
sample is, of itself, without further proof, prima facie evidence of the
statements contained in it and this must depend on whether the rebuttable
presumption accorded to such a certificate by s. 237 , before the
amendment, subsists under the section as amended or whether the new
wording requires that the certificate be based upon two or more analyses before
it can be accepted without further proof of its contents.

The effect of s. 237  both before and after
the amendment is to establish the conditions under which the certificate of a
qualified technician is admissable, without further evidence, as proof of the
proportion of alcohol in the blood of the accused. These provisions are
obviously designed to assist the Crown in proving its case, and as they serve
to restrict the normal rights of the accused to cross-examination and saddle
him with the burden of proving that the certificate does not accurately reflect
his blood alcohol content at the time of the alleged offence, they are to be
strictly construed and, where ambiguous, interpreted in favour of the accused.

I subscribe to the opinion expressed by Chief
Justice Hughes in the last two paragraphs of his reasons for judgment in the
Appeal Division where he said:

[Page 639]

In my opinion the new s. 237(1)  makes
it amply clear that the rebuttable presumption as to the proportion of alcohol
in the blood of the accused at the time of the alleged offence arises only
‘where samples of the breath of the accused have been taken…’ and this
requirement is not satisfied by showing that only one sample has been taken.

Both clauses (c) and (f)
of s. 237(1)  confer special advantages on the prosecution and impose a
particular burden upon an accused to meet the burden of proof which arises when
the certificate of a qualified technician is received in evidence. Such a
provision must, in my opinion, be strictly construed and the requirement that a
certificate of a qualified technician is admissible only ‘where samples of
the breath of the accused have been taken’ cannot be extended by the provisions
of the Interpretation Act  declaring the singular to include the plural and vice
versa to a case where only one sample of the breath of the accused has been
taken. Such a provision, in my opinion, should only be resorted to where it is
necessary to give effect to the apparent legislative intent of the Act being
considered. No such necessity arises in construing clause (f) of
s. 237(1)  which in the context of the amendments referred to above clearly
applies only where more than one sample of the breath of the accused has been
taken.

I am of opinion also that s. 237(1) (c)(ii)
in providing for “an interval of at least fifteen minutes between the time when
the samples were taken”, clearly establishes that more than one sample is
required.

For all these reasons I would dismiss this
appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

structures—Whether affixation in the soil must be proved—Whether “mobile homes”
are buildings or structures—Criminal Code , s. 389(1) (a).

dismissed.

The judgment of the Court was delivered orally
by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—We do not need to hear you,
Mr. Hachborn. We agree with the Ontario Court of Appeal that the trial
judge erred in directing the jury to acquit the accused on the ground that the
mobile homes in their particular location and in their particular conditions
were not buildings or structures within the Criminal Code , s. 389(1) (a).
We do not agree with the submission of appellant’s counsel that affixation in
the soil is a requirement that must be satisfied before a finding of “building
or structure” can be made for the purpose of establishing culpability under s.
389(1) (a). The appeal is accordingly dismissed and the direction
for a new trial is affirmed.

Appeal dismissed, direction for new
trial affirmed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE,
PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Unlawful abortion—Defences sub­mitted to jury in
error—""Necessity"" not proven—Exclusion of criminal responsibility in
cases of surgical operations not applicable—Verdict of acquittal by a jury—Conviction
entered by Court of Appeal—Powers of Court of Appeal—Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. 34, ss. 251(1), (4), 45, 613(4)(b), 603, 605.

Appellant was accused of having procured the miscar­riage
of a female person by the manipulation and use of an instrument, contrary to s.
251(1) of the Criminal Code. During the trial which took place before a
judge and jury, he admitted the act, but relied upon the common law defence of
necessity and the statutory defence found in s. 45 of the Criminal Code.

A verdict of acquittal was returned. A unanimous
decision of the Court of Appeal set aside this verdict and a conviction was
entered with a direction to the trial judge to pass sentence. Hence the appeal
to this Court as of right under s. 618(2) of the Criminal Code, on the
basis that s. 251 of the Criminal Code is unconstitution­al; that it is
inoperative by virtue of the Canadian Bill of Rights; that the preferred
indictment was void as constituting an abuse of power by the provincial
Attorney General; that the accused was entitled to the benefit of the defences
of necessity and of s. 45; that the operation performed was not within the intendment
of s. 251; and that the Court of Appeal could not substitute a convic­tion for
an acquittal in a jury trial.

Held (Laskin C.J. and Judson and Spence JJ.
dissent­ing): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and de
Grandpré JJ.: Nothing was said to show that there was any

[Page 617]

evidence of an urgent necessity for effecting the
abortion in disregard of s. 251 of the Criminal Code. Therefore, the
Court of Appeal was correct in holding that the trial judge erred in putting
the defence of necessity before the jury as there was no evidence to support
it. It would be wholly inconsistent with the requirements for a legal abortion
as they are clearly defined in s. 251, to read s. 45 as protecting from
criminal responsibility any person who performs the operation anywhere provided
only that it is done with reasonable care and skill having regard to the state
of health of the woman. To submit that the operation performed did not come
within the intendment of s. 251 is to ignore the meaning of
""avortement"" in the French version as well as the definition of
""means"". By specifying the use of an instrument, the section clearly
covers a surgical abortion as practiced by the accused. As for the conviction
entered by the Court of Appeal after the accused had been acquitted by a jury,
s. 605(1) of the Criminal Code, granting the right of appeal from an
acquittal, clearly includes a judgment at trial with or without a jury. Section
613(4) authorizes the Court of Appeal to enter a verdict of guilty where the
accused was tried by a jury. Paragraph (b) necessarily applies to a jury
verdict after such a trial as well as to an acquittal by a judge. It is true
that, as a rule, the duty of a court of appeal is to render the judgment that
the trial court should have rendered. However, under our Criminal Code in
what is clearly a fundamental departure from common law principles, Parliament
has not only pro­vided for appeals against acquittals, but has also spelled out
the powers which can be exercised on such appeals, including that of entering a
verdict of guilty when there has been an acquittal by jury verdict. This is
obviously a power to be used with great circumspection.

Per Martland, Ritchie, Dickson, Beetz and de
Grandpré JJ.: Section 45 of the Criminal Code is not available as a
defence to a charge under s. 251. Parliament in s. 251 has proscribed as
criminal conduct, surgery procur­ing a miscarriage, except in conformity with
precise and detailed protective measures including a qualified medi­cal
practitioner and an accredited or approved hospital. Section 251 contains a
comprehensive code on the sub­ject of abortions, unitary and complete within
itself, which the general language of s. 45 does not touch. Section 45 may be
available as an answer to a charge arising out of a surgical operation
performed on an

[Page 618]

unconscious patient but it is not available as an
answer to a charge of procuring an abortion contrary to s. 251 for s. 251 is
concerned with procurement of miscarriage and only remotely, if at all, with
surgical operations. As for the defence of necessity, at the very least it must
rest upon evidence from which a jury could find (I) that the accused in good
faith considered the situation so emer­gent that failure to terminate the pregnancy
immediate­ly could endanger life or health and (2) that upon any reasonable
view of the facts compliance with the law was impossible. The evidence did not
establish these two conditions and the defence of necessity was not open to the
appellant.

Per Laskin C.J. and Judson and Spence JJ., dissent­ing:
The contention that s. 251 of the Criminal Code was invalid was
rejected by this Court because Parlia­ment may determine what is not criminal
as well as what is, and may hence introduce dispensations or exemptions in its
criminal legislation. Parliament has made a judgment which does not admit of
any interfer­ence by the Courts. Furthermore, having regard to the residuary
feature of federal legislative power, s. 251 cannot be invalidated unless it is
shown that it is in relation to a head of exclusive provincial legislative
power. This was not proven.

As to the effect of the Canadian Bill of Rights upon
s. 251, s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights must not be
regarded as charging the Courts with supervising the administrative efficiency
of legislation or with evaluat­ing the regional or national organization of its
adminis­tration, in the absence of any touchstone in the legisla­tion itself
which would indicate a violation of s. 1(6). There is no judicial basis for
impeaching s. 251 under s. 1(b) merely because not all persons affected by s.
251 may find it feasible because of geographical or economic considerations to
take shelter under its exculpating terms. Any unevenness in the administration
of the relieving provisions is for Parliament to correct and not for the Courts
to monitor as being a denial of equality before the law and the protection of
the law.

As to the dispensations afforded by compliance with s.
251(4) and (5), they do not involve any issue of depriva­tion of a right which
may require an opportunity to be heard with or without counsel. They simply
permit a person to make conduct lawful which would otherwise be unlawful.
Furthermore, it is difficult to see how due process of law in s. 1(a) can be
said to require express provision for review of a therapeutic abortion
committee’s

[Page 619]

decisions or can require that reasons be given for
these.

The contention that the standard upon which thera­peutic
abortion committees must act is uncertain and subjective must be rejected.
Parliament could assign an exercise of judgment as to the danger of
continuation of pregnancy to a professional group without colliding with any
imperatives called for by due process of law under s. 1(a).

Finally, it cannot be said that the mere prohibition
of' abortions save as permitted by s. 251(4)(5) involves any imposition of
treatment nor that a physician or other person who runs foul of the abortion
law is subjected to cruel or unusual punishment if he is sentenced to a term of
imprisonment for his criminal conduct. That would mean ignoring the contextual
importance of the words ""impose"" and ""imposition"".
Furthermore the proposi­tions that the accused had a right to a preliminary
inquiry and that he had a right to have the indictment screened by a grand jury
before its presentation to the Court must be rejected. Modes of trial or modes
of bringing an accused to trial are not, by reason of their number, in
violation of s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights.

As to the legal issues raised under the Criminal
Code, not only does s. 45 remain available as a defence but there was also
evidence upon which the trial judge could leave that defence to the jury. In
charging the jury on this defence, the trial judge proceeded to outline the
elements of a s. 45 defence and then to relate the evidence to those elements
by explaining that the required regard ""to all the circumstances of the
case"" brought into play s. 251(4) itself as a circumstance bearing on the
resort to s. 45.

Since the charge arose out of a surgical operation and
since provision existed for a lawful therapeutic abortion under s. 251(4), the
evidentiary question, in the light of the law that was put to the jury on
necessity, was whether there were more emergent circumstances than those
reflected in s. 45 upon which the jury could act, if it so chose, despite the
provision for a lawful abortion under s. 251(4). There was some such evidence,
and it was for the jury to say whether, in the circumstances, the harm sought
to be avoided was an immediate and physical one, and whether there was enough
of an emergency in this respect facing the accused as to make it certain that
there could be no effective resort to the machinery of s. 251(4) to cope with
the emergency. The sufficiency of evidence on any issue is a matter for the
jury, which alone is charged to accept what it chooses

[Page 620]

and to weigh what it accepts in the light of the law
given to it by the trial judge. The jury discharged this function in this case;
and once it is decided that there was evidence to go to the jury on the two
defences which were properly left to the jury, the jury's verdict is not one
which can be lightly interfered with by an Appellate Court.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Judson and Spence JJ. was
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—This appeal, which is
before this Court as of right under s. 618(2) of the Criminal Code, presents
the highly unusual, if not the singularly exceptional, situation of an
appellate court itself entering a conviction after setting aside a jury verdict
of acquittal. The appellant, Dr. Henry Morgentaler, was acquitted on the
verdict of a jury of unlawfully procuring the miscarriage of a female person,
contrary to s. 251 of the Criminal Code. That verdict was set aside and
a conviction was entered by the Quebec Court of Appeal which found it
unnecessary to send the case back for a new trial. The five judges who
constituted the court, unanimous in result but not in their reasons,
concentrated on the two defences that the trial judge had left to the jury, a
defence under s. 45 of the Criminal Code and the common law defence of
necessity preserved by s. 7(3) of the Criminal Code. It was the opinion
of the court that s. 45 was not available as a defence to a charge under s. 251
(or, in the opinion of at least one of the judges, if open, was not applicable
in this particular case) and that the defence of neces­sity, in so far as it
differed in this case from s. 45 and in so far as it could be a separate
defence, was not supported by any evidence that would bring it into play on the
facts of this case in respect of all, or at least one of the elements in
respect of which the defence had to raise a reasonable doubt.

The appeal from the conviction by the Quebec Court of Appeal is
founded on the defences which the trial judge had put to the jury and as well
on a number of other matters, set out below, going to the merits of the charge
and the acquittal at trial. In addition, the appellant has challenged the con­stitutional
validity of s. 251 and has also contested its operative effect in the light of
the Canadian Bill of Rights. Intervention on these matters was sought
and accorded to the Attorney General of Canada, the Canadian Civil Liberties
Association, the Foundation for Women in Crisis, the Alliance

[Page 622]

for Life, the Fondation de la Vie, the Front
Commun pour le Respect de la Vie and l'Associa­tion des Medecins du Québec pour Le Respect de la Vie.

Section 251 of the Criminal Code, in its present
form, which is as it was when the charge against Dr. Morgentaler was laid,
reads as follows:

251. (1) Every one who, with intent to procure the
miscarriage of a female person, whether or not she is pregnant, uses any means
for the purpose of carrying out his intention is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.

(2) Every female person who, being pregnant, with intent to
procure her own miscarriage, uses any means or permits any means to be used for
the purpose of carrying out her intention is guilty of an indictable offence
and is liable to imprisonment for two years.

(3) In this section, ""means"" includes

(a) the administration of a drug or other noxious thing,

(b) the use of an instrument, and

(c) manipulation of any kind.

(4) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to

(a) a qualified medical practitioner, other than a member of
a therapeutic abortion committee for any hospital, who in good faith uses in an
accredited or approved hospital any means for the purpose of carry­ing out his
intention to procure the miscarriage of a female person, or

(b) a female person who, being pregnant, permits a qualified
medical practitioner to use in an accredited or approved hospital any means
described in paragraph (a) for the purpose of carrying out her intention to
procure her own miscarriage, if, before the use of those means, the therapeutic
abortion committee for that accredited or approved hospital, by a majority of
the members of the committee and at a meeting of the committee at which the
case of such female person has been reviewed,

(c) has by certificate in writing stated that in its opinion
the continuation of the pregnancy of such female person would or would be
likely to endanger her life or health, and

(d) has caused a copy of such certificate to be given to the
qualified medical practitioner.

[Page 623]

(5) The Minister of Health of a province may by order

(a) require a therapeutic abortion committee for any
hospital in that province, or any member thereof, to furnish to him a copy of
any certificate described in paragraph (4)(c) issued by that committee,
together with such other information relating to the circum­stances surrounding
the issue of that certificate as he may require, or

(b) require a medical practitioner who, in that prov­ince,
has procured the miscarriage of any female person named in a certificate
described in paragraph (4)(c), to furnish to him a copy of that certificate,
together with such other information relating to the procuring of the
miscarriage as he may require.

(6) For the purposes of subsections (4) and (5) and this
subsection

""accredited hospital"" means a hospital accredited
by the Canadian Council on Hospital Accreditation in which diagnostic services
and medical, surgical and obstetri­cal treatment arc provided;

""approved hospital"" means a hospital in a province
approved for the purposes of this section by the Minister of Health of that
province;

""board"" means the board of governors, management
or directors, or the trustees, commission or other person or group of persons
having the control and management of an accredited or approved hospital;

""Minister of Health"" means

(a) in the Provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick,
Manitoba, Alberta, Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island, the Minister of
Health,

(b) in the Province of British Columbia, the Minister of
Health Services and Hospital Insurance,

(c) in the Provinces of Nova Scotia and Saskatche­wan, the
Minister of Public Health, and

(d) in the Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories,
the Minister of National Health and Welfare;

[Page 624]

""qualified medical practitioner"" means a person
entitled to engage in the practice of medicine under the laws of the province
in which the hospital referred to in subsection (4) is situated;

""therapeutic abortion committee"" for any hospital
means a committee, comprised of not less than three members each of whom is a
qualified medical practi­tioner, appointed by the board of that hospital for
the purpose of considering and determining questions relating to terminations
of pregnancy within that hospital,

(7) Nothing in subsection (4) shall be construed as making
unnecessary the obtaining of any authorization or consent that is or may be
required, otherwise than under this Act, before any means are used for the
purpose of carrying out an intention to procure the miscarriage of a female
person.

This provision, consisting of prohibitory terms in subss. (1) and
(2) and of relieving terms in subss. (4) and (5) (the other subsections are
definition and supporting clauses), is the product, as to its prohibitory
terms, of legislation originating in s. 60 of the Offences against the
Person Act, 1869 (Can.), c. 20, which in turn was founded upon the Offences
against the Person Act, 1861 (U.K.), c. 100, s. 58. Its relieving
provisions were enacted in 1969 by 1968-69 (Can.), c. 38, s. 18.

At the conclusion of the submission by counsel for the appellant
and by counsel for the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and counsel for the
Foundation for Women in Crisis, the Court announced that it did not need to
hear the respondent Crown or the other intervenors on either the constitutional
issue or on the applicabili­ty and effect of the Canadian Bill of Rights because
no case was made out on these matters which required an answer. It is
nonetheless impor­tant, in my opinion, to state why the attack on the validity
and operation of s. 251 was rejected.

—II—

First, as to the attack on validity. The conten­tion that s. 251
was invalid as being an encroachment on provincial legislative power in
relation to hospitals and to the regulation of the profession of medicine and
the practice of medicine was made by the appellant alone. It was founded on the
position that s. 251 did not meet the test of valid

[Page 625]

criminal law set out by Rand J. in the Margarine Reference,
Reference re Validity of Section 5(a) of the Dairy Industry Act[2],
where that learned judge stated it as follows (at pp. 49-50):

A crime is an act which the law, with appropriate penal
sanctions, forbids; but as prohibitions are not enacted in a vacuum, we can
properly look for some evil or injurious or undesirable effect upon the public
against which the law is directed. That effect may be in relation to social,
economic or political interests; and the legisla­ture has had in mind to
suppress the evil or to safeguard the interest threatened ... .

Is the prohibition then enacted with a view to a public
purpose which can support it as being in relation to criminal law? Public peace,
order, security, health, mor­ality: these are the ordinary though not exclusive
ends served by that law, .. .

In my opinion, the provisions of s. 251 as it stood after the
amendment in 1969 are well within the scope of the tests by which the late Justice
Rand would measure a valid exercise of the federal criminal law power.

The wide scope of the exclusive federal criminal law power has
been consistently asserted in the relevant case law in both the Privy Council,
when it was Canada's ultimate appellate court, and in this Court. Parliament,
in fastening upon certain behaviour or conduct or activity as criminal by
proscribing it with penal sanctions, exercises a judgment which is not
constitutionally impeachable simply because it may attract the opposition of a
section of the population. The remedy or relief, as the case may be, lies with
Parliament and not with this Court unless it is made plain to the Court that
the use of the penal sanction was a colourable or evasive means of drawing into
the orbit of the federal criminal law measures that did not belong there,
either because they were essen­tially regulatory of matters within exclusive
pro­vincial competence or were otherwise within such exclusive competence.

[Page 626]

Counsel for the appellant invoked history to support the
submission that whatever the basis of prohibitory abortion legislation when
first enacted in England by Lord Ellenborough's Act, 1803 (U.K.), c. 58,
the evil aimed at had substantially abated because of improved medical and
surgical procedures now known and practiced, and especial­ly because of the
widely-used surgical suction procedure practiced by the appellant to terminate
a pregnancy. Counsel relied on the recent judg­ments of the Supreme Court of
the United States in Roe v. Wade[3]
and Doe v. Bolton[4].
Those were cases that turned on the scope of the constitutional guarantees
of the fourteenth and the ninth amendment of the American Constitution, and
were not based on any issue of the limits of federal and state legislative
power inter se. Indeed, counsel for the appellant conceded that, absent
any issue of con­stitutional guarantees, there could be no valid attack upon
the constitutionality of the state abor­tion legislation in those cases as
being a trespass on congressional legislative power. (It should be recalled
that there is no general criminal law power in the Congress but it resides
rather in the states, qualified only by such power in the field of criminal law
as Congress derives from its assigned powers.)

What counsel sought to draw from Roe v. Wade and Doe v.
Bolton was that the present s. 251 of the Criminal Code could no
longer be supported as legislation for the protection of a pregnant wom­an's
health, and hence that rationale could no longer justify the presence of s. 251
in the Crimi­nal Code. This, however, is to attribute to Parlia­ment a
particular, indeed exclusive concern under s. 251 with health, to the exclusion
of any other purpose that would make it a valid exercise of the criminal law
power. I am unable to accept this assessment of the basis of s. 251. Perhaps
the matter would have a different face if there was here the kind of material
that moved the courts in the Margarine Reference (Reference re
Validity of Section 5(a) of the Dairy Industry Act)[5]

[Page 627]

to hold that the challenged s. 5(a) could no longer be
supported as for the protection of health. Moreover, in that case there was no
other supporting purpose open (apart from Parliament's power to control exports
and imports of margarine). What is patent on the face of the prohibitory
portion of s. 251 is that Parliament has in its judgment decreed that
interference by another, or even by the preg­nant woman herself, with the
ordinary course of conception is socially undesirable conduct subject to punishment.
That was a judgment open to Parliament in the exercise of its plenary criminal
law power, and the fact that there may be safe ways of terminating a pregnancy
or that any woman or women claim a personal privilege to that end, becomes
immaterial. I need cite no au­thority for the proposition that Parliament may
determine what is not criminal as well as what is, and may hence introduce
dispensations or exemp­tions in its criminal legislation. It has done this in
respect of gaming and betting by prescribing for lawful operation of
pari-mutuel systems (s. 188), by exempting agricultural fairs or exhibitions
from certain of the prohibitions against lotteries and games of chance (s.
189(3)) and by expressly permitting lotteries under stated conditions (s. 190).
I point also to the Lord's Day Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. L-13 as an
illustration of a federal statute drawing its validity from the criminal law
power which contains various exemptions.

Thus, I see nothing in s. 251(4)(5) that, either alone or
in relation to s. 251 as a whole, casts any doubt on its validity. There is,
finally, the very relevant point that having regard to the residuary feature of
federal legislative power, s. 251 cannot be invalidated unless it be shown that
it is in relation to a head of exclusive provincial legislative power. The only
suggested bases of invalidation put forward by the appellant were the exclusive
provincial powers under s. 92(7)(13) and (16). The

[Page 628]

short answer to these assertions is that in so far as s. 251 has
any relationship to the establishment of hospitals or the regulation of the
medical profes­sion or the practice thereof, the relationship is so incidental
as to be little short of ephemeral.

—III—

I now address myself to the submissions of counsel for the
appellant and counsel for the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and counsel
for the Foundation for Women in Crisis on the effect of the Canadian Bill of
Rights upon s. 251. These submissions invoked, in the main, s. 1(a) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights and s. 1(b), s. 2(b) and, in one respect, s. 2(e).
These provisions read as follows:

1. It is hereby recognized and declared that in Canada there
have existed and shall continue to exist without discrimination by reason of
race, national origin, colour, religion or sex, the following human rights and
fundamental freedoms, namely,

(a) the right of the individual to life, liberty, security
of the person and enjoyment of property, and the right not to be deprived
thereof except by due process of law;

(b) the right of the individual to equality before the law
and the protection of the law;

2. Every law of Canada shall, unless it is expressly
declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate
notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied as not
to abrogate, abridge or infringe or to authorize the abrogation, abridgment or
infringement of any of the rights or freedoms herein recognized and declared,
and in par­ticular, no law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as to

(b) impose or authorize the imposition of cruel and unusual
treatment or punishment;

(e) deprive a person of the right to a fair hearing in
accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for the determination of
his rights and obligations;

Before summarizing and dealing with the sub-missions, variously
made, on the Canadian Bill of Rights there is one matter, advanced by
the appel­lant as bearing on the range of the Canadian Bill of Rights,

[Page 629]

upon which I wish to comment. It was counsel's contention that
the language in s. 1(a) and s. 1(b) upon which he relied, came from the
Constitution of the United States and he urged, in consequence, that the
adoption of the language involved the adoption of the decisional law by which
it has been elaborated and applied. Since counsel for the appellant abjured any
claim that stare decisis operated, his submission amounted to this, that
decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States should carry weight in the
consider­ation of the particular provisions of the Canadian Bill of Rights.

This Court has found such decisions to be help­ful in the past
and remains receptive to their citation, but they do not carry any authority
beyond persuasiveness according to their relevance in the light of context, with
due regard to the obvious differences that exist between the statutory Canadian
Bill of Rights and the guarantees of the Constitution of the United States.
To give decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States respectful
consideration does not carry us into any such theory of the adopted statute as
the appellant propounded. Such a theory might have a place where provincial
legislation, already con­strued by this Court, has been adopted by another
provincial legislature. It does not operate in the present case as the
appellant would have it.

The contentions under the Canadian Bill of Rights were
that (1) under s. 1(a) thereof women had a right to privacy, involving at least
a qualified right to have pregnancy terminated, especially in the first trimester
of pregnancy; (2) the right to security of the person under s. 1(a) was infringed
by s. 251 without due process of law because the standard in s. 251(4)
(""would or would be likely to endanger her life or health"") was so
vague, so uncertain and so subjective as among different physicians and as
among different therapeutic abortion committees as to deny due process of law;
(3) there was a further denial of due process of law in the failure to provide
adequate procedural safeguards whereby an applicant may appear, with counsel,
if she so pleases, before a therapeutic abortion committee to plead her case;
(4) moreover,

[Page 630]

since there was a right to obtain an abortion under certain
circumstances without risking crimi­nal penalty, there was a right to a fair
hearing thereon in accordance with the principles of funda­mental justice,
pursuant to s. 2(e) of the Canadian Bill of Rights; (5) there was a
denial of equality before the law and the protection of the law under s. 1(b)
because s. 251(4), in permitting 'but not compelling the establishment of
therapeutic abor­tion committees and in specifying the number of medical
practitioners for those committees, oper­ates unequally in respect of women in
rural areas and in areas where no such committees have been established and in
relation to women whose eco­nomic status prevents the mobility necessary to
avail themselves of such committees where they exist, and in any event, creates
inequality because the vague standard given to the committees makes varying interpretations
and applications thereof inevitable and consequently enables some women to
obtain the protection of the law and others not; (6) there was also a denial of
due process of law under s. 1(a) for failure to provide for a review of the
decisions of therapeutic abortion committees having regard to the vague
standard they must apply, the inability of an applicant to plead her case and
the want of reasons for the committees' decisions; indeed the failure to
require reasons was itself a denial of due process of law; and (7) the fact
that a woman is prevented from having and a physician from performing an
abortion using safe medically—proven techniques constitutes cruel and unusual
treatment; and moreover, the fact that a physician is prevented from and is
punished for performing an abortion which is in his judgment, in the best
interest's of his patient and is with her consent is cruel and unusual
punishment.

[Page 631]

It was also submitted by counsel for the Foun­dation for Women in
Crisis that the Canadian Bill of Rights, even if considered merely as an
aid to interpretation, would support resort to s. 45 as a defence to a charge
under s. 251.

This last point does not, in my opinion, give any larger shape to
s. 45 than it has under ordinary principles of construction applicable to
enactments which provide shelter against conduct that would otherwise be
criminal. Point 7 in the submissions on the Canadian Bill of Rights fails
because it ignores the contextual importance of the words ""impose""
and ""imposition"". I am unable to agree that the mere prohibition of
abortions save as permitted by s. 251(4)(5) involves any imposition of
treatment; nor can it be said that a physician or other person who runs foul of
the abortion law is subjected to cruel or unusual punishment if he is sentenced
to a term of imprisonment for his crimi­nal conduct. Counsel's submission here
inverts s. 2(6) of the Canadian Bill of Rights into a pros­cription
against making conduct criminal. It is quite untenable.

I deal with points (3) and (4) together, and the short answer to
them is that the dispensations afforded by compliance with s. 251(4) and (5) do
not involve any issue of deprivation of a right which may require an
opportunity to be heard with or without counsel. Nothing is being taken away
under s. 251(4) and (5); they simply permit a person to make conduct lawful
which would otherwise be unlawful. I note in this connection that s. 251(4) and
(5) envisage that a qualified medical practitioner will be involved in the
review by a therapeutic abortion committee of the case of a pregnant female who
seeks lawfully to terminate her pregnancy. Point 6 is a related point and I am
unable to see how due process of law in s. 1(a) can be said to require express
provision for review of a therapeutic abortion committee's decisions or can
require that reasons be given for them. There is no violation of due process of
law even in the case of quasi-judicial or regulatory statutory bodies where

[Page 632]

no provision is made for review of their determinations.

Point 1 and point 2 of the submissions on the Canadian Bill of
Rights may be dealt with to­gether. They raise the question considered by
this Court in Curr v. The Queen[6]
whether s. 1(a) of the Canadian Bill of Rights can be read as
invit­ing this Court to pass on the substantive quality of legislation as well
as on the adequacy of proce­dural safeguards for the right of the individual to
life, liberty, security of the person and enjoyment of property, as specified
in s. 1(a). The contentions of counsel who would impugn s. 251 in the light of
s. 1(a) of the Canadian Bill of Rights are founded, as to point 1, on
the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States in the Wade and Bolton
cases previously cited; and, as to point 2, are founded to a degree on
those cases and on other decisions in the United States, such as that in The
People v. Barksdale[7],
a judgment of the Supreme Court of California.

This Court indicated in the Curr case how for­eign to our
constitutional traditions, to our consti­tutional law and to our conceptions of
judicial review was any interference by a court with the substantive content of
legislation. No doubt, sub­stantive content had to be measured on an issue of ultra
vires even prior to the enactment of the Canadian Bill of Rights, and
necessary interpreta­tive considerations also had and have a bearing on
substantive terms. Of course, the Canadian Bill of Rights introduced a
new dimension in respect of the operation and application of federal law, as
the judgments of this Court have attested. Yet it cannot be forgotten that it
is a statutory instru­ment, illustrative of Parliament's primacy within the
limits of its assigned legislative authority, and this is a relevant
consideration in determining how far the language of the Canadian Bill of
Rights should be taken in assessing the quality of federal enactments which
are challenged under s. 1(a). There is as much a temptation here as there is on
the question of ultra vires to consider the wisdom

[Page 633]

of the legislation, and 1 think it is our duty to resist it in
the former connection as in the latter.

I am not, however, prepared to say, in this early period of the
elaboration of the impact of the Canadian Bill of Rights upon federal
legislation, that the prescriptions of s. 1(a) must be rigidly confined
to procedural matters. There is often an interaction of means and ends, and it
may be that there can be a proper invocation of due process of law in respect
of federal legislation as improperly abridging a person's right to life,
liberty, security and enjoyment of property. Such a reservation is not,
however, called for in the present case.

The contention under point 1 that a right of privacy, as an
element of liberty, is protected against federal invasion, is founded upon Roe
v. Wade, supra. Yet that case did not recognize this as absolute to the
exclusion of a state interest to protect health or potential life. Rather, it
sought to balance its recognition of the right to privacy (that is, the right
to decide on an abortion) with the right, timewise, of the state to interfere.
(The Supreme Court of the United States disclaimed any intention to support
abortion on demand, and, indeed, no such claim was advanced by counsel for the
appellant or by his supporting intervenors in the present case.) In a situation
such as exists in Canada, where there is an exclusive national federal criminal
law power and no constitutionally entrenched Bill of Rights, I am unable to
agree that we would be warranted in dividing the normal gestation period into
zones of interest, one or more to be protected against state interference and
another or others not. This is altogether apart from the question whether
""liberty"" in s. 1(a) embraces privacy or freedom of choice in any
such sense as to entitle a pregnant woman to claim that the federal Parliament
may not legislate as it has done in s. 251 in its present form.

[Page 634]

Appellant's contentions on the constitutional validity of s. 251
were in some measure based on the saine considerations that the intervenors,
Canadian Civil Liberties Association and the Foundation for Women in Crisis,
urged in chal­lenging s. 251 under s. 1(a) of the Canadian Bill of Rights. The
challenge, in my view, fails in the latter respect as it failed in the former.

The contention under point 2 is equally unten­able as an attempt
to limit the substance of legisla­tion in a situation which does not admit of
it. In submitting that the standard upon which thera­peutic abortion committees
must act is uncertain and subjective, counsel who make the submission cannot
find nourishment for it even in Doe v. Bolton. There it was held that
the prohibition of abortion by a physician except when ""based upon
his best clinical judgment that an abortion is necessary"" did not
prescribe a standard so vague as to be constitutionally vulnerable. A
fortiori, under the approach taken here to substantive due process, the
argument of uncertainty and subjec­tivity fails. It is enough to say that
Parliament has fixed a manageable standard because it is addressed to a
professional panel, the members of which would be expected to bring a practiced
judgment to the question whether ""the continua­tion of the pregnancy ...
would or would be likely to endanger ... life or health"". Moreover, I am
of the view that Parliament could assign such an exercise of judgment to a
professional group without colliding with any imperatives called for by due
process of law under s. 1 (a).

Finally, in the catalogue of submissions under the Canadian
Bill of Rights is point 5 which, understandably, shows concern for the
effect of place or area of residence (where remote from hospitals or where
there is a dearth of qualified physicians) and economic status on the
availability and accessibility of the services under s. 251(4) and (5) of
the Criminal Code, through which an

[Page 635]

abortion may be sought without risk of criminality. The
contention that there is here a denial of equality before the law and the
protection of the law necessarily assesses s. 251(4) and (5) accord­ing to
whether it gives its advantages to all sections of the Canadian community,
enabling them to avail themselves of it in whatever part of Canada they may be
and regardless of their economic status. Assessment on this basis would make
the operation of s. 251(4) and (5) depend on there being a certain distribution
of physicians throughout the country and on the availability of hospitals in
all areas. It would mean too that the Court would have to come to some
conclusion on what distribution would satisfy equality before the law, and that
the Court would have to decide how large or small an area must be within which
an acceptable distribution of physicians and hospitals must be found. This is a
reach for equality by judicially unmanageable standards, and is posited on the
theory that the Court should either give directions for the achievement of
relative equality of access to therapeutic abortion committees and approved
hospitals to overcome an alleged legislative short-coming, or should strike
down not only subss. (4) and (5) of s. 251 (which would leave an unquali­fied
prohibition of abortion) but the whole section as being inseverable.

I do not regard s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights as
charging the courts with supervising the administrative efficiency of
legislation or with eva­luating the regional or national organization of its
administration, in the absence of any touchstone in the legislation itself
which would indicate a viola­tion of s. 1(b) including the specified
prohibitions of discrimination by reason of race, national origin, colour,
religion or sex. There is nothing of this sort in s. 251. Nor is that
section vulnerable to attack on any substantive ground inhering in the command
of ""equality before the law and the protection of the law"". There may
be situations where, in determining whether federal legislation is incompatible
with s. 1(b) or other provisions of the Canadian Bill of Rights, the
Court may have to examine and come to a conclusion on the purpose or object of
the challenged legislation and decide whether its provisions bear a rational
relation

[Page 636]

to that purpose. The present case does not raise this issue when
there is nothing to show that s. 251 offends against the prohibited discrimina­tions
or is otherwise offensive to s. 1(b). I do not find any judicial basis for
impeaching s. 251 under s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights because
not all persons affected by s. 251 may find it feasible because of geographical
or economic consider­ations to take shelter under its exculpating terms.

Whether s. 251 be viewed as primarily a crimi­nal prohibition
subject to a dispensing provision, or as establishing a forum and a formula for
lawful abortions which must be followed on pain of crimi­nality, I see nothing
in it which warrants this Court in either blunting its operation or rendering
it inoperative as incompatible with s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights. Both
the prohibition in s. 251 and its relieving terms are general in their
application; and in qualifying the prohibition against the intentional
procurement of a miscar­riage by a requirement of certification of likely
danger to life or health by a medical practitioner and interposing the
safeguards of a medical screening committee and performance of the abor­tion in
an accredited or approved hospital, Parlia­ment has made a judgment which does
not admit of any interference by the courts. Nor can I regard Parliament's
prescription of the number to consti­tute a therapeutic abortion committee, nor
the limitation that the performance of authorized abortions be in an approved
or accredited hospital as raising a judicially reviewable question. Any
unevenness in the administration of the relieving provisons is for Parliament
to correct and not for the courts to monitor as being a denial of equality
before the law and the protection of the law.

Counsel for the appellant took the point, which was elaborated in
great detail in the appellant's factum, that since the prosecution in this case
was initiated by an indictment preferred by the Attor­ney General of Quebec who
signed it personally, there was a duty upon the Attorney General to act

[Page 637]

judicially in the exercise of his power and he had not so acted.
It was contended further that s. 507(3) of the Criminal Code, under
which the indictment was preferred, was in conflict with s. 1(b) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights as being a denial of equality before the law and the
protection of the law. As to the submission that there was a duty to act
judicially which had been violated it is enough to adopt the ruling on this
point of the trial judge, as follows:

Even assuming ... that the attorney general in sign­ing the
preferred indictment was exercising a quasi-judi­cial function, I do not think
that there is anything before me which would entitle me to hold that such
discretion had been improperly exercised.

The contention on the Canadian Bill of Rights must also be
rejected. It is founded on the proposi­tion that the accused had a right to a
preliminary inquiry, and on the further proposition that he had a right to have
the indictment screened by a grand jury before its presentation to the Court.
in short, the submission is that uniformity of criminal law administration
across Canada is involved in s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights. I
do not find any violation of the Canadian Bill of Rights simply because
our criminal law and procedure provide for alternative methods of bringing an
accused person to trial. The methods prescribed have their roots in history,
and this is a relevant factor in considering whether there is a denial of
equality before the law. The submission of the appellant here, if accepted,
would entail desistment from trial by judge alone because trial by jury is also
prescribed or vice versa. Modes of trial or modes of bringing an accused
to trial are not, by reason of their number, and consequent choice of one or
another, whether by the prosecution or by an accused, in violation of s. 1(b)
of the Canadian Bill of Rights: see Smythe v. The Queen[8].

—IV—

I turn now to the facts of the present case and to the legal
issues raised by those facts under the

[Page 638]

Criminal Code. The appellant was
charged with performing an illegal abortion on August 15, 1973, upon a
twenty-six year old unmarried female who had come to Canada from a foreign
country in 1972 on a student visa. She was without family or close friends in
Canada, ineligible to take employment and also ineligible for Medicare
benefits. On becoming apprehensive of possible pregnancy in July, 1973, she
consulted a physician in general practice who referred her to a gynecologist.
He confirmed that she was pregnant, but refused assistance to procure an
abortion. On her own initiative she canvassed five Montreal hospitals by
telephone and learned that if an abortion was to be performed she would have to
bear the fees of a surgeon and an anaesthetist, and could envisage two or three
days' hospitalization at $ i 40 per day. This was far beyond her means.

Throughout the period following her apprehen­sion and the
confirmation of her pregnancy and until the abortion performed by the
appellant, she was anxious, unable to eat or sleep properly, prone to vomiting
and quite depressed. Her condition had an adverse effect upon her studies and
it was aggravated by her being told that the longer she delayed in having an
abortion the more dangerous it would be. One hospital offered her an
appointment (which would result in her case coming before the therapeutic
abortion committee) at the end of August, 1973, when she would be eight to ten
weeks pregnant. She got in touch with the appellant at the suggestion of a
hospital or hospi­tals that she had contacted. There is some discrep­ancy
between her evidence and that of the appel­lant as to the scope and nature of
the conversation between them when she visited his clinic where the abortion
was performed. In this appeal I think it proper to accept the evidence of the
appellant who testified that his discussion with her went beyond asking whether
she had previously had an abor­tion, when she realized she was pregnant and
what his fee would be. He asserted that the conversation also encompassed
reference to her country of origin, her vocation, her marital status and why an
abortion was necessary. During the conversation the appellant said that he
assessed the necessity of an abortion by reference to her state of anxiety,

[Page 639]

her inability to eat or sleep properly and the consequent adverse
effect on her physical health. He also considered that her determination to
have an abortion might lead her to do something fool­ish. The appellant was
aware that his patient had approached a number of hospitals without success,
but did not know that she had been offered an appointment at the end of August,
1973.

The appellant's competence to perform the abortion was
unquestioned. I do not think that the fact that he has performed numerous
abortions should have any adverse bearing on any defence that was open to him
in this case. As a competent surgeon, the fact of his specialization should
make it more likely than not that he would be in a better position than a
non-specialist to determine, relative to a patient's state of pregnancy and to
her state of physical and mental health, whether abortional surgery should be
carried out at the particular time. The trial Judge stated in imposing sentence
upon the appellant (as directed by the Quebec Court of Appeal when it set aside
the jury's acquittal and entered a conviction) that there was substantial
evidence at the trial that had this woman gone to an accredited hospital, she
would have received the approval of a therapeutic abor­tion committee to have
an abortion performed, but, of course, it was merely speculation whether she
would in fact have received such approval. In short, according to the trial
Judge, there was evidence upon which the therapeutic abortion com­mittee could
conclude that the continuation of her pregnancy would or would be likely to
endanger her life or her health, but that did not mean that it would so
conclude. Since she would have been eight to ten weeks pregnant when her case
might have come before the therapeutic abortion com­mittee at the end of
August, 1973, and since the decision might not have been made promptly or might
have been adverse, the question of likely danger to health if not also to life
would not be an idle one.

In charging the jury, the trial judge told them that they were
entitled to consider two defences, namely, that of necessity, preserved as a
common

[Page 640]

law defence under s. 7(3) of the Criminal Code and a defence
open under s. 45 of the Criminal Code which reads as follows:

45. Every one is protected from criminal responsiblity for
performing a surgical operation upon any person for the benefit of that person
if

(a) the operation is performed with reasonable care and
skill, and

(b) it is reasonable to perform the operation, having regard
to the state of health of the person at the time the operation is performed and
to all the circum­stances of the case.

The acquittal of the accused by the jury may have been based on
both defences or on one or other of them but, of course, this was not a matter
within the knowledge of the trial Judge or of the appellate Court.

In determining whether the two defences are open on a charge
under s. 251 and, if open, whether there was any evidence upon which they, or
either of them, should have been left to the jury, it is, of course, proper to
consider that under s. 251 itself there is a procedure through which an abor­tion
may lawfully be procured and performed. The Quebec Court of Appeal was of the
opinion that s. 45 could not be invoked in defence of a charge under s. 251,
the majority of the Court holding that it was not open having regard to s.
251(4), and two members of the Court indicating that in this case it did not
differ in any material way from the defence of necessity. There was, however,
agreement by the members of that Court that in this case the defence of
necessity was open. They went on to say that this defence demanded that there
be evidence to make it as probable as not that it was necessary to perform the
abortion because of the probable danger in the circum­stances to the physical
or mental health of the woman from the continuation of her pregnancy and,
further, that it was, in the light of all the circumstances, impossible to
fulfil the conditions for a lawful abortion under s. 251(4) at the time and in
the circumstances under which the necessity for performing it was determined.

[Page 641]

I read the reasons of the Quebec Court of Appeal as finding no
reversible error in the way the trial Judge charged the jury on the defence of
necessity. However, it appears to me that the Quebec Court of Appeal was also
of the opinion (although here the matter was not made as clear as it might have
been) that there was either no evidence to go to the jury on the defence of
necessity or that the jury's verdict on the evidence which was left to them was
unreasonable or unsup­portable on the evidence. The Quebec Court of Appeal
thereupon set aside the verdict of acquittal and entered a conviction on the
very charge of which the accused had been acquitted.

Formally, the powers of a provincial appellate Court under s.
613(4)(b) of the Criminal Code are broad enough to authorize it to do
what it did. However, 1 have been unable to find any reported Canadian case
where an appellate Court, in setting aside a jury's verdict of acquittal, has
entered a conviction on the very offence charged and of which the accused has
been acquitted by a jury, and has not been content to order a new trial with
accompanying directions. Counsel for the respec­tive parties were unable to
produce any such case, and I am not particularly suprised that they could not.
Where a case is left to the jury on evidence that may be found to support a
defence to the offence charged, and the accused is acquitted, the fact that the
trial Judge may have erred in charg­ing the jury on the law would ordinarily
result in a direction for a new trial. If it be the case at the trial that
there is, in the opinion of the trial Judge, no evidence to go to the jury to
support a required defence the trial Judge would so charge, but would leave it
to the jury to bring in a verdict of guilty. Correlatively, if the trial Judge
is of the opinion that there is no evidence to go to the jury in support of the
charge, it would be for the jury to bring in a directed verdict of acquittal.
It must be an unusual case, indeed, in which an appellate Court, which has not
seen the witnesses, has not observed their demeanour and has not heard their
evidence adduced before a jury, should essay to pass on its sufficiency, either
as to a defence or in support of a charge, and thereupon to substitute its
opinion for that of the jury and to enter a conviction

[Page 642]

(rather than ordering a new trial) where the jury has acquitted.
Where the jury has convicted, appellate Courts have, from time to time, sub­stituted
their opinion that an acquittal should be directed, and this has been done even
by this Court: see Savard and Lizotte v. The King[9].

I shall return to this point after examining whether the defences
set up by the accused, and accepted by the trial Judge as open on a charge
under s. 251, were indeed open and, if so, whether as to both or either of them
there was any evidence upon which the jury could find that the defences or
either of them were made out.

I deal first with s. 45, which has been part of the Criminal
Code since the Code was first enacted in 1892. Two questions arise in
respect of the relation of s. 45 to s. 251. First, there is the question
whether s. 45 (which was enacted as s. 57 in 1892) could be invoked as a
defence to a charge under s. 251 as it stood before the amendment thereto in
1969 (it was then s. 237) which introduced what is now s. 251(4). If the answer
is ""no"", a second question does not arise. If the answer is
""yes"", the second question is whether the defence open under s. 45
was impliedly removed by reason of the enactment of what is now s. 251(4).

Section 45 appears in Part I of the Criminal Code, entitled
""General"", thus indicating its applicability, according to the
circumstances, to all provisions of the Criminal Code. It had no
counterpart in English legislation when introduced into the Criminal Code in
1892 as s. 57; on the other hand, the anti-abortion provisions, s. 272 of the
1892 Code, clearly came from the English Offences against the Person Act, 1861
(U.K.), c. 20, s. 58. As it stood in 1892, s. 272 made it an offence
""unlawfully"" to administer to a woman any drug or other noxious thing
or to use any instrument or other like means on her with intent

[Page 643]

to procure her miscarriage. Section 273 was a companion provision
respecting a woman's pro­curement of her own miscarriage. The word
""unlawfully"" disappeared in the Criminal Code revision of
1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, and the anti-abortion provisions, then s. 237, were as
follows:

237. (1) Every one who, with intent to procure the
miscarriage of a female person, whether or not she is pregnant, uses any means
for the purpose of carrying out his intention is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.

(2) Every female person who, being pregnant, with intent to
procure her own miscarriage, uses any means or permits any means to be used for
the purpose of carrying out her intention is guilty of an indictable offence
and is liable to imprisonment for two years.

The origin of s. 45 is to be found in Sir James Fitzjames
Stephen's English Draft Code of 1878 which in turn built upon the Indian
Penal Code of 1860. Section 67 of Stephen's Draft Code under the heading
""Surgical Operations"" was as follows:

Every one is protected from criminal responsibility for
performing with reasonable care and skill any surgical operation upon any
person for his benefit: provided that performing the operation was reasonable,
having regard to the patient's state at the time and to all the circumstances
of the case.

Stephen's Digest of the Criminal Law (5th ed. 1894) at p.
164 shows that s. 67 was deemed by him to apply both to consensual and
non-consensu­al surgery. Certainly, there is no limitation in s. 45 or anywhere
else in the Criminal Code to suggest that s. 45 is confined to
situations where an uncon­scious or disabled person is the subject of the
surgical operation and is unable to give a consent. It appears to me,
therefore, that before the enactment in 1969 of what is now s. 251(4), s. 45
was available as a defence to a charge of procuring a miscarriage laid against
a physician who with the consent of his patient performed an operation to abort
her.

[Page 644]

I appreciate that s. 45 is not limited to physi­cians or surgeons
but it is obvious that, where consensual surgery is involved, except in the
rarest of cases, it would be a qualified physician or surgeon who would be
likely to meet the condition fixed by s. 45. This view of s. 45 is not affected
by reason of the fact that the section was not express­ly annexed to the
anti-abortion provisions of the Code as they stood in 1892 and later, as is the
case with the defence expressly included in s. 221 of the Criminal Code. That
section makes it an offence to kill an unborn child in the act of birth but it
also excludes in subs. 2 liability of a person who, in good faith, to preserve
the life of the mother, causes the death of the child.

The trial Judge dealt with this matter in his reasons for
allowing the defence of s. 45 to be set up in this case, and he rejected the
submission that because s. 221 had a built-in defence the same should be
expected in the anti-abortion provisions of the Code. I agree with him that logical
consist­ency is not an invariable canon of construction, although I cannot
myself see the logic of the argument made in relation to s. 221 as a required
measure of the provisions respecting abortion. Sec­tion 45, as the trial Judge
noted, is limited to surgical operations and this is not a limitation found in
s. 221(2). Like s. 45, s. 221(2) had its origin in Stephen's Draft Code of 1878
as a pro­viso to its s. 212, dealing with the offence of killing a child at
birth. Although the draconian effect of the English abortion legislation of
1861 could be explained on medical grounds, namely, that the operation was then
regarded as highly dangerous so that ""it would be ridiculous to call it
therapy"" (see Glanville Williams, The Sanctity of Life and the Criminal
Law (1957), at p. 160), Stephen appears to have thought it proper to
distinguish the defence open to surgeons (who would generally be those seeking
to invoke a s. 45 defence) and the particular defence open to others as well as
sur­geons, for example, midwives, in respect of the killing of children at
birth. This defence was lim­ited expressly to the preservation of the life of
the mother. By the time the Criminal Code of 1892

[Page 645]

was enacted, both antiseptic surgical procedures and delivery of
children by Caesarean section had been discovered but the Code adopted the
general defence for surgical operations and the specific defence in respect of
the killing of a child at birth, that is a viable child.

In the present case we are concerned with an abortion performed
well before the viability of the unborn child, taking viability to arise not
before the end of the twentieth week of pregnancy. It is a matter of evidence
here that abortion procedures are now medically and surgically safe and it would
be, in my opinion, incongruous indeed if the progress of surgery should be
regarded as having the effect of excluding a defence which would have been open
at the time that s. 45 was first enacted (as s. 57) in 1892.

It is urged, however, that because s. 45 as a defence to abortion
does not appear to have been used before now it cannot be regarded as having
been available at the time it was introduced into the Criminal Code or
to have become available thereafter. The answer may lie in two directions;
first, reluctance to prosecute surgeons and, second, the influence of English
precedent since there was no s. 45 or equivalent provision in English law.
Indeed, not until the Infant Life Preservation Act, 1929, was there any
provision in English law simi­lar to that found in s. 221(2) of the Criminal
Code.

There is some incongruity in the fact that although English law
lacked a s. 45, a result with a wider effect was reached by judicial decision
in R. v. Bourne[10].
There, a surgeon invited an indictment for performing an abortion upon a
fourteen year old girl who had been raped and who was described, in physical
terms, as normal and healthy. The surgeon and other medical witnesses

[Page 646]

were of opinion that the continuation of the preg­nancy
constituted a substantial danger to health. The Crown conceded that it would be
a good defence if there was a danger to life, but not otherwise, and contended
that there was a funda­mental difference between saving life and preserv­ing
health. The trial Judge, Macnaghten J. agreed with the defence position and
charged the jury accordingly. He told them, in part (at p. 694 of the K.B.
report) that if a doctor is of opinion on reasonable grounds and with adequate
knowledge that the probable consequence of the continuation of the pregnancy
will be to make the woman a physical or mental wreck, the jury were quite
entitled to take the view that the doctor who, under those circumstances and in
that honest belief operates, is operating for the purpose of preserving the
life of the mother. The jury acquit­ted on the basis of the charge in which
they were also warned that there was no justification for abortion on demand
and, on the other hand, nei­ther was it the law that an abortion was
unjustified under any circumstances.

Writers have viewed the Bourne case as resting on the
defence of necessity, notwithstanding that the charge of the trial Judge
invoked the word ""unlawfully"" in the English abortion legislation as
an indication that not all abortions are unlawful, and notwithstanding that he
took a wider view of the defence in the Infant Life Preservation Act, 1929,
than its words expressed in holding that defence to be applicable to abortions
as a reflec­tion of the common law: See Glanville Williams, The Sanctity of
Life and the Criminal Law (1957), at p. 162; Smith and Hogan, Criminal
Law (3rd ed. 1973), at p. 158.

Whether or not the Bourne case be regarded as having taken
an exceptional view of the law (see D. Seaborne Davies, Law of Abortion and
.Neces­sity (1938), 2 Mod. L. Rev. 126), it was accepted in later cases by
the application of its principle, as in R. v. Bergmann and Ferguson, an
unreported case in 1948 in which Morris J. charged the jury in similar terms of
honest belief (see the passage in

[Page 647]

Glanville Williams, op. cit., at p. 178 and in R. v.
Newton and Stungo[11]).
There the jury was charged that the use of instruments to procure a miscar­riage
was unlawful unless the use is made in good faith for the purpose of preserving
the life or health of the woman, not only her physical health but her mental
health as well. One of the accused doctors was convicted of manslaughter and
the other was acquitted on a charge of being an acces­sory before the fact to
using an instrument to procure a miscarriage. Stephen's Digest of the
Criminal Law (9th ed. 1950) at p. 232, cites the Bourne case in
support of a proviso to the offence of procuring an abortion, the proviso being
that no offence is committed if the person performing the • abortion being a
person of competent medical skill, does so for the purpose of preserving the
woman from reasonably apprehended danger then or thereafter to her life if her
pregnancy continues.

In referring to the wider effect of a defence to abortion given
by the Bourne doctrine than by s. 45, I have in mind a subjective aspect
of the test that the Bourne case sets up, namely, that honest belief,
good faith of the surgeon is the issue, relative to the preservation of the
life or health of the mother (an issue, moreover on which the burden is on the
prosecution) whereas s. 45 appears to me to raise only an objective question
for the jury. The only reported Canadian case of which I am aware which,
without any reference to s. 45, has any affinity to the Bourne case is
the early case of Re McCready[12],
where Lamont J. of the Saskatchewan Supreme Court was considering extradition
proceedings in respect of an abortion performed in the United States and, after
referring to the abortion provisions of the Criminal Code, he said this
(at p. 485):

From the evidence before me I cannot say that the operation
which was performed and which resulted in the miscarriage might not have been
necessary to preserve her life, in which case it is not unlawful. Every

[Page 648]

miscarriage brought about by a physician is not unlawful.

I am bound to observe that Lamont J. relied on the presence of
the word ""unlawfully"" in the abortion provisions of the Code, a word
which, as already noted, was removed in the Criminal Code revision
effected by 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51. The removal of the word, under modern
drafting styles, was simply the removal of a redundancy which reflected an
older style of drafting. In my opinion, it was not the controlling element in
the approach taken in Bourne.

The word ""unlawfully"" remains as part of the English abortion
law under the Abortion Act of 1967, which incorporates the
offence as it was defined in the Offences against the Person Act, 1861,
and then goes on to provide for medical termination of abortions, without
culpability, under conditions similar to but wider than those permitted by s.
251(4). I reproduce ss. 1 and 5(2) of the English Act which read as follows:

1. (1) Subject to the provisions of this section, a person
shall not be guilty of an offence under the law relating to abortion when a
pregnancy is terminated by a registered medical practitioner if two registered
medi­cal practitioners are of the opinion, formed in good faith

(a) that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk
to the life of the pregnant woman, or of injury to the physical or mental
health of the pregnant woman or any existing children of her family, greater
than if the pregnancy were terminated; or 

(b) that there is a substantial risk that if the child were
born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be
seriously handicapped.

(2) In determining whether the continuance of a pregnancy
would involve such risk of injury to health as is mentioned in paragraph (a) of
subsection (1) of this section, account may be taken of the pregnant woman's
actual or reasonably foreseeable environment.

(3) Except as provided by subsection (4) of this section,
any treatment for the termination of pregnancy must be carried out in a
hospital vested in the Minister of Health or the Secretary of State under the
National Health Service Acts, or in a place for the time being approved for the
purposes of this section by the said Minister or the Secretary of State.

[Page 649]

(4) Subsection (3) of this section, and so much of
subsection (1) as relates to the opinion of two registered medical
practitioners, shall not apply to the termination of a pregnancy by a
registered medical practitioner in a case where he is of the opinion, formed in
good faith, that the termination is immediately necessary to save the life or
to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the
pregnant woman.

5....

(2) For the purposes of the law relating to abortion,
anything done with intent to procure the miscarriage of a woman is unlawfully
done unless authorized by section 1 of this Act.

Under these provisions, it is not only true that s. 1(1)(a)
provides a wider protection than the Bourne case, but it appears to me
that s. 1(4) provides wider exculpation than would be provided by s. 45 if
there was such a provision in England. It is not surprising therefore that
Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law (3rd ed. 1973) should say, at p. 279, that
""it seems clear that [s. 5(2)] is intended entirely to supersede the law
as laid down in Bourne"".

The course of judicial decision and of legislation in England
reinforces my opinion that s. 45 was available as a defence to a medical
practitioner who performed an abortion which would otherwise be punishable
under s. 251 as it stood before 1969. This brings me to consider whether s.
251(4), enacted in 1969, had the effect of precluding reliance on s. 45 as a
defence. It is not difficult to envisage situations which would support either
a s, 45 or a Bourne necessity defence, despite s. 251(4), as, for
example, where a doctor is called upon to perform an abortion in an area of the
country where a therapeutic abortion committee could not be assembled, or where
abortional surg­ery is performed in urgent circumstances by a competent surgeon
who may not be licensed under the relevant provincial law. I need not be con­cerned
here with whether there would be any attempt to prosecute in such cases if the
surgery was successful, because the facts here do not bring

[Page 650]

the present case within the exact suggested situations.

An urban area may nonetheless be no different from and, indeed,
more alien than a remote area to a friendless young woman, a native of another
country and a comparative stranger in Canada, who is alone, frightened by her
pregnancy and without the means or access to means to be able to invoke the
elaborate procedures of s. 251(4), and who in desperation seeks the assistance
of a quali­fied surgeon who in his honest judgment feels that immediate
abortional surgery should be performed, and carries it out to preserve the
young woman's mental health, if not also her physical health. I think it
entirely reasonable in such cir­cumstances that s. 45 should be available as a
defence to be left to the jury. It might be otherwise if s. 251(4) had in it
the kind of saving provision that is found in s. 1(4) of the English Act of
1967, but s. 251(4) contains no such leeway to excuse the requirement of the
opinion of other medical practitioners or use of an approved hospital as is pro­vided
under the English Act.

During the course of the trial, when evidence was tendered in support
of a defence under s. 45, the trial Judge, Hugessen A.C.J., found it neces­sary
to rule on the availability of s. 45 as a defence after the enactment of s.
251(4). He took the point that s, 251 (4) (and its companion provisions s. 251(5),
(6)) could have an application where s. 45 would not apply, and that is where a
drug or other noxious substance was the means employed for an abortion, rather
than a surgical operation: see R. v. Morgentaler (No. 4)[13].
Since the present case deals with a surgical operation, which is within both s.
251(4) and s. 45, nothing is added by the point taken by the learned trial
Judge, unless it be the fact that where s. 251(4) has been satisfied no offence
has been committed, whereas under s. 45 there is simply protection from
criminal responsi­bility if an accused brings himself within it under the
limited requirements of proof applicable where

[Page 651]

an accused has the carriage of an issue.

I am not only satisfied that s. 45 remains available as a defence
but also that there was evidence upon which the trial Judge could leave that
defence to the jury. In charging the jury on this defence, the trial Judge told
them that it had a wider and more detailed import than the defence of necessity
which he also put to them, (I deal with this defence later in these reasons),
and he pro­ceeded to outline the elements of a s. 45 defence and then to relate
the evidence to those elements. It is important to notice that in explaining
the elements of s. 45 to the jury the trial Judge put it to them that the
required regard ""to all the cir­cumstances of the case"" in s. 45
brought into play s. 251(4) itself as a circumstance bearing on the .resort to
s. 45: see R. v. Morgentaler (No. 5)[14].

I have already noted that a s. 45 defence, which is posited on
reasonableness in the various particu­lars mentioned therein, raises a question
which goes beyond mere honest belief or good faith of the doctor, so that it is
for the jury to determine whether it is as probable as not that the require­ments
of the section have been met. The belief and good faith of the doctor are
admissible elements referable to what the jury must determine, but they do not
themselves conclude the issue in his favour under s. 45.

The defence of necessity raises considerations which on one view,
that underlying the Bourne case, gives a wider defence than s. 45 and on
another view is much narrower in scope if, indeed, it is at all open. The
members of the Quebec Court of Appeal variously viewed s. 45 and the defence of
necessity as intertwined or as related (at least in this case), and it seems to
me also that, in failing to distinguish the objective character of s. 45 from
the subjective aspect of the Bourne doctrine, some

[Page 652]

members of that Court were led into error in postulating that to
allow a s. 45 defence in the face of s. 251(4) would be to countenance abortion
on demand, a position rejected by counsel for the appellant, and rightly so in
my opinion.

There are views on the defence of necessity which would limit it
very severely and in respect of which the Bourne case would be regarded
as an exception. Kenny's Outlines of the Criminal Law (19th ed. 1966)
states the strict view, albeit expressing doubt in view of R. v. Dudley and
Stephens[15],
whether necessity could ever be a defence to a homicide. The author says
this (at p. 73):

Probably no such defence can be accepted in any case (1)
where the evil averted was a lesser evil than the offence committed to avert
it, or (2) where the evil could have been averted by anything short of the
commission of that offence, or (3) where more harm was done than was necessary
for averting the evil. Hence it is scarcely safe to lay down any more definite
rule than that suggested by Sir James Stephen, viz. that ""it is just possible
to imagine cases in which the expediency of breaking the law is so
overwhelmingly great that people may be justified in breaking it; but these
cases cannot be defined beforehand.

See also Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law, (3rd ed. 1973), at
p. 159. Williams, Criminal Law, (2nd ed. 1961) takes a more liberal view
saying (at p. 724) that notwithstanding the doubts expressed by others,
""it will be here submitted somewhat confi­dently that the defence is
recognized in English law"". Whether its limits can be defined in any
general way is another matter. In his review of the authorities, Williams
asserts that in most of them that have recognized the defence the act was done
to preserve life. He assessed the defence of necessi­ty as follows:

Generally, the doctrine is limited to cases where the harm
sought to be avoided is an immediate and physical one. Thus necessity is no
excuse for the deliberate creation of a nuisance: the sanction of statute must
be

[Page 653]

obtained, even though the nuisance is for the public
benefit. It is only Parliament that can decide when private rights are to be
subordinated to general econom­ic well-being. Even when the defendant aims at
the avoidance of suffering, he is justified in breaking the law only in
circumstances of emergency. Thus a surgeon who supplied morphine for use in
mountaineering first-aid stations was convicted by magistrates, since the
Dangerous Drugs Act contained no exception for such supply.

However, exceptional cases may occur where the defence may
be stretched beyond this .. .

The decision in Bourne, which has already been
referred to, may also be regarded as exceptional .. .

In his charge to the jury on necessity as a defence, the trial
Judge said this (as translated in 14 C.C.C. (2d) 459, at p. 460):

I can summarize the defence of necessity for you, then, in
the following way: the law, in certain circum­stances, allows an illegal act,
because it is absolutely necessary, to become, by this very fact, legal.
However, the term necessary does not mean preferable, to be wished for, or
desirable, but, on the contrary, that it is the only solution by which to avoid
a disaster to a person's life or health which would otherwise be not only
probable but unavoidable.

The Quebec Court of Appeal was of the opinion, founding itself on
a strict view of the second element quoted from Kenny, supra, that there
was simply no evidentiary basis for a conclusion that there was any
impossibility of complying with s. 251(4) (per Casey J.A.) or that there was
any obvious and immediate necessity or a grave emer­gency (per Rinfret J.A.),
or that there was any necessity and urgency of acting (per Crete J.A.), or that
the decision of the accused to perform the abortion was taken in good faith in
accordance with the requirements of the defence of necessity, involving the
impossibility of complying with s. 251(4) (per Bélanger J.A.), or that it was
neces­sary to proceed immediately with the abortion and without having
furnished evidence that it was then impossible to meet the requirements of s.
251(4) (per Dubé J.A.).

It appears quite clearly that what the Quebec Court of Appeal saw
in the defence of necessity

[Page 654]

was urgency of such a nature as to make it impos­sible to obtain
a lawful abortion under s. 251(4). The test it would apply parallels that which
can rarely be met, if at all, where the charge against the accused is one
arising out of homicide. I am not prepared to take the same stringent view of
urgency and impossibility as did the Quebec Court of Appeal, and I would
observe, moreover, that there is a danger here in usurping the function of the
jury on that question according to the way in which it is defined. I do not
doubt, of course, that the necessity must arise out of danger to life or health
and not merely out of economic circum­stances, although the latter may have an
effect in producing the danger to life or health.

The trial Judge in charging the jury on necessity could only have
done so on the basis that there was evidence to go to the jury on which they
could make a finding that the defence was made out. Since the charge arose out
of a surgical operation and since provision existed for a lawful therapeutic
abortion under s. 251(4), the evidentiary question, in the light of the law
which was put to the jury, is whether there were more emergent circumstances
than those reflected in s. 45 upon which the jury could act, if it so chose,
despite the provision for a lawful abortion under s. 251(4). In my opinion,
there was some such evidence in the present case, evidence of the accused that
he feared that the pregnant woman would do something foolish unless she was
given immediate professional medi­cal attention to relieve her condition and
her anx­iety. The jury was entitled, if it so chose, to consider this evidence
as raising an emergency situation in the light of the fact that the woman was a
friendless stranger in this country, adrift more or less in an unfamiliar urban
locality. It was for the jury to say whether in such circumstances the harm
sought to be avoided by performing the abortion was an immediate and physical
one (to use the words of ""Williams"", above quoted) and whether there
was enough of an emergency in this respect facing the accused as to make it
certain

[Page 655]

that there could be no effective resort to the machinery of s.
251(4) to cope with the emergency.

I need hardly say that the sufficiency of evi­dence on any issue
is a matter for the jury, which alone is charged to accept what it chooses and
to weigh what it accepts in the light of the law given to it by the trial
Judge. The jury discharged this function in this case; and once it is decided,
as in my opinion is the case here, that there was evi­dence to go to the jury
on the two defences which, again in my opinion, were properly left to the jury,
the jury's verdict is not one which can be lightly interfered with, by an
appellate court.

In the result, I would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction
registered by the Quebec Court of Appeal and restore the jury's verdict of
acquittal. I refrain from any conclusion as to what would have been the
appropriate course in this case if I had been of the opinion that neither of
the two defences should have been left to the jury. It is clear, of course,
that if one only of the two defences should properly have been left to the
jury, the proper order would have been to direct a new trial.

Martland, Ritchie, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. concurred win the
judgment delivered by

PIGEON J.—The charge on which the appellant was tried on a
preferred indictment was in the following terms:

[TRANSLATION] On or about the 15th day of August, 1973, with
intent to procure the miscarriage of a female person, to wit, VERONA PARKINSON,
whether or not she was pregnant, used some means for the purpose of carrying
out his intention, to wit, the manipulation and use of an instrument, thereby
committing an indictable offence contrary to Section 251 (1) Cr. C.

The relevant provisions of s. 251 of the Criminal Code read:

251. (1) Every one who, with intent to procure the
miscarriage of a female person, whether or not she is pregnant, uses any means
for the purpose of carrying out his intention is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.

[Page 656]

(3) In this section, ""means"" includes

(a) the administration of a drug or other noxious thing,

(b) the use of an instrument, and

(c) manipulation of any kind.

(4) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to

(a) a qualified medical practitioner, other than a member of
a therapeutic abortion committee for any hospital, who in good faith uses in an
accredited or approved hospital any means for the purpose of carry­ing out his
intention to procure the miscarriage of a female person,

if, before the use of those means, the therapeutic abor­tion
committee for that accredited or approved hospital, by a majority of the
members of the committee and at a meeting of the committee at which the case of
such female person has been reviewed,

(c) has by certificate in writing stated that in its opinion
the continuation of the pregnancy of such female person would or would be
likely to endanger her life or health, and

(d) has caused a copy of such certificate to be given to the
qualified medical practitioner.

(6) For the purposes of subsections (4) and (5) and this
subsection

""therapeutic abortion committee"" for any hospital
means a committee, comprised of not less than three members each of whom is a
qualified medical practi­tioner, appointed by the board of that hospital for
the purpose of considering and determining questions relating to terminations
of pregnancy within that hospital.

The trial took place before a judge and jury. The accused did not
deny having performed the abortion with which he was charged. On the con­trary,
testifying in his own defence, he admitted having ""helped"" in the
same way a large number of pregnant women. Some of the grounds of
defence urged in a very lengthy trial were that this was a case of necessity
for the operation and that it was justified by s. 45 of the Criminal Code which
is in the following terms:

[Page 657]

45. Every one is protected from criminal responsibili­ty for
performing a surgical operation upon any person for the benefit of that person
if

(a) the operation is performed with reasonable care and
skill, and

(b) it is reasonable to perform the operation, having regard
to the state of health of the person at the time the operation is performed and
to all the circum­stances of the case.

The trial judge ruled that the accused was entitled to claim the
benefit of this provision although no effort had admittedly been made to submit
the woman's case to a hospital therapeutic abortion committee in accordance
with s. 251(4). He left to the jury to decide whether the accused had made good
his above mentioned defences to the extent of raising a reasonable doubt as to
his guilt. A verdict of acquittal was returned.

On appeal by the Crown it was unanimously held that the trial
judge had erred in law, the verdict of acquittal was set aside and a conviction
was entered with a direction to the trial judge to pass sentence.

On the appeal to this Court, it was contended:

(a) that s. 251 of the Criminal Code is unconstitutional;

(b) that it is inoperative by virtue of the Canadian Bill of
Rights;

(c) that the preferred indictment was void as constituting an
abuse of power by the provincial attorney general;

(d) that the accused was entitled to the benefit of the defences
of necessity and of s. 45;

(e) that the operation performed was not within the intendment of
s. 251;

(f) that the Court of Appeal could not substi­tute a conviction
for an acquittal in a jury trial.

Notice of the constitutional question was given and the Attorney
General of Canada intervened to support the constitutional validity of s. 251 Cr.C.
The Canadian Civil Liberties Association and The

[Page 658]

Foundation for Women in Crisis were given leave to intervene to
support the attack based on the Canadian Bill of Rights. Alliance for Life, La Fondation pour la Vie, Le Front commun pour le
Respect de la Vie, and l'Association des Médecins du Québec pour le Respect de la Vie were also permitted
to intervene in order to oppose such attack.

After hearing counsel for the
appellant and for the two intervenants supporting the attack against s. 251,
the Court unanimously decided that no case had been made out to require hearing
counsel for the Crown or the intervenants on the constitutional validity of s.
251, the effect of the Bill of Rights and the validity of the preferred
indictment. Thus, the only points raised on the appeal which remain to be
considered are the last three above enumerated.

Dealing first with the defences of
necessity and of s. 45, it must be noted that while the five judges who heard
the case in appeal were all of the view that these were not available to the
accused, their reasons for so deciding were not identical, especial­ly with
respect to s. 45.

Concerning the defence of necessity, Casey J.A. relied on Kenny's
opinion the conclusion of which is:

Probably no such defence can be accepted in any case (I)
where the evil averted was a lesser evil than the offence committed to avert
it, or (2) where the evil could have been averted by anything short of the
commission of that offence, or (3) where more harm was done than was necessary
for averting the evil. Hence it is scarcely safe to lay down any more definite
rule than that suggested by Sir James Stephen, viz. that 'it is just possible
to imagine cases in which the expediency of breaking the law is so
overwhelmingly great that people may be justified in breaking it; but these
cases cannot be defined beforehand'.

In the end, Casey J.A. concluded:

Nowhere is it shown that Respondent made any effort, as was
his duty, to find out why this woman couldn't comply with the law nor do I find
anything tending to establish that such compliance was impos­sible. Assuming on
the need issue that there was something

[Page 659]

for the jury to consider the complete absence of proof on
the other leads inescapably to the conclusion that a properly directed jury—necessarily
would have convicted.

The views expressed by the other judges were not significantly
different on this question. As I read them they were all of the view that there
was no evidence of the urgent necessity which, as the Crown conceded may, in
very exceptional circum­stances, justify a violation of the criminal law, this
being a common law defence preserved by s. 7(3) of the Criminal Code. Before
this Court, nothing was said that would tend to show that there was any
evidence of an urgent necessity for effecting the abortion in disregard of
s.251 Cr.C. In Parner­kar v. The Queen[16],
(at p. 454) Fauteux C.J., speaking for a majority, said:

If, then, the record is denuded of any evidence potential­ly
enabling a reasonable jury acting judicially to find a wrongful act or insult
of the nature and effect set forth in s. 203(3)(a) and (b), it is then, as a
matter of law, within the area exclusively reserved to the trial judge to so
decide and his duty to refrain from putting the defence of provocation to the
jury.

This reasoning is clearly applicable to every defence, seeing
that it rests on the fundamental definition of the respective roles of judge
and jury. I am therefore of the opinion that the Court of Appeal was correct in
holding that the trial judge erred in putting the defence of necessity before
the jury as there was no evidence to support it.

Concerning s. 45, three of the judges who sat on the case in
appeal were of the view that this provision was not available as a defence to a
charge under s. 251(1), while the other two, namely, Casey and Rinfret JJ.A.,
appear to hold only that it was not available in the circumstances of the.
present case. I think that the majority opinion is the correct view to be taken
of the

[Page 660]

Criminal Code as it presently stands. When by s. 18 of the
Criminal Law Amendment Act 1968-69, Parliament added subsections (4),
(5), (6) and (7) to what was then s. 237 of the Criminal Code (comprising
what is now s. 251, subs. (1), (2) and (3)), an explicit and specific
definition was made of the circumstances under which an abortion could lawfully
be performed. Essentially the requirements are that this must be done by a
qualified medical practitioner in an accredited or approved hospital under the
authority of a certifi­cate of the latter's therapeutic abortion committee
stating ""that in its opinion the continuation of the pregnancy"" of
the woman ""would or would be likely to endanger her life or health"".

It would be wholly inconsistent with those requirements to read
s. 45 as protecting from criminal responsibility any person who performs the
operation anywhere provided only that it is done with reasonable care and
skill, and it is reasonable having regard to the state of health of the woman.
Section 251 plainly requires that the necessity of the operation be determined
by a therapeutic abortion committee, independently of the partitioner
performing it and goes so far as to specify that this practitioner cannot be a
member of the committee. It is also required that this be done in an accredited
or approved hospital. All those elaborate provisions would be meaningless if
they could be ignored by virtue of s. 45.

These considerations are, in my view, so decisive that I find
unnecessary to consider the elaborate material with which we were provided
respecting the origins of s. 45 which remained practically unchanged from the
enactment of our first crimi­nal code to this day and have never, in all those
years, been claimed to authorize what was specifi­cally forbidden by what is
now s. 251.

For much the same reason I find it unnecessary to say much about R.
v. Bourne[17].
When that case was decided, the law on abortion in England was

[Page 661]

much the same as our own law before the 1968-69 amendments. In
the absence of any explicit provi­sion applicable to the sad case of a fourteen
year old girl pregnant by reason of a rape for which her assailant had been
convicted, there was good reason to consider this a case of necessity. This is
how the decision is viewed by many writers. However, our law having now
determined how such cases ought to be dealt with, the decision appears to be of
historical interest only. I would also note that the operation was performed as
an act of charity without a fee, not in the course of a lucrative business such
as appellant's was.

With respect to the submission that the opera­tion performed by
the accused did not come within the intendment of s. 251(1), it appears to me
to rest only on some dictionary definitions of miscar­riage, ignoring the wider
meaning of ""avortement"" in the French version as well as the definition
of ""means"". By specifying the use of an instrument, this clearly
covers a surgical abortion as practised by the accused. In any case, the
amendments by referring to ""terminations of pregancy"" make it
indisputable that all such operations are included in the expression
""using means for the purpose of carrying out his intention to procure the
miscar­riage of a female person"".

The last question to be considered is whether the Court of Appeal
could in the present case, where the appeal was from an acquittal by a jury,
enter a verdict of guilty. The provisions defining the powers of the Court of
Appeal in such case are those of subs. (4) of s. 613 which are as follows:

(4) Where an appeal is from an acquittal the court of appeal
may

(a) dismiss the appeal; or

(b) allow the appeal, set aside the verdict and

(i) enter a verdict of guilty with respect to the offence of
which, in its opinion, the accused should have been found guilty but for the
error in law, and pass a sentence that is warranted in Iaw, or

(ii) order a new trial.

[Page 662]

Because the order of the Court of Appeal in this case appears to
be without precedent, a review of the relevant legislative history is
desirable. Under the Criminal Code as enacted in 1892, an appeal by the
Crown against an acquittal was possible only when a question of law had been
reserved for the opinion of the Court of Appeal (1892 (Can.) c. 29, s. 743).
However, if the Court trying the case refused to reserve the question, a motion
for leave to appeal could be made to the Court of Appeal with the leave in
writing of the Attorney General. If leave was granted, a case was stated as if
the question had been reserved (s. 744). By an amendment in 1900, the leave of
the Attorney General was no longer required (1900 (Can.) c. 46). A further
amendment in 1909 provided that the application to the trial court to have the
question reserved could be made ""during or after the trial"" (1909
(Can.) c. 9). The result was that the Crown had a right of appeal from an
acquittal on any question of law by leave of the trial judge or of the Court of
Appeal.

In 1923 (1923 (Can.) c. 41, s. 9), all the sections dealing with
appeals to the Court of Appeal were replaced by what was practically a verbatim
copy of the U.K. Criminal Appeal Act of 1907 (1907 (U.K.) c. 23). The
only important differences were:

(a) A right of appeal against sentence by the Crown as well as
the accused, not by the accused only as in the English Act;

(b) Provision for a new trial when a conviction is quashed.

The essential parts of the new enactment were:

1013. (1) A person convicted on indictment may appeal to the
court of appeal against his conviction—

(a) on any ground of appeal which involves a question of law
alone; and

(b) with leave of the court of appeal, or upon the certificate
of the trial court that it is a fit case for appeal, on any ground of appeal
which involves a

[Page 663]

question of fact alone or a question of mixed law and fact;
and

(c) with leave of the court of appeal, on any other ground
which appears to the court of appeal to be sufficient ground of appeal.

(2) A person convicted on indictment, or the Attor­ney
General, or the counsel for the Crown at the trial may with leave of a judge of
the court of appeal, appeal to that court against the sentence passed by the
trial court, unless that sentence is one fixed by law... .

1014....

(3) Subject to the special provisions contained in the
following sections of this Part, when the court of appeal allows an appeal
against conviction it may—

(a) quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict
of acquittal to be entered; or

(b) direct a new trial;

and in either case may make such other order as justice
requires.

While those amendments gave to the Crown a right of appeal in
respect of the adequacy of the sentence and not merely its legality, they took
away its right of appeal from an acquittal on a question of law. There seems to
have been an oversight, they left intact the provision (1921 (Can.), c. 25, s.
18) for appeals to this Court ""by any person whose acquittal has been set
aside"".

The right of appeal by the Crown on a question of law from an
acquittal in the trial court, was reestablished in 1930 (1930 (Can.), c. 11, s.
28). This was done by replacing subs. (4) and (5) of s. 1013 (which excluded
separate judgments in appeal unless, on a question of law, the Court found it
convenient), by the following:

(4) Notwithstanding anything in this Act contained, the
Attorney General shall have the right of appeal to the court of appeal against
any judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial court in respect of an
indictable offence on any ground of appeal which involves a ques­tion of law
alone.

(5) The procedure upon such an appeal and the powers of the
court of appeal, including the power to grant a new trial, shall mutatis
mutandis and so far as

[Page 664]

the same are applicable to appeals upon a question of law
alone, be similar to the procedure prescribed and the powers given by sections
one thousand and twelve to one thousand and twenty-one of this Act, inclusive,
and the Rules of Court passed pursuant thereto, and to section five hundred and
seventy-six of this Act.

The first case in which those provisions were considered in this
Court was Belyea v. The King[18].
Being a prosecution under the Combines Investi­gation Act, it had
perforce been tried by a judge without a jury[19].
The acquittal had been set aside on appeal by the Crown and the Court of Appeal
had entered a conviction[20].
Anglin C.J.C. speaking for the Court, concluded his observations on the
construction of the new enactment as follows (at p. 297):

... It does seem rather a strong thing to hold that the
effect of the words ""mutatis mutandis"" is that clause (a) must
be made to read, on an appeal (by the Attor­ney-General) being allowed, to

(a) quash the acquittal and direct a judgment and
verdict of conviction to be entered;

yet that, apparently, was the construction put upon this
provision by the Appellate Division.

It occurred to some members of this Court that, under such
circumstances as are here present, the correct course would be to apply clause
(b) and to direct a new trial. That idea, however, would seem to involve a
lurking suspicion that we are, in fact, reversing the trial judge on a question
of fact, whereas, in reality, we do nothing of the kind, but, on the contrary,
we affirm the facts found by him, and, upon them, we reach the conclusion that
the only course open to the Appellate Division was to allow the appeal and
convict the present appellants, giving to the words ""mutatis
mutandis"" the effect given them by the Appellate Division, which we
certainly are not convinced was wrong.

In the 1955 Criminal Code, the 1923 and 1930 amendments
were reproduced practically unchanged. The right of appeal by the Crown against
acquittal and against sentence was dealt

[Page 665]

with in the same s. 584 (now 605). The mutatis mutandis
provision was replaced by subs. (4) of s. 592 (now 613) as to which
we read in Martin's Criminal Code, 1955, p. 900:

Subsec. (4) is the former s. 1013(5) and sets out what is there
incorporated by reference.

No change was made in s. 594(4) (now 615(4) which still reads:

(4) The power of a court of appeal to impose sentence may be
exercised notwithstanding that the appellant is not present.

The key provisions now read:

603. (1) A person who is convicted by a trial court in
proceedings by indictment may appeal to the court of appeal

(a) against his conviction

(i) on any ground of appeal that involves a question of law
alone,

(ii) on any ground of appeal that involves a ques­tion of
fact or a question of mixed law and fact, with leave of the court of appeal or
a judge thereof or upon the certificate of the trial judge that the case is a
proper case for appeal, or

(iii) on any ground of appeal not mentioned in subparagraph
(i) or (ii) that appears to the court of appeal to be a sufficient ground of
appeal, with leave of the court of appeal; or

(b) against the sentence passed by the trial court,
with leave of the court of appeal or a judge thereof unless that sentence is
one fixed by law.

(2) A person who

(a) is found unfit, on account of insanity, to stand his
trial may appeal to the court of appeal against that verdict, or

(b) is found not guilty on account of insanity may appeal to
the court of appeal against that special verdict.

on any ground of appeal mentioned in subparagraph (1)(a)(i),
(ii) or (iii) and subject to the conditions therein.

[Page 666]

605. (1) The Attorney General or counsel instructed by him
for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal

(a) against a judgment or verdict of acquittal of a
trial court in proceedings by indictment on any ground of appeal that involves
a question of law alone, or

(b) with leave of the court of appeal or a judge thereof,
against the sentence passed by a trial court in proceedings by indictment,
unless that sentence is one fixed by law.

613. (1) On the hearing of an appeal against a con­viction
or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit, on account of
insanity, to stand his trial, or against a special verdict of not guilty
on account of insanity, the court of appeal

(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that

(i) the verdict should be set aside on the ground
that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,

(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set
aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, or

(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;

(b) may dismiss the appeal where

(i) the court is of the opinion that the appellant, although
he was not properly convicted on a count or part of the indictment, was
properly convicted on another count or part of the indictment,

(2) Where a court of appeal allows an appeal under paragraph
(1)(a), it shall quash the conviction and

(a) direct a judgment or verdict of acquittal to be
entered, or

(b) order a new trial.

(3) Where a court of appeal dismisses an appeal under
subparagraph (1)(b)(i), it may substitute the verdict that in its
opinion should have been found and affirm the sentence passed by the trial
court or impose a sentence that is warranted in law.

(4) Where an appeal is from an acquittal the court of appeal
may

(a) dismiss the appeal; or

(b) allow the appeal, set aside the verdict and

[Page 667]

(i) enter a verdict of guilty with respect to the
offence of which, in its opinion, the accused should have been found guilty but
for the error in law, and pass a sentence that is warranted in law, or

(ii) order a new trial.

As is underscored by my underlinings, the words used in s. 605(1)
granting the right of appeal from an acquittal clearly include a judgment at
trial with or without a jury, these words being ""a judgment or verdict of
acquittal."" However, in s. 613 defining the powers of a Court of Appeal,
the word ""verdict"" only is found in subs. (4) dealing with acquittals
while, in the preceding subsections dealing with appeals from convictons [sic] or
special verdicts, only one of those words is sometimes used. It must also be
noted that in Part XVI entitled ""Indictable Offences—Trial without a
Jury"", the word ""verdict"" is never used, and in Part XVII
""Procedure by Indictment"", ""verdict"" is used only as
meaning a jury verdict.

After anxious consideration, I do not find it possible to read s.
613(4) as not authorizing the Court of Appeal in a proper case to enter a
verdict of guilty where the accused was tried by a jury. In the first line of
para. (b) the words ""allow the appeal, set aside the verdict""
necessarily apply to a jury verdict after such a trial as well as to an
acquittal by a judge. The right of appeal being from ""a judgment or
verdict of acquittal"", the single word ""verdict"" necessarily
includes a ""judg­ment"" as well as a ""verdict"". Then, the
same word ""verdict"" in the following line must have the same meaning.
If Parliament had intended otherwise, the word ""judgment"" or ""conviction""
would be used. If either of those words were found there, the provision might
be interpreted otherwise, but, faced with the word ""verdict"", I fail
to see how it can be supposed that Parliament meant only a judgment, not a
verdict.

Furthermore, the words ""enter a verdict of guil­ty""
appear specifically designed to remove any doubt that this was to be applicable
in the case of

[Page 668]

a jury trial as well as in the case of an acquittal after a trial
without a jury. Also the words "" the offence of which, in its opinion, the
accused should have been found guilty but for the error in law"" appear
specifically intended to overcome the dif­ficulty arising from the fact that a
verdict of acquittal is a general verdict, so that there are no findings on
which the Court of Appeal can rely to decide what the verdict would have
been but for the error in law. If it had been intended that the Court of Appeal
should be empowered to rely only on findings in the trial court, then the
wording ought to have been ""the offence of which the accused would have
been found guilty but for the error in law"". The insertion of the words
""in its opinion"" indicates that the Court of Appeal is empowered to
reach its own conclusion from the evidence as to what the verdict should have
been but for the error in law. This is in accordance with the following
observations of Anglin C.J.C. in Belyea (at p. 296):

The right of appeal by the Attorney-General, conferred by
s.1013(4), Cr.C., as enacted by c.11, s. 28, of the Statutes of Canada, 1930,
is, no doubt, confined to ""questions of law"". That implies, if it
means anything at all, that there can be no attack by him in the Appellate
Divisional Court on the correctness of any of the findings of fact. But we
cannot regard that provision as excluding the right of the Appellate Divisional
Court, where a conclusion of mixed law and fact, such as is the guilt or
innocence of the accused, depends, as it does here, upon the legal effect of
certain findings of fact made by the judge or the jury, as the case may be, to
enquire into the soundness of that conclusion, since we cannot regard it as
anything else but a question of law,—especially where, as here, it is a clear
result of misdirection of himself in law by the learned trial judge.

This passage was quoted and relied on by Martland J. in Ciglen
v. The Queen[21],
(at p. 819), Wild v. The Queen[22],
(at p. 117). Those are cases in which this Court upheld judgments entering
a conviction on appeal by the Crown from an acquit­tal by a judge sitting without
a jury. I have italicised the words indicating that Anglin C.J.C.

[Page 669]

was making no distinction between a jury and a non jury case. Of
course, this is dictum only with respect to a jury case and has
reference to the law as enacted in 1930.

It cannot be denied that to authorize a Court of Appeal to enter
a verdict of guilty on an appeal from an acquittal by jury verdict is a major
depar­ture from the traditional principles of English criminal law under which
where an accused has been given in charge to a jury, none but the jury can find
him guilty. It has been held in England that, even if he pleads guilty during
the trial, the judge is without jurisdiction to enter a conviction so that if
he does it and discharges the jury, his decision is a nullity and there must be
a new trial. (R. v. Heyes[23];
R. v. Hancock[24].)
If I could see any room for doubt as to the meaning of the words used in
the Code, such considerations would be of great weight but I fail to see how
they could overcome what appears to be the clear literal meaning.

It is true that, as a rule, the duty of a court of appeal is to
render the judgement that the trial court should have rendered and it is
certain that a trial judge cannot substitute a verdict of guilty for a verdict
of acquittal. However, the situation is that, under our Criminal Code in
what is clearly a fundamental departure from common law princi­ples, Parliament
has not only provided for appeals against acquittals, but has also spelled out
the powers which can be exercised on such appeals. It cannot therefore be
objected that s. 429 provides: ""Except where otherwise expressly provided
by law, every accused who is charged with an indictable offence shall be tried
by a court composed of a judge and jury."" The Code expressly provides
otherwise in s. 613(4) that the Court of Appeal may ""enter a verdict of
guilty"". It can seem strange that this should be possible where the trial

[Page 670]

judge has made an error in law and thus opened the way to an
appeal by the Crown from an acquittal, while no appeal would be possible if the
jury had been properly directed. This, however, cannot be considered as an
absurdity and therefore cannot justify a departure from the literal meaning of
the enactment.

The last objection I can find against the exercise by the Court
of Appeal of the power to enter a verdict of guilty in the instant case is the
principle that powers conferred upon the courts are to be exercised as the
justice of the case requires. It has been held in this Court that although the Court
of Appeal may order a new trial when setting aside a conviction, such order
cannot always properly be made. For instance, it should not be made in order to
have the accused tried on a basis different from that on which the first trial
was held (Savard and Lizotte v. The King)[25].
It does not appear to me that this objection can be sustained on the view
that whenever the accused was tried with a jury, justice requires that he
should never be found guilty except by a jury verdict. To so hold would be to
deprive the enactment of any application in such cases and to read it as if it
did not authorize the Court of Appeal to ""enter a verdict of guilty"".

Needless to say that this is obviously a power to be used with
great circumspection. However, it is hard to conceive of a case in which it
could be used, if not here. There cannot be any doubt concerning the commission
of the offence by the accused. He has admitted the fact and denied his guilt
only on the basis of some defences which the Court of Appeal rightly held
unavailable, one of them because it was unfounded in law, the other because
there was no evidence to support it.

For those reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 671]

Since writing the above, I have had the advan­tage of reading the
reasons written by Mr. Justice Dickson and wish to add that I agree with the
further views he has expressed on the merits of this case.

Martland, Ritchie, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. concurred in the
judgment delivered by

DICKSON J.—It seems to me to be of impor­tance, at the outset, to
indicate what the Court is called upon to decide in this appeal and, equally
important, what it has not been called upon to decide. It has not been called
upon to decide, or even to enter, the loud and continuous public debate on
abortion which has been going on in this country between, at the two extremes,
(i) those who would have abortion regarded in law as an act purely personal and
private, of concern only to the woman and her physician, in which the state has
no legitimate right to interfere, and (ii) those who speak in terms or moral
absolutes and, for religious or other reasons, regard an induced abortion and
destruction of a foetus, viable or not, as destruc­tion of a human life and
tantamount to murder. The values we must accept for the purposes of this appeal
are those expressed by Parliament which holds the view that the desire of a
woman to be relieved of her pregnancy is not, of itself, justifica­tion for
performing an abortion.

The jurisdiction of the Court is limited by s. 618(2) of the Criminal
Code, pursuant to which this appeal has been brought, to questions of law.
The legal question now before us is whether, in answer to the charge of
unlawfully procuring the miscarriage of a female person, the appellant can
raise as defences (i) s. 45 of the Criminal Code; (ii) necessity. The
trial judge held that both of these defences were available and charged the
jury to that effect. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty. The Crown
appealed to the Court of Appeal of the Province of Quebec and five judges of
that Court were unanimous in holding that neither defence should have been left
to the jury. Accordingly the Court of Appeal acted under s. 613(4) of the Code
which empowers it, where the appeal is from an acquital, to enter a verdict of
guilty with respect to the offence of which, in its opinion, the accused should
have been found guilty

[Page 672]

but for the error in law. The position, therefore, in the present
appeal is simply this: If the Court of Appeal is correct and neither of the two
defences is open to the appellant, the guilty verdict must stand; if one of the
two defences is open, the appellant in my opinion is entitled to a new trial;
if both defences are open, the jury's verdict of acquittal should be
reinstated.

Before considering possible defences it may be appropriate to
observe that since Confederation, and indeed before, the law of Canada has
regarded as criminal, interference with pregnancy, however early it may take
place; in 1969, the law was to some extent modified to exclude from criminal
sanction abortions for therapeutic reasons carried out in compliance with
prescribed conditions. It should also be noted that the appellant admits having
done the act with which he stands charged, procuring the abortion of Verona
Parkinson. His response to that charge simply is that he had two defences, a
statutory defence of s. 45 and a common law defence of necessity which the jury
was entitled to consider.

I.

Section 251 of the Criminal Code, so far as
relevant in these proceedings, reads:

251. (1) Every one who, with intent to procure the
miscarriage of a female person, whether or not she is pregnant, uses any means
for the purpose of carrying out his intention is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.

(2) Every female person who, being pregnant, with intent to
procure her own miscarriage, uses any means or permits any means to be used for
the purpose of carrying out her intention is guilty of an indictable offence
and is liable to imprisonment for two years.

(3) In this section, ""means""
includes

(a) the administration of a drug or other noxious thing,

(b) the use of an instrument, and

(c) manipulation of any kind.

(4) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to

[Page 673]

(a) a qualified medical practitioner, other than a member of
a therapeutic abortion committee for any hospital, who in good faith uses in an
accredited or approved hospital any means for the purpose of carry­ing out his
intention to procure the miscarriage of a female person, ... if, before the use
of those means, the therapeutic abortion committee for that accredited or
approved hospital, by a majority of the members of the committee and at a
meeting of the committee at which the case of such female person has been
reviewed,

(c) has by certificate in writing stated that in its opinion
the continuation of the pregnancy of such female person would or would be
likely to endanger her life or health, and

(d) has caused a copy of such certificate to be given to the
qualified medical practitioner.

(6) For the purposes of subsections (4) and (5) and this
subsection

""therapeutic abortion committee"" for any hospital
means a committee, comprised of not less than three members each of whom is a
qualified medical practi­tioner, appointed by the board of that hospital for
the purpose of considering and determining questions relating to terminations
of pregnancy within that hospital.

Subs. (1) defines the offence. The offence is com­mitted when a
person uses any means for the purpose of carrying out his intention of
procuring the miscarriage of a female person. The means adopted may include the
administration of a drug or other noxious thing, or the use of an instrument or
manipulation of any kind. The appellant openly admits using an instrument for the
purpose of procuring the miscarriage of Verona Parkinson. Subs. (2) provides
that a pregnant female person who uses any means or permits any means to be
used for the purpose of procuring her miscarriage is guilty of an indictable
offence. Subs.(4) is of the utmost importance to any medical practitioner
contemplating the use of any means to procure the miscarriage of a female
person. This subsection is intended to afford, and does afford, a complete
answer and defence to those who respect its terms. The subsection requires: (1)
That the person procuring the miscarriage be a qualified medical practitioner,

[Page 674]

(2) The medical practitioner must not be a member of a
therapeutic abortion committee for any hospital; (3) The medical practitioner
must act in good faith; (4) The means used to procure the miscarriage must be
used in a hospital accred­ited by the Canadian Council on Hospital Accredi­tation
or approved by the provincial Minister of Health; (5) The hospital must have a
therapeutic abortion committee comprised of not less than three members, each
of whom is a qualified medi­cal practitioner, appointed by the board of that
hospital for the purpose of considering and determining questions relating to
terminations of preg­nancy within that hospital; (6) The committee at a meeting
must review the case of the female person; The committee, by a majority of the
members, must have agreed to the issuance of a certificate; The certificate
must be in writing and must state that in the opinion of the committee the
continuation of the pregnancy of such female person would or would be likely to
endanger her life or health; (9) The committee must cause a copy of the
certificate to be given to the medical practitioner who intends to procure the
miscar­riage. It is only too obvious, on reading s. 251, that, first,
Parliament regards procuring abortion as a grave crime which carries with it
the same maximum penalty as non-capital murder; second, Parliament has
recognized that continuation of pregnancy may endanger the life or health of a
pregnant woman, and has, therefore, made provi­sion whereby pregnancy may be
terminated by a qualified medical practitioner in an accredited or approved
hospital; third, and for the purposes of the present case, of paramount
importance, the decision whether or not to terminate the pregnancy is not that
of the doctor who intends to perform the operation but of at least three of his
peers, specially appointed to consider and determine questions relating to
terminations of pregnancy; fourth, Parliament has not embodied in s. 251 a
section similar to s. 1(4) of the English Abortion Act which relieves
the medical practitioner of the need for independent medical opinions and a hos­pital
setting prior to terminating a pregnancy in

... a case where he is of the opinion, formed in good faith,
that the termination is immediately necessary to

[Page 675]

save the life or to prevent grave permanent injury to the
physical or mental health of the pregnant woman.

Counsel for the appellant would have us write into s. 251 a like
dispensing provision though Parlia­ment has not chosen to legislate it. Whether
one agrees with the Canadian legislation or not is quite beside the point.
Parliament has spoken unmistak­ably in clear and unambiguous language. The starting
point for proper judicial analysis of the legal position of appellant is the
statute. Justice must be done within the framework of, and according to, the
rules set out in the Criminal Code.

II.

Turning now to s. 45 of the Code. It is found under the
heading ""Protection of Persons in Authority"". Two other sections fall
under the same heading, s. 43, ""Correction of child by force"" and s.
44, ""Master of Ship maintaining discipline."" The next thing to note
is that s. 45 has been in the Criminal Code since the year 1892, but,
until the present case, no one has raised it as a defence to a charge of
procuring an abortion. This is, of course, in no way determinative of the issue
we face; if s. 45 offers a good defence, it is available to appel­lant,
although raised now for the first time. The section is expressed in broad
terms:

45. Every one is protected from criminal responsibility for
performing a surgical operation upon any person for the benefit of that person
if

(a) the operation is performed with reasonable care and
skill, and

(b) it is reasonable to perform the operation, having regard
to the state of health of the person at the time the operation is performed and
to all the circum­stances of the case.

The essential ingredients of s. 45 are that the operation be
performed with reasonable care and skill and that, having regard to the state
of health of the person at the time the operation is performed and all the
circumstances of the case, it is reasonable the operation be performed. The sec­tion
is available to ""every one"", whether doctor or not, and the operation
to which the section refers can be performed anywhere, within a hospital or

[Page 676]

not. Parliament in s. 251 has proscribed as crimi­nal conduct
surgery procuring a miscarriage, except in conformity with precise and detailed
protective measures including a qualified medical practitioner and an
accredited or approved hospi­tal, yet, if the argument on behalf of appellant
is correct, Parliament in s. 45 has protected from criminal responsibility any
person who by surgical means procures a miscarriage anywhere, provided the
operation is performed with reasonable skill and care and it is reasonable to
perform it, having regard to the state of health of the person upon whom the
operation is performed and to all the circumstances of the case. If the
argument is valid, an abortion performed by surgical means could have the
protection of s. 45 but not one performed by other means. Section 45 might
protect the person performing the operation but not protect the woman from
prosecution under s. 251(2). We must give the sections a reasonable
construction and try to make sense and not nonsense, of the words. We should
pay Parliament the respect of not assuming readily that it has enacted
legislative inconsistencies or absurdities. The better opinion in my view is
that s. 251 contains a comprehensive code on the subject of abortions, unitary
and com­plete within itself, which the general language of s. 45 does not
touch. Section 45 may be available as an answer to a charge arising out of a
surgical operation performed on an unconscious patient but it is not, in my
view, available as an answer to a charge of procuring an abortion contrary to
s. 251. Section 251 is concerned with the procurement of a miscarriage, i.e.,
the bringing forth prematurely of the foetus. It is concerned only remotely, if
at all, with surgical operations. According to our law, the appellant's only
statutory means of defence was s. 251(4) of the Criminal Code.

III

In an attempt to escape the discipline of the statute, the
appellant seeks to rely on an ill-defined and elusive concept sometimes
referred to as the

[Page 677]

defence of necessity. The defence of necessity is as rare to
Canadian jurisprudence as a s. 45 defence. Standard Canadian texts on criminal
law either ignore or make scant reference to the subject. Save in the
exceptional case of R. v. Bourne[26],
to which I will later refer, the defence has never been raised
successfully, so far as one can ascertain, in a criminal case in this country
or in England. It was unavailing in U.S. v. Holmes[27],
where, following a shipwreck, the sailors threw fourteen passengers
overboard to lighten a lifeboat that was sinking and in R. v. Dudley and
Stephens[28],
where the accused, two seamen, after eighteen days adrift in an open boat
and starving, killed a youthful com­panion and fed on his flesh four days, at
the end of which time they were rescued. It was raised in Gregson v. Gilbert[29],
where 150 slaves were pushed overboard because of water shortage. The
defence of necessity has been held to permit encroachment on private property
in the case of great and imminent danger: Mouse's case[30],
where a casket belonging to Mouse and other things were thrown overboard in
order to lighten a barge that was in danger of sinking during a storm.
Necessity has been said to justify pulling down a house to prevent the spread
of a fire, or the escape of prisoners from a burning prison and it has given
rise to endless philosophizing on the right of a person in danger of drowning
to push another from a floating plank in order to save himself. These are said
to be examples of the defence of necessity, but no clear principle can be
detected. It has been held that necessity cannot justify killing: R. v.
Dudley and Stephens, supra, or the stealing of food by a starving man,
Hale, Pleas of Crown I, 54 or the occupancy of empty housing by those in
dire need of accommodation, Southwark London Borough Council v. Williams[31].
The courts have been reluc­tant to give recognition to the doctrine of
necessity for, as Lord Denning M.R. said in the Williams case, p. 744:
""Necessity would open a door which no man could shut"" and ""The
plea would be an excuse for all sorts of wrongdoing."" and Lord Justice
Edmund Davies in the same case, p. 746,

[Page 678]

""—necessity can very easily become simply a mask for
anarchy"". The defence of necessity finds little support in the cases.
Professor Glanville Williams, who has written frequently on abortion and the
doctrine of necessity ((1952), 5 C.L.P. 128; (1953), 6 C.L.P. 216; The
Sanctity of Life and the Criminal Law (1957)) introduces the subject
""Authorities on the defence of necessity"" in his text on Criminal
Law (2nd ed. 1961) with the qualified statement, p. 724:
""Notwithstanding the doubts that have been expressed, it will here be
submitted somewhat confidently that the defence is recognized in English
law."" Compare, however, ""The Necessity Plea in English Common
Law"" by P. R. Glazebrook, 1972 A Cambridge Law Jour­nal, 87 and see
""The Defence of Necessity in Criminal Law: The Right to Choose the Lesser
Evil"" by Arnolds and Garland, (1974), 65 The Journal of Criminal Law
and Criminology, 289. On the authorities it is manifestly difficult to be
categorical and state that there is a law of necessi­ty, paramount over other
laws, relieving obedience from the letter of the law. If it does exist it can
go no further than to justify non-compliance in urgent situations of clear and
imminent peril when com­pliance with the law is demonstrably impossible. No
system of positive law can recognize any prin­ciple which would entitle a
person to violate the law because on his view the law conflicted with some
higher social value.

R. v. Bourne, supra, is sometimes quoted in support of the
contention that there is a defence of necessity: for myself, I have some
considerable reservations on the point. The facts in Bourne were
undoubtedly exceptional. On April 27, 1938, the girl, who was then under the
age of fifteen, had been raped with great violence, in consequence of which she
became pregnant. Mr. Bourne, an obstetrical surgeon of highest skill, openly,
at one

[Page 679]

of the great English hospitals, performed an abor­tion as an act
of charity, without fee or reward. He was charged with using an instrument with
intent to procure the miscarriage, contrary to the provisions of s. 58 of the Offences
Against the Person Act, (1861 (U.K.), c. 10U). The indictment did
not allege that the defendant had used the instrument ""unlawfully"";
and, before plea, counsel for Mr. Bourne objected that by reason of the
omission of that word the indictment was bad. Macnaghten J. directed that the
indictment should be amended by the addition of the word
""unlawfully"". In charging the jury, the judge referred to the Infant
Life (Preservation) Act, (1929, (U.K.), c. 34) which made it an
offence to cause a child to die before it had an existence independent of its
mother, but contained a proviso that no person should be found guilty of an
offence under the section unless it were proved that the act which caused the
death of the child was not done in good faith for the purpose only of
preserving the life of the mother. No such proviso was in fact set out in s. 58
of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, under which Mr. Bourne was
charged but Macnaghten J. concluded the word ""unlawfully"" in the
latter Act was not a meaningless word but one which imported the meaning
expressed by the proviso in the Infant Life (Preservation) Act, 1929, and,
therefore, a burden rested on the Crown to satisfy the jury beyond reasonable
doubt that the accused did not procure the miscarriage of the girl in good
faith for the purpose only of preserving her life. The jury acquitted. It might
be mentioned in passing that Macnaghten J. made this comment in the course of
his charge to the jury, p. 695:

As I said at the beginning of my summing-up, it does not
touch the case of the professional abortionist. As far as the members of the
medical profession themselves are concerned—and they alone could properly
perform such an operation—we may hope and expect that none of them would ever
lend themselves to the malpractices of professional abortionists, and in cases
of this sort, as Mr. Bourne said, no doctor would venture to operate except
after consulting some other member of the profession of high standing.

The Bourne decision may be regarded as excep­tional and in
a sense legislative. Although stated to

[Page 680]

exemplify the doctrine of necessity, the judge did not
specifically rely on necessity. At the time of Bourne the law was
unclear as to the legal position of a medical practitioner who procured an
abortion on a girl whose life or health was endangered by continued pregnancy.
The English statute did not then contain, although it now does, any provision
for therapeutic abortion akin to s. 251(4) of the Code. The trial judge,
through the word ""unlaw­fully"", imported such a concept and on the
facts of that case it is of no surprise that the jury acquit­ted. The question
of compliance with statutory law permitting therapeutic abortion did not arise.
If the proponents of the existence of the defence of necessity have to rely on
the case of Bourne—and the only support in modern jurisprudence would seem to
come from that case and one or two which followed it—to support their position,
the very uniqueness of Bourne both on facts and law may lead one
seriously to question whether a defence of necessity can really be said to
exist. I do not think the Bourne case is of great assistance to the
appel­lant. In Bourne the trial judge imported into the charge the
consideration of ""preserving the life of the mother"". That same
concept finds statutory recognition in our abortion legislation but in the
somewhat broader phraseology ""likely to endanger her life or health.""
It is, therefore, clear that a medical practitioner who wishes to procure a
miscarriage because continued pregnancy may endan­ger the life or health of his
patient may legally do so if he secures the certificate mentioned in s.
251(4)(c). The defence of necessity, whatever that vague phrase may import,
does not entitle a medi­cal practitioner, in circumstances of time and place
such as those under consideration, to procure an abortion on his own opinion of
the danger to life and health.

Assuming the theoretical possibility of such a defence in the
present case, it remains to be seen whether there is evidence to support it.
Amid the general imprecision and philosophic uncertainty discernible among the
authors as to reach and effect of a defence of necessity, the most definite

[Page 681]

assertion would seem to be that found in Kenny's Outlines of
the Criminal Law, 19th ed. (1966) where the author says, p. 73:

Probably no such defence can be accepted in any case (1)
where the evil averted was a lesser evil than the offence committed to avert
it, or (2) where the evil could have been averted by anything short of the
commission of that offence, or (3) where more harm was done than was necessary
for averting the evil. Hence it is scarcely safe to lay down any more definite
rule than that suggested by Sir James Stephen, viz. that ""it is just
possible to imagine cases in which the expediency of breaking the law is so
overwhelmingly great that people may be justified in breaking it; but these
cases cannot be defined beforehand.""

Kenny says, p. 72:

Yet though theoretical writers have been willing to accept
this ground of defence, there is no English case in which the defence has been
actually raised with success.

Turning our attention to Kenny's (2), we must ask whether the
evil averted could have been averted by anything short of the commission of the
offence. This raises the question of the urgency of the operation performed by
the appellant and whether the appellant could have complied with the law. A
defence of necessity at the very least must rest upon evidence from which a
jury could find (i) that the accused in good faith considered the situation so
emergent that failure to terminate the pregnancy immediately could endanger
life or health and (ii) that upon any reasonable view of the facts compliance
with the law was impossible.

It is the function of the jury and not that of an appellate court
to weigh the evidence in any case, but it is proper and at times indeed
essential for an appellate court to examine the record with a view to ascertaining
whether there is any evidence to support a defence. What was the
evidence as to urgency and was there any evidence from which a jury properly
instructed could have concluded that the appellant could not have complied with
the law'? There is no need to review the evidence in detail, it is essentially
as follows:

Verona Parkinson

[TRANSLATION] Counsel for the Crown:

Q. After you filled out Form P-15—will you tell the Court
what happened?

[Page 682]

A. I waited for a while. Then a man came in and called my
name. Then I went in, he said ""Sit down"", and it was the doctor.

Q. Do you mean this was inside a private office? A. Yes.

Q. Please go on.

A. Then he said, ""How far advanced is the pregnan­cy?
How long has it lasted?"" I said ""Six (6) weeks."" He asked me whether
I had ever been pregnant before, and I said no. Then I told him that I did not
have all the money, and he asked me how much I had. I told him ""Eighty
dollars ($80.00)"", and he said ""OK, I will let you pay a hundred and
fifty dollars ($150.00)."" No, excuse me, he said he would let me pay one
hundred and fifty dollars ($150.00). Then I told him I would give him a
post-dated cheque for the balance.

Later in her testimony, Miss Parkinson testified that she had
decided to have an abortion for financial reasons. She did not have a health
prob­lem but she believed she had some psychological problems as she was
anxious and could not eat nor sleep. The following questions and answers also
appear during her cross-examination:

[TRANSLATION] Q. Did you have anything in mind if you had
not found a doctor or a hospital to have an abortion?

A. Well, I would probably have borrowed some money and gone
to the United States.

Q. To do what?

A. To have an abortion.

Q. Is it not true that you had decided to have an abortion
at whatever cost? A. Yes.

The evidence in chief of the appellant concerning his interview
with Verona Parkinson before the operation was:

[TRANSLATION] A. Well, on August fifteen (15), Verona
Parkinson came to my clinic; as I normally do, I went into the waiting room, to
take the cards of people waiting there; among these cards was one for Verona
Parkinson. I called her in, that is to say into my office, where the initial
interviews

[Page 683]

are held; I should add that there is always an initial
interview with the patient. I asked her to sit down; I sat in front of my desk,
and she sat opposite. So I looked at her card, I saw that her name was entered,
that she was entered as being twenty-six (26) years old, that she had been
referred by a friend and a doctor. Can I see the card?

The card—Exhibit P-15—reads:

NAME:  Verona O. Parkinson AGE: 26

____________________________________________________

ADDRESS: 7A ST. GEORGES, St. Anne D. Belle. TEL: 457-9183

REF. BY: A friend & another Doctor           app. 11:10

DATE:   15th August '73                                app.
11:40

[TRANSLATION] Q. P-15, yes. A. Thank you.

Q. Do you recognize this card?

A. Yes, her address is entered above, her telephone number,
and then the date. So, in the initial interview, I asked her why she had come;
she told me that she was pregnant and she wished to have an abortion. She told
me she was a student, that she was studying, and that she was single. In these
cases, I always ask if she has had previous preg­nancies; she told me no; if
she had had any, it would be shown on the card. And on the other cards I
usually use, it is indicated whether a woman has had previous pregnancies, or a
previ­ous medical history. So, we talked, I asked her questions, where she was
from, and she told me that she was from Sierra Leone—I think it was the first
time that I have had a patient from Sierra Leone—and what she was doing in
Montreal, and she told me her reasons for wanting an abortion. At the time, she
seemed very worried; it was not anything new, you are always faced with these
problems of extreme anxiety in patients; and it is usually my practice to
explain to patients that the operation is not dangerous; that it only lasts
five (5) to ten (10) minutes, usually; that it is done under local anaesthesia,
that there is a mask with nitrous oxide, oxygen, to relieve anxiety, and there
would be a woman beside her to hold her hand, to reassure her..

[Page 684]

And later:

[TRANSLATION] Q. Doctor, as the result of these various
events, interview, the card, the examina­tion of Miss Parkinson, what was your
medical diagnosis and your decision?

A. My conclusion was that an abortion was for her
reasonable, necessary, and I would even say indispensable.

Q. Why?

A. Because, first, there were several things that she had
told me, that she was single, she was studying, she was a stanger [sic] here,
her boyfriend was a stu­dent, and they were not ready to get married and take
on the responsibilities of a child. So, she was in a state of psychological
distess [sic]; as she stated in Court here, she was not sleeping, she was not
eating, she was very upset and losing sleep; and, in psychosomatic terms, I am
well aware that a state of psychism like that can cause very serious physi­cal
disorders, and if I had not done it, there was always the danger that she would
give up hope, and go to a quack, that she would perform the abortion herself,
that she would commit suicide in a moment of despair. Therefore, it was
absolutely necessary, in order to protect her life and her health, for me to
peform [sic] this abortion.

Glanville Williams expresses ""grave doubt"" that a
suicide threat by a mother, and of course there was no such threat by the
mother in this case, would in itself be sufficient to legalize an induced
abortion: The Law of Abortion, supra, at p. 133. As to the time spent by
appellant with Verona Parkinson prior to the operation, the following question
and answer appear:

[TRANSLATION] Q. So then, if I tell you that the initial
interview with Verona Parkinson only lasted about two (2) minutes, would you
say that this was correct?

A. No, that surprises me greatly. It is a rare case that I
do not spend five (5), then (10) or fifteen (15), sometimes even twenty (20),
minutes with a patient. It varies from one case to another.

The appellant conceded that from 10:00 a.m. until noon on the day
in question he had completed six abortions. The evidence also disclosed
that at the time of the operation Verona Parkinson was 6 to 8 weeks' pregnant,
leaving some 4 to 6 weeks before

[Page 685]

completion of the first trimester of pregnancy, and that she had
an appointment with the Montreal General Hospital for August 28, 1973, thirteen
days after the appellant performed the abortion. The risk attendant upon
abortion would have become greater the longer Verona Parkinson waited. Perhaps
that is some evidence of urgency, but it does not go to establish
impossibility.

Upon this evidence I think it perfectly clear the Court of Appeal
did not err in concluding there was on the record little evidence of real and
urgent medical need. More important, in answer to the question: ""Was there
any legal way out?"" I think one must say that evidence from which a jury
could conclude it was impossible for appellant to comply with the law is wholly
wanting. The plain fact is that appellant made no attempt to bring himself
within the bounds of legality in deciding to perform this abortion. Appellant
failed to establish the second condition which Kenny says must be satisfied
before the defence of necessity can be accepted in any case. I would hold, therefore,
that the defence of necessity was not open to the appellant.

I have had the avantage of reading the reasons prepared by Mr.
Justice Pigeon and I agree with him as to the powers of a Court of Appeal under
s. 613(4) of the Criminal Code.

I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF
NEWFOUNDLAND ON APPEAL

Criminal law—Indictable offence—Loss of
jurisdiction—Accused on successive appearances before magistrate not put to his
election—Adjournment by magistrate for more than eight days—Loss of
jurisdiction over “the person”—Loss of jurisdiction over “the offence” or over
“the information”—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 463, 464, 465,
483, 484, 501.

An information was laid on December 7, 1973,
charging appellant and another with two counts of fraud contrary to
s. 338(1)  of the Criminal Code  and two counts of breach of trust
contrary to s. 111 of the Code. Appellant was arrested that same
day in Montreal and the
following day, at a court appearance in St. Johns, was conditionally released from custody subject inter alia to
his remaining in Newfoundland
and surrendering his passport, on the understanding that the matter would be
proceeded with on January 30th. On that date, however, the Crown requested an
adjournment until April 1, to which appellant only consented upon the Crown
undertaking that the condition governing his release be varied by permitting
him to leave Newfoundland and return to Montreal. On April 1, the Crown
requested a further adjournment until August 1, which adjournment though
strenuously opposed by appellant was granted by the Magistrate. Appellant had
not until April 1 had the information read to him and was not, even on that
date, put to his election as the Criminal Code  requires. Appellant
applied for a writ of mandamus declaring void the recognizance and ordering the
return of the cash deposit and the release of the sureties. The application was
refused and appellant’s further appeal was dismissed.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

The powers and function of a magistrate
acting under the Criminal Code  are circumscribed by the provisions of
that statute and must be found to have been thereby

[Page 598]

conferred either expressly or by necessary
implication. The careful and detailed procedural directions in the Code are
exhaustive and the powers of a magistrate or justice acting thereunder are
entirely statutory. Both s. 464 which deals with the situation where “the
justice” before whom the accused is brought is not “a magistrate” and
s. 484 provide that the justice or magistrate shall, after the information
has been read to the accused, put him to his election. The failure to put the
appellant to his election as required by the Code constituted an error
which involved loss of jurisdiction over him.

Further s. 501 which provides that a
magistrate may from time to time adjourn the trial has no application in the
case of a person charged with an indictable offence over which the magistrate
does not have absolute jurisdiction unless the accused elects to be tried before
a magistrate.

As here there was not only no trial but no
election and as there are no provisions in the Criminal Code  which
authorize a magistrate or justice to adjourn a case under such circumstances
for more than eight days without the consent of the accused, jurisdiction over
the person of the appellant was lost and the recognizance entered into by him
thereby voided.

[Page 599]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—The circumstances giving rise to this
appeal can best be described in chronological sequence as follows:

(1) On December 7, 1973, an information
was laid before Hugh O’Neill, a magistrate in the Province of Newfoundland,
charging the appellant, whose address was described as Montreal, P.Q., and
Panama, together with one Oliver Vardy of Belair Bluffs, Florida, U.S.A., with
two counts of fraud contrary to s. 338(1)  of the Criminal Code  and
two counts of breach of trust contrary to s. 111  thereof. On the same day
the informant, a police officer, arrested the appellant at his Montreal
residence under the authority of a warrant issued pursuant to the said
information.

(2) On December 8, 1973, the appellant,
having been brought to Newfoundland in the informant’s custody, appeared before
Magistrate O’Neill at which time an application was forthwith made for bail to
be fixed and after argument the appellant was remanded in custody until
December 11th.

(3) On December 11, 1973, Magistrate
O’Neill made an order fixing the conditions of the appellant’s interim release
as follows:

(i) cash bail of $25,000 with two sufficient
sureties of $25,000 each and the appellant’s own recognizance in the amount of
$50,000;

(ii) that appellant remain in the Province of Newfoundland reporting daily to the R.C.M.P., and that he surrender his
passport;

(iii) that he not communicate with any witnesses
involved in this case.

These conditions were fixed on the understanding
that the matter would be proceeded with before the Magistrate on January 30th.

(4) On January 30, 1974, the appellant
appeared before Magistrate O’Neill prepared to proceed with the case but the
Crown moved for an adjournment until April 1st. This motion was initially
opposed on behalf of the appellant and only agreed to upon the Crown
undertaking that the conditions governing his interim release be varied

[Page 600]

by permitting him to leave Newfoundland and proceed to Montreal.

(5) On April 1, 1974, the appellant appeared before another magistrate named Clement
Scott, and on this occasion for the first time the charges were read to him in
open court whereafter the Crown at once applied for a further adjournment until
August 1st.

This application was strenuously opposed on
behalf of the appellant but counsel for the Crown contended that such an
adjournment was necessary by reason of the difficulty encountered in obtaining
an order in the United States for the extradition of the co-accused Vardy
without whose presence in Newfoundland it was said that the Crown feels that it
cannot proceed with a preliminary enquiry or trial in the absence of one of the
accused.

In refusing to consent to the adjournment,
appellant’s counsel pointed out that he had already consented to a two months’
postponement of the hearing, that his client was charged on December 7, 1973,
at which time the informant swore that there were reasonable and “probable
grounds to believe him guilty” and that as no steps had been taken to proceed
with his case for almost four months, the charges should be dismissed for want
of prosecution. The adjournment was however granted until August 1st, and it is
the question raised by the appellant as to the magistrate’s jurisdiction to
grant such an adjournment which gives rise to this appeal. It is to be noted
that between December 8, 1973 when the appellant was arrested, and April 1, 1974, when he appeared before Magistrate
Clement Scott, no steps whatever appear to have been taken by the Crown to
comply with the requirements of Part XV or XVI of the Criminal Code . The
information was not read to him until April 1st and even at that time he was not
“put to his election” as the Code requires.

(6) On May 6, 1974, application having
been made on behalf of the appellant, an order was

[Page 601]

granted by the Chief Justice of Newfoundland
directing

…that John Christopher Doyle have leave to
issue a Notice of Motion of this Court directed to Magistrate Hugh O’Neill to
appear before me in person or by counsel on the 13th day of May, A.D., 1974… to
show cause why a Writ of Mandamus should not be issued declaring void the
Recognizance entered into by Applicant on December 11, 1973 and ordering that
Respondent return to Applicant the sum of $25,000 deposited by him as a
condition of his Judicial Interim Release and ordering that Applicant and his
sureties be fully released, discharged and exonerated with respect to said
Recognizance.

The appellant’s application for the order so
granted was based on the contention that Magistrate Scott had acted in excess
of his jurisdiction on April 1st when he granted an adjournment of the
proceedings against the appellant for a period of four months without the
appellant’s consent and indeed, in the teeth of strenuous opposition asserted
on his behalf, but when the matter came on to be heard before Furlong C.J.,
Nfl’d., he declined to grant the mandamus holding that the magistrate had an
inherent jurisdiction to grant such an adjournment. Mifflin and Noel JJ.,
composing the Supreme Court of Newfoundland on Appeal, dismissed the appeal
from Chief Justice Furlong’s judgment and declined to grant the mandamus but on
other grounds which will hereafter be considered. It is from this latter
judgment that the appellant now appeals to this Court.

It is contended on behalf of the appellant that
when an accused person “is taken before a justice” within a period of
twenty-four hours after his arrest as required by s. 454(1)  of the Criminal
Code , the only power vested in such justice or magistrate to adjourn the
proceedings without the consent of the accused, is that found in s. 465(1) 
which provides that:

465. (1) A
justice acting under this Part may

(b) adjourn the inquiry from
time to time and change the place of hearing, where it appears to be desirable
to do so by reason of the absence of a witness, the inability of a witness who
is ill to attend at the place where the justice usually sits, or for any other
suffi-

[Page 602]

cient reason, but no such adjournment shall
be for more than eight clear days unless the accused

(i) is not in custody and he and the
prosecutor consent to the proposed adjournment,…

In the course of his reasons for judgment, the
learned Chief Justice of Newfoundland held that this section had no
application to the circumstances because no “inquiry” had commenced when the
adjournment was granted on April 1st, and speaking of the powers of the
magistrate he said:

In the exercise of his judicial discretion
he has the power, in my opinion to grant such necessary adjournments as either
the prosecution or the defence can establish are necessary to the proper and
just determination of the charges against the accused.

Whatever inherent powers may be possessed by a
superior court judge in controlling the process of his own Court, it is my
opinion that the powers and functions of a magistrate acting under the Criminal
Code  are circumscribed by the provisions of that statute and must be found
to have been thereby conferred either expressly or by necessary implication.

I am not unaware of the fact that
Mr. Justice Kelly of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Keating[3], expressed
the opinion that the Criminal Code 

…does not restrict the inherent
jurisdiction the Court possesses to control its own process and proceedings in
any manner not contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code  or any other
statute;…

I am, however, unable to subscribe to this
opinion as I take the view that the careful and detailed procedural directions
contained in the Code are of necessity exhaustive, and as I have
indicated, I regard the powers of a magistrate or justice acting under the Criminal
Code  as entirely statutory.

I am therefore unable to subscribe to the
reasoning employed by the Chief Justice of Newfoundland, the effect of which
would, as I understand it, be to ascribe to “a justice” a discretion to grant
an

[Page 603]

adjournment in this case which would only result
in a delay of approximately eight months after arrest without the appellant
being given an opportunity to elect the forum for his trial.

On appeal the two judges who participated both
agreed with the Chief Justice that s. 465(1)  of the Criminal Code  did
not apply to the circumstances, but they reached this conclusion on the
assumption that the offences here charged were not within Part XV of the Code
but were governed by Part XVI and although no trial of any kind had
commenced, they took the view that the power of the magistrate to grant the
adjournment was to be found in s. 501  which provides:

501. A judge
or magistrate acting under this Part may from time to time adjourn a trial
until it is finally terminated.

In order to deal with this contention it appears
to me to be necessary to consider the relevant provisions of Part XV and Part
XVI. I have already referred to s. 454 which occurs in Part XIV of the Code
and which requires the arresting officer to cause a person arrested to be
taken before a justice within a period of twenty-four hours, and it appears to
me that the next provision to be found in the Code as to the disposition
of such an arrested person is to be found in s. 463 which occurs in Part
XV of the Code and which reads:

463. Where
an accused who is charged with an indictable offence is before a justice, the
justice shall, in accordance with this Part, inquire into that charge
and any other charge against that person. [The italics are my own].

It will be noted that such an inquiry is
mandatory under the terms of that section and in my view the
section applies to any accused “taken before a magistrate” “who is charged
with an indictable offence”.

In the present case, Magistrate O’Neill
presumably inquired into the charges to the extent of satisfying himself that
he had jurisdiction to grant bail (s. 457  of the Criminal Code ) and fix
the terms of the appellant’s interim release, but there is no suggestion that
he or any other magistrate made any further inquiry, at least until the charges
were first read to the appellant on April 1st.

[Page 604]

The succeeding sections of Part XV of the Code
are designed to provide for a situation where “the justice” before whom the
accused is brought is not “a magistrate” as defined by s. 482 of the Code
and they provide for the steps which are to be taken by way of preliminary
inquiry to determine whether there are grounds for committing the accused for
trial.

Before considering the effect of the provisions
of Parts XV and XVI, I think it desirable first to observe that where “a
justice” is referred to in the Criminal Code  it means “a justice of the
peace or a magistrate” (s. 2 ) and that the offences here charged are not ones
“over which a magistrate has absolute jurisdiction under s. 483 ”, and
neither is “an offence that is mentioned under s. 427 ”. Having said this,
I think it convenient to reproduce the relevant provisions of the two Parts of
the Code side by side:


 
  
  PART XV
  
  
  PART XVI
  
 
 
  
  464. (1) Where an accused is before a justice other than a magistrate
  as defined in Part XVI charged with an offence over which a magistrate, under
  that Part, has absolute jurisdiction, the justice shall remand the accused to
  appear before a magistrate having absolute jurisdiction over that offence in
  the territorial division in which the offence is alleged to have been
  committed.
  
  
  484. (1) Where an accused is charged in an information with an
  indictable offence other than an offence that is mentioned in
  section 427, and the offence is not one over which a magistrate has
  absolute jurisdiction under section 483, a magistrate may try the
  accused if the accused elects to be tried by a magistrate.
  
 
 
  
  (2) Where an
  accused is before a justice other than a magistrate as defined in Part XVI
  charged with an offence other than an offence that is mentioned in
  section 427, and the offence is not one over which a magistrate has
  absolute jurisdiction under section 483, the justice shall, after the
  information has been read to the accused, put him to his election in the
  following words:
  
  
  (2) An accused
  to whom this section applies shall, after the information has been read
  to him, be put to his election in the following words:
  
 
 
  
  You have the
  option to elect to be tried by a magistrate without a jury; or you may elect
  to be tried by a judge without a jury; or you may elect to be tried by a
  court composed of a judge and jury. How do you elect to be tried?
  
  
  You have the
  option to elect to be tried by a magistrate without a jury; or you may elect
  to be tried by a judge without a jury; or you may elect to be tried by a
  court composed of a judge and jury. How do you elect?
  
 


 [Page 605]


 
  
  (3) Where an
  accused elects to be tried by a magistrate, the justice shall endorse on the
  information a statement that the accused has so elected and shall remand the
  accused to appear and plead to the charge before a magistrate having
  jurisdiction over that offence in the territorial division in which the
  offence is alleged to have been committed.
  
  
  (3) Where an
  accused does not elect to be tried by a magistrate, the magistrate shall hold
  a preliminary inquiry in accordance with Part XV, and if the accused is
  committed for trial or, in the case of a corporation is ordered to stand
  trial, the magistrate shall
  (a)
  endorse on the information a statement showing the nature of the election or
  that the accused did not elect, and
  (b)
  state in the warrant of committal, if any, that the accused
  (i) elected to
  be tried by a judge without a jury,
  (ii) elected
  to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury, or
  (iii) did not
  elect.
  
 
 
  
  (4) Where an
  accused does not elect to be tried by a magistrate, the justice shall hold a
  preliminary inquiry into the charge and if the accused is committed for trial
  or, where the accused is a corporation, is ordered to stand trial, the
  justice shall
  (a)
  endorse on the information a statement showing the nature of the election or
  that the accused did not elect, and
  (b)
  state in the warrant of committal, if any, that the accused
  (i) elected to
  be tried by a judge without a jury,
  (ii) elected
  to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury, or
  (iii) did not
  elect.
  
  
  (4) Where an
  accused elects to be tried by a magistrate, the magistrate shall
  (a)
  endorse on the information a record of the election and
  (b)
  call upon the accused to plead to the charge, and if the accused does not
  plead guilty the magistrate shall proceed with the trial or fix a time for
  the trial.
  
 
 
  
  465. (1) A justice acting under this Part may
  …
  (b)
  adjourn the inquiry from time to time and change the place of hearing, where
  it appears to be desirable to do so by reason of the absence of a witness,
  the inability of a witness who is ill to attend at the place where the
  justice usually sits, or for any other sufficient reason, but no such
  adjournment shall be for more than eight clear days unless the accused
  (i) is not in
  custody and he and the prosecutor consent to the proposed adjournment,…
  
  
  501. A judge or magistrate acting under this Part may from time to
  time adjourn a trial until it is finally terminated.
  
 


[Page 606]

These are the rules governing the procedure to
be followed when an accused person is first “taken before a justice”. The
material difference between the two Parts is that Part XV is necessarily
concerned with procedure preliminary to trial because it contemplates a
“justice” who has no power of trial even with the consent of the accused,
whereas Part XVI is concerned with the powers of a magistrate as therein
defined and deals both with preliminary procedure and procedure at trial when
the accused has elected trial before a magistrate, but in both cases the first
inquiry must be into the charge itself (s. 463) to determine whether or not it
is one over which a magistrate has absolute jurisdiction and ensure that it is
not one of those offences mentioned in s. 427. This first step is
essential whether the subsequent procedures are conducted before a Part XV
“justice” or a Part XVI “magistrate” and in my opinion in both cases it is a
part of the inquiry contemplated in s. 465(1) (b) which cannot be
adjourned for more than eight days without the consent of the accused.

It will be seen that under both Parts XV and
XVI, a justice or magistrate, after the information has been read to the
accused shall put him to his election. The form of election is identical
under both Parts and as I have indicated, the granting of the adjournment until
the 1st of August meant that eight months would have elapsed without these
sections of the Code being complied with.

Both judges of the Court of Appeal expressed the
view that s. 484(2) did not require the magistrate or justice to put an
accused to his election immediately after the information was read to him.
Mr. Justice Noel expressed himself as follows:

Section 484 (2) does not impose upon a
Magistrate the duty of putting an accused to his election as soon as the
information has been read to him.

484. (2) An
accused to whom this section applies shall, after the information has been
read to him, be put to his election in the following words:

[Page 607]

It is clear that the words of
section 484(2) do not require an interpretation which would prevent proceedings
being adjourned after the information has been read and before an accused is
put to his election, indeed, such an adjournment is often desirable, for
example, to allow the accused an opportunity to retain counsel to advise him as
to his election.

In my view the whole structure of the procedural
provisions of the Code which deal with the treatment of persons
immediately after they have been arrested is designed to provide a speedy
disposition of their cases. As I have said, the arresting officer is required
to bring such a person before a magistrate within twenty-four hours and the
duties with which a magistrate is thereafter seized are all phrased in
mandatory language so that I am unable to agree with the view expressed in the
Supreme Court of Newfoundland on Appeal which culminates in the present case in
authorization of a delay of eight months between the arrest and the opportunity
to elect for trial. In my view the failure of both magistrates to put the
accused to his election as required by the Code was a clear error which
of itself involved the loss of jurisdiction over the accused.

In finding that the magistrate had the necessary
jurisdiction and authority to grant the four months’ adjournment which he did,
Mr. Justice Noel, in dismissing this appeal, relied on the judgment of
Freedman J.A. (as he then was) in R. v. Heminger and Hornigold[4] where he said of s. 483 (now
501) of the Code:

We find it unrealistic to think that when the
framers of the Criminal Code  were dealing with Part XVI they provided for a
right to adjourn a trial already in progress, but required resort to an
enactment in another part of the Code for adjournment of the commencement of
the trial. In our view the language of Section 483  is sufficiently broad and
comprehensive to make it unnecessary to resort to such an awkward and
roundabout approach as counsel has suggested. The section empowers a Judge
or Magistrate to adjourn either the commencement or the continuance of a trial.

It is this reasoning which dominates the judgments
in the Court of Appeal, but I am satisfied

[Page 608]

that it has no application to the present case.
The remarks of the present Chief Justice of Manitoba in the Heminger case
are directed towards the trial of an offence over which a Part XVI magistrate
has absolute jurisdiction without the consent of the accused and when an
accused person appears before him, such a magistrate may, in accordance with
the authority vested in him under s. 501, adjourn the proceedings from
time to time. These considerations, however, have no application in the case of
a person charged with an indictable offence over which a Part XVI magistrate
does not have absolute jurisdiction unless the accused has elected to be tried
before such a magistrate.

In the present case there was not only no trial
but no election as to the forum in which the trial was to take place and in my
view there are no provisions in the Criminal Code  which authorize a
justice or a magistrate to adjourn a case under such circumstances for more
than eight days without the consent of the accused. I am accordingly of the
opinion that Magistrate Scott exceeded his power when he adjourned the case on
April 1st and that jurisdiction over the person of the accused was accordingly
lost and that the recognizance entered into by the appellant before Magistrate
O’Neill on December 11, 1973, is thereby voided.

This latter finding is sufficient to dispose of
the application giving rise to this appeal, but it was also contended before
this Court that the error to which I have referred involved not only loss of
jurisdiction “over the person” but also “over the offence”.

Somewhat different conclusions have been reached
in varying provincial courts as to the effect of such an error on the
jurisdiction of a magistrate. These differences have been occasioned in large
degree by differing factual situations, but in my opinion the principle
governing the present case is to be derived from the judgment of this Court in Trenholm
v. Attorney General of Ontario[5], where
the date to which the appellant had been remanded had passed with nothing
having been done and it was held that the informa-

[Page 609]

tion lapsed and no further process could be
taken pursuant to it. Kerwin J., speaking for himself and Chief Justice Duff
observed at p. 308, that: “…after the expiry of the remand there was no
criminal cause or charge in existence…” and Davis J., in a separate opinion
said, at p. 313: “But when a remand has expired without any further
hearing or appearance the justice becomes functus…”. In the present case
if the magistrate had granted an adjournment for eight days and then done
nothing, the situation would have been exactly within the Trenholm decision
and I cannot see that the affirmative violation of the Code by
adjournment for more than eight days which occurred here affords any
distinction in principle from the acquiescence in allowing an eight-day
adjournment to expire which is what occurred in Trenholm.

In conformity with the Trenholm decision,
the courts of Quebec appear to have treated an error such as the one here found
as going to the question of jurisdiction “over the offence”, (see R. v.
Dupras Ltd.[6], and
St. Pierre v. The Queen[7]), and
the courts of British Columbia appear to adopt the same approach, (see R. v.
Peters[8], where
Maclean J., speaking for the Court of Appeal, had occasion to say:

“When Davis J. held in the Trenholm case
that the magistrate was functus I take it to mean he was functus with
regard to any proceeding sought to be taken under the original information”.)

The judgment of Aikins J. in R. v. Light[9], contains a useful collection of the
cases on both sides of the question.

In the recent case of Kuhn and The Queen[10], the Court of Appeal of Ontario was
considering a case where counsel for the accused had consented to an
adjournment for a period of more than eight days in the absence of the accused
himself and it was held that this technical breach involved only loss of

[Page 610]

jurisdiction over the person which was regained
by the subsequent appearance of the accused before the magistrate. In this
regard Dubin J.A., speaking for the Court, noted that:

It is to be observed that the provisions of
s. 465  of the Criminal Code  do not specifically require that the
accused be present when the inquiry is to be adjourned.

Similarly, in R. v. Born[11], Dickson J.A., as he then was,
rendered judgment on behalf of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba under like
circumstances where the absence of the accused at the time of an adjournment of
his case was due to his incarceration in the penitentiary. In finding that
there was loss of jurisdiction over the person only and not over the offence,
Mr. Justice Dickson observed that if the absence of the accused were to
deprive the magistrate of jurisdiction over the offence

An accused could cause a magistrate to lose
jurisdiction by the simple expedient of failling to appear unless the
magistrate resorted to the use of a bench warrant.

The Born case is clearly not an authority
governing the present circumstances and Mr. Justice Dickson was careful to
say in the course of his reasons for judgment that:

Many of the cases dealing with loss of
jurisdiction arose when the adjournment was sine die or for a period
exceeding eight days. That is not the present case.

Much of the difficulty in this area has, I
think, been occasioned by the use of the phrase “jurisdiction over the
offence”. In my opinion the word “offence” as used in this phrase must be
construed as meaning the “information” charging the accused with the offence
and the result of an error such as occurred in the present case is, in my view,
that that information is to be treated as if it had never been laid. This in no
way affects the jurisdiction of the court in relation to the “offence” itself
so as to preclude the laying of another information in the same jurisdiction
charging the same offence. This result, I think, follows from the case of Trenholm
v. Attorney General of Ontario, supra.

[Page 611]

The matter appears to me to have been well
expressed by McKenzie J., of the Supreme Court of British Columbia in R. v.
Mack[12], where
he said, at p. 665:

With respect to this distinction between
jurisdiction ‘over the person’ as contrasted to ‘over the offence’ in my view
the only way the decisions can be reconciled is to assume that, if jurisdiction
over the person is lost, it can be regained under certain circumstances (as in Kuhn)
upon a subsequent appearance of the accused, but when jurisdiction over the
offence is lost, in the words of the Kuhn decision, ‘the information
lapses, jurisdiction is totally lost and no further process can be taken
pursuant to it’. This is to say that this information has lost its potency but
it is not to say that a fresh information cannot be proceeded upon.

In view of all the above, I would allow this
appeal and direct that a writ of mandamus should be issued declaring void the
recognizance entered into by the appellant on December 11, 1973, and order that
the sum of $25,000 deposited by the appellant as a condition of his interim
release be returned to him and that he and his sureties be fully released,
discharged and exonerated with respect to the said recognizance.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Rape—Corroboration—Whether
evidence capable of corroborating story of complainant—Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, s. 142 (now repealed).

Criminal law—Appeal—Failure to specify
grounds for dissent in formal judgment of Court of Appeal—Omission not fatal to
jurisdiction of Supreme Court of Canada to hear appeal.

The complainant, an 18-year-old Indian girl,
alleged that at about 9 p.m., upon leaving a bar at Williams Lake, she was
grabbed by four men, three of whom were the present appellants, forced into a
red Mustang car, and driven to an isolated spot, where one of the men pulled
her out of the car and threw her on the ground. Two of the accused then held
her arms and one, after having undressed her partially, had intercourse with
her without her consent while the fourth stood close by laughing. Thereafter,
she said, she escaped through the bush and, meeting two friends, reported what
had befallen her. She was “very upset” and “crying hard”. On her return a few
minutes later to Williams Lake,
she met another friend and was finally convinced to go to the police. The three
accused were arrested the following day around 1:30 a.m.

On a charge of rape, a verdict of guilty was
entered against all three appellants. An appeal was dismissed by a majority of
the British Columbia Court of Appeal and a further appeal was then brought to
this Court.

The question to be decided was whether the
trial judge erred in characterizing the following pieces of evidence as being
capable of corroborating the story of the complainant: (1) A written admission
of facts that the three accused and a fourth man were together at a dance hall
at the time of their arrest; that the accused and the fourth man admitted that
they had been together earlier in the evening; and that a red Mustang

[Page 356]

vehicle owned by one of the accused was
parked at the dance. (2) The distraught condition of the complainant after she
had made her escape. (3) The fact that seminal fluid was found in the
complainant’s vagina and underclothing. (4) The fact that human scalp hair was
found on her jeans and that it could have originated from the same source as 70
human scalp hairs on the clothing of one of the appellants. (5) The finding of
pine needles in the complainant’s underclothing.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Pigeon and Dickson JJ. dissenting): The appeal
should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: The corroborative evidence of which
s. 142  of the Criminal Code  speaks need not identify each accused
separately when the evidence to be corroborated is that a gang rape has been
committed. It is sufficient to establish that intercourse without consent has
taken place and that the group was a party to it. Nor could it be accepted that
the corroborative evidence of s. 142  must be pigeonholed in three
different slots, namely intercourse, non-consent and identity. It is the entire
picture that must be looked at, not a portion thereof. When that supporting
evidence, as in the present case, is circumstantial, it is the whole that must
be examined and not each piece individually. The corroborating evidence should
not be broken up into fragments.

The five pieces of evidence indicated by the
trial judge as capable of constituting corroborative evidence should only be
looked at together. Taken one by one, they did not tend to show that
intercourse took place without the consent of the complainant with one or the
other of the accused. Taken as a whole, however, they were capable of
establishing these three elements of the crime.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Pigeon and Dickson JJ. dissenting: In order to
be corroborative within the meaning of s. 142 of the Code, the
evidence must be on a material point in the case and, above all, it must
implicate the accused by connecting or tending to connect him with the alleged
offence. This evidence must, of course, also be independent of the acts or words
of the complainant.

There were in this case two issues: (i) was
the complainant subjected to intercourse without her consent, i.e. was
she raped?; (ii) were the accused identified with that intercourse, i.e. did
the accused commit the act alleged? Corroboration was required on each issue
and, if lacking, it was the duty of the judge to instruct the jury to that
effect.

The five pieces of evidence to which the
trial judge referred tended to support the credibility of the complai-

[Page 357]

nant and they were no doubt admissible in
evidence, but they could not be regarded as capable of being corroborative of
the complainant’s evidence, within the meaning of s. 142 of the Code. There
was simply no corroborative evidence which linked the group (comprising the
three accused and a fourth man) or any individual member of the group with the
offence. The mere presence of the four men in Williams Lake on the night of the
alleged crime could hardly serve as a nexus entwining the accused with
the act of forced intercourse, nor could ownership of a red Mustang by one of
the men. The evidence of identity must be such as to place the accused at the
scene of the crime, not at some other place in the same town.

The emotionally distraught condition of the
girl after the offence did not in any way implicate the accused and the
presence of seminal fluid did not show that the intercourse was without consent
nor did it implicate any of the accused. The human scalp hair was of such
little probative value as to be incapable of corroborative effect and the pine
needles did not strenghten or confirm the evidence of the complainant on any
issue.

Items of evidence said to implicate an
accused may be looked at collectively and within the total picture of all the
evidence but if, lacking independence, none of the items is capable of
corroborative effect, then no accumulation will serve to create that effect.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Pigeon, Dickson and Beetz JJ.: Despite the incomplete nature
of the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal, this Court had jurisdiction to
hear the appeal. Section 618(1)(a) of the Code accords an appeal
to any person convicted of an indictable offence “on any question of law on
which a judge of the court of appeal dissents”. There is no reference in
s. 618(1)(a) to s. 606, which provides that the formal
judgment “shall specify any grounds in law upon which the dissent, in whole or
in part, is based”.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie and de Grandpré JJ., dissenting: The failure to specify
the grounds for dissent in the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal was an
omission which, under s. 606 of the Code, was fatal to the
jurisdiction of this Court.

APPEAL from a majority judgment of the Court

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence, Pigeon
and Dickson JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
from a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia (Maclean
and McFarlane JJ.A., Robertson J.A. dissenting) dismissing an appeal by the
appellants from their conviction before Craig J. and a jury on a charge of
rape. The point in issue is whether the trial judge erred in characterizing
certain evidence as being capable of corroborating the story of the
complainant. There are few problems more troublesome and difficult for a trial
judge than that of deciding what evidence is in law susceptible of
corroborative effect and what evidence is not. On the authorities, however,
including two decisions of this Court, I think one must conclude that in this
case the trial judge erred.

I do not propose to deal with the evidence at
length. It reveals that the complainant, Helen Sandy, an 18-year-old native
woman, at about

[Page 359]

noon on May 5, 1973, travelled from the Sugar
Cane Reserve, where she lived, to the Town of Williams Lake, a distance of
about seven miles. She wandered around the town during the afternoon. According
to her evidence, at about 9.00 p.m., upon leaving a bar, she was seized by the
three accused, forced into a red Mustang car, and driven to an isolated spot,
where an alleged act of intercourse took place in the presence of the three
accused and a fourth man. Thereafter, she said, she escaped through the bush
and, meeting two friends, reported what had befallen her. According to one of
these friends, Diane Buckle the complainant was “very upset” and “crying hard”.

As part of the case for the Crown, an admission
of facts, signed by counsel for the appellants was entered as an exhibit:

ADMISSION

At approximately 1.30 a.m. on May 6, 1973,
the three accused and a fourth man were together at a dance at a place known as
Squaw Hall at the Exhibition Grounds at Williams Lake, in the County of
Cariboo, Province of British Columbia.

The accused and the fourth man were
questioned and admitted that they had been together at an unstated time earlier
in the evening.

The red Mustang vehicle owned by the
accused Hanson was parked at the dance but the accused were not occupying it
when they were taken in for questioning.

At the conclusion of the trial, the judge
charged the jury that the following pieces of evidence were capable of being
corroborative of the evidence of the complainant, namely:

1. The written admission of facts.

2. The distraught condition of the
complainant when seen by Diane Buckle.

3. The fact that seminal fluid was found in
the complainant’s vagina and underclothing.

4. The fact that human scalp hair was found
on her jeans and it could have originated from the same source as the seventy
human scalp hairs on the appellant Warkentin’s clothing.

5. The finding of pine needles in the
complainant’s underclothing.

Section 142  of the Criminal Code  (now
repealed) required the trial judge, in a case such as this, to

[Page 360]

instruct the jury that it is not safe to find
the accused guilty on the basis of the complainant’s evidence alone in the absence
of corroboration, although they are entitled to do so if satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that her evidence is true. The corroboration to which the
section refers is not corroboration in the loose sense of evidence which
tends merely to confirm or support the story of the complainant. Section 142 
speaks of corroboration (i) “in a material particular” by (ii) evidence that
“implicates the accused”.

One finds in two recent decisions of the House
of Lords, Director of Public Prosecutions v. Hester[2], and Director of Public
Prosecutions v. Kilbourne[3], expressions
of opinion to the effect that the word “corroboration” should be treated not as
a term of art but as an ordinary word and given its ordinary dictionary
meaning. In that sense, corroborative evidence is evidence which serves to give
weight to, confirm, or render more probable, other relevant evidence in the
case. It is clear, however, that in order to be corroborative within the
meaning of s. 142 of the Code the evidence must be on a material
point in the case and, above all, it must implicate the accused by connecting
or tending to connect him with the alleged offence. This evidence must, of
course, also be independent of the acts or words of the complainant, for a
witness cannot corroborate herself. The nature of the corroboration will vary
according to the offence charged and the particular circumstances of the case
and will frequently be circumstantial, as eye-witnesses to the commission of
sexual offences are not legion.

In many rape cases, the fact that intercourse
has taken place is admitted by the accused and the only issue is whether the
woman has consented. In those cases, the evidence said to be corroborative must
be that which tends to establish the absence of consent. In contrast, in the present
case there were two issues: (i) was the complainant subjected to intercourse
without her consent, i.e. was she raped?; (ii) are the accused
identified with that

[Page 361]

intercourse, i.e. did the accused commit
the act alleged? In my opinion, corroboration was required on each issue and,
if lacking, it was the duty of the judge to instruct the jury to that effect.

As Viscount Dilhorne stated in the Privy Council
in James v. The Queen[4], at
p. 302:

In sexual cases, in view of the possibility
of error in identification by the complainant, corroborative evidence
confirming in a material particular her evidence that the accused was the
guilty man is just as important as such evidence conforming that intercourse
took place without her consent.

I do not think there is to be found in the
record in the case at bar any evidence capable of corroborating the allegations
of the complainant that she had been raped by the accused. Apart from her
story, there was no evidence that the accused participated in the commission of
the alleged offence.

I should like now to examine each of the five
pieces of evidence which the trial judge considered to be capable of
corroborative effect. The first of these, the admission of facts which placed
the three accused and a fourth man at a dance hall at some time after the
alleged offence and at an unstated time earlier in the evening, is meaningless
and irrelevant standing independent of the complainant’s evidence. Ownership of
a red Mustang vehicle by one of the accused suffers from the same flaw. This
evidence only assumes significance by reason of what has been said by the
complainant.

In Kolnberger v. The Queen[5], there was no question but that a
rape had taken place. The appeal was concerned solely with the question of the
identity of the appellant as the assailant. The complainant described the
automobile as one she believed to be an older model Chrysler product, cream or
off-white in colour and very dirty. The complainant was shown an automobile
which she said she identified as the one in which she had been attacked. This
automobile, which belonged to the appellant, was a 1957 Chevrolet, blue body

[Page 362]

with white top, very dirty both inside and
outside. Hall J., with whom Cartwright C.J. and Spence J. concurred, held that although
not a jury case, the trial judge had to instruct himself in accordance with
s. 134 (now s. 142 ) of the Code not only as to the fact of the
rape but also on the matter of identity. Hall J. said, p. 219:

It is manifest either that he concluded
that corroboration was not necessary on the question of identity or,
alternatively, that he found he could satisfy himself beyond a reasonable doubt
that the complainant’s story (her identification of the appellant) was true
from the fact that the appellant offered no explanation or contradiction. In
either case, he was in error.

Martland J., with whom Cartwright C.J. and
Fauteux J., concurred, said, p. 219:

The only evidence in this case which
implicated the appellant was that of the complainant. Her evidence, in that
respect, was not corroborated by an evidence which implicated the appellant.

This latter passage is of particular interest
having regard to the automobile identification evidence which is common to that
case and to the present one. The Court in Kolnberger was unanimous in
allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial.

In the earlier case of Hubin v. The King[6], the offence charged was that of
carnally knowing a girl under the age of 14 years. After the offence was
committed and as the accused was leaving her, the girl made a note of the plate
number of his car. She subsequently picked out the car, recognizing it,
according to her evidence, by its plate number and by a certain cushion on the
seat. The accused admitted he owned a car with a plate number the same as that
alleged by the complainant, and that he was driving it on the day in question,
but at the city of Winnipeg, which is nearly 20 miles from Lockport, the site
of the alleged offence. The question before the Court was whether or not there
was evidence upon which corroboration of the complainant’s evidence, as
required by s. 1002  of the Criminal Code , as amended 1925 (Can.),
c.

[Page 363]

38, s. 26, could properly be found. Section
1002  read:

No person accused of an offence… shall be
convicted upon the evidence of one witness unless such witness is corroborated
in some material particular by evidence implicating the accused.

Anglin C.J., delivering the judgment of the
Court said, p. 444:

Since the decision of the Court of Criminal
Appeal in R. v. Baskerville, the requirements of the provision now found
in s. 1002  admit of no doubt. The corroboration must be by evidence
independent of the complainant; and it “must tend to show that the accused
committed the crime charged”.

The Hubin case stands for the proposition
that evidence relating solely to the identity of the accused but not
implicating him in the crime is not sufficient to qualify as capable of
corroborative effect. The following well-known passage from the judgment of
Chief Justice Anglin commences at p. 444 of the report:

Of most of the matters relied upon by the
Crown as implicating the accused, however, it cannot, in our opinion, be safely
predicated that they are in evidence independently of the testimony and conduct
of the complainant, or that, without her testimony, they “tend to show that the
accused committed the crime charged”. This defect affects everything in
connection with the alleged implication of the accused because of the admission
by him of the ownership and driving, on the morning in question, of the car
identified by the complainant as that in which she was taken to the scene of
the crime. While the verification of the details given by her no doubt adds to
the credibility of the story she tells, everything in that connection,
including the admitted facts of ownership and driving (not at or near the scene
of the offence, but in and about Winnipeg) depends, for its evidentiary value,
upon her statement that a certain license number was that carried by the car in
which she was conveyed to the scene of the crime and her subsequent
identification of a cushion found in the car bearing that number. This is not,
in a proper sense, independent evidence tending to connect the accused with the
crime. In themselves these facts and circumstances merely “relate to the
identity of the accused without connecting him with the crime”. R. v.
Baskerville, [1916] 2 K.B. 658. They implicate the accused solely by reason
of the complainant’s statement as to the number of the car and her identification
of the cushion

[Page 364]

in it. Without this additional factor they
are quite irrelevant. Nor can any multiplication of such facts amount to
corroboration. Thomas v. Jones, [1921] 1 K.B. 22. They are all
admissible only by reason of the girl’s own story connecting them with the
crime. They lack, therefore, the essential quality of independence.

In R. v. Reardon[7], the trial judge characterized to
the jury as evidence which might be considered corroborative, two items
identified by the complainant, namely, a car blanket and a $2 bill. The
Appellate Court held another view and a new trial was ordered. Reference might
also be made to R. v. O’Hara[8] in
which the trial judge found possible corroboration in evidence as to the
condition of the girl’s clothes and her appearance after the assault, in her
identification of the car, and in the finding of certain prophylactic articles
and two soiled handkerchiefs at the place where the complainant said the
offence had taken place. The British Columbia Court of Appeal held that
evidence of this nature was corroborative in the sense that it tended to affirm
the credibility of the complainant, but it was not independent evidence and
therefore not corroborative within the statutory requirement.

Cases in which the sole issue for determination
is consent or no consent of the complainant to the act of sexual intercourse
are of little help in deciding a case such as the one at bar where identity is
the sole issue. The closest case to that at present before us would seem to be R.
v. Ethier[9], a
decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal. Mr. Justice Morden delivered the
judgment of the Court. In that case, following the alleged offence, the accused
drove the complainant home. Upon her arrival there, she told her mother and
father what had occurred, giving them the name of the accused and licence
number, year and make of the accused’s car. At the trial, she swore that there
were foot marks on the ceiling of the car made by her while she was being
assaulted and that the interior handle of the left door was missing. The

[Page 365]

accused, his automobile and clothing all
answered the complainant’s description of them. The following passage will be
found at p. 334 of the judgment:

However, in the case at bar there were two
areas in which corroboration must be sought: (a) the commission of the crime
and, (b) the identity of the accused, and evidence which is capable of being
confirmatory of the complainant’s evidence in one area may not so qualify in
the other. For this reason, where the two issues are present, a trial Judge
should be careful to consider whether or not there is evidence which, taken
together, is capable of being confirmatory on both issues. If it is capable of
being confirmatory in only one area, this should be made plain to the jury.

In Ethier, as here, the trial judge did
not distinguish the two issues. He told the jury they might find corroboration
in respect of the following (p. 335):

…(1) the human blood, type A, on the
accused’s shorts; (2) hair found in the car was similar to the girl’s; (3) the
handle on the car was broken; (4) the person who assaulted her was wearing
brown pants and a checkered shirt; (5) the licence number of the car; (6) the
bruise on her left cheek; (7) the marks on the ceiling of his car; (8) her emotional
condition upon arriving at home.

On the issue of the identity of the accused,
Mr. Justice Morden said, p. 336:

I have said, many of the matters mentioned
by the learned trial Judge depended solely upon her evidence to connect the
accused with the alleged crime. I refer to her description of the accused and
of his car. The condition of the girl and of her clothing were independently
proved, but this evidence was equally consistent with the truth as with the
falsity of her story on the issue of identity: Thomas v. The Queen, 103
Can. C.C. at pp. 200-1, (1952), 4 D.L.R. at p. 312, 2 S.C.R. at
p. 354. The scientific evidence with respect to the hair found in the car
and type of the blood found upon the clothing of the girl and of the accused
failed by the same test.

Although one might well consider the evidence of
footmarks on the ceiling of the car as affording corroboration, the Court was
of opinion that none

[Page 366]

of the evidence mentioned was capable of
corroborative effect and a new trial was ordered.

It would be wrong to conclude from the foregoing
phalanx of authorities that corroborative evidence as to identity of an alleged
assailant is never available. In an early case, R. v. Steele[10], affirmed by this Court[11], corroboration of the girl’s story was
found in the evidence of a witness who saw the girl and the accused dance
together at a dancehall, leave the hall separately, then meet outside and walk
toward a public park. This witness did not see them enter the park where the
girl testified the assault took place. In that case, the evidence described as
corroborative came from the testimony of someone other than the complainant. So
also in The Queen v. Redpath[12]. The
appellant was convicted of indecent assault on a girl aged seven. The evidence
of the girl was that she was playing on a moor one afternoon when a man, whom
she identified as the appellant, pulled her to the ground and indecently
assaulted her. A Mr. Hall, who with his wife was near the edge of the
moor, saw a car (later identified as belonging to the appellant’s wife) parked
at the edge of the moor and a man, whom he identified as the appellant, walk
towards the girl and later return and drive off in the car. Immediately
afterwards Mr. Hall saw the girl come from the moor in a very distressed
condition. The appellant’s defence was that he had never been near the moor.
The trial judge directed the minds of the jury to two issues, saying that they
should look for corroboration of the indecent assault and, if they were
satisfied that the little girl was indecently assaulted by someone, they should
look for corroboration implicating this appellant. Lord Chief Justice Parker
had this to say respecting corroborative evidence implicating the appellant,
p. 321:

[Page 367]

So far as corroborative evidence
implicating this appellant is concerned, it is abundant, because Mr. Hall,
quite apart from claiming to identify the appellant, took the number of the
car, which belonged to the appellant’s wife, and that quite clearly—and it is
not disputed—was corroboration of the girl’s identification of this appellant.

See also R. v. Boucher[13], at p. 270, as exemplifying a
case in which the story of the girl’s mother and the stories of two independent
witnesses, taken together, satisfied the requirements of independent
corroborative evidence that a crime had been committed and that the accused had
committed it.

I return to the present case. The second piece
of evidence upon which the trial judge relied as corroborative, the emotionally
distraught condition of the girl after the offence, might go to corroborate
evidence of non-consent if that were an issue in the case (R. v. White,
Dubeau and McCullough[14]; R.
v. Basken and Kohl[15]; R.
v. Flannery[16]; R.
v. Boyd[17]; R.
v. Conner s and Jones[18]), but
consent or lack of consent is not at issue and I do not think it can be said
that evidence in any way implicates the accused.

Thirdly, the presence of seminal fluid no doubt
supports the complainant’s story that intercourse took place but it does not
serve any other purpose. It does not show that the intercourse was without
consent nor does it implicate any of the accused.

The fourth item, the human scalp hair, is in my
view of such little probative value as to be incapable of corroborative effect.
Corroboration must not be so meagre as to create a mere possibility that the
accused committed the crime charged: MacDonald v. The King[19]. All that the evidence amounted to
was the finding of a single Caucasian,

[Page 368]

non-Indian, hair on the slacks worn by the
complainant and the finding on Warkentin’s slacks of seventy hairs of Caucasian
origin. The expert witness called by the Crown could not say that the single
hair and the seventy hairs had come from the same source.

The fifth and final item of evidence which the
judge placed before the jury as capable of corroborative effect, the pine
needles, fails for many reasons. It does not strengthen nor confirm the
evidence of the complainant on any issue.

The five pieces of evidence to which the trial
judge referred tended to support the credibility of the complainant and they
were no doubt admissible in evidence, but they cannot, in my opinion, be
regarded as capable of being corroborative of the complainant’s evidence,
within the meaning of s. 142  of the Criminal Code . There is simply
no corroborative evidence which links the group (comprising the three accused
and a fourth man) or any individual member of the group to the offence. The
mere presence of the four men in the Town of Williams Lake on the night of the
alleged crime can hardly serve as a nexus entwining the accused with the
act of forced intercourse, nor can ownership of a red Mustang by one of the
men. The evidence of identity must be such as to place the accused at the scene
of the crime, not at some other place in the same town. I entirely agree that
items of evidence said to implicate an accused may be looked at collectively
and within the total picture of all of the evidence but if, lacking
independence, none of the items is capable of corroborative effect, then no
accumulation will serve to create that effect.

Before leaving the case, I would refer briefly
to the question of jurisdiction. In his reasons for judgment, my brother de
Grandpré properly draws attention to the failure to specify the grounds for
dissent in the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal, an omission which he
feels is fatal to jurisdiction in this Court. Section 606  of the Criminal
Code , specifies the requirement as follows:

Where an appeal is dismissed by the court
of appeal and a judge of that court expresses an opinion dissenting

[Page 369]

from the judgment of the court, the formal
judgment of the court shall specify any grounds in law upon which the dissent,
in whole or in part, is based.

Despite the incomplete nature of the formal
judgment, I consider, with due respect for those of contrary view, that this
Court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Section 618(1)(a) of the Code
accords an appeal to any person convicted of an indictable offence “on any
question of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents”. There is no
reference in s. 618(1)(a) to s. 606 , and I cannot conclude
that it is fatal to an individual’s right to appeal that the formal judgment is
irregular.

The issue as to the form of dissent necessary to
found jurisdiction was raised in Canning v. The King[20], and left open, even though there
was no clear statement of the point or points of law on which the dissent
rested in either the formal judgment nor in the notice of appeal and no written
reasons for the dissent were given. The situation is very different here, as
the points of law on which Robertson, J.A. dissented are clearly set out in his
reasons for judgment.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia and direct a new trial. This is not
a case in which s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  can
have application to sustain the jury verdict, because one cannot say that the
misdirection might not have influenced the jury in reaching the verdict.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie and de
Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

DE GRANDPRÉ J—The indictment against the three
appellants reads:

THAT at or near Williams Lake, in the
County and Province aforesaid, on or about the 5th day of May, A.D. 1973, being
then and there together, they did unlawfully assault Helen Sandy, a woman not
their wife and did have sexual intercourse with her without her consent,
thereby committing rape, contrary to the form of the statute in such case made
and provided and

[Page 370]

against the peace of our Lady the Queen,
her Crown and Dignity.

A verdict of guilty was entered against all
three. On appeal, the following order was pronounced:

THIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUGE that the
Appeal of each of the Appellants from his conviction be and the same is hereby
dismissed;

BE IT RECORDED that the Honourable
Mr. Justice Robertson dissented from the judgment of the Court as
aforesaid and would have allowed the appeal of each of the Appellants and
quashed the conviction of each of the Appelants and ordered a new trial.

Although the dissent of Robertson J.A. is
recorded, the formal judgment of the Court does not follow the prescription of
s. 606  of the Criminal Code  which enacts that the formal judgment
“shall specify any grounds in law upon which the dissent, in whole or in part,
is based”. Inasmuch as the present appeal has been entered as of right because
of the dissent (s. 618(1) (a)), it is my view that we have no
jurisdiction, the formal judgment not specifying the ground of dissent upon
which the appeal is purportedly taken. The point was mentioned in Canning v.
The King[21] but
the Court did not think it necessary to decide the question (p. 423).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, I now turn to the
question of law raised by the dissenting reasons of Roberston J.A. The relevant
part of the notice of appeal to this Court reads:

The learned trial judge erred in his
application of the principles of law relating to corroboration as disclosed by
the charge to the jury in which the learned trial judge instructed the jury
that there had been adduced the following pieces of evidence which were capable
of corroborating the evidence of the complainant:

(a) The written, admission made at trial on
behalf of all three accused in the following words:

“At approximately 1:30 a.m. on May 6, 1973,
the three accused and a fourth man were together at a dance at a place known as
Squaw Hall at the Exhibition Grounds at Williams Lake, in the County of
Cariboo, Province of British Columbia.

[Page 371]

“The accused and the fourth man were
questioned and admitted that they had been together at an unstated time earlier
in the evening.

“The red Mustang vehicle owned by the
accused Hanson was parked at the dance but the accused were not occupying it
when they were taken in for questioning.”

(b) The distraught condition of the
complainant when picked up on a roadside by friends and at the time of her
speaking to the police and the doctor.

(c) The presence of seminal fluid in the
complainant’s vagina and on her panties.

(d) The presence of a human scalp hair of
Caucasian origin on her jeans, which was similar to hair found on the clothing
of one of the accused.

(e) The presence of pine needles in the
crotch of the complainant’s underclothes…

The notice of appeal against conviction by each
of the three appellants had put three other grounds before the Court of Appeal:

2. The Learned Trial Judge misdirected the
jury on identification.

3. The Learned Trial Judge wrongly admitted
into evidence an alleged first complaint.

4. The Learned Trial Judge failed to
instruct the jury on the law with respect to aiding and abetting.

The last of these grounds was abandoned by
appellants before the hearing took place in the Court of Appeal and the two
others were rejected by all three justices. I have found it necessary to refer to
this aspect because appellants have alluded to grounds 2 and 3 in the course of
their argument. Of course, none of these three grounds is still open for this
Court.

The issue of corroboration is the only one
before us. Before turning thereto, we must have a look at complainant’s
version. Helen Sandy, an 18-year-old native Indian girl, lives a few miles from
Williams Lake. About noon, on May 5, she came to the town, did some errands
including a visit to a laundromat. She spent some time with her cousin Marlene
Chelsea, ending up in a room at the Ranch Hotel with her cousin and her
cousin’s husband. Two or three times she wandered over to the Lakeview Hotel
looking for friends of hers.

[Page 372]

She wanted to go to the dance. Eventually,
around 9 p.m., near the Ranch Bar, she was grabbed by four men, three of whom
are present appellants, who took her a short distance down the street, then
forced her up into the back seat of a red Ford Mustang car and drove to a place
called Glendale, which is a suburb of Williams Lake, approximately two miles
away. On arrival at Glendale, at an isolated spot, one of them pulled her out
of the car and threw her on the ground. Two of the accused then held her arms
and one, after having undressed her partially, had intercourse with her without
her consent while the fourth stood close by laughing. After the act on
intercourse, Hanson took her into the bush, said he was going to get some
cigarettes and told her that the others would also have intercourse with her if
she was still there when he got back. She grabbed her clothes, ran down the
road and was picked up by a car containing a friend, Diane Buckle, and George
Ross. She was very upset and crying hard. On her return to Williams Lake, a few
minutes later, she met another friend and was finally convinced to go to the
police. The three appellants were arrested around 1:30 a.m. on May 6. As
mentioned in the admission quoted in the notice of appeal, they were together
at the time, had been together earlier in the evening and the red Mustang car
was parked outside.

As to the first piece of evidence stated by the
trial judge to be capable of corroborating complainant’s version, there was, of
course, the admission; as to the other four pieces, there was testimony. The
only issue before us: do these pieces of evidence have, in the circumstances of
the case, a corroborative quality so that the trial judge was right in leaving
them to be weighed by the jury?

Apart from that particular issue, the charge
meets all the standards evolved over the years. In particular, it underlines:

[Page 373]

—corroborative evidence must be independent of
the complainant (Hubin v. The King[22]);

—there is no corroboration if the testimony is
equally consistent with the truth as with the falsity of complainant’s story (Thomas
v. The Queen[23]).

Appellants’ basic submission is that for each of
the three accused there are three issues, namely intercourse, absence of
consent and identity, and that each of the three appellants must be looked at
individually. In other words, in the case at bar, there were nine separate
issues and there would be misdirection as to corroboration because, as stated
in their factum, “in his charge to the jury, the learned trial judge did not
distinguish which pieces of evidence were capable of corroborating which
particular issue in the case but all the items were lumped together as being
generally capable of corroborating the complainant’s story”.

The general principles on the issue of
corroboration, especially in the case of a sexual offence, have been reviewed
by Ritchie J. in The Queen v. Parish[24],
who, at p. 472, adopted the following statement of McFarlane J.A., in
his dissenting judgment in the British Columbia Court of Appeal[25], at p. 376:

“I think evidence which may be
corroboration of the evidence of a female person in such a case is evidence
which may, in law, be considered by the jury as evidence of a material
particular implicating the accused in the commission of the crime alleged. A
particular is material in this sense if it may, in the opinion of the jury,
show or tend to show that the testimony of the female person that the offence
was committed and committed by the accused is true, thus being relevant to the
issue which the jury is called upon to decide. That issue in this case was simply
whether or not there was an act of sexual intercourse. To be capable of being
considered corroborative, evidence need not in itself prove the guilty act.”

As was said by Martin J.A. delivering the judg-

[Page 374]

ment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in R.
v. Boyce[26], at
p. 572:

In many cases involving sexual offences
there will be no physical evidence of the alleged offence. In cases of indecent
assault and gross indecency, commonly, the only evidence of the element of
indecency is the complainant’s evidence. The same situation may exist with
respect to proof of penetration in some cases of rape. It is, of course,
unnecessary to prove these elements independently of the complainant’s
evidence. What is sought is independent evidence which makes it probable that
the complainant’s testimony with respect to the vital issue or issues is true.

Corroboration is not a word of art. It is a
matter of common sense. In recent years, this Court has repeatedly refused to
give a narrow legalistic reading of that word and to impose upon trial judges
artificial restraints in their instructions to juries or to themselves. It will
be sufficient to refer to two cases.

In R. v. Kanester[27], the accused had been convicted of
rape after a trial in the course of which, following the testimony of
complainant, he had admitted being the person mentioned in her evidence so that
the sole issue was the consent or non-consent. The notice of appeal to the
Court of Appeal, amongst many grounds, raised misdirection in that the judge would
have erroneously instructed the jury that the finding of a piece of string in
the appellant’s car could be considered corroboration. The majority (Branca
J.A., Norris J.A. concurring) agreed with that submission because in their view
the connection of the string with the crime emanated from the complainant and,
therefore, lacked the essential quality of independence; a lengthy quote from
the judgment of this Court in Hubin supra, is to be found at p. 369
of the report. In his dissent, Maclean J.A. wrote (p. 379):

Ground No. 5: That the trial judge erred in
instructing that certain matters could be corroborative.

This complaint was not particularized in
the notice of appeal but the argument indicated that the appellant

[Page 375]

complained that the finding of string in
the appellant’s car could be considered corroboration of the complainant’s
story, as it would not be independent evidence incriminating the appellant.

It will be noted, however, that there was
evidence from the girl that he had tied her hands with string. A doctor
testified that there were marks on her wrists. There was evidence that string
was found in the car. The learned trial judge did not say that the finding of
string in the appellant’s car was corroborative of the girl’s story. He put it
this way:

“Furthermore, evidence was given of some
string which the police found in the car, and that string was put in evidence
and you will see it. The Crown does not suggest that that very string itself
was necessarily used to tie the girl’s hands but that the presence of that
string in the car and other string is corroborative of the fact that her story
could be true that the accused tied her hands up with string in the car itself.
And I agree that you are at liberty to consider that as corroborative evidence—the
string and the red mark on her wrist.”

It should be noted that there was evidence
that the car in which the string was found belonged to the appellant.

The combination of circumstances indicated
by the learned judge formed the basis for his direction that the evidence could
be considered corroborative. In my view his direction was correct.

The Crown appealed to this Court and this
particular ground was argued again. In appellant’s factum, the point was
expressed thus:

For the reasons given in the dissenting
judgment the Appellant respectfully submits that the Learned Trial Judge was
not in error in charging the Jury in connection with the corroborative effect
of string found in the car.

which respondent answered in his factum:

That the Learned Trial Judge erred in
instructing the Jury that certain evidence of string found in the Respondent’s
automobile was independent evidence tending to connect the accused with the
crime of rape and hence corroborative of the Complainant’s account.

This Court (Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott,
Ritchie and Hall JJ.—there is an error in the report, Spence J. was not a
member of that Bench)

[Page 376]

in an oral judgment, allowed the appeal and
restored the conviction:

“We find no merit in the points argued
before us on behalf of the respondent. We are in agreement with the reasons and
conclusion of Maclean J.A.”

I now turn to R. v. Thomas, an unreported
unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia pronounced on
June 22, 1970, and reversed on May 19, 1971 by this Court. Following a
conviction of attempted rape in a case where consent or non-consent was the
issue, the accused submitted two grounds to the Court of Appeal:

(1) that, when discussing corroboration, the
trial judge had not repeated the warning he had already given when discussing
circumstantial evidence and had not stated a second time that the facts could
not amount to corroboration if they were equally consistent with the truth as
with the falsity of complainant’s story on that particular point;

(2) that the five items of evidence enumerated
by the trial judge as being capable of amounting to corroboration were not so
capable.

The Court of Appeal accepted the first
submission and on that basis ordered a new trial. However, Bull J.A., on the
second ground, expressed “some grave doubts as to whether some or all of them
could be deemed capable of being corroborative, under the particular
circumstances of this case”. This potentially corroborative evidence was

(1) a missing button on complainant’s blouse;

(2) a missing clasp from her brassiere and a
separation in the material;

(3) the girl’s distraught and disheveled
condition that evening;

(4) her emotionally upset condition when seen by
the investigating constable the following day;

(5) fairly fresh scuff marks at the edge of the
road as seen by the constable the day after the assault.

[Page 377]

Leave to appeal was granted to the Crown on the
following question of law:

Whether the Court of Appeal erred in
holding that although the trial Judge charged the Jury generally on the
circumstantial evidence rule he was obliged to give the Jury a separate and
distinct instruction on the applicability of the circumstantial evidence rule
as to corroboration.

At the conclusion of the hearing, this Court composed
of Fauteux C.J. and Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ., allowed the
appeal and restored the verdict:

We are of the opinion that the learned
trial judge gave to the jury an exact and satisfactory definition of
corroboration and in the circumstances of this case, his charge was adequate
and accurate.

This treatment of corroboration as a matter of
common sense, the purpose of which is to ensure that no conviction will be
entered if there is a reasonable doubt as to the guilt, is not restricted to
Canada. It is sufficient for my purpose to refer to two recent decisions of the
House of Lords, namely Director of Public Prosecutions v. Hester[28], and Director of Public
Prosecutions v. Kilbourne[29]. From
the holding of this last case, I extract two sentences:

The word “corroboration” had no special
technical meaning; by itself it meant no more than evidence tending to confirm
other evidence. No distinction could, therefore, be drawn between evidence
which could be used as corroboration and evidence which might help the jury to
determine the truth of the matter.

Appellants have invoked the authority of the
judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in R. v. White, Dubeau and
McCullough[30], and
particularly the following sentence found in the judgment of the majority
written by Arnup J.A., where the reference was to the judge’s charge:

He did not tell them that evidence which
was equally consistent with the guilt or innocence of a particular accused
could not in law be capable of corroboration against that accused.

[Page 378]

I simply wish to mention that Martin J.A., who
concurred with Arnup J.A., in White, wrote in R. v. Boyce,
supra, at p. 575:

The effect of this passage appears to have
been misunderstood.

And then Martin J.A. explains the meaning of the
passage. I cannot do any better than to refer in his reasons to the paragraphs
immediately following the words just quoted.

When the indictment alleges, as in the case at
bar, that a gang rape has been committed, the same common sense approach must
be adopted. To insist that nine separate issues be submitted to the jury,
namely intercourse, absence of consent and identity, in relation to each of the
three accused individually, is to forget the realities of life; rape being a
crime of the shadows, the Crown would never be in a position to adduce evidence
of such a quality as to satisfy the criteria when applied separately to nine
different issues. On that basis, one can well imagine the difficulties in the
way of the Grown if the rape had been committed by six, eight or ten persons.
It is no answer to state that in the light of s. 142  a conviction could
always be entered on the basis of the complainant’s evidence; Parliament has
not enacted that corroboration would not be available in the case of gang rape.

Such a submission also fails to take into
consideration s. 21  of the Criminal Code . The common purpose that
joins the perpetrators of a gang rape renders everyone of them a party to the
offence and there is certainly no need when looking at the corroborative evidence
to relate it to each accused individually. It is sufficient to relate it to the
group. The trial judge was correct when he said:

Well, I tell you ladies and gentlemen of
the jury, that if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there are
four people there in and circumstances which she described and these men were
three of the four then it does not matter whether Hanson had intercourse with
her or Ken, as long as one man—one of these four—had intercourse with her
against her consent or with her consent if the consent was extorted by threats
or fear of bodily harm, then all are guilty of rape. The basis of

[Page 379]

that, Crown counsel alluded to that law—but
the basis of that law is found in Section 21 of our Criminal Code . Section
21(1)  says everyone is a party to an offence who (a) actually commits it, (b)
does or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it
or, (c) abets any person in committing it.

She has testified that one man had
intercourse with her while two men were holding her arms preventing her from
struggling and fighting and another stood there laughing right by her feet.

If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable
doubt that, in fact, this is so then the men holding her arms would be aiders,
they would be the ones who did something for the purpose of aiding any person
to commit it. The person standing there at her feet laughing would be what you
would call an abetter.

I am satisfied that the corroborative evidence
of which s. 142  speaks need not identify each accused separately when the
evidence to be corroborated is that a gang rape has been committed. It is
sufficient to establish that intercourse without consent has taken place and
that the group was a party to it. In the same fashion, I cannot accept the submission
that the corroborative evidence of s. 142  must be pigeonholed in three
different slots, namely intercourse, non-consent and identity. The wording of
the section goes against that interpretation. On the text of the article,
there is corroboration when the story of the complainant is “corroborated in a
material particular by evidence that implicates the accused”. It is the entire
picture that must be looked at, not a portion thereof. When that supporting
evidence, as in the case at bar, is circumstantial, it is the whole that must
be examined and not each piece individually. The corroborating evidence should
not be broken up into fragments. Appellants’ submission is really the
proposition that, in the case of sexual offences, corroboration may never be
circumstantial because each piece must be complete in itself. Here again the
trial judge should be quoted:

I say to you that these following bits of
evidence are capable of being corroborative of the girl’s story. The fact that
these men together—these four men were found together in Williams Lake within
three or four hours or so of the alleged offence; the fact that they had
admitted the four of them had been together earlier in

[Page 380]

the evening even though an unstated time;
the fact that the red motor vehicle which was owned by the accused was at the
dance; the distraught condition of the girl when seen by Diane Buckle; the fact
that fluid, seminal fluid was found in her vagina and a spot in the crotch of
her pants and that the fact that a human scalp hair was found on her jeans—I’ll
have more to say about that because counsel suggested to you it was found only
in the bag—was found on her jeans and it could have originated—not must have,
could have originated from the same source as the seventy human scalp hairs or
approximately seventy on Warkentin’s clothes. Each one of these pieces of
evidence by itself is insignificant and does not prove there has been a crime
committed or that the accused committed them but as I say, you must consider
them all together…

Again, I remind you before, when I tell you
that is being corroborative, before you find it is in fact corroborative of the
girl’s testimony—that is, that it shows or tends to show that her story that
the crime was committed namely rape and that the accused committed it, is true
you must be satisfied that those pieces of evidence to which I referred taken
as a whole are not only consistent with the truth of her story but inconsistent
with any other rational conclusion.

The last part of this last sentence may be too
favourable to the accused in that it appears to go beyond the test enunciated
by this Court in the 1952 Thomas case, supra, where Cartwright
J., as he then was, speaking for the Court, said that it was essential that it
be made plain to the jury that (p. 354):

…facts, though independently established,
could not amount to corroboration if, in the view of the jury, they were
equally consistent with the truth as with the falsity of her story on this
point.

I should add that the pine needles were
mentioned by the trial judge when the jury was recalled. No objection to the
charge was voiced in open Court by counsel acting for the accused; in Chambers,
on a previous day, he had expressed the opinion that the fact that the accused
“were arrested together in a red Mustang—perhaps that in itself may be
corroborative—may be capable of being corroborative” but that putting all
together was “just going a little bit too far”.

[Page 381]

Rape is particularly a crime for which juries
are the proper forum. It is the type of offence the examination of which turns
on an infinite number of small details related to the credibility of the
witnesses, the community in which the actors and the jurors live, the standards
of conduct in that area, etc. With that in mind, when the charge to the
jury is practically letter perfect and is only attacked because the trial judge
would have been wrong in listing the possible corroborative elements, a Court
of Appeal should be very reluctant to intervene and declare that the charge
amounts to misdirection; this is especially so for this Court, twice removed as
we are from the scene, where as in the present case, the verdict has been
upheld in appeal by a majority judgment. In my eyes, this principle is implied
in, and the basis of, our 1966 judgment in Kanester, supra, and our 1971
judgment in Thomas, supra, two cases where the conviction had been
quashed by the Court of Appeal and was restored by this Court.

Because each case really turns on its own facts,
I do not propose to enter upon a study of the decided cases. In my view, it is
sufficient to look at the evidence mentioned by the trial judge as capable of
amounting to corroboration and to see whether, examined as a complete picture,
it establishes the three elements under discussion. The intercourse is clearly
established by the presence of seminal fluid. The non-consent could certainly
have been considered by the jury as corroborated by the distraught condition of
the complainant as well as by the pine needles; in this day and age, if the
complainant had no objection to have intercourse with one or the other of the
accused, it was certainly open to the jury to decide that there was no need to
go into the bush; our permissive society would certainly allow for more
comfortable quarters. Relevant to the identity, in my view, were the two other
pieces of evidence mentioned by the trial judge, namely the written admission
and the human scalp hair; for the four men to be together at the time of their
arrest, to have been together earlier in the evening, to have through one of
them possession of a red Mustang automobile, all of these admitted facts
coupled with the presence of

[Page 382]

the human scalp hair of Caucasian origin on the
jeans worn by the complainant constitute “evidence which might help the jury to
determine the truth of the matter” D.P.P. v. Kilbourne, supra. Not only
was this evidence relevant and admissible, it was capable of corroborating
complainant’s evidence. Our judgment in Hubin, supra, does not govern
the present situation because

(1) there was in that case no evidence that the
accused was in the vicinity, on the contrary his statement had put him many
miles away from the scene;

(2) there was in that case no other element left
to the jury whereas in the case at bar, there is the additional factor of the
hair which is certainly as capable of being corroborative as the piece of
string in Kanester, supra.

The Crown when presenting a case based on
circumstantial evidence is like a painter whose work is not to be judged after
each stroke of the brush but simply at the end of the day. In the case at bar,
the five pieces of evidence indicated by the trial judge to the jury as capable
of constituting corroborative evidence should only be looked at together as a
completed painting. Taken one by one, they do not tend to show that intercourse
has taken place without the consent of the complainant with one or the other of
the accused. Taken as a whole, however, they are certainly capable of
establishing these three elements of the crime mentioned in the indictment.

For these reasons, I am in agreement with the
reasons and conclusion of the Court of Appeal and I would dismiss the appeal.

BEETZ J.—I agree with Mr. Justice Dickson
as to jurisdiction. I otherwise agree with Mr. Justice de Grandpré.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Non-capital
murder—Defences—Drunkenness—Provocation—Accused under the influence of alcohol
and aggressive—Accused accompanying deceased outside for a fight—Accused kicked
by deceased before shooting him—Sufficiency of evidence of wrongful act or
insult—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 215(3).

Respondent, a policeman, was charged and
convicted of non-capital murder. Having completed his duties on the day shift
he had been drinking with two fellow constables, first at the home of one of
them and thereafter at a succession of bars. In the course of the evening
respondent had become aggressive and argumentative; an argument had developed
in one hotel with two strangers chiefly due to the aggressive action of
respondent and later respondent and one of his fellow constables had tossed the
same two strangers out of another hotel. Shortly after that when the three
friends left in respondent’s automobile his driving was so erratic that he was
stopped by two other constables who were on patrol. Respondent told these other
constables that he had been “shaking up creepies” and kept asking them to go
with him to various hotels to continue this activity. At the next bar the three
again ordered beer. Respondent made an approach to two girls, which was not at
all obnoxious though one of them did tell the deceased that he had saved her
life as “those three goofs were trying to put the hassle on us”. The deceased
shortly thereafter motioned for respondent to go outside and told a friend that
there was going to be a fight. That friend was prevented from following the
deceased and respondent by one of respondent’s companions. Outside, the
deceased and respondent appeared to have animated conversation which ended in a
scuffle or fight. Respondent pushed the deceased who kicked respondent twice.
Subsequently the respondent went to the ground. When he got up he had a
revolver in his hand and shot the deceased twice, the deceased reeled and
started to run and three more reports were heard. Three bullet wounds were
found in the deceased. At trial the only defence

[Page 14]

pressed was that of drunkenness, though a
defence of provocation by reason of drunkenness had been mentioned by defence
counsel prior to jury selection.

In the Court of Appeal where the defence of
provocation was urged the conviction at trial was set aside and a new trial
ordered because of the failure of the trial judge to deal in his charge with
the defence of provocation.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

While it is the duty of a trial judge in his
charge to the jury to deal with any defence available to the accused on the
evidence led whether or not defence counsel chose to advance that defence in
his address to the jury, a trial judge is under no duty to invite the jury to
consider defences of which there is no evidence or which cannot reasonably be
inferred from the evidence. Parnerkar v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R.
449, is determinative that whether there is any evidence of wrongful act or
insult is a question of law to be determined by the trial judge. As the Court
of Appeal in the present case found that there was such evidence and the appeal
is against that conclusion, the issue to be determined is whether there was
evidence of wrongful acts or insults that a reasonable jury acting judicially
could find sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of
self-control. Throughout the evening the respondent was aggressive and he
seized on the slightest confrontation by the deceased to again become so. The
two kicks which he received during the ensuing fight could not constitute the
kind of provocation to cause a police officer to draw his gun and fire five
shots at his assailant. There was nothing in the evidence on which to base a
defence of provocation.

Mancini v. Director
of Public Prosecutions (1941), 28 Cr. App. R. 65; Lee Chun-Chuen v. The
Queen, [1963] A.C. 220; Wu v. The King, [1934] S.C.R. 609; Parnerkar
v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 449 referred to.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] allowing an appeal
by an accused from a conviction for non-capital murder. Appeal allowed, verdict
of jury affirmed.

Charles Scullion, for the appellant.

Charles Ryall, for the respondent. 

[Page 15]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

SPENCE J.—This is an appeal by leave from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on April 21, 1975. By that judgment, the Court of Appeal
for Ontario allowed art appeal
from the conviction of the respondent on February 20, 1974, upon a charge of non‑capital
murder. The Court of Appeal for Ontario directed a new trial.

The respondent was an officer of the Niagara
Regional Police Force and on November 26, 1973, having completed his duties on
the day shift, met two fellow officers, Faragher and Montgomery, intending to
spend the evening together. First at Faragher’s residence, and later, all three
officers consumed a considerable quantity of alcohol. It would appear that the
respondent consumed considerably more than either of his two fellow constables.

At about ten o’clock in the evening, the three men went to one hotel where they were
served more alcoholic beverages then on to another where the same thing
occurred. On leaving the second hotel, the three men observed two other men and
some type of an argument arose, chiefly through the aggressive action of the
respondent. When that incident seemed to have quietened down, the three men
entered a third hotel named the Klondike and the respondent, finding therein
the two with whom he had previously quarrelled, he and his fellow constable
Montgomery simply tossed them out of the hotel. Shortly thereafter, the three
entered the respondent’s automobile with the respondent driving and his driving
was so erratic that he attracted the attention of two other constables, Fiddes
and Pearson, who were on patrol. These constables stopped the respondent and
his two companions and the respondent told Constable Fiddes that he had been
“shaking up creepies” at the Klondike Hotel. Constable Fiddes testified that
the respondent kept asking him to go with the respondent to these various
hotels “to shake up creepies”. Constable Fiddes testified that he declined and
requested Montgomery to drive
the respondent’s car but as they left the respondent continued to drive his own
automobile.

[Page 16]

Their next stop seems to have been the Steven’s
Hotel where they again ordered beer. Constable Montgomery testified that the
respondent left the table and went to a booth. Constable Faragher stated that a
couple of girls were seated at that booth. Both young ladies testified as to
the approach to them made by the respondent, which was not at all obnoxious,
but one of them had spoken to her friend Tremblay, the deceased, using the
words “You really saved my life because those three goofs were trying to put
the hassle on us”. Thereafter, the deceased Tremblay stood behind the table
occupied by the respondent and his fellows and motioned that the respondent
should go out of the building. Tremblay then walked to the door followed by the
respondent and on the way out Tremblay spoke to a friend Jacques Veilleux and
said “Come on, Jack, there’s going to be a fight”. Veilleux attempted to follow
the respondent and Tremblay but was stopped by Montgomery. The latter two engaged in a short fight.

Constable Fiddes continued his patrol. He parked
his car where he could observe the area surrounding Steven’s Hotel and observed
that the respondent’s car was parked near that hotel. For the circumstances
which followed, I quote the following from the appellant’s factum which cited
Constable Fiddes’ testimony:

A few minutes after I parked, I saw a male
person later identified to me as the deceased, come out of the front door of
the hotel onto the sidewalk. This person then stopped and turned around and
faced the hotel door and placed his hands on his hips as though he was
expecting someone else to follow. A few seconds later I saw Lawrence Squire
come out of the hotel in the same manner and go down onto the sidewalk and face
Mr. Tremblay. They appeared to have animated conversation which ended up
in a scuffle or a fight between the two.

I saw Squire motion several times towards
Tremblay as though to push or strike him. He did not make contact at that point.
Tremblay raised clenched fists in a fighting position. Squire pushed Tremblay
with his hand placed on his chest and Tremblay kept his hands up and attempted
to kick Squire with his right foot. Squire pushed or swung at Tremblay and
Tremblay then kicked Squire with his right foot twice…

I started to drive to the area and as I was
approaching the curb or going parallel to the curb Tremblay and Squire made
close contact and Squire went to the ground. When Squire got up he had a
revolver in his hand and pointed it at Tremblay and shot twice. Tremblay reeled
backwards and started to run and I heard three more reports. Squire followed
with the gun still pointing at Tremblay. Tremblay fell on the driveway located
directly west of the Steven’s Hotel at a point where the sidewalk adjoins the
entrance of the driveway. Squire followed to where Tremblay was lying face down
with his head pointing in a due west direction and placed the gun at the back
of Tremblay’s head. At this point I was running parallel to the curb and I had
the radio microphone in my hands and I called the dispatcher requesting a CIB
team and an ambulance and advising that there had been a shooting at the
Steven’s Hotel. I stopped the car and began to get out. During that time Squire
had disappeared from my view.

Counsel for the respondent, in his factum,
states:

Except for the reservations and additions
hereinafter set forth, the Respondent adopts the Statement of Facts set forth
in Part I of the Memorandum of Fact and Law filed on behalf of the Appellant.

In so far as the actual incident outside the
hotel is concerned, counsel for the respondent, in his factum, only added the
following:

9. Where the Respondent was kicked, and the
consequent pain, was the subject of comment by the Court as follows:

MR. ROOT: “The question was not
phrased properly. It was a question of pain. One might be knocked to the ground
but not feel any pain. The resulting tumble might give you pain.”

HIS LORDSHIP: “If we see a man kicked and
knocked down or hit and knocked down, isn’t it a reasonable conclusion that it
was a painful experience and isn’t that all he is saying, “and it would have
been a painful kind of thing?” and the answer is, “I assume”. We would all
assume that.”

MR. ROOT: “I agree.”

HIS LORDSHIP: “Shouldn’t we leave it at
that?” [Emphasis added].

MR. AGRO: “I will leave it.”
[Emphasis added].

[Page 18]

Tremblay died as a result of the bullets fired
by the respondent who was charged with non‑capital murder.

Counsel for the respondent at trial was a very
experienced counsel and particularly so in matters of criminal law. Before the
jury was selected, the said counsel for the respondent, making a submission to
the trial judge, said:

I make this statement openly and for the
purposes of the record in order that Your Lordship knows that we intend and
hope to restrict the issues to the very narrow issue of the defence of
drunkenness and because of the kicking, and I must concede it is very thin, a
defence of provocation by reason of the man’s drunkenness.

Despite that reference to provocation, counsel
for the respondent, in his address to the jury, did not refer to provocation in
any way. The learned trial judge requested both the Crown and the defence to
outline their theories in writing and, in his charge, he said:

I will read to you the theory of the
defence as they have written it out:

First, the onus is on the Crown to prove
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, which burden remains on the Crown throughout
and if the jury has a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused they must
find the accused not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter;

Secondly, the accused is not required,
where drunkenness is a defence, to prove his defence by a preponderance of
evidence. There is no onus on the accused; all he needs do is raise a
reasonable doubt as to his ability to form the intent, and not to prove an
inability to form the necessary intent;

Thirdly, that the total evidence indicates
conduct completely out of character, a complete change in the man from what Montgomery
and Faragher knew of him;

Fourthly, that by reason of the marked and
dramatic change in the man following the third drink at the Lord Nelson,
coupled with the irritability, irrational behaviour, rambling speech, inability
to recognize persons, the jury can find that something was added to that drink;

Fifthly, the description of the accused as
given by Pearson “a drunken man” and his observations of the man point to a
complete incapacity to form any intent;

[Page 19]

Sixthly, that the acts of violence after
the shooting when he broke and entered other people’s homes, robbed and
assaulted them, are so out of character of the accused as to show that at the
time of the shooting his mind was so affected by alcohol that he was incapable
of forming the intent to murder or, at least, provide some reasonable doubt
about it.

It will be seen that that theory of the defence
depended wholly upon the defence of drunkenness. As I have said, the
respondent’s then counsel was a very experienced and able counsel and one would
be most unwise to assume that his failure to advance to the jury the defence of
provocation was an accident. In the light of the evidence which I have very
briefly outlined, he probably exhibited a very considerable degree of wisdom in
refraining from advancing the defence of provocation.

After his conviction, the respondent appealed to
the Court of Appeal for Ontario
and there urged most strongly the defence of provocation.

It is, of course, the duty of a trial judge to
submit to the jury in his charge any defence available to the accused which had
been revealed by the evidence whether or not counsel for the accused chose to
advance that defence in his address to the jury: Mancini v. Director of
Public Prosecutions[2]. And,
of course, in many cases, there are alternative defences and counsel for the
accused feels that his presentation to the jury would only be weakened if he
presented alternatives requiring the jury to make two different findings of
fact. It is, however, equally plain that a trial judge is under no duty to
invite the jury to consider defences of which there is no evidence or which
cannot reasonably be inferred from the evidence: Mancini v. Director
of Public Prosecutions, supra, at p. 72, Lee Chun-Chuen v. The
Queen[3], at p.
233, Wu v. The King[4], at pp.
616 and 617.

Martin J.A., giving the reasons for the Court of
Appeal, having made the statement which I have just made, continued:

It is therefore necessary to determine
whether on any reasonable view of the evidence, the jury could find

[Page 20]

provocation within the meaning of
section 215  of the Criminal Code .

And after an examination of a considerable
number of authorities including Parnerkar v. The Queen[5], and also having regard to much of the
evidence, continued:

I am satisfied, however, that there was
evidence of provocation appropriate for the consideration of the jury, since
there was evidence upon which the jury could find that the deceased had
assaulted the appellant, and that such assault was sufficient to deprive an
ordinary person of the power of self-control.

This is the problem which now faces this Court.
The authoritative pronouncement upon the question of provocation as a defence
by virtue of what is now s. 215  of the Criminal Code  is Parnerkar v.
The Queen, supra. In that appeal, Chief Justice Fauteux, giving the
judgment for the majority, said at p. 454:

Subsection (3) declares that the
constituent elements, which are described in (ii)(a) and (b) above,
are questions of fact and, therefore, assigns exclusively to the jury the
function to decide as to these facts. 

The function assigned to the jury with
respect to the particular facts mentioned in s. 203(3) does not in any way
differ from the function they have to decide all other questions of fact,
whether these facts constitute elements of a crime or elements of an excuse or
a justification for a crime charged. Indeed and in all of the cases, the valid
exercise of the function of the jury is, according to the very words of the
oath of office taken by them, to give a verdict according to evidence. They
cannot go beyond the evidence and resort to speculation nor, of course, would
it be proper for the trial judge to invite them to do so. If, then, the record
is denuded of any evidence potentially enabling a reasonable jury acting
judicially to find a wrongful act or insult of the nature and effect set forth
in s. 203 (3) (a) and (b), it is then, as a matter of law, within
the area exclusively reserved to the trial judge to so decide and his duty to
refrain from putting the defence of provocation to the jury.

Although there were dissenting judgments in Parnerkar,
the Court was unanimous on the only issue which, I think, is involved in
the present

[Page 21]

appeal, namely, that whether there was any
evidence of a wrongful act or insult is a question of law to be determined by
the trial judge. The Court of Appeal for Ontario determined that there was such evidence and the appeal of the
Attorney General is against such a conclusion. Therefore, the determination of
whether the record contained any such evidence must be made by this Court. In
doing so, one must consider all of the evidence adduced at trial. That
evidence, I have summarized briefly above. I now characterize that evidence as
the story of a man who drank heavily and set out to pick a quarrel with any
member of a group of people whom he described as “creepies”, who succeeded in
picking that quarrel on at least one previous occasion that night, and upon
getting into the quarrel with Tremblay and perhaps seeming to be losing the
physical battle he drew his revolver, shot Tremblay twice and then followed
Tremblay as he reeled backwards and fired three further shots. The pathologist
giving evidence for the Crown found three bullet wounds in the deceased
Tremblay.

It is true that there was evidence that Tremblay
motioned to the respondent to indicate that the respondent leave the Steven’s
Hotel very evidently so that they might fight and that he, Tremblay, informed
his friend Veilleux that there was going to be a fight but the respondent
needed no second invitation and the respondent was the aggressor when the fight
commenced. During the fight, such as it was, Tremblay twice kicked at the
respondent but how serious those kicks were is a matter of mere conjecture.
Constable Fiddes testified that the respondent went to the ground but was
unable to say whether that was the result of being knocked to the ground by
Tremblay or from losing his balance.

As I have said, it is the duty of this Court to
come to a decision whether those circumstances amount to any evidence that a
reasonable jury acting judicially could find a wrongful act or insult
sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control (s.
215(2)), and I am strongly of the view, with great respect to the opinion expressed
by Martin J.A., that no jury acting judicially could come to such a conclusion.
It must

[Page 22]

be remembered that on the evidence the
respondent was, throughout the disgraceful incidents of the evening, a
bad-tempered aggressor and that he seized on the slightest confrontation by
Tremblay to again become the aggressor. If, during the fight which followed,
and which I am of the opinon was a fight between two men fully consenting to
the battle, he suffered a couple of kicks of indefinite violence, the
provocation resulting therefrom could not possibly have caused a police officer
to draw his gun and fire five shots at his assailant. To put it very shortly, I
agree with the view of the learned counsel for the respondent at trial who,
upon the basis of this evidence, decided that there was simply nothing on
provocation which he could present to a jury and who, therefore, depended on
the one available defence of drunkenness. There was much to be said in favour
of that defence but very evidently the jury rejected it and that, of course, is
not the subject of any review in this Court.

For these reasons, I am of the opinion that the
appeal by the Crown should be allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal be
quashed, and that the verdict of the jury be affirmed. I have not found it
necessary, under these circumstances, to deal with the application of
s. 613(l)(b)(iii) of the Code.

Appeal allowed, verdict of jury
affirmed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Rape—Corroboration—One of two
accused denying intercourse—Evidence as a whole plus complainant’s distraught
condition corroborative of complainant’s story implicating each of the accused.

The complainant, a 16-year-old Indian girl,
testified that she was taken by the two appellants (M and B) under a pretence
of friendship to an apartment which they occupied and that she was then raped
first by M and then by B. She alleged that M later drove her to a bus station
where she first telephoned a cousin and then the police with the result that a
constable arrived, who, after speaking with the complainant, took her to a
hospital. While speaking with her cousin and during the subsequent interview
with the policeman, the complainant was in an emotionally distraught condition.
Convincing evidence of her mental condition was given by both the cousin and
the policeman.

Both appellants testified in their own
defence. M admitted intercourse but alleged it was with the complainant’s
consent. B denied having intercourse. Both M and B admitted that they had
picked up the girl while driving about the streets of Vancouver late at night,
had done so because they were of the opinion at the time they picked her up
that she was a prostitute, that they had taken her to their apartment and, that
later when she slept in the living room, M testified that he had left the
bedroom to which first B and then he had retired, had entered the living room
and had, as he alleged, intercourse with the complainant with her consent, and
then had retired to the bedroom.

They both testified that later M had left
that bedroom again returning to the living room and then, when the complainant
desired to be driven downtown, had again returned to the bedroom to borrow the
car keys from B. M then testified that he drove the complainant downtown and
that when she attempted in vain to borrow $20

[Page 604]

from him she left the automobile. This latter
incident was denied by the complainant.

On a charge of rape, the appellants were
convicted before a judge and jury. The British Columbia Court of Appeal
dismissed an appeal from the convictions and an appeal to this Court followed.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Dickson J. dissenting in part): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Spence, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: It was all of the
evidence plus the complainant’s distraught condition which the jury were
entitled to consider as corroboration of not only M’s but B’s rape of the
complainant. The fact that M admitted intercourse with the complainant could
not deprive the whole of the evidence of its corroborative effect as to each of
the accused.

Whether or not circumstantial evidence was
consistent with another rational conclusion is a question of fact so no appeal
as of right can be based on the dissent of a judge in the Court of Appeal upon
such issue.

R. v. Conners and Jones, [1972] 5 W.W.R. 1 applied; R. v. Thomas, [1951] O.R. 422,
referred to.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Dickson J., dissenting in part: In the case of B, the appeal
should be allowed and a new trial directed. The complainant’s hysterical
condition or emotional distress may be evidence that is corroborative against
an accused who admits sexual intercourse, as M did, but who at the same time
alleges consent. In such a case it may properly be regarded as supporting the
complaint in a material particular, that is want of consent, and to implicate
the accused because of his admission of intercourse. However, a complainant’s
hysterical condition cannot implicate an accused in any material particular
when, as in the case of B, he has denied intercourse and there is no other
evidence (apart from the complainant’s) that can support a finding of
intercourse.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia[1], dismissing an
appeal by both appellants from their conviction for rape. Appeal dismissed,
Laskin C.J. and Dickson J. dissenting in part.

[Page 605]

S.R. Chamberlain, for the appellants.

F.A. Melvin, for the respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting in part)—I
have had the advantage of seeing the reasons proposed by my brother Spence and
I agree in his proposed disposition of this appeal so far as it concerns the
appellant Murphy. I differ from him, however, with respect to the co-accused
and co-appellant Butt, and for the reasons which follow I am of the opinion
that a new trial should be directed in his case.

On a trial of co-accused for the same offence,
allegedly committed by each separately, each accused is entitled to have the
benefit of a proper direction to the jury that will relate to each separately
on the issues that go to their separate culpability. The present case concerns
a piece of evidence, the hysterical condition of the complainant of a rape by
each of the two appellants, of which testimony was offered by two witnesses to
whom she complained of rape shortly after it allegedly took place. This piece
of evidence was the only evidence which the trial judge told the jury was
capable of being corroborative of the complainant’s testimony, and he told the
jury that it was capable of being corroborative with respect to each accused.

Both accused gave evidence. Murphy admitted
intercourse but alleged it was with the complainant’s consent. Butt denied
having intercourse and, apart from the evidence of the complainant against him,
there was no other evidence upon which a finding that he had intercourse with
her could be made. In this situation the trial judge had to consider whether to
limit his charge to the jury in respect of Butt to the required warning that it
was not safe to find Butt guilty in the absence of corroboration (within the
meaning of s. 142  of the Criminal Code ) but that the jury could do
so if it was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that her evidence was true.
However, he went beyond this in telling the jury that there was evidence
capable of being corroborative (within the statutory prescription) as against
Butt as well as against Murphy, and that was the evidence of the complai-

[Page 606]

nant’s hysterical condition. In this I think he
was plainly wrong.

I do not quarrel with the proposition that a
complainant’s hysterical condition or emotional distress, evident after the
commission of an alleged rape, may be adduced in evidence as corroboration
provided, however, that, in the words of s. 142 , it is “evidence that
implicates the accused.” It cannot be said that evidence of a complainant’s
hysterical condition or emotional distress is capable of being corroborative at
large and that it can be used accordingly against a particular accused simply
because the complainant has alleged that he raped her. It may be evidence that
is corroborative against an accused who admits sexual intercourse, as Murphy
did, but who at the same time alleges consent. In such a case it may properly
be regarded as supporting the complaint in a material particular, that is want
of consent, and to implicate the accused because of his admission of
intercourse. I am unable to understand, however, how a complainant’s hysterical
condition can implicate an accused in any material particular when he has
denied intercourse and there is no other evidence (apart from the
complainant’s) that can support a finding of intercourse.

I have examined the line of cases in this
country in which evidence of a complainant’s hysterical or emotional condition
has been held to be admissible as corroboration in a material particular
implicating the accused. In each of the cases hereinafter cited, where such
evidence was dealt with, it was brought in on the issue of consent where there
was either an admission of or independent evidence of intercourse: see R. v.
Thomas[2], reversed
on other grounds[3]; R.
v. Aubichon[4]; R.
v. Bear, Bear and Tinker[5]; R.
v. Boyd[6]; R.
v. White, Dubeau and McCullough[7]; R.
v. Connors and Jones[8].

[Page 607]

The Privy Council said in James v. R.[9] at p. 301 that “where the charge is
rape, the corroborative evidence must confirm in some material particular that
intercourse has taken place and that it has taken place without the woman’s
consent and also that the accused was the man who committed the crime.” If it
is enough under s. 142  that, where the complainant’s evidence is the only
evidence that implicates the accused, evidence offered as corroboration need
only go to a material particular, it is still necessary that it be evidence
that implicates the accused. The only issue on which a complainant’s hysterical
condition may logically be offered as corroboration is want of consent, but
without some other basis in the evidence to show intercourse evidence of a
hysterical upset can no more implicate the accused on want of consent than it
can implicate him on the issue of identification where that is contested.

Counsel for the respondent Crown in the present
case, if I understood him correctly, said that although the complainant’s
hysterical condition would not, taken alone, implicate the accused Butt, nor
would the mere fact that the accused Butt was on the premises where Murphy
admittedly had intercourse with the complainant, nonetheless the two things
taken together provided the required implication. This submission fails
entirely to implicate the accused in any act of intercourse, and without proof
of such an act the case against Butt must fail if it is to stand on a
foundation of corroboration.

I can appreciate concern that a scrupulous
regard for the limitations on corroborative evidence may make it difficult to
deal with “gang” rape. This issue was faced recently by the Ontario Court of
appeal in R. v. White, Dubeau and McCullough, supra, where the Court
split in a gang rape case on whether the finding of some bloody kleenex at the
locale of an alleged rape was capable of being corroborative on the issue of
want of consent, the majority holding it was not. The fact that a gang rape is
alleged, where some members deny intercourse, does not justify any different
application of the rules of law than in a

[Page 608]

case where there is an allegation of rape by one
person who denies intercourse. If there is no proper corroborative evidence,
there may still be a conviction if the jury chooses to bring in a verdict of
guilty after being warned of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated
evidence of the complainant.

I would allow the appeal of Butt and direct a
new trial for him.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Spence, Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

SPENCE J.—This is an appeal from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia pronounced on November 15, 1974. By
that judgment, the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by both appellants from
their conviction before the Honourable Mr. Justice McKay and a jury upon a
charge of rape. Branca J.A. dissented in the Court of Appeal and in accordance
with the provisions of s. 605  of the Criminal Code  the formal
judgment of the Court contained the following paragraphs:

BE IT RECORDED that the Honourable
Mr. Justice Branca dissents from the decision of this Honourable Court on
the following question of law:

THAT circumstantial evidence as to the
distraught condition of the complainant that was consistent with two rational
conclusions was not capable of corroborating the evidence of the complainant.

Counsel for the appellants relied upon those
paragraphs as the basis for an appeal to this Court under the provisions of
s. 618(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .

I am of the opinion, however, that an appeal
does not lie to this Court upon a question so framed for the short reason that
it is not a question of law. When circumstantial evidence is submitted by the
Crown then the jury may only accept that evidence as corroboration if it is
consistent with the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with any other
rational explanation. It is for the jury to determine as a question of fact
whether (a) the evidence is consistent with the guilt of the accused,

[Page 609]

and (b) whether that evidence is inconsistent
with any other rational conclusion. Branca J.A. was of the opinion that the
evidence submitted was not inconsistent with any other rational conclusion but
his view upon that issue was a decision of fact and not of law. It should be
noted that the learned trial judge instructed the jury upon the issue in the
following terms:

You will also keep in mind that this is circumstantial
evidence and you would only draw a corroborative inference if you concluded it
was consistent with an offence having been committed and having been committed
by the particular accused you are considering and inconsistent with any other
rational explanation.

I am, therefore, of the opinion that in so far
as the ground of appeal upon which the accused relied for an appeal as of right
is concerned the appeal should stand dismissed.

The appellants, however, applied to this Court
for leave to appeal in accordance with the provisions of s. 618(1) (b)
and in such application requested leave to argue the following questions:

1. Was there misdirection or non-direction
amounting to misdirection by the learned trial Judge in his charge, when he
instructed the jury that the hysterical condition of the complainant was
capable in law of corroborating the issue as to whether the Appellant, Butt,
had intercourse with the complainant?

2. Was there non-direction amounting to
misdirection by the learned trial Judge in his charge when he failed to
instruct the jury that they should attach little or no weight to the evidence
of the hysterical condition of the complainant in that the possibility exists
that she might well be simulating distress where the distress is displayed at
the time of the complaint having first been made by the complainant?

The time for hearing this application for leave
to appeal was extended to the date of the hearing of the appeal and the
argument upon the appeal was, in fact, an argument upon the questions which I
have set out immediately above. It is at this time appropriate to outline some
of the circumstances which gave rise to the charge of rape. I quote from the
reasons of McFarlane J.A. speaking for the majority of the Court of Appeal for
British

[Page 610]

Columbia and summarizing the evidence of the
complainant:

The testimony of the complainant, a sixteen
year old native Indian girl, may be summarized as follows: That the two
appellants being together in an automobile picked her up, by offering her a
lift to the home of a friend of hers, on a street in Vancouver at an early hour
of the morning of October 18th, 1973; that they took her to a house where they
occupied a basement suite containing a bedroom and a livingroom in the latter
of which there was a cot or couch: having removed only her coat she lay on this
cot otherwise fully clothed and fell asleep: that she was awakened by the
presence on the cot of Murphy, who thereupon by threats which frightened her
had sexual intercourse with her, against her will and without her consent: that
Murphy then left the living-room and before she could dress herself Butt
entered from the bedroom, naked, and by the use of similar threats also had
sexual intercourse with her against her will and without her consent: that
later Murphy drove her to a bus depot where she telephoned to a cousin in
Prince Rupert and that following a conversation with that cousin she telephoned
to the Vancouver Police with the result that a Constable arrived about 7:50
a.m., spoke with her and then took her to a hospital.

Both appellants testified in their own defence.
The appellant Murphy admitted that he had had intercourse with the complainant
but alleged that such intercourse was with her full consent not as a result of
any intimidation. The appellant Butt testified that upon reaching the apartment
occupied by both appellants he had immediately retired to bed and had no
knowledge of any events which occurred thereafter until his co-appellant Murphy
had awakened him in order to borrow the keys for his automobile. There are, of
course, discrepancies between the evidence given by the complainant and that
given by the two appellants and even certain discrepancies between the evidence
given by one appellant and the other with which I shall deal hereafter.

The learned trial judge properly gave to the
jury in his charge the warning required by the provisions of s. 142  of the
Criminal Code . That section provides:

142.
Notwithstanding anything in this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of
Canada, where an accused is charged with an offence under section 144,
145, subsection 146(1) or (2) or subsection 149(1), the

[Page 611]

judge shall, if the only evidence that
implicates the accused is the evidence, given under oath, of the female person
in respect of whom the offence is alleged to have been committed and that
evidence is not corroborated in a material particular by evidence that
implicates the accused, instruct the jury that it is not safe to find the
accused guilty in the absence of such corroboration, but that they are entitled
to find the accused guilty if they are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
her evidence is true.

It may be noted that by an amendment wrought by
the Criminal Code Amendment Act, 1975, 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 93,
s. 8, the requirement that the trial judge give to the jury the above
warning has been removed and a very different procedure instituted.

The learned trial judge then continued:

Now, I tell you as a matter of law that the
only evidence capable of being considered by you as corroborative of the
complainant’s testimony with respect to each accused, if you believe that
evidence, is the evidence of her distraught condition as described by her
cousin, Ruth Cecil, and the police constable who picked her up at the bus
depot.

It is the propriety of giving to the jury this
evidence as being possible corroboration which was the subject-matter of the
first question upon which leave to appeal was sought and granted. It is
submitted by counsel for the accused that such evidence fails in the first
requisite for its acceptance as corroboration in that it was not independent.
It was evidence of the observance of emotional distress which was exhibited by
the complainant herself. The question as to whether such evidence may be
submitted to the jury as corroboration has been canvassed in a variety of cases
and the results of those cases are by no means consistent. McFarlane J.A., in
his reasons for judgment, relied particularly upon the decision of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Conners and Jones[10]. In that decision, the Court of
Appeal for British Columbia held that the distraught condition of the
complainant shortly after the incident complained of and her emotional
reactions during an interview

[Page 612]

with the police the day following were capable
in law of amounting to corroboration. In arriving at that conclusion, the Court
of Appeal for British Columbia had cited with approval the decision of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Thomas[11], where Roach J.A. said at
p. 432:

It was argued that the emotional condition
of the wife could not be corroborative of her story. I disagree. It is of
course possible to think of a case where a woman consented to the act and
immediately thereafter became affected by remorse, but it surely must be left
to the jury to assess the value to be attached to the emotional condition of a
woman shortly after an occasion upon which she alleges that she has been
violated. It is evidence to be considered in relation to other evidence which…

That case came to this Court and a new trial was
ordered but upon a different ground.

The respondent’s factum, I believe, sets out the
proper view as follows:

Independent testimony of a rape
complainant’s emotional condition is capable at law of corroboration where it
is sufficiently damning that it may be considered by a jury to be more
consistent with her denial of consent than with the existence of consent, or,
to put it another way, where a reasonable inference can be drawn by a jury, considering
all the circumstances, that there is a causal relationship between the assault
and the complainant’s distraught emotional condition.

In the present case, the complainant, who I have
noted was a sixteen-year-old native Indian girl, displayed this emotionally
distraught condition firstly in a telephone call to her cousin made within
fifteen minutes after she had been driven by the appellant Murphy back to the
bus terminal in Vancouver and again in an interview with a policeman whom she
called as soon as she had ceased speaking to her cousin. Her mental condition
was most marked and very convincing evidence thereof was given by both the
cousin and the policeman. I am of the opinion that such evidence could qualify
as corroboration within the provisions of s. 142  of the Criminal Code . The
weight which should be given to such evidence was, of course, a matter for the
jury and it must be presumed that the jurors

[Page 613]

did assess its weight in accordance with their
sworn duty. Cases which deal with the emotional distress of the complainant
vary all the way from R. v. Redpath[12],
where the victim was a small child and the evidence proferred was that of
persons who had observed her immediately after the incident when she did not
know she was under observation, to cases where the complainant exhibits the
emotional distress a very considerable time after the incident and when she had
failed to display such a distraught condition after the incident and before the
display which was the subject-matter of the evidence. In such latter case, the
independent character of the evidence is very doubtful and courts have very
properly excluded it from consideration as corroboration required by the
provisions of the Code.

The second question advanced upon the
application for leave to appeal dealt with the alleged failure of the learned
trial judge to instruct the jury that they should attach little or no weight to
the evidence of the hysterical condition of the complainant in that the
possibility existed that she might well be simulating distress. The learned
trial judge, in his charge to the jury, reciting the theory of the defence,
pointed out this very danger saying:

The defence points out that the crying and
hysteria are easy to simulate if one is laying a trap. The defence’s theory is
that she was laying a trap. The defence says, “Why should she lay a trap? Well,
she needed money and in frustration when Murphy refused her a loan of $20 she
cried “rape” in retaliation”.

Throughout his charge, the learned trial judge
had stressed that the Crown must prove each and every ingredient beyond a
reasonable doubt and had adequately pointed out to the jury their duty of
assessing the credibility of each witness. There is, of course, the danger that
a complainant motivated by most improper considerations would simulate her
distress but the determination of whether that has occurred is essentially the
task of the jury and, in my view, the jury in this case was adequately alerted
to that duty and would consider its decision in the light of the fact that the
complainant was a young native Indian girl in a

[Page 614]

strange city and that she had, even apart from
the actual rapes with which she charged the two accused, undergone a very
stressful experience over many hours. It is to be noted that the defence theory
as to the complainant’s anger at failing to obtain the $20 loan depends on the
evidence of the appellant Murphy alone and that when counsel for the appellants
cross-examined her as to the allegation that she had attempted to obtain a $20
loan from the appellant Murphy the complainant answered “No way. I didn’t ask
him for nothing. As soon as he stopped that car I walked as fast as I could to
the nearest phone.”

Under all of these circumstances, I am of the
opinion that no complaint can be made as to the sufficiency of the charge in
reference to the jury’s duty of weighing the possibility that the complainant
was simulating her distress.

A considerably more difficult problem was
advanced in argument by counsel for the appellants as to the availability of
the evidence of the complainant’s distress as advanced as corroboration in the
particular circumstances of this case. It is to be remembered that both
appellants admitted that they had taken the complainant into the car driven by
the appellant Butt and in which the appellant Murphy rode and driven to the
basement apartment occupied by them both and further that the appellant Murphy
admitted having intercourse with the complainant but alleged that it had been
with the consent of the complainant while the appellant Butt had testified that
he had retired to the bedroom and to sleep immediately upon arriving at the
apartment and had never left that bedroom or even touched the complainant at
any time and his testimony to this effect was confirmed by the appellant
Murphy.

Under these circumstances, it is submitted that
the evidence as to the overwrought condition of the complainant could not be in
any way corroborative of her evidence accusing the appellant Butt and that as
to the appellant Murphy even if evidence of the complainant’s hysterical
condition could be corroborative on the issue of consent in so far as the
appellant Murphy is concerned, it could not be corroborative as identifying him
and, at any rate,

[Page 615]

he had admitted that he had intercourse with the
complainant. It must be carefully considered just what is required by the
provisions of s. 142 of the Code. It is firstly called into force
when “the only evidence that implicates the accused is the evidence, given
under oath, of the female person in respect of whom the offence is alleged to
have been committed”. Those conditions do apply to the present case. Then what
is required is “that evidence is not corroborated in a material particular by
evidence that implicates the accused”. So that what is required to be
corroborated is a material particular of the evidence of the
complainant. The evidence of the complainant was, as I have already recited,
that she was taken by these two appellants acting under a pretence of friendship
to the apartment which they occupied and then raped first by the appellant
Murphy and then by the appellant Butt. It is a material particular of that
evidence which must be corroborated. There is no requirement that the whole of
her evidence be corroborated. Were that the requirement, there would be no need
for even the evidence of the complainant. The so-called corroborative evidence
would be sufficient for a conviction.

It is true that corroboration to be within
s. 142 , as it then existed, had to be evidence that implicated the accused
and counsel for Butt submits that in the light of Murphy’s admission of
intercourse with the complainant the corroboration was only required as to
Murphy on the issue of consent and that the overwrought condition of the complainant,
even if capable of corroborating her evidence upon that issue as to Murphy
could in no way corroborate her evidence that Butt as well had intercourse with
her without her consent. The jury were required to consider all of the evidence
upon the issue not only of the identity of her assailants but of her lack of
consent. That evidence not only included Murphy’s admission that he had
intercourse with the complainant, as he alleged with her consent, but also the
admissions of both Murphy and Butt that they had picked up this girl while
driving about the streets of Vancouver late at night, had done so because they
were of the opinion at the time they picked her up that she was a prostitute,
that they had taken her to their apartment and, that later when she slept in
the

[Page 616]

living room, Murphy testified that he had left
the bedroom to which first Butt and then he had retired, had entered the living
room and had, as he alleged, intercourse with the complainant with her consent,
and then he had retired to the bedroom.

They both testified that later Murphy had left
that bedroom again returning to the living room and then, when the complainant
desired to be driven downtown, had again returned to the bedroom to borrow the
car keys from Butt. Murphy then testified that he drove the complainant
downtown and that when she attempted in vain to borrow $20 from him she left
the automobile. This latter incident, as I have pointed out, was denied
vehemently by the complainant.

It is all of that evidence plus the
complainant’s distraught condition upon which the Crown relies as corroboration
of not only Murphy’s but Butt’s rape of the complainant. The jury were entitled
to consider all of that evidence and to come to the conclusion that that
evidence with its rather unusual outline of events does corroborate the
evidence of the complainant. It was that evidence which the learned trial judge
left to the jury as evidence which they might find corroborative of the
complainant’s testimony.

In my view, the learned trial judge was correct
in his conclusion that that evidence was capable of corroborating the
complainant’s story implicating each of the accused.

Under these circumstances, therefore, I am of
the opinion that the fact that Murphy admitted intercourse with the complainant
cannot deprive the whole of the evidence of its corroborative effect as to each
of the accused.

As Coady J.A. said in R. v. Jesseau and Breen[13], at p. 296:

[The] defence offered by the respondents is
a matter for consideration by the jury and does not affect the question of
whether or not the evidence of torn clothing may be corroborative of the
complainant’s story. That ques-

[Page 617]

tion, it seems to me, has to be decided
quite apart from the defence evidence, and if more consistent with her story,
the jury may find that it is corroborative.

It would be intolerable if evidence which was
admissible and relevant as corroboration of the complainant’s evidence were
made inadmissible or ineffective by some admission made by the accused.

For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

DICKSON J. (dissenting in part)—I have
had the advantage of reading the reasons of the Chief Justice with which I
agree. I should like, however, to make several observations. First, s. 142
of the Criminal Code  (now repealed) appears to contain a logical
inconsistency. The section requires the judge to instruct the jury in the
manner specified if: (i) the only evidence that implicates the accused is the
evidence of the female person and (ii) that evidence is not corroborated by
evidence that implicates the accused. If the only evidence implicating the
accused is that of the female person, it would seem to follow logically that
there could be no other evidence implicating the accused. Be that as it may,
the intent of the section is clear and trial judges have not experienced
difficulty in repeating its language in jury charges. I pass then to the second
observation.

This relates to s. 21(1) of the Code. This
section goes to the question of guilt and not to corroboration, but I
think that some reference to it is warranted. Section 21(1) provides that
everyone is a party to an offence who actually commits it or does or omits to
do anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it or abets any
person committing it. In many “gang” rape cases, the Crown relies upon this
section to secure conviction of members of the group who may not have had
intercourse with the complainant but aided others. In the case at bar, the
theory of the Crown was that each of the accused had had intercourse with the
complainant. The Crown did not rely upon s. 21 and the judge did not
charge on s. 21. The onus therefore rested upon the Crown of proving
inter-

[Page 618]

course by each accused.

During the trial, Murphy admitted intercourse,
which left open so far as he was concerned only the question of consent or no
consent. On this point, evidence of the distraught condition of the complainant
was capable of corroborative effect and Murphy, in my view, was properly
convicted.

The position of Butt is different. He testified,
confirmed by Murphy, that he had gone to bed upon arrival at the apartment and
had taken no part whatever in the events recounted by complainant. When the
judge came to consider s. 142, as affecting Butt, the question before him
was whether there was evidence on the record implicating Butt, which
corroborated in a material particular the evidence of complainant that Butt had
had intercourse with her. How does a distraught condition, essentially neutral,
incriminate Butt, or lend credence to the story of the complainant that he, in
addition to Murphy, forced intercourse upon her? Can a distraught condition in
the circumstances of this case be identified with any particular person? Can it
be related to any particular act? Can it be said that the condition was
attributable to forced sexual intercourse and that the person or one of the
persons who forced intercourse upon the complainant was Butt? If not, then it
is difficult to see how it can be said to have corroborative force. The possibility
of corroborative effect is, no doubt, enhanced by the accuseds’ testimony that
they were cruising in the middle of the night in downtown Vancouver and that
they picked up complainant whom they thought might be a prostitute and took her
to the accuseds’ apartment where the three remained during the relevant period.
Within the totality of the testimony it may be argued that the evidence of
hysteria assumed greater significance. Nonetheless, there is no evidence
capable of corroborating the vital element in question in the case against
Butt, namely intercourse with the complainant. In any rape case, there are
essentially two items requiring corroboration, offence and identity. Each needs
confirmation. It is not neces-

[Page 619]

sary that the same evidence corroborate both
items but it is essential that both items be corroborated.

In the case of Warkentin v. The Queen, in
which reasons are being delivered contemporaneously with those in the present
appeal, there was not, in my view, corroborative evidence as to identity. In
the case at bar there is not, in my view, corroborative evidence as to the
offence. It is not enough to find guilt by association.

I would allow the appeal of Butt and grant him a
new trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL DIVISION

Criminal law—Capital murder—Trial—Charge to
jury—Errors in charge—Circumstantial evidence.

Appellants were convicted of capital murder.
The victims were two policemen who were last heard of when responding to a call
to check a car in connection with the investigation of a kidnapping and whose
dead bodies were discovered two days later. In the Appeal Division appellants
urged eighteen grounds of appeal with two additional grounds as to the
appellant Ambrose. The Appeal Division considered that the trial judge had made
certain errors viz. (1) by failing to reprimand Crown Counsel for his
use of the word “fiction” and not instructing the jury to disregard it, (2) by
not more fully detailing the evidence not admissible against each accused, (3)
by stating as facts conclusions not supported by the evidence, (4) by not more
fully enumerating gaps in the Crown’s case and (5) in admitting evidence and
statements inter alia of an intended kidnapping by Hutchison. However
despite the finding of these errors the Appeal Division came to the conclusion
that no jury properly instructed could have done otherwise than find appellants
guilty and that there had been no miscarriage of justice.

Held: The
appeals should be dismissed.

The Supreme Court like the Appeal Division
was entitled to take cognizance of the mass of circumstantial evidence pointing
well nigh irrefutably to the guilt of the accused and that despite such
evidence neither accused

[Page 718]

offered any evidence in defence. The Appeal
Division was entitled to apply s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code  and properly found that there had been no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice.

Colpitts v. R., [1965] S.C.R. 739 referred to.

APPEALS from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of New Brunswick, Appeal Division[1],
dismissing appeals from appellants’ convictions by Dickson J. with jury upon
two charges of capital murder. Appeals dismissed.

J.E. Warner, Q.C., for the appellants.

Donal Friel, Q.C., and C.A. Dumas, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

SPENCE J.—These are appeals from the judgments
of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick both pronounced on
July 18, 1975. By those judgments, the said Appeal Division dismissed the
appeal of each of the appellants from their conviction by Dickson J. and a jury
on April 1, 1975 upon two
charges of capital murder contrary to s. 218  of the Criminal Code .

Reasons for judgment in the Appeal Division were
given by Limerick J.A., and the learned justice on appeal set out the facts in
a very complete and detailed fashion. The judgment in the Ambrose case
is now reported at (1975), 7 A.P.R. 376, and in the Hutchison case at
(1975), 7 A.P.R. 327, and also at (1976), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 423. I repeat that
statement of facts:

On the night of December 13th, 1974,
Mrs. Sara Stein, mother of Mr. Simon Stein, sometimes referred to as
Cy Stein (a restaurant proprietor), and the 14 year old son of Cy Stein,
Raymond Stein, were driven to Mr. Stein’s home from his restaurant about
10:30 p.m. by an employee of Mr. Stein, Jean Stone, who let them out of
her automobile and immediately returned to the restaurant. Both the home of
Mr. Stein and the restaurant are in the City of Moncton, New Brunswick.

[Page 719]

Raymond Stein unlocked the front door of
the residence and when he and his grandmother entered they were confronted by
two masked men of short stature both armed with revolvers, one of whom asked
where “Cy” was. On being informed by Mrs. Stein her son was at the
restaurant they proceeded to bind her wrists and tie her to the railing of the
stairs leading upstairs. They then left the house by a side door on the ground
floor taking Raymond Stein with them. Before doing so, they placed a balaclava
or ski hat over the boy’s head backwards. One man stayed with the boy at the
street while the other left and returned with an automobile. The front seat of
the car was pushed ahead and the boy and one of the men got into the rear seat
of the car which was fairly roomy. The seats were covered with fabric. The
boy heard conversation between two people only. They then drove him to an
apartment where they kept him for several hours with the balaclava still over
his head.

The head covering did not completely cut
off the vision of the boy because of the nature of the material of which it was
made. He could distinguish light and darkness and indistinct forms. Raymond was
able to trace part of the route followed by the vehicle in which he was being
conveyed. It went to the corner of Mount Royal Boulevard and Bessborough
Avenue, turned right on Mount Royal, then left on St. George Boulevard
past Centennial Place thence to the New Brunswick Power Plant and Edinborough
Drive and past an A & W take-out restaurant on Mountain Road.

En route one stop was made during which one
of the kidnappers took Raymond from the back seat to a telephone attached to
the side of the building. One man dialed Mr. Stein’s number and there was
a conversation by the boy and by the man with Mr. Stein.

The next stop was at an apartment. The
kidnappers took the boy through an entrance door and up two flights of stairs.
Raymond testified the stairs were not wood or carpeted but more like concrete.
They then went through a hallway into a room where the boy sat on the carpeted
floor. There was a window in the room. The boy had considerable conversation
with the men, most of which was with the man who had been in the back seat with
him. One of the men got $10 from the boy, left the apartment and returned with
some cooked chicken and coke. The man who stayed with the boy while the other
went out also sat on the floor. After several hours all three left the
apartment by a rear door and got into a car again. The boy got into the back
seat, the same as he had done before, by having the front seat moved ahead.

[Page 720]

The rear seat was roomy and the seat was
fabric covered as before.

After leaving the apartment the car was
driven to the Riverview Mall across the river from Moncton by way of the causeway. One man was in the back seat with the boy
and he did not know if there was anyone in the front seat besides the driver or
which man was in the back seat with him as there was no talking.

The car stopped past the Riverview Mall and
they waited in the car until Mr. Stein came in his Thunder-bird car and
dropped $15,000 in $10 bills contained in a canvas bag some distance ahead of
the kidnappers’ car. Mr. Stein then drove forward about 100 yards and
stopped. The car in which the boy was held was driven forward to where
Mr. Stein had dropped the money in the ditch and the boy was then
released. When he got halfway to his father’s car he took off the head covering.
Mr. Stein and his son then drove back to the restaurant.

Mrs. Sara Stein, 15 or 20 minutes
after being tied up, worked her wrists free and called Mr. Stein at the
restaurant who immediately drove home where, shortly after arriving, he
received a telephone call from a man whom he was then unable to identify; he
also on the same occasion talked to his son on the phone. As a result of the
phone call he went back to the restaurant to see how much money he had there.
While at the restaurant he received a second telephone call from the same man,
following which Mr. Stein telephoned Mr. Milton Palmer, Manager of
the Bank of Nova Scotia, and arranged for Mr. Palmer to attend at his
branch of the Bank to obtain $15,000 for Mr. Stein who then returned to
his residence where he received a third telephone call from one of the
kidnappers. After this call Mr. Palmer and his bank accountant delivered
$15,000 in $10 bills to Mr. Stein at his residence, having first dictated
the serial numbers of a number of the bills on the tapes of two dictation
machines.

Shortly after the Manager left
Mr. Stein’s residence the latter received a fourth telephone call at about
3:30 a.m. during which he was instructed to drop off the money which was
enclosed in the canvas bag in a ditch just west of the Riverview Mall across
the river south of Moncton.

The last two telephone calls were monitored
by one of the Moncton policemen
at the New Brunswick Telephone Company building with the aid of Telephone

[Page 721]

Company technicians and with the consent of
Mr. Stein. There were some discrepancies in the evidence as to the exact
time of the various telephone calls which can be accounted for by the fact that
the wrist watches of the witnesses were not synchronized.

Mr. Stein then proceeded to take the
money in his dark brown Thunderbird car across the causeway to Riverview, then
turned right or westerly along the Salisbury or Coverdale Road about one mile
to the Riverview Mall. He stopped the car about 100 yards past the Mall and
dropped the bag of money out of the right door of the Thunderbird into the
ditch and drove ahead a short distance, stopped the car and waited until his
son Raymond Stein came forward and got into the Thunderbird car. Mr. Stein
then turned the car and drove easterly along the Salisbury
 Road and returned to the restaurant.

The Moncton Police failed to notify the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who had jurisdiction in the area surrounding Moncton including the Riverview area, of
the kidnapping until about 5:30 a.m. of the morning following the kidnapping;
as a result no road blocks were set up until after the boy was released.

In spite of the fact that the last
telephone conversation lasted for seven minutes from 3:30 to 3:37 a.m. or from
3:37 to 3:44 a.m., depending upon from whose watch the time was taken, the
location from which the call was made was not traced at the telephone office
and the Moncton Police failed to have police cars in the Riverview Mall area
until Mr. Stein was returning home with his son.

Four police cars were dispatched to the
Mall area, two of which met and passed Mr. Stein’s Thunderbird east of the
Mall on its way back to the restaurant.

One police car parked in a private driveway
just east of the Mall; a second proceeded to set up a road block west of the
Mall, and a third police car, occupied by the two now deceased police officers,
Cpl. Bourgeois and Cst. O’Leary, went to an area east of the first
above-mentioned police car. Each of the deceased was armed with a revolver and
there was a shotgun in the car.

Detectives Cairns, Cassidy and Cudmore,
occupants of the police car parked east of the Mall, observed a 1968 to 1970
two door Cadillac car with a light beige body and dark top following a blue
Dodge which latter car they had observed passing them twice before.

[Page 722]

The Cadillac turned southerly on Wentworth Street and as it entered that
street the headlights went out. It turned about on Wentworth Street and
returned northerly and turned right and proceeded easterly on the Salisbury
Road, otherwise known as the Coverdale Road, with the lights still out.

The three detectives decided to follow the
blue Dodge and back up the two policemen Crandall and Galbraith when the latter
stopped the Dodge car which they found contained the Chief of the Moncton Police
Force and two other people. As they started to follow the Dodge one of the
officers radioed Cpl. Bourgeois and Cst. O’Leary to check a Cadillac with a
dark roof and light-coloured body. Cpl. Bourgeois replied “Okay”. The bodies of
Cpl. Bourgeois and Cst. O’Leary were discovered on December 15, 1974, in
shallow graves at Evangeline about 15 miles northeast of Moncton.

Before the Appeal Division, the appellants urged
eighteen grounds of appeal as to both appellants and two additional grounds as
to the appellant Ambrose.

On the appeal to this Court, counsel for the
appellants set out the points in issue and their position as follows:

POINTS
IN ISSUE AND
POSITION OF THE APPELLANTS

1. Was the Court of Appeal for the Province
of New Brunswick wrong in holding that:

(a) Notwithstanding the finding of
prejudicial errors on the part of the trial Judge, no reasonable jury properly
charged could have come to any other conclusion than the guilt of the accused?;
and

(b) In finding there was no substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice?

2. Did the Court of Appeal for the Province
of New Brunswick also err in finding that:

(a) The trial Judge was right in his
instructions to the jury as to reasonable doubt regarding the victims acting in
the course of duty; and

(b) In holding that the jury in finding
capital murder was correct?

The Appellants respectfully submit that the
Court of Appeal for the Province of New Brunswick erred in findings under both
points 1 and 2.

[Page 723]

At the commencement of the argument, counsel for
the appellants expressly withdrew the point outlined in para. 2(a) above.

In his very carefully considered reasons,
Limerick J.A. dealt with the trial and with the judge’s charge and then
summarized his conclusions as follows:

In summation the trial Judge made certain
errors during the trial, specifically:

1. In failing to reprimand Crown Counsel
for his use of the word “fiction” and not instructing the jury to disregard it.

2. In not more fully specifying the
evidence which was admissible against one accused and not against the other.

3. In stating as facts certain conclusions
he arrived at which were not supported by evidence, particularly, the reference
to an illegal drug bill.

4. In not more fully enumerating the
discrepancies and gaps in the Crown’s case.

5. In admitting evidence of an intended
kidnapping of J.D. Irving by Hutchison, and also in admitting evidence of a
statement by Hutchison to James Nelligan that the former had been involved in
an armed robbery in Ontario and had asked his accomplice to kill a policeman.

I shall briefly comment on some of the errors
which Limerick J.A. found.

1. This error was a most inconsequential one.
The learned trial judge had expressly instructed the jury in the usual manner
that they were the sole judges of the facts and should exercise their judgment
in weighing both the testimony of the witnesses and the addresses of counsel.

2. It is true that the learned trial judge did
not in complete detail separate the items of evidence which were admissible as
against one accused but not against the other accused. The learned trial judge,
however, did, in his charge, say to the jury:

I must say this though, here we have two
accused who are jointly charged but you must consider the case of each accused
separately and you must apply the evidence here against each accused separately
and, more than that, you must bear in mind there is some evidence which is
applicable against one accused which may not be applicable against the other
accused. You don’t say

[Page 724]

to yourselves, look, those two accused we
will just consider them in one lump sum and the evidence is strong that those
men were murdered and one of the accused must have murdered him or them so
therefore both accused are guilty. You must consider each man, you must ask
yourselves “am I satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Hutchison killed
those two men or killed one or the other of them” and then you must ask
youselves, “Am I satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Ambrose killed those
two men or killed one or other of them”. There is certain evidence that is
applicable perhaps in the case of one that is not applicable in the case of the
other and you must ignore it in so far as you can. You must ignore it totally,
as a matter of fact, in considering the case of the other.

The learned trial judge then continued over
several foolscap printed pages to refer to examples of pieces of evidence which
were admissible as against one accused only and not against the other. Having
outlined the principle of separate consideration of the cases against each of
the accused, and after having warned the jury that they must consider each
piece of evidence and determine whether it was evidence against one or both of
the accused, I do not think the learned trial judge was required to enumerate
every piece of evidence which was admissible against only one of the two
accused, and I am of the opinion that his failure to do so did not constitute
any miscarriage of justice.

3. The learned trial judge in his charge did
state certain conclusions which were not supported in the evidence. The jury
were carefully instructed by the learned trial judge that it was their decision
upon the facts alone which was of any importance and, in my view, these few and
rather inconsequential so-called conclusions by the learned trial judge were,
in fact, surmises which he made and which the jury would understand he was
making and which the jury would realize they could accept or reject as they
deemed fit. It would have been much better if the learned trial judge had
refrained from such a course. Again, I do not regard his adoption of it on
these very few occasions as causing any miscarriage of justice.

4. In finding this fault in the learned trial
judge’s charge, Limerick J.A. was referring to the outline of the theory of the
defence by the learned trial judge. It must be noted that neither of the

[Page 725]

accused gave evidence and, in fact, no evidence
was called for the defence. The learned trial judge was, therefore, called upon
to determine the theory of the defence from consideration of the
cross-examination of the Crown’s witnesses by defence counsel and then from the
defence counsel’s address to the jury. The learned trial judge said:

I am obliged to review here the theory of
the defence, what is known as the theory of the defence, and Mr. Bell has
outlined it and outlined it extremely well and dealt with all aspects of the
defence essentially and I have touched on it in some of the things I have had
to say. Essentially the theory of the defence is that the evidence here is all
circumstantial, that even though no alternative explanation is given there are
gaps in the Crown’s case which indicate there are alternative explanations and
if there is any other logical explanation of this then a jury must under the
rule I cited earlier where all the evidence is circumstantial, the jury must be
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt or it must acquit. This is the first point
of the theory of the defence. The second is on the theory, the burden being on
the Crown to satisfy you of the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt,
that the Crown has failed in that and therefore you must acquit. That, in a
nut-shell, is the theory of the defence and, Mr. Bell, I don’t feel it is
necessary to go into the evidence there, the theory has been put forward,
Mr. Bell has done that most adequately and has pointed out what
undoubtedly are some discrepancies, whether material or not is up to you to
decide, in the evidence of the witnesses.

The indictment of the two appellants showed the
names of seventy-six witnesses who were called by the Crown. The evidence at
trial occupies four foolscap printed volumes and ran to 1371 pages. If counsel
for the defence based the theory of the defence upon discrepancies in 1371
printed pages of evidence given by Crown witnesses then it was his duty in his
address to outline those discrepancies. The learned trial judge was of the
opinion that counsel for the defence had done so most adequately and was,
therefore, I think, properly of the opinion that it was neither necessary nor
desirable that he should repeat the outline of those discrepancies in his
charge. The charge and recharge occupied fifty-nine foolscap printed pages and
the main charge occupied two hours and five

[Page 726]

minutes. To have burdened the jury with a
recital of discrepancies which had already been outlined in the very long and
most complete address of counsel for the accused would not have served any
useful purpose and might well have so confused the jury as to detract from
their efficient discharge of their sworn duty.

5. Counsel for the Crown on this appeal frankly
admitted that this evidence was inadmissible and it is most regrettable that it
should ever have been proferred by the Crown let alone admitted by the learned trial
judge. Unfortunately, the learned trial judge not only admitted the evidence
but made considerable reference to it in his charge, evidently being of the
opinion that it was admissible to show the state of mind of the appellant
Hutchison. Limerick J.A., in giving reasons for the Appeal Division, said:

Some of these errors on the part of the
trial Judge would not by themselves be of sufficient weight to prejudice the
jury or result in a miscarriage of justice. The last mentioned error was
however extremely prejudicial. We must however, consider the cumulative effect
of all the errors and against that, the weight of the evidence against the
Appellant.

As will be seen from the statement of facts
aforesaid, it was the theory of the Crown that these two accused had formed the
intention of kidnapping a member of the Stein family, probably the father Cy
Stein, but as the events occurred, they did kidnap the young son Raymond Stein,
that they demanded from the father a ransom, that that ransom was paid and that
as they left the place where they had received the payment they were followed
by the two deceased policemen Cpl. Bourgeois and Cst. O’Leary, that they, in
turn, captured these two officers and subsequently killed them. Upon this
theory, it was necessary for the Crown to adduce all possible evidence pointing
toward the occurrence of the various events. Limerick J.A., in his reasons,
after referring to the evidence of the fourteen-year-old kidnapped victim
Raymond Stein, referred to

[Page 727]

forty-six items of circumstantial evidence
indicative of the guilt of the two accused. One of these only was stated by the
Crown counsel in this Court to have been in error. Limerick J.A. then
continued:

In my opinion the massive weight of the
circumstantial evidence against Hutchison and his co-accused Ambrose is so
overwhelming that no reasonable jury properly instructed and acting judicially
could have come to any conclusion other than that both of the accused were
guilty of the murders of the two police officers as charged in the indictment,
notwithstanding the cumulative effect of the five errors referred to above.

In applying that test, Limerick J.A. followed
the decision of this Court in Colpitts v. R.[2] There, I said (at p. 755):

Therefore, this Court must apply the test
set out in the aforesaid cases and, to quote again from Brooks v. The King,
[1927] S.C.R. 633, [1928] 1 D.L.R. 268:

The onus is upon the Crown to satisfy the
Court that the jury, charged as it should have been, could not, as reasonable
men, have done otherwise than find the appellant guilty.

That test may be considered to be somewhat more
stringent than those enunciated by the then Chief Justice Cartwright and by
Ritchie J. but Limerick J.A. chose to apply the sterner test and was of the
opinion that even on that basis the jury could not have come to any conclusion
other than that both of the accused were guilty of the murder of the two
policemen as charged. Despite the able argument of counsel for the appellants,
I am unable to find any fault in that conclusion.

Counsel for the Crown in this Court cited six
other pieces of evidence which also indicated the guilt of the accused of the
offence with which they were charged. Some of those are of slight probative
value but others add considerable weight.

In addition, this Court is, of course, as was
the Appeal Division, entitled to take cognisance of the

[Page 728]

fact that despite this mass of circumstantial
evidence pointing well nigh irrefutably to the guilt of the accused neither of
the accused offered any evidence in defence. I need not cite authority for the
proposition that such a circumstance is a proper one for an Appellate Court to
consider. Therefore, Limerick J.A. came to the conclusion that the Appeal
Division was entitled to apply the provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  and found that there had been no substantial wrong
or miscarriage of justice. I am in complete agreement with that view.

I would, therefore, dismiss both appeals and
affirm the conviction of both of the appellants.

Appeals dismissed, convictions at trial affirmed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Non-capital
murder—Duress—Threat of death or of grievous bodily harm—“A party to the
offence”—“Intention in common”—Aiding and abetting under duress—Defence of
duress open to accused—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 7(3), 17,
21(2).

During the course of a robbery committed by
Simard and Clermont an innocent bystander was killed by a rifle shot fired by
Simard. When jointly charged, together with appellant, with non-capital murder,
both Simard and Clermont pleaded guilty. Appellant was not present at the
robbery or at the shooting but was charged under s. 21(2)  of the Criminal
Code  as an accomplice. Appellant did not testify at trial but relied on
statements made to the police and to his girl friend the day after the robbery
to support his argument that he had no intention in common with Simard and
Clermont to carry out the robbery. The trial judge charged the jury that if
they accepted that appellant had joined the common plot to rob under threats of
death or grievous bodily harm they should find appellant to be not guilty.
Appellant was acquitted. While the subsequent appeal by the Crown was allowed
the Court of Appeal made it clear that the appeal would have been dismissed but
for Dunbar v. The King (1936), 67 C.C.C. 20, 4 D.L.R. 737.

Held. The
appeal should be allowed.

The application of s. 17  of the Criminal
Code  is limited to cases in which the person seeking to rely on it has
himself committed an offence. Appellant did not himself commit the offence of
robbery or of murder and could only be considered a party to the murder on the
basis of s. 21(2)  which only applies if it is established that the appellant,
in common with Simard and Clermont, formed an intention to commit robbery. As
s. 17 was inapplicable appellant was entitled by virtue of s. 7(3)  to rely on
any excuse or defence available to him at common law. A person whose actions
have been dictated by fear of death or of grievous bodily injury cannot be said
to have formed a genuine common intention to

[Page 190]

carry out an unlawful purpose with the person
who has threatened him.

Although Dunbar v. The King, supra, could be
distinguished on its facts it should not be followed as it was based on the
proposition with which the Court is not in agreement, that on a charge of
murder founded on what is now s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code  duress does
not negative the intention of an accused to carry out an unlawful purpose in
common with others.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario allowing an appeal
from an acquittal by Houlden J. and jury of an accused on a charge of
non-capital murder founded on s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code . Appeal
allowed.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—The facts which give rise to this
appeal are as follows:

During the course of a robbery at the Pop
Shoppe, in the City of Ottawa,
on March 18, 1973, an innocent bystander was killed by a bullet from a rifle
fired by one Simard. The robbery was committed by Simard and one Clermont, both
of whom, together with the appellant, were jointly charged with non-capital
murder. Simard and Clermont pleaded guilty to this charge.

The appellant was not present when the robbery
was committed or when the shooting occurred. The charge against him was founded
upon s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code . Section 21  provides as follows:

21. (1) Every one is a party to an offence
who

(a) actually commits it,

(b) does or omits to do
anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it, or

(c) abets any person in committing
it.

[Page 191]

(2) Where two or more persons form an
intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other
therein and any one of them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits an
offence, each of them who knew or ought to have known that the commission of
the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose
is a party to that offence.

The appellant made a statement to the police,
which was admitted in evidence at the trial and which described his involvement
in the matter as follows: On the day of the robbery Clermont telephoned the
appellant for a ride as his own car was broken. Clermont asked the appellant
where he used to work and was told at the Pop Shoppe. Clermont told him to
drive to the Pop Shoppe because Clermont wanted to rob it, and, when the
appellant refused, Clermont pulled his gun and threatened to kill him. Simard
was picked up later and also a rifle. The appellant drove them to the Pop
Shoppe. The appellant had been threatened with revenge if he did not wait for
Clermont and Simard. The appellant, in his statement, stated he was afraid and
drove around the block. After the robbery and homicide Clermont and Simard
attempted twice, unsuccessfully, to get into the appellant’s car. Three of the
Crown’s witnesses supported this latter statement.

The appellant did not testify at trial but
relied on the above statement and two other statements also introduced at the
trial by the Crown to support his argument that he had no intention in common
with Simard and Clermont to carry out the robbery; i.e.:

(1) An oral statement to a police officer on his
arrest that he had been threatened with death “is he squealed”;

(2) The written statement to the police outlined
above in which he stated that he had only participated in the robbery by
driving because he was threatened with death;

(3) A statement to his girl friend the day after
the robbery that he was forced to do it.

The trial judge charged the jury as follows:

[Page 192]

Now, the defence are asserting that
Paquette participated in this robbery because he was compelled to do so, and in
that connection I charge you that if Paquette joined in the common plot to rob
the Pop Shoppe under threats of death or grievous bodily harm, that would
negative his having a common intention with Simard to rob the Pop Shoppe, and
you must find Paquette not guilty.

The appellant was acquitted. The Crown appealed
to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The reasons delivered by that Court make it clear that the appeal
would have been dismissed had it not been for the decision of this Court in Dunbar v. The King[1].

The relevant portions of the majority judgment
in that case are as follows:

On January 15, 1936, three men entered and
robbed a branch of the Canadian Bank of Commerce in Vancouver and in the course of the robbery the teller was fatally shot. The
appellant Dunbar was not among
those who entered the bank but he had brought the robbers to the bank in an
automobile and after the robbery was over drove back for them and took them
away to the house where they had all been living together. He subsequently
shared with them in the proceeds of the robbery. He had a criminal record, had
met one or other of the robbers in the penitentiary and had been living with
them in the same house for some days prior to the robbery. He knew when driving
the car to the bank that his associates were going there with the purpose of
robbing the bank, that these men were armed and that in the course of such
robbery it was not improbable that someone might be killed. His sole excuse for
his conduct was that he had acted under compulsion as one of his associates had
threatened his life unless he accompanied them and had further threatened that
if he did anything to betray them that he would be killed. The point of alleged
misdirection most stressed by counsel for the prisoner before us was a
statement as follows:—

“If you accept Dunbar’s evidence that he
was so bereft of reason that his reasoning faculties were suspended and that he
was really in the position of having his hand held by somebody, that he has two
men standing over him—you had this story of the thing put to you in the way
that he would have you believe—well, then it seems to me there should be some
evidence to show his mental condition.”

[Page 193]

Section 20 (now s. 17) of the Criminal
Code , dealing with compulsion, excludes murder and robbery and therefore is
inapplicable to this case, but it was argued that if compulsion were shown it
might be sufficient to negative any common intention under the provision of s.
69(2)  (now s. 21(2) ) of the Code. It seems to me that this argument fails to
recognize the distinction between intention and the motive giving rise to
intention.

If Dunbar’s story of the threat to him was
true then he was faced with a choice between endangering his own life or assisting
those about to commit a robbery which might, as he knew, be accompanied by
murder of an innocent person. The motive giving rise to his choice between
these two courses is irrelevant. This being so, in my opinion the issue was not
unfairly put before the jury in the learned trial Judge’s charge. I would,
therefore, dismiss the appeal.

Counsel for the Crown submits that the
principles of law applicable to the excuse or defence of duress or compulsion
are exhaustively codified in s. 17  of the Criminal Code , and that the
appellant is precluded from relying upon this provision because of the
exception contained at the end of it. Section 17  provides:

17. A person
who commits an offence under compulsion by threats of immediate death or
grievous bodily harm from a person who is present when the offence is committed
is excused for committing the offence if he believes that the threats will be
carried out and if he is not a party to a conspiracy or association whereby he
is subject to compulsion, but this section does not apply where the
offence that is committed is treason, murder, piracy, attempted murder,
assisting in rape, forcible abduction, robbery, causing bodily harm or arson.

In my opinion the application of s. 17  is
limited to cases in which the person seeking to rely upon it has himself
committed an offence. If a person who actually commits the offence does so in
the presence of another party who has compelled him to do the act by threats of
immediate death or grievous bodily harm, then, if he believes the threats would
be carried out, and is not a party to a conspiracy whereby he is subject to
such compulsion, he is excused for committing the offence. The protection
afforded by this section is not given in respect

[Page 194]

of the offences listed at the end of the
section, which include murder and robbery.

The section uses the specific words “a
person who commits an offence”. It does not use the words “a person who is a
party to an offence.” This is significant in the light of the wording of s.
21(1) which, in para. (a), makes a person a party to an offence
who “actually commits it”. Paragraphs (b) and (c) deal
with a person who aids or abets a person committing the offence. In my opinion
s. 17  codifies the law as to duress as an excuse for the actual commission of a
crime, but it does not, by its terms, go beyond that. R. v. Carker[2], in which reference was made to s.
17  having codified the defence or excuse of duress, dealt with a situation in
which the accused had actually committed the offence.

The appellant, in the present case, did not
himself commit the offence of robbery or of murder. He was not present when the
murder occurred, as was the case in R. v. Farduto[3], and R. v. Warren[4], to which counsel for the Crown
referred. In the former case the accused provided the razor with which the
murderer cut the throat of the victim in his presence. The Court was of the
view that the trial judge could conclude that there was no case of such
compulsion as would constitute an excuse. In the latter case the accused, the
brother of the actual murderer was present with him over a period of time after
the robbery occurred and before the deceased was killed in his presence. The
report does not indicate the nature of the compulsion alleged. The emphasis
appears to have been on the subnormal intelligence of the accused making him
willing to go along with what was suggested to him.

The appellant could only be considered to be a
party to the murder on the basis of the application of s. 21(2) .
Section 21(1) is not applicable because the offence to which he is alleged
to be a party is murder, and it is clear that he did not commit murder, nor did
he aid or abet in its commission.

[Page 195]

Subsection (2) is only applicable if it is
established that the appellant, in common with Simard and Clermont, formed an
intention to commit robbery. The question in issue is as to whether the trial
judge erred in law in telling the jury that if the appellant joined in the plot
to rob under threats of death or of grievous bodily harm, this would negative
such common intention.

I have already stated my reasons for considering
s. 17  to be inapplicable. That being so, the appellant is entitled, by virtue
of s. 7(3) of the Code, to rely upon any excuse or defence available to
him at common law. The defence of duress to a charge of murder against a person
who did not commit the murder, but who was alleged to have aided and abetted,
was recently considered by the House of Lords in Director of Public
Prosecutions for Northern Ireland v. Lynch[5],
in which the decided cases were fully reviewed. The facts in that case were
as follows:

The defendant drove a motor car containing
a group of the I.R.A. in Northern Ireland on an expedition in which they shot and killed a police officer. On
his trial for aiding and abetting the murder there was evidence that he was not
a member of the I.R.A. and that he acted unwillingly under the orders of the
leader of the group, being convinced that, if he disobeyed, he would himself be
shot. The trial judge held that the defence of duress was not available to him
and the jury found him guilty. The Court of Criminal Appeal in Northern Ireland upheld the conviction.

The House of Lords, by a 3 to 2 majority, held that on a charge of murder
the defence of duress was open to a person accused as a principal in the second
degree (aider and abettor) and ordered a new trial.

The conclusion of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest is
stated at p. 677, as follows:

Having regard to the authorities to which I
have referred it seems to me to have been firmly held by our courts in this
country that duress can afford a defence in criminal cases. A recent
pronouncement was that in the

[Page 196]

Court of Appeal in 1971 in the case above
referred to (Reg. v. Hudson, [1971] 2 Q.B. 202). The court
stated that they had been referred to a large number of authorities and to the
views of writers of textbooks. In the judgment of the court delivered by Lord
Parker C.J. and prepared by Widgery L.J. the conclusion was expressed, at p.
206, that

“…it is clearly established that duress
provides a defence in all offences including perjury (except possibly treason
or murder as a principal).”

We are only concerned in this case to say
whether duress could be a possible defence open to Lynch who was charged with
being an aider and abettor. Relying on the help given in the authorities we
must decide this as a matter of principle. I consider that duress in such a
case can be open as a possible defence. Both general reasoning and the
requirements of justice lead me to this conclusion.

Lord Wilberforce, at p. 682, cited with approval
a passage from the dissenting reasons of Bray C.J., in R. v. Brown and
Morley[6] at
p. 494:

The reasoning generally used to support the
proposition that duress is no defence to a charge of murder is, to use the
words of Blackstone cited above, that “he ought rather to die himself, than
escape by the murder of an innocent.” Generally speaking I am prepared to
accept this proposition. Its force is obviously considerably less where the act
of the threatened man is not the direct act of killing but only the rendering
of some minor form of assistance, particularly when it is by no means certain
that if he refuses the death of the victim will be averted, or conversely when
it is by no means certain that if he complies the death will be a necessary
consequence. It would seem hard, for example, if an innocent passer-by seized
in the street by a gang of criminals visibly engaged in robbery and murder in a
shop and compelled at the point of a gun to issue misleading comments to the
public, or an innocent driver compelled at the point of a gun to convey the
murderer to the victim, were to have no defence. Are there any authorities
which compel us to hold that he would not?

I am in agreement with the conclusion reached by
the majority that it was open to Lynch, in the circumstances of that case, to
rely on the defence of duress, which had not been put to the jury. If

[Page 197]

the defence of duress can be available to a
person who has aided and abetted in the commission of murder, then clearly it
should be available to a person who is sought to be made a party to the offence
by virtue of s. 21(2) . A person whose actions have been dictated by fear of
death or of grievous bodily injury cannot be said to have formed a genuine
common intention to carry out an unlawful purpose with the person who has
threatened him with those consequences if he fails to co-operate.

The Dunbar case could be distinguished
from the present case on its facts. The accused, in that case, had been living
with the persons who committed the robbery in which the shooting occurred. He
drove them to and from the scene of the crime and shared with them in the
proceeds of the robbery. However, the decision is based upon the proposition
that on a charge of murder founded on the operation of what is now s. 21(2) of
the Code, duress does not negative the intention of the accused to carry
out an unlawful purpose in common with others, but only relates to his motive
for joining in that common purpose, which is irrelevant to the issue of his
guilt. I am not in agreement with this view and I am of the opinion that it
should not be followed.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal, and restore the verdict of acquittal.

Appeal allowed, verdict of acquittal
restored.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law — Murder of policeman while acting in course of
his duties — Mandatory sentence of death — Death penalty not cruel and unusual
punishment within meaning of s. 2(b) of Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.),
c. 44 — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 214(2), 218(1) (am. 1973, c.
38) — Criminal Law Amendment Act (No. 2), 1974-75-76, c. 105.

On a joint charge of unlawfully committing
""murder punishable by death"" in the killing of a policeman while
acting in the course of his duties, the two appellants were convicted at trial
and sentenced to death pursuant to ss. 214(2)  and 218(1)  of the Criminal
Code . On appeal, the majority of the Court of Appeal held, inter alia, that
the death penalty was not cruel and unusual punishment within the meaning of s.
2(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights and that, accordingly, ss. 214(2)
and 218(1) of the Code were not inoperative by virtue of the application
of the said s. 2(b) of the Bill of Rights. Following the hearing of the
appeals to this Court, the Criminal Law Amendment Act (No. 2), 1976, was
enacted, whereby, inter alia, the death penalty provisions of the Criminal
Code  were repealed. Section 25(2)  provides that if ""after the coming
into force of this Act, an appeal against conviction by a person under a
sentence of death upon the coming into force of this Act for murder punishable
by death is dismissed, that sentence thereupon becomes a sentence of
imprisonment for life for first degree murder without eligibility for parole
until he has served twenty-five years of his sen­tence."" The Act came into
force on July 26, 1976.

Held: The appeals should be dismissed.

Per Curiam: Notwithstanding the provisions of
the 1976 Act, the question as to whether the death penalty in this case
constituted cruel and unusual punishment remained of more than academic
importance. If s. 2(b) of the Bill of Rights had already had the effect
of rendering ss. 214 and 218 inoperative, then these appellants

[Page 681]

could not have been found guilty of ""murder
punishable by death"" and, as the law then stood, the only sentence which
could have been imposed would have been one of imprisonment for life under s.
214(3). The question therefore became one of first importance to the appellants
because if these appeals were to be allowed rather than dismissed, and if the
convictions ""for murder punishable by death"" were to be quashed,
there would be no provision rendering either of the appellants ineligible ""for
parole until he had served twenty-five years of his sentence"". Whether or
not the appellants were to be denied parole for the first twenty-five years of
their sentences therefore depended upon whether or not ss. ,214 and 218 of the Code
were rendered inoperative by s. 2(b) of the Bill of
Rights.

Per Laskin C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ.:
Section 5(2) of the Canadian Bill of Rights provides for its
application to federal law, whether enacted before or after the effective date
of the Bill of Rights. What is more, the Bill of Rights cannot be
governed in its interpretation and application by the course of parlia­mentary
legislation, especially post-Canadian Bill of Rights legislation.
It is rather that the legislation of Parliament falls to be tested as to its
operative effect by what the Bill of Rights prescribes; otherwise, the Bill
of Rights becomes merely an interpretation statute, yield­ing to a contrary
intention in legislation measured against it.

It is s. 2 of the Bill of Rights which
gives force to s. 1 and hence, especially since the prescriptions of s. 2 are
stated to be effective ""in particular"", their import should not be
diminished by reference to what is more generally prescribed in s. 1. Section
2(b), therefore, must be considered in its own terms as providing that ""no
law of Canada should be construed or applied so as to impose or authorize the
imposition of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment"".

Although the words of s. 2(b) have
application to methods of punishment, whether the punishement be death or not,
they cannot reasonably be limited to methods. It would be patent, for example,
that death as a mandatory penalty today for theft would be offensive to s.
2(b). That is because there are social and moral considerations that enter into
the scope and application of s. 2(b). Harshness of punishment and its severity
in consequences are relative to the offence involved but, that being said,
there may still be a question whether the punishment prescribed is so excessive
as to outrage standards of decency.

The words ""cruel and unusual"" should not be
treated as conjunctive in the sense of requiring a rigidly separate assessment
of each word, each of whose meanings must

[Page 682]

be met before they become effective against
challenged legislation, but rather as interacting expressions colour­ing each
other, so to speak, and hence to be considered together as a compendious
expression of a norm.

The four grounds of challenge to the death penalty
offered by the appellants were respectively, that (1) it is unusually severe
and hence degrading to human dignity and worth; (2) it is arbitrarily imposed;
(3) it is not acceptable to a large segment of the population and (4) it is
excessive in that it cannot be shown that it has had any deterrent effect on
murder that would not be real­ized by a punishment that was not so final.
Grounds (2) and (3) were completely without merit, and grounds (1) and (4) must
also be rejected. The mandatory death penalty for the murder of a policeman or
a prison guard is not cruel and unusual punishment within s. 2(b) of the
Canadian Bill of Rights.

Per Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon and de Grandpré
JJ.: The effect of s. 2(b) of the Bill of Rights must be
considered in the light of s. 1. The declaration of the right of the individual
not to be deprived of life which is contained in s. 1(a) is clearly qualified
by the words ""except by due process of law"", which appear to
contemplate a process whereby an individual may be deprived of life. At
the time when the Bill of Rights was enacted there did not exist and had
never existed in Canada the right not to be deprived of life in the case of an
individual who had been convicted of ""murder pun­ishable by death"" by
the duly recorded verdict of a properly instructed jury; the ""existing
right"" guaranteed by s. 1(a) can only relate to individuals who have not
undergone the process of such a trial and conviction.

Accepting the proposition that s. 2 did not
create new rights, it cannot be that Parliament intended to create anew the
absolute right not to be deprived of life under any circumstances by providing
that no law of Canada was to be applied so as ""to impose or authorize the
imposition of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment"". If so construed
the section would prevent the infringement of a right which had never existed
and would thus run contrary to the purpose for which it was enacted.

The fact that Parliament has on three occasions since
the enactment of the Bill of Rights seen fit to retain the death penalty
as part of the Criminal Code constitutes strong evidence that it had
never intended that the word ""punishment"" as employed in s. 2 (b) should
preclude punishment by death in the case of an individual who has been duly
convicted of murder. If it were otherwise

[Page 683]

it would mean in light of s. 5(2) that the provisions
for punishment by death contained in the amendments had been rendered
inoperative in advance of their enactment. That proposition could not be
accepted.

Accordingly, the ""cruel and unusual treatment
or punishment"" referred to in s. 2(b) of the Bill of Rights does
not include punishment by death for murder and it was neither the intention nor
the effect of that section to render inoperative the death penalty provisions
of the Criminal Code .

The words ""cruel and unusual"" as they are
employed in s. 2(b) are to be read conjunctively and refer to ""treatment
or punishment"" which is both cruel and unusual. The death penalty for
murder cannot be said to be unusual punishment in the ordinary accepted mean­ing
of that word.

Per Beetz J.: It was unnecessary, for the
purpose of this case, to decide whether or not s. 2 of the Bill of Rights creates
new rights or is subordinate to s. 1. However, as stated by Ritchie J., s. 1
throws some light on s. 2, and the words ""cruel and unusual"" in s.
2(b) are to be read conjunctively and refer to ""treatment or
punishment"" which is both cruel and unusual and pun­ishment by death for
murder is not contrary to s. 2(b).

APPEALS from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia[1],
dismissing the appeals of the appellants from their conviction on a joint
charge of unlawfully committing ""murder punishable by death"". Appeals
dismissed.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ. was
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This Court is confronted for the first time
with a contention that the death penalty, mandatorily imposed in this case on
the two appellants upon their conviction of the murder of a policeman, is cruel
and unusual punishment within s, 2 (b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights
and that, consequently, s. 218 (1)  of the Criminal Code , which
prescribes that punishment, must yield to the overriding provisions of s. 2 
(b). If the appellants should succeed in their contention, the result would be
that capital murder, that is murder for which the punishment is death, could
not be retained or included as part of Canadian criminal law so long as s. 2 (b)
of the Canadian Bill of Rights was applicable; and we would and
could have only non-capital murder, punishable now by life imprisonment as a
mandatory penalty.

It is mere coincidence that on the very day on which the hearing
of this appeal commenced the House of Commons gave second reading to a bill to
abolish capital punishment. The bill was subse­quently passed into law; and
although the result is that the two accused, if their convictions are upheld by
the rejection of all grounds of appeal urged against them, will not be liable
to execution,

[Page 685]

that does not foreclose this Court from considering the question
whether the Canadian Bill of Rights precludes the operation of federal
legislation making it mandatory to sentence to death a person or persons
convicted of killing policemen or prison guards acting in the course of their
duties, as provided by ss. 214 (2) and 218 (1) of the Crimi­nal Code, provisions
which have now been superseded by amending legislation. I have nothing to add
to what my brother Ritchie has said about the effect of the abolition
legislation on the posi­tion of the two appellants.

We are not concerned here with the method of execution, which in
this country has been by hang­ing, no argument having been addressed to it; nor
are we concerned directly with whether the sen­tences herein would have been
carried out or would have been commuted, as have other death sentences for more
than the past decade. The issue is whether federal legislation may authorize
the imposition of the penalty of death for the murder of policemen or prison
guards in the face of the proscription of the Canadian Bill of Rights against
""the imposition of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment"". It is
patent to me that if such a penalty cannot properly be authorized and imposed
(that is, in the absence of a parliamentary declaration in avoidance of the
application of the Canadian Bill of Rights) for the murder of policemen
and prison guards, I am unable to appreciate how it can be authorized and
imposed in respect of the murder of anyone else, whatever the status or
position of that person.

I have had the advantage of seeing the reasons prepared by my
brother Ritchie in which he takes a view of s. 1 of the Canadian Bill of
Rights that subordinates s. 2 to that opening declaratory sec­tion, with
the result (having regard to the provi­sions enacted by Parliament touching
culpable homicide since the enactment of the Canadian Bill of Rights in
1960) that he finds that the word ""punishment"" could not have been
intended to exclude the penalty of death for murder.

My approach is different, although I come to the same conclusion
as does my brother Ritchie that it is not offensive to s. 2 (b) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights to prescribe the death penalty as a

[Page 686]

punishment to be mandatorily imposed for the murder of a
policeman or prison guard.

Section 5(2) of the Canadian Bill of Rights provides for
its application to federal law, whether enacted before or after the effective
date of the Canadian Bill of Rights, and this Court has acted on this
provision to test the operative effect of federal legislation in the face of
the Canadian Bill of Rights although enacted subsequent to it: see, for
example, Brownridge v. The Queen[2]; and
cf. Curr v. The Queen[3], at
p. 893. What is more, it seems to me that the Canadian Bill of Rights cannot
be governed in its interpretation and application by the course of
parliamentary legisla­tion, especially post-Canadian Bill of Rights legis­lation.
It is rather that the legislation of Parlia­ment falls to be tested as to its
operative effect by what the Canadian Bill of Rights prescribes;
otherwise, the Canadian Bill of Rights becomes merely an interpretation
statute, yielding to a con­trary intention in legislation measured against it.
This Court rejected such an approach in its majority judgment in the Drybones[4]
case, and it reaffirmed its rejection of that approach in both the majority
and minority judgments in Hogan v. The Queen[5].

Although this moves the problem of the applica­tion of the Canadian
Bill of Rights to a common plane, it by no means determines the scope of
its application, nor its force in particular cases. Such decisions of this
Court as Attorney-General of Canada v. Lavell[6]; R.
v. Burnshine[7], and
Attor­ney-General of Canada v. Canard[8], show
this in no uncertain fashion.

I take the same view here as I expressed in the majority judgment
of this Court in Curr v. The Queen[9], at
p. 896, that is, that it is s. 2 of the Canadian Bill of Rights which
gives force to s. 1

[Page 687]

and hence, especially since the prescriptions of s. 2 are stated
to be effective ""in particular"", I would not diminish their import by
reference to what is more generally prescribed in s. 1. I turn, therefore, to a
consideration of s. 2 (b) in its own terms as providing that ""no
law of Canada shall be con­strued or applied so as to impose or authorize the
imposition of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment"".

In the original draft bill, introduced in 1958 and superseded by
a revised draft in 1960 (after being left for public examination for more than
a year), the forerunner of s. 2(b) was a reproduction of s. 4(2) of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights which forbids ""the imposition of torture,
or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment"". A similar
provision was found in the consti­tution of Southern Rhodesia of 1961 and was
the subject of consideration by the Privy Council in Runyowa v. Reginam[10],
on appeal from a judg­ment of the Federal Supreme Court of the then Federation
of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The Privy Council was of the opinion that the
formulation in the then Southern Rhodesian Constitution was manifestly
different from the ""cruel and unusual punishment"" provisions of the
American Constitu­tion and that, accordingly, American decisions, to which the
Privy Council was referred, although helpful, were not directly enough in point
in respect of the different conceptions involved in the Southern Rhodesian
provisions.

In the particular case, the Judicial Committee, affirming the
Federal Supreme Court, concluded that the mandatory death penalty imposed upon
a person convicted of complicity in arson did not offend the Constitution,
having regard particularly to a qualifying provision that ""nothing ...
done under the authority of any written law shall be held to be ... in
contravention of this section [forbidding torture or inhuman or degrading pun­ishment
or other treatment] to the extent that the law in question authorizes the doing
of anything by way of punishment or other treatment which might lawfully have
been so done in Southern Rhodesia immediately before the appointed day"".
It is obvious that this decision, having regard to its

[Page 688]

foundation, can be of no assistance in the present case.

In its present formulation, s. 2(b) is in the language of the English
Bill of Rights of 1688 and of the eighth amendment to the American Consti­tution.
Although the words have application to methods of punishment, whether the punishment
be death or not, and there are indications that this was what they were aimed
at when originally adopted in England and in the United States, they cannot
reasonably be limited to methods, which at one time in history included
decapitation, disem­bowelling and drawing and quartering. It would be patent to
me, for example, that death as a mandatory penalty today for theft would be
offensive to s. 2(b). That is because there are social and moral
considerations that enter into the scope and application of s. 2(b). Harshness
of punishment and its severity in consequences are relative to the offence
involved but, that being said, there may still be a question (to which history
too may be called in aid of its resolution) whether the punishment prescribed
is so excessive as to outrage stand­ards of decency. This is not a precise
formula for s. 2(b), but I doubt whether a more precise one can be found.

Two main submissions were made by the appel­lants and by the intervenor
Canadian Civil Liberties Association on the proper approach to the words
""cruel and unusual punishment"". They supported the view expressed by
McIntyre J.A. in dissent that the words should be treated disjunc­tively, a
construction which would strengthen their sterilizing effect upon s. 218(1)  and
allied provi­sions of the Criminal Code . However, in the course of the
oral argument, counsel for the appellants stated that they would not insist on
a disjunctive interpretation, in effect abandoning that point.

McIntyre J.A., in stating that the words should be given a
disjunctive meaning, invoked American judicial decisions and academic writings
on those decisions to support that view. Robertson J.A., who spoke for the
other four members of the five judge Court assumed for the sake of argument
(as he said) that hanging is cruel punishment, and then proceeded to consider
whether death as punishment

[Page 689]

for murder was ""unusual"". He concluded, having regard
to the fact that death was the punishment for murder in England from time
immemorial and that it was known in Canada before Confederation and had been
continuously prescribed since then, that it could not be con­sidered
""unusual"" within s. 2(b), notwithstanding the consistent practice of
commutation by the federal Cabinet since 1962. It is clear that Robertson J.A.
looked upon the key words of s. 2(b) as being conjunctive. Earlier in
his reasons on the effect of the Canadian Bill of Rights he concluded
that because of differences in methods of interpre­tation and in permissible
resort to extrinsic ma­terial in the construction of the American Consti­tution
and of the Canadian statutory Bill of Rights, he did not find American
decisions relevant.

At the time that he wrote, the leading American decision was Furman
v. Georgia[11], and
indeed this was still the leading decision at the time that this Court heard
the present appeal. Shortly after the hearing, a number of other judgments on
the question of the compatibility of the death penalty with the eighth (and
through it with the four­teenth) amendment were handed down by the Supreme
Court of the United States, among them Gregg v. Georgia[12]
and Woodson and Waxton v. North Carolina[13].
There were three companion cases to these two, of which I would mention Jurek
v. Texas[14] and
Roberts v. Louisiana[15],
principally because of the dissenting reasons of White J. in this
last-mentioned case.

The various judgments in the Supreme Court of the United States,
which I would not discount as being irrelevant here, do lend support to the
view that ""cruel and unusual"" are not treated there as conjunctive in
the sense of requiring a rigidly separate assessment of each word, each of
whose meanings must be met before they become effec­tive against challenged
legislation, but rather as

[Page 690]

interacting expressions colouring each other, so to speak, and
hence to be considered together as a compendious expression of a norm. I think
this to be a reasonable appraisal, in line with the duty of the Court not to
whittle down the protections of the Canadian Bill of Rights by a narrow construc­tion
of what is a quasi-constitutional document.

Since we are concerned here with a situation where the death
penalty is mandatory, I need not embark on any consideration of questions of
uneven application of authorized punishments or questions of discretionary,
arbitrary or capricious application of the death penalty. It cannot be argued
that arbitrariness or capriciousness resides in the limitation of the death
penalty to the murder of policemen and prison guards, persons who are specially
entrusted with the enforcement of the criminal law and with the custody and
supervision of convicted persons. The progressive restriction of the situations
in which the death penalty could be imposed in this country (prior to its
recent abolition for civil as opposed to military offences, with which we are
not here concerned), does not point to an erratic imposition when it was
mandatory in the narrow classes of cases for which it was authorized.

In Furman v. Georgia, only two members of the Supreme
Court of the United States, Brennan and Marshall JJ., were of the opinion that
the death penalty was per se unconstitutional, and they adhered to this
view in the two recent cases of Gregg v. Georgia and Woodson and Waxton
v. North Carolina. The other three members of the Court, who with Justices
Brennan and Marshall formed the majority in the five to four Furman decision,
based themselves on the view that there was a broad discretion given to the
jury as the sentencing tribunal to impose the death penalty or not for several
crimes (which varied as among different states), and this discretion, not
clearly guided by legislative direction, resulted in discriminatory and wanton
and even freakish sentenc­ing which was, moreover, so infrequent in relation to
the number of cases in which it could have been

[Page 691]

imposed as to make any particular death sentence cruel and
unusual.

I pause here to draw attention to two important differences,
relevant in this case, between Canadi­an and American criminal law. First,
there is one Criminal Code  for the whole of Canada; the crimi­nal law is
within exclusive federal jurisdiction, unlike the case in the United States
where it is, in general, within state jurisdiction and hence varies from state
to state. Second, there is no provision in Canadian criminal law for sentencing
by juries. It appears to me that the reproach of arbitrariness and
capriciousness in sentencing, which was con­sidered in the Furman case,
embraced also an issue of equality before the law when related to the alleged
randomness of jury practices in dealing with the death penalty. Even so, four
members of the Court in the Furman case were of the opinion that the
death penalty was not cruel and unusual punishment, although wide discretionary
authority was vested in juries to impose it.

In its recent judgment. in Gregg v. Georgia, the Supreme
Court of the United States not only dealt with the question whether the death
penalty is per se unconstitutional, and determined, with only Jus­tices
Brennan and Marshall dissenting on this point, that it was not, but it also
dealt with the validity of new Georgia legislation designed to overcome the
infirmities that were present in the legislation reviewed in the Furman case.
On this point too the Court was of opinion, the two dis­sents being a
fortiori on the matter, that Georgia's new scheme had adequate standards
for the jury as sentencing tribunal, especially when its determina­tions were
subject to scrutiny and review by the Georgia Supreme Court as to whether, inter
alla, a death sentence was excessive or disproportionate as compared with
the disposition of similar cases, having regard to the crime and to the
accused.

It was on the per se position of Justice Brennan that the
appellants in the present case particularly relied and, no doubt, they would
have invoked the majority judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States in
Woodson and Waxton v. North Carolina

[Page 692]

had it been delivered at the time of their submissions to this
Court. I turn, therefore, first to the contentions based on Justice Brennan's
views, and I shall deal thereafter with the Woodson and Waxton case.

The per se argument must, it seems to me, have in view the
imposition of the death penalty for the most heinous of offences, and murder is
certainly of that class; the per se contention is of little validity
when addressed to, say, simple assault, because other considerations come into
play in such a case in determining whether the death sentence would be cruel
and unusual punishment. Approaching the issue on this basis, I note that four
grounds of challenge to the death penalty are offered by the appellants and
they are, respective­ly, that (1) the death penalty is unusually severe and
hence degrading to human dignity and worth; (2) it is arbitrarily imposed; (3)
it is not acceptable to a large segment of the population and (4) it is
excessive in that it cannot be shown that it has had any deterrent effect on
murder that would not be realized by a punishment that was not so final.

The contention of arbitrary imposition seems odd in a Canadian
context when imposition of the penalty is mandatory for capital murder as
hereto—fore defined. I do not, moreover, see any arbitrari­ness in imposition
by reason of Cabinet review to determine whether to exercise the prerogative of
mercy, a review which relates to the individual case, although there has been a
consistent policy of commutation since 1962. Again, the contention of
unacceptability to a large segment of the Canadian population appears to me to
be asking this Court to define and apply s. 2(b) by a statistical
measure of approval or disapproval of the death penalty. This is not what s. 2(b)
prescribes. In my opinion, grounds (2) and (3) are completely
without merit,

Ground (4), excessiveness, is posited on an as­sertion that the
death penalty must be cruel and unusual if it cannot be shown to be an
effective deterrent to the commission of the offence for

[Page 693]

which it is prescribed. The same issue is raised in a somewhat
different fashion by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association which contended
that the death penalty is not a ""fit"" penalty because the purposes of
punishment would be served equally well by lesser punishment; and if it is not
a fit penalty, that is some evidence that it is cruel and unusual. Indeed, so
the argument runs, such a conclusion is warranted by the severity of the
penalty and its affront to human dignity. This last assertion engages ground
(1) of the submission of the appellants, although it too is made separately by
the Canadian Civil. Liberties Association.

The contentions of severity and excessiveness advanced by the
appellants and by the intervenor were supported by them by drawing on the
reasons of Brennan J. in the Furman case who took as his guiding
principle that ""a punishment must not be so severe as to be degrading to
the dignity of human beings"" and, further, that the fundamental premise of
the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments is that
""even the vilest criminal remains a human being possessed of common human
dignity"". The appellants and the intervenor pointed to the preamble of the
Canadi­an Bill of Rights in its reference to ""the dignity and worth
of the human being"" as reflecting this same sentiment.

On the aforementioned principle, Justice Bren­nan propounded a
cumulative test, which repre­sented the arguments addressed to this Court by
the appellants and the intervenor, and it was in these words:

If a punishment is unusually severe, if there is a strong
probability that it is inflicted arbitrarily, if it is substan­tially rejected
by contemporary society, and if there is no reason to believe that it serves
any penal purpose more effectively than some less severe punishment, then the
continued infliction of that punishment violates the command of the Clause that
the State may not inflict inhuman and uncivilized punishments upon those con­victed
of crimes.

The appellants did not advance their submissions as being
necessarily cumulative, but I take from their contentions that if severity and
excessiveness (as they conceived them) were established, that

[Page 694]

should be enough to sustain their attack on the death penalty in
the present case. I am prepared to accept this premise, but I am unable to
agree that the conclusion that they urge is well-founded.

In a general sense, all punishment by way of imprisonment or
otherwise is degrading, but socie­ty cannot be expected to tolerate without
sanction breaches of the criminal law merely because pun­ishment degrades the
criminal. What we are con­cerned with here is not mere degradation by which
society expresses its reprobation of criminal behaviour but the extent of it,
related of course to the offence and at times to the offender. The enormity and
the irreversibility of a death penalty when carried out certainly bespeak its
undue sever­ity in the abstract, but the present case is con­cerned with
proportionality, with mandatory application of the death penalty not to an
entire range of the most heinous of offences, that is, murder, but to particular
and narrow instances of it specially selected by Parliament as meriting the
drastic penalty of death.

The fact that Parliament has, since the hearing of these appeals,
abolished the death penalty for any type of murder does not mean that this
Court must, ex post facto, conclude that the death penal­ty as
previously prescribed was ""cruel and unusual punishment"" so as to
render the previous prescrip­tion inoperative. In exercising the jurisdiction
over the operation and application of federal law, as committed to it under the
Canadian Bill of Rights, this Court may certainly consider the course of
parliamentary enactments and the state of the statute book as of the time when
it comes to a decision, but it would abdicate its function if it surrendered to
parliamentary policy without making an independent assessment of the
compatibility of a particular policy, reflected in a chal­lenged statute, with
the Canadian Bill of Rights, regardless of a subsequent change in that
policy by Parliament. Such a change, always open the Par­liament, does not
signal a previous abridgement of the Canadian Bill of Rights.

[Page 695]

The appellants and the intervenor would sub­sume the question of
proportionality under what to them was the larger issue of penal policy,
contend­ing in that connection that the purposes of punishment, conceived
generally as being for the protec­tion of society through prevention,
deterrence and reformation, would be equally well served by pro­viding for a
lesser punishment, such as life impris­onment. They submit data designed to
show that there is no convincing proof of general deterrence, so far as murder
is concerned, by reason of the imposition of capital punishment. I do not
(indeed it is impossible to) disagree with this contention, but it is based on
two premises, neither of which I find acceptable.

The first of these is that the issue of cruel and unusual
punishment in this case is to be resolved not only as a question of fact
respecting deter­rence, but that the burden of proof (or disproof) is on
Parliament. In my opinion, the data presented by the appellants and by the intervenor
cannot have been lost on Parliament when it first nar­rowed the situations in
which the death penalty for murder was mandatory and, more recently, abol­ished
the death penalty for all types of murder. That did not mean, however, that
Parliament acted on a firm basis of fact but rather that it considered the data
in arriving at a legislative judgment, a judgment which cannot be said to have
been limited by or to the factor of deterrence. Indeed, while I agree that
there is no convincing proof of general deterrence as submitted by the
appellants and the intervenor, it may equally be said, at least in respect of
the narrow situations with which we are concerned in this case, that there is
no convincing proof that deterrence has had no impact. The number of murders of
policemen and prison guards has been, fortunately, rela­tively small, and there
are no persuasive statistics for a conclusion one way or the other, certainly
not a conclusion that Parliament could not reasonably believe, when it limited
the mandatory death penalty to the murder of policemen and prison guards, that
there would be a deterrent effect. There is no question of any burden of proof
resting on Parliament, especially when dealing with a penalty that has been
known and imposed mandatorily

[Page 696]

over so long a period.

This brings me to the second unacceptable premise which appears
to be that deterrence should be the governing consideration in assessing the
mandatory death penalty under s.2(b), and that small regard, at the best,
should be paid to retribution or to the social outrage which may reasonably
find expression in a penal policy of a mandatory death penalty for the murder
of policemen and prison guards. It is not difficult to appreciate that the kind
of revulsion that an order­ly society may feel against murder, and especially
murder of policemen and prison guards, may express itself in a correspondingly
severe sanction that would be deemed inappropriate for less griev­ous offences.
In short, as was said by Justice Stewart in Gregg v. Georgia, ""the
decision that capital punishment may be the appropriate sanc­tion in extreme
cases is an expression of the com­munity's belief that certain crimes are
themselves so grievous an affront to humanity that the only adequate response
may be the penalty of death"" (44 U.S. LW at p. 5239).

It is certainly arguable that the mandatory death penalty,
considered as mere vengeance, should be regarded as cruel and unusual
punishment within s. 2(b), having regard to its enormity and its
irreversibility, its incompatibility with any aim of rehabilitation and its
physical and mental pain. I do not think, however, that it can be said that
Parliament, in limiting the mandatory death penalty to the murder of policemen
and prison guards, had only vengeance in view. There was obviously the
consideration that persons in such special positions would have a sense of
protection by reason of the grave penalty that would follow their murder and,
further, that the mandatory penalty would be, to some extent at least, a
deterrent as, for example, to a prison inmate already serving a life sentence
but tempted to escape even if this meant committing murder. It was open to
Parliament to act on these additional consider­ations in limiting the mandatory
death penalty as it did, and I am unable to say that they were not acted upon.
On this view, I cannot find that there

[Page 697]

was no social purpose served by the mandatory death penalty so as
to make it offensive to s. 2(b).

The appellants sought to strengthen their posi­tion by invoking
the public conscience or public morality as reflecting a revulsion against
capital punishment. No doubt, this is a strongly held position by an
undetermined section of the public so far as the death penalty in general is
concerned but the issue is not so free of debate as to enable me to say that
the moral position is clear. Indeed, I can, I believe, properly take judicial
notice of the fact that there is a substantial opinion that the imposition of
the death penalty for the murder of policemen or prison guards is neither
shocking nor abhorrent. This is adequate ground for being wary about
interfering with a legislative policy that prescribes the death penalty in such
cases.

I wish, finally, to say a word about the recent Woodson and Waxton
case. There the Supreme Court of the United States, by a bare majority, set
aside mandatory death penalties imposed upon the petitioners under North
Carolina law when they were found guilty of first-degree murder by reason of a
killing in the course of a robbery. Again, as in Furman and in Gregg,
seven members of the Court refused to hold that the death sentence was
uncon­stitutional under any circumstances. However, three members of the Court
who, with Justices Brennan and Marshall, formed the majority for the decision
in the case, held that a mandatory death sentence for a broad category of
homicidal offences was cruel and unusual punishment. In reaching this
conclusion, the three Justices, Stewart, Powell and Stevens JJ., reviewed the
history of the mandatory death penalty in the various states, a history which
showed a progressive relaxation of mandatory imposition to enable juries to
exercise discretion in individual cases. The Justices regarded this relaxation
and the substitution of discre­tionary sentencing as indicating the aversion of
society at large to the mandatory death penalty, and its reintroduction was not
an adequate

[Page 698]

response to the vice of the legislation in the Furman case,
namely that the discretion was unguided. A further element in the position of
the three Justices was that the mandatory death sen­tence, having regard to the
irretrievable nature of the death penalty compared with other forms of
present-day punishment, did not leave room for individual assessment of each
convicted person. As they put it,

While the prevailing practice of individualizing sen­tencing
determinations generally reflects simply enlight­ened policy rather than a
constitutional imperative, we believe that in capital cases the fundamental
respect for humanity underlying the Eighth Amendment … requires consideration
of the character and record of the individual offender and the circumstances of
the par­ticular offence as a constitutionally indispensable part of the process
of inflicting the penalty of death.

Justice Stewart, who wrote the reasons in which Justices Powell
and Stevens concurred, made an express reservation in a footnote of ""a
mandatory death penalty statute limited to an extremely narrow category of
homicide, such as murder by a prisoner serving a life sentence, defined in
large part in terms of the character or record of the offender"", and
stated that no opinion was being expressed as to the constitutionality of such
a statute. Whether the Canadian statute in issue here would, if found in the
United States, lead to a different result than that reached in Woodson and Waxton
may be speculative, especially in view of the decision of the Supreme Court
of the United States in the companion case of Jurek v, Texas where a
Texas statute limiting the death penalty to five specific situations, was
upheld; but it should be noted that the gist of that decision (from which only
Brennan and Marshall JJ. dissented) lay in the view of the Court that the
capital sentencing procedure prescribed by the statute met constitu­tional
standards by requiring what was referred to as ""individualized sentencing
determinations"".

[Page 699]

The Canadian Criminal Code's death penalty offences are
not only narrower than those in Jurek v. Texas but, what
is more, there is no such legislative history in Canada, as there is in the
United States, of a discretionary sentencing proce­dure in respect of the death
penalty, exhibiting over the years a move away from provisions which originally
prescribed mandatory death sentences.

It is also I think of prime importance here that the widest
judicial review is open in capital cases; there is an unqualified right of
appeal by an accused to this Court on any ground of law or fact or mixed law
and fact: see Criminal Code , s. 619 . I am, therefore, unable to accept
the reasons given in Woodson and Waxton against the constitution­ality
of a mandatory death sentence as having persuasive force here. The
considerations which underlie the reasons of Stewart J. do not apply here,
having regard to our history, the limited range of capital offences, the
absence of any prac­tice of jury sentencing and the broad scope of judicial
review, not to mention the reserve power of the Government to commute death
sentences.

The same observations apply to the majority judgment of the
Supreme Court of the United States in Roberts v. Louisiana which
concerned a mandatory death penalty statute narrower in its definition of
first-degree murder than that in the Woodson and Waxton case and where
the result was the same as in that case. The Louisiana statute involved in the Roberts
case is broader in its definition of death penalty offences than the
Canadian provision in issue here, but like the Canadian provision it makes the
death penalty mandatory for those offences, whereas previously the jury was
authorized to return a verdict of ""guilty without capital
punishment"". In comment­ing on this change in the law, White J. in his
dissenting reasons, concurred in by the Chief Jus­tice and by Justices Blackmun
and Rehnquist, observed:

[Page 700]

The difference between a jury having and not having the
lawful discretion to spare the life of the defendant is apparent and
fundamental. It is undeniable that the unfettered discretion of the jury to
save the defendant from death was a major contributing factor in the
developments which led us to invalidate the death penal­ty in Furman v.
Georgia. This factor Louisiana has now sought to eliminate by making the
death penalty com­pulsory upon a verdict of guilty in first-degree murder
cases. As I see it, we are now in no position to rule that the State's present
law, having eliminated the overt discretionary power of juries, suffers from
the same constitutional infirmities which led this Court to invali­date the
Georgia death penalty statute in Furman v.

Georgia.

I refer to one other matter dealt with by White J. because it
relates to submissions made by the intervenor in the present case respecting
the allegedly arbitrary imposition of the death penalty because of (1)
prosecutorial discretion in the choice of a charge and in acceptance of a plea
of guilty to a lesser charge and (2) jury ""discretion"" in the range
of verdicts open to it on a charge of murder. These submissions were also made
in Roberts v. Louisiana and, in my opinion, were effectively disposed of
by White J. in his reasons at pp. 5287 and 5288 of 44 U.S. LW. The discretion
of a prosecutor is part of the normal criminal process and it cannot be assumed
that it will be incompetently or dishonestly exercised. Again, juries do not
have unfettered discretion to convict of a lesser included offence but must be
guided by the evidence, and the Criminal Code  provisions for review by
appellate courts are there to ensure against unreasonable or unfounded jury
verdicts.

None of the contentions made against the death penalty in the
present case persuades me that it is cruel and unusual punishment within s.
2(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, and I would reject this ground of
appeal.

As to the other grounds urged in this Court, I am in agreement
with my brother Ritchie that

[Page 701]

there is no reversible error, and I would, accord­ingly, dismiss
the two appeals.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon and de Grandpré
JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—These are appeals from a judg­ment of the Court of
Appeal of British Columbia dismissing the appeals of the two appellants from
their conviction at a trial held before Mr. Justice Kirke Smith sitting with a jury,
on a joint charge of unlawfully committing ""murder punishable by
death"" in the killing of a policeman while acting in the course of his
duties in the County of Westmin­ster in the Province of British Columbia on
March 29, 1974.

In rendering judgment on behalf of the majority of the Court of
Appeal of British Columbia, Rob­ertson J.A., considered six grounds of appeal
alleg­ing errors in the charge of the learned trial judge and also a seventh
ground which was set out in the factum filed on behalf of Cockriell as follows:

7. It is respectfully submitted that the provisions of the
Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 and amend­ments thereto relating to murder
punishable by death are rendered inoperative by reason of their infringement of
section 2(b) of the Bill of Rights, R.S.C. 1970, Appendix III.

The majority of the Court of Appeal found that s. 2(b) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights did not have this effect and accordingly when the present
appeals were asserted to this Court, the same question, being one of law, was
asserted as a ground of appeal and was phrased as follows:

The majority of the Court of Appeal for the Province of
British Columbia erred in holding that the death penalty is not cruel and
unusual punishment within the meaning of Section 2(b) of the Bill of Rights,
being R.S.C. 1970, Appendix III; and that accordingly the said majority of the
Court of Appeal for the Province of British Columbia erred in holding that
Section 214(2)  and Section 218(1)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada, being R.S.C.
1970, C-34 and amendments thereto (namely S.C. 1973, c. 38 section 2(2) and
Section 3(1)) were not inoperative by virtue of the application of the said
Section 2(b) of the Bill of Rights.

[Page 702]

In view of the far-reaching importance of this submission the
Attorneys General of the Provinces were advised that it would be raised on this
appeal and the Province of Newfoundland intervened in accordance with Rule 60
of the Supreme Court Rules and was represented at the hearing. Leave was also
granted by Mr. Justice Spence for the intervention of the Canadian Civil
Liberties Asso­ciation. For these reasons, and in view of the fact that the
dissenting judgment of McIntyre J.A., in the Court of Appeal, is based almost
exclusively on this ground, it appears to me to be desirable to deal with it
before considering the errors alleged in the charge to the jury, all of which
were also argued at length.

The relevant portions of the sections of the Criminal Code  which
the appellants allege to have been rendered inoperative by the Canadian Bill
of Rights read as follows:

214. (1) Murder is punishable by death or is punishable by
imprisonment for life.

(2) Murder is punishable by death, in respect of any person,
where such person by his own act caused or assisted in causing the death of

(a) a police officer, police constable, constable, sheriff,
deputy sheriff, sheriff's officer or other person employed for the preservation
and maintenance of the public peace, acting in the course of his duties, ... or
counselled or procured another person to do any act causing or assisting in
causing the death.

(3) All murder other than murder punishable by death is
punishable by imprisonment for life. [1973, c. 38, s. 2.]

218. (1) Every one who commits murder punishable by death is
guilty of an indictable offence and shall be sentenced to death.

The section of the Bill of Rights which is invoked by the
appellants reads as follows:

2. Every law of Canada shall, unless it is expressly
declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate
notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied
as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe or to authorize the abrogation,
abridgment or infringement of any of the rights or freedoms herein recognized
and declared, and in particular,

[Page 703]

no law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as to .. .

(b) impose or authorize the imposition of cruel and unusual
treatment or punishment .. .

It is to be remembered that the expression ""law of
Canada"" as used in the Bill of Rights is defined in s. 5(2)
as meaning ""an Act of the Parliament of Canada enacted before or after the
coming into force of this Act ..."".

The effect of s. 2(b) of the Bill of Rights must be
considered in light of s. 1 which provides:

1. It is hereby recognized and declared that in Canada there
have existed and shall continue to exist without discrimination by reason of
race, national origin, colour, religion or sex, the following human rights and
funda­mental freedoms, namely,

(a) the right of the individual to life, liberty,
security of the person and enjoyment of property, and the right not to be
deprived thereof except by due process of law;

(The emphasis is my own.)

At the outset it should be stated that these reasons for judgment
are not concerned with the moral issue involved in the retention or abolition
of capital punishment.

The answer to the question of whether or not the death penalty
sections of the Criminal Code  are to be retained as a feature of the
administration of justice in Canada lies with Parliament, and since the hearing
of this appeal Parliament has repealed those sections, but the question of
whether, at the time when this murder was committed and the appellants were
tried, convicted and sentenced to death, Parliament had already, by enacting s.
2(b) and s. 5(2) of the Bill of Rights ""recognized and
declared"" that no law of Canada was to be applied so as to impose
punishment by death, is a question for the Courts and this was the only
question argued in this area in this appeal.

I subscribe to the analysis of the meaning and effect of ss. 1
and 2 of the Bill of Rights to be found in the reasons for judgment of
Mr. Justice Martland, speaking for the majority of this Court

[Page 704]

in The Queen v. Burnshine[16],
at p. 705 where, after noting that the Bill of Rights ""by its
express wording ... declared and continued existing rights and freedoms"",
he went on to say:

It was those existing rights and freedoms which were not to
be infringed by any federal statute. Section 2 did not create new rights. Its
purpose was to prevent infringement of existing rights. It did particularize in
paras. (a) to (g), certain rights which were a part of the rights

declared in s. I . The declaration of the right of the individual
not

to be deprived of life which is contained in s. I (a) is clearly
qualified by the words ""except by due process of law"", which appear
to me to contem­plate a process whereby an individual may be deprived of
life. At the time when the Bill of Rights was enacted there did not
exist and had never existed in Canada the right not to be deprived of life in
the case of an individual who had been convicted of ""murder punishable by
death"" by the duly recorded verdict of a properly instructed jury and, in
my view, the ""existing right"" guaranteed by s. 1(a) can only relate
to individuals who have not undergone the process of such a trial and
conviction.

Accepting as I do the proposition that s. 2 did not create new
rights, it cannot be that Parliament intended to create anew the absolute right
not to be deprived of life under any circumstances by providing that no law of
Canada was to be applied so as ""to impose or authorize the imposition of
cruel and unusual treatment or punishment"". If so construed the section
would prevent the infringement of a right which had never existed and would
thus run contrary to the purpose for which it was enacted. As I have said, the
abolition of the death penalty is a matter for Parliament and is not to be
achieved by such an oblique method as that sug­gested by the appellants.

In seeking to determine the intention of Parlia­ment in enacting
s. 2(b), I think it is pertinent to observe that since the Bill of Rights was
enacted Parliament had amended the provisions of the Criminal Code  defining
the types of culpable homicide which are punishable by death on three
occasions. In this regard it must be noted that

[Page 705]

within a year after the Bill of Rights had been enacted,
the same Parliament passed An Act to amend the Criminal Code by 1960-61
(Can.), c. 44, and by s. 2 re-enacted s. 206(1) of the former Code in
the following terms:

Every one who commits capital murder is guilty of an
indictable offence and shall be sentenced to death.

The death penalty was also recognized in the amendments to the Criminal
Code , 1967-68, c. 15, and 1973-74, c. 38, by which ss. 214  and 218  were
enacted as they existed at the times relevant to this appeal. None of these
amendments contained any declaration that it was to operate notwithstanding the
Bill of Rights.

In my view the fact that Parliament saw fit to retain the death
penalty as part of the Criminal Code  after the enactment of the Bill
of Rights constitutes strong evidence of the fact that it had never been
intended that the word ""punishment"" as employed in s. 2 (b) should
preclude punishment by death in the case of an individual who has been duly
convicted of murder.

If it were otherwise it would mean in light of s. 5(2) that the
provisions for punishment by death contained in the amendments had been
rendered inoperative in advance of their enactment. I cannot accept that
proposition.

For these reasons I have concluded that the ""cruel and
unusual treatment or punishment"" referred to in s. 2(b) of the Bill of
Rights does not include punishment by death for murder and that it was
neither the intention nor the effect of that section to render inoperative the
death penalty provisions of the Criminal Code .

Having reached this conclusion I do not find it necessary, in
considering the meaning of ""cruel and unusual treatment or
punishment"" as employed in s. 2(b) of the Bill of Rights, to make
any assessment of current community standards of morality or of the deterrent
effect of the death penalty. These matters in my view raise what are
essentially questions of policy and as such they are of necessity
considerations effecting the decision of

[Page 706]

Parliament as to whether or not the death penalty should be
retained; but in the view which I take they do not arise in considering the
question of law here at issue which is whether the provisions of s. 2(b) of the
Bill of Rights preclude the imposition of punishment by death for murder
of a police officer as provided in ss, 214 and 218 of the Criminal Code  in
force at the time of this murder.

In my opinion the words ""cruel and unusual"" as they are
employed in s. 2(b) of the Bill of Rights are to be read
conjunctively and refer to ""treatment or punishment"" which is both
cruel and unusual. In this latter regard I share the view of Mr. Justice
Robertson that, having regard to the fact that the death penalty for murder had
been a part of the law of England from time immemorial and that, at the time
when this murder was com­mitted and the trial was held, it had been a feature
of the criminal law of Canada since Confedera­tion, it cannot be said to have
been an ""unusual"" punishment in the ordinary accepted meaning of that
word.

The dissenting reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice McIntyre, are,
however, predicated on his conclusion that the death penalty constitutes cruel
and unusual punishment. This opinion is in large measure based on decisions
rendered by the Supreme Court of the United States in construing the words
""cruel and unusual punishment"" as they occur in the 8th and 14th
amendments to the United States Constitution, and he places great reliance on the
case of Furman v. The State of Georgia[17], where
it was held that the imposition of the death penalty did constitute cruel and
unusual punishment. Even if I found it necessary to enter upon a discussion of
these cases in the United States Supreme Court, I would be disinclined to adopt
them as applicable in interpreting s. 2(b) of the Canadian Bill of
Rights.

Although the phrase ""cruel and unusual punish­ments"" is
to be found in the English Bill of Rights of 1688 and the use of the words
""cruel and unusual"" in this context in both the Canadian Bill of
Rights

[Page 707]

and the United States Constitution no doubt owes its origin to
that source, I am nonethe­less satisfied that these two latter documents differ
so radically in their purpose and content that judgments rendered in
interpretation of one are of little value in interpreting the other. In view,
however, of the stress placed on the case of Furman in Mr. Justice
McIntyre's decision, I think it perti­nent to observe that since the argument
of this appeal the United States Supreme Court has ren­dered decisions holding
that ""the imposition of the death penalty is not per se cruel and
unusual punishment violative of the 8th and 14th amend­ments"". I refer
particularly to the cases of Gregg v. Georgia; Roberts v. Louisiana, and
Woodson et al. v. North Carolina, all of which were decided on July 2,
1976, and which also recognized that the mandatory death penalty imposed in
certain States did violate the provisions of the Constitution to which I have
referred.

The circumstances surrounding the death of the police officer in
this case and the course of the joint trial of the two appellants before Mr.
Justice Kirke Smith are set out at length in the reasons for judgment delivered
by Robertson J.A. which are now conveniently reported at pp. 2 to 61 of [1975]
6 W.W.R., (hereinafter referred to as ""the Report"") and I am
accordingly relieved of the task of restating them in detail. The case
presented by the Crown is fully described at pp. 7 and 8 of the Report, and the
essential facts appear to me to be that the appellants, who were jointly
charged with ""murder punishable by death"", had been together in an
automobile in the early hours of March 29, 1974, after having spent the
previous evening drinking at a beer parlour and at the home of some friends.
The evidence admitted at the trial indi­cates that they bore a grudge against
the police and having talked of shooting a police officer, they took with them
a loaded rifle and drove the car to the Town of Cloverdale where they
intentionally drew themselves to the attention of the police by their method of
driving and by the appellant Cock­riell throwing a beer bottle out of the car
through the window of the local Court House. When a police officer followed
them in his police car with flashing lights Miller, who was driving, pulled
over to the shoulder of the road and stopped. When the

[Page 708]

police officer got out of his car and came over to ask Miller for
his driver's licence and then asked him to get out of his car, the loaded,
cocked rifle which was resting on Miller's arms was discharged by Cockriell
pulling the trigger. The bullet struck the police officer in the chest causing
his death.

The defences of the two appellants are described at p. 4 of the
Report of Mr. Justice Robertson's reasons as follows:

The theory of Miller's defence was that he never intended
anything by what he said about shooting a policeman: it was drunk talk; that he
was too drunk to form the intention to shoot the policeman; that he had no idea
that Cockriell would ever do such a thing and that what Cockriell did was an
accident; and that in fact Miller did not do it.

The theory of Cockriell's defence was that he never formed
any intention to shoot a policeman: his talk was just drunk talk for the
purpose of attracting attention; that he did not know the gun was loaded; that
if he ever had any intention, he had abandoned it before the event; and that in
any event the rifle was discharged by accident. (He did not rely on
drunkenness.)

The defence of abandonment was advanced in this Court on Cockriell's
behalf, but there is no evidence to indicate that he at any time com­municated
""his intention to abandon the common purpose"" to his associate,
Miller, and ""timely com­munication"" of such intention amounting,
where ""practicable and reasonable"", to ""unequivocal notice""
has been characterized as ""an essential element"" of this defence by
Sloan J.A. in R. v. Whitehouse (Elias Savage)[18],
at pp. 115 and 116. This view was recently unanimously adopted in the Court of
Criminal Appeal in England in R. v. Becerra and Cooper, decided on
December 16, 1975, but as yet unreported, and as I share it, I cannot find any
ground for holding that Cockriell had abandoned his intention to associate
himself with the criminal purpose before the crime was committed.

The learned trial judge refused to order separate trials for the
appellants or to sever their defences,

[Page 709]

and after a lengthy trial the jury convicted both Miller and Cockriell.

In appealing to the Court of Appeal the errors alleged in the
conduct of the trial concerned a failure so to order separate trials and
separate defences, alleged misdirection as to the admissibil­ity and use of
certain evidence, failure to review the theories of the defences and misdirection
as to drunkenness in the case of Miller.

In the course of his reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal,
Robertson J.A. expressed the opinion that the trial judge should have
instructed the jury specifically that

... Miller could, though otherwise guilty of the same
offence, [i.e. murder] be convicted of manslaughter if the jury were of the
opinion that, because of drunken­ness, he was unable to form the necessary
intent.

He went on to say:

However, in view of the fact that earlier the Judge had stated
the proposition correctly, and of the fact that the evidence showed only some
degree of effect on Miller of the beer that he had drunk, I cannot consider the
error to be of significance.

Mr. Justice Robertson went on to say at p. 43 of the Report:

Limiting myself to the arguments presented, I can see no
error in the charge on the verdicts that were open, except for the misdirection
I have referred to with respect to Miller and drunkenness. However, in my
consideration of the record to ascertain whether there are present any other
grounds upon which either of the convictions ought to be set aside, there has
occurred to me a point that, in my respectful opinion, indicates a misdirection
of the jury by the learned trial Judge in his charge, particularly with respect
to Miller.

This latter point concerned the interaction of s. 214  and s. 21 
of the Criminal Code  which reads as follows:

21. (1) Every one is a party to an offence who

(a) actually commits it,

(b) does or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding
any person to commit it, or

(c) abets any person in committing it.

[Page 710]

(2) Where two or more persons form an intention in common to
carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein and any one of
them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits an offence, each of them who
knew or ought to have known that the commission of the offence would be a
probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose is a party to that
offence.

This further ground which presented itself to Mr. Justice
Robertson is summarized at pp. 44 and 45 of the Report where he says:

There is a marked difference between parts of s. 214(2)  and
parts of s. 21 . The latter has not anywhere in it the words ""by his own
act"". Section 214(2)  uses the words ""assisted"", ""counselled""
and ""procured"", while s. 21(1) uses the words ""aiding"" and
""abets"".... Section 21(2) (which does use the word
""assist"") can have no application to the first class of murder in s.
214(2)  because it is designed to make responsible as a party one who has not
""by his own act"" committed the offence and so is inconsistent with
that class. Section 214(2)  is, therefore, its own code and neither subsection
of s. 21  can be applied to it. But there is nothing in s. 21  that is
inconsistent with s. 214(3) and so s. 21  may be applied in a case of murder
punishable otherwise than by death.

It follows that, where a person commits the murder of a
police officer acting in the course of his duties but the case does not fall
within s. 214(2) , it will fall within s. 214(3) and the murder will be
punishable by imprisonment for life.

In concluding his observations in this regard, Mr. Justice
Robertson says of the trial judge at p. 50:

He later instructed the jury that the verdicts that it was
open to them to find were guilty of murder punishable by death, guilty of
manslaughter and not guilty. He said nothing about guilty of murder punishable
by imprisonment for life being a verdict open to the jury in the case of
Miller, and this was error, as I have shown.

The authories [sic] to which reference is made in support of this
argument are R. v. Côté[19], and
R. v. Black[20], both
of which are concerned with the effect of s. 202 of the former Criminal Code 
(1953-54 (Can.), c. 51)

[Page 711]

and in each of which the alleged murder had been committed in the
course of robbery. With the greatest respect, I do not consider these
authorities to be applicable to the present circumstances and I would not wish
to be taken as affirming the reasons for judgment of the majority of the Court
of Appeal in this regard.

In any event, after a careful review of all the grounds of appeal
taken by each appellant, Mr. Justice Robertson saw fit to apply the provisions
of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  and found that no substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred. The following passage appears at
p. 59 of the Report where he said:

Earlier in these reasons I set out a number of passages from
the evidence of the two accused given under oath in open court at the trial and
I followed them with a summary that began with this sentence: ""This
evidence of the accused themselves (with the gaps filled in by other evidence
about which there is no dispute) presents a damning prima facie picture of a
deliberate murder"". Without more, that body of evidence is such that no
jury properly instructed could reach any conclusion but that both accused were
guilty. It is so complete that nothing in the post-arrest statements that was
not either repeated or confirmed in the accuseds' evidence at trial added anything
of an inculpatory nature to which there was any substantial significance.

In applying the provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code , Mr. Justice Robertson found that the Crown had discharged the onus
which is now generally accepted as the test in such cases and which was stated
by this Court in Brooks v. The King[21], and
recently restated by Mr. Justice Spence in Ambrose v. The Queen, as yet
unreported[22]:

... the onus is upon the Crown to satisfy the Court that the
jury, charged as it should have been, could not, as reasonable men, have done
otherwise than find the appellant guilty.

The penultimate paragraph of Mr. Justice Rob­ertson's reasons for
judgment, with which I agree, is phrased as follows:

[Page 712]

I can now answer the questions that I put to myself and my
answers are these. Had there been no misdirec­tion; (i) the verdicts would
necessarily have been the same; (ii) the jury, as reasonable men, could not
have done otherwise than find the accused guilty; and (iii) there is no
possibility that the jury would have had a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of
either of the accused.

For all these reasons I would dismiss this appeal.

In conclusion it appears to me to be desirable to consider the
""transitional"" provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act (No.
2), 1976, being the statute repealing the death penalty provisions of the Criminal
Code  which was enacted after the hearing of these appeals and to which
reference is made in the earlier part of these reasons. The relevant provisions
are found in s. 25(1) and (2) of that Act.

Section 25(1) reads as follows:

25. (1) If, on the day this Act comes into force, any person
is under a sentence of death for murder punishable by death that has not been
commuted, that sen­tence thereupon becomes a sentence of imprisonment for life
for first degree murder without eligibility for parole until he has served
twenty-five years of his sentence.

This section applies to any person under sentence of death at the
time when the Act ""comes into force"" whose sentence has not been
commuted, and I think that such a person is to be taken as being one who has
either not appealed against conviction or whose rights to appeal have been
exhausted or abandoned before seeking to invoke the authority of the Governor
in Council to com­mute the sentence in accordance with s. 684(1) of the Code.
On the other hand the case of persons like the appellants who have appealed
and whose appeals have not been disposed of until after the coming into force
of the Act, is separately dealt with under s. 25(2) which in my view applies
directly and with full force to the present case. That section reads as
follows:

25. (2) If, after the coming into force of this Act, an
appeal against conviction by a person under a sentence of death upon the coming
into force of this Act for murder punishable by death is dismissed, that
sentence thereupon becomes a sentence of imprisonment for life

[Page 713]

for first degree murder without eligibility for parole until
he has served twenty-five years of his sentence.

The Act of which this section is a part came into force on July
26, 1976, (Canada Gazette, Part II, vol. 110, No. 15), at which time an
appeal was outstanding against the convictions of the two appellants for
""murder punishable by death"" and they were both ""under sentence
of death"". It follows that if these appeals are dismissed the sentences of
death will thereupon become sen­tences of imprisonment for life for first
degree murder without eligibility for parole until they have each served
twenty five years of their respective sentences.

There is no doubt that the enactment of s. 25 and the repeal of ss.
214  and 218  of the Criminal Code  by ss. 4 and 5 of the same Act makes
any discussion of whether or not punishment by death is cruel and unusual an
academic one in so far as future cases are concerned,' but the contention
advanced on behalf of the appellants that ss. 214 and 218 of the Code as
they stood at the time of the murder and of the trial and both appeals were
made inoperative by s. 2(b) of the Bill of Rights, is not disposed of by
s. 25 of the new Act.

As I have already indicated, the indictable offence of
""murder punishable by death"" was created by s. 218(1) of the Code as
it stood before the 1976 amendment in the following terms:

218. (1) Every one who commits murder punishable by death is
guilty of an offence and shall be sentenced to death.

and the former s. 214  which defined the type of murder punishable
by death also provided in its concluding section 214(3) that ""all murder
other than murder punishable by death is punishable by imprisonment for
life"".

If effect were given to the argument that ss. 214 and 218 of the Code
had been rendered inoperative by the provisions of s. 2(b) of the Bill
of Rights, then it would follow that the Court, acting under the law as it
then existed, should ""allow the appeal, quash the conviction for murder
punishable by death and substitute a conviction for murder punishable by life
imprisonment"", which is

[Page 714]

the order sought by the appellants under this head of their
appeal.

In the result, by allowing the appeal on this ground, the Court
would have performed the func­tion of rendering ss. 214  and 218  inoperative,
which end was achieved by Parliament when it repealed these sections.

It will be observed that s. 25(2) only applies to ""a person
under sentence of death ... for murder punishable by death"" and it is only
such a person whose sentence ""thereupon becomes a sentence of imprisonment
for life for first degree murder without eligibility for parole until he has
served twenty-five years of his sentence"". If s. 2(b) of the Bill of
Rights had already had the effect of ren­dering ss. 214  and 218 
inoperative, then these appellants could not have been found guilty of
""murder punishable by death"" and, as the law then stood, the only
sentence which could have been imposed would have been one of imprisonment for
life under s. 214(3). The question therefore becomes one of first importance to
the appel­lants because if these appeals were to be allowed rather than dismissed,
and if the convictions ""for murder punishable by death"" were to be
quashed, there would be no provision rendering either of the appellants ineligible
""for parole until he had served twenty-five years of his
sentence"". Whether or not the appellants are to be denied parole for the
first twenty-five years of their sentences therefore depends upon whether or
not ss. 214 and 218 of the Code were rendered inoperative by s. 2(b) of
the Bill of Rights, and the answer to this latter question is by no
means an academic one.

It is for these reasons that I have considered it important,
notwithstanding the provisions of the 1976 Act, to develop the argument that
when the provisions of s. 2(b) of the Bill are read in light of those of
s. 1(a), it becomes apparent that Parlia­ment did not thereby intend to create
any right in the individual not to be deprived of life if he were duly
convicted of ""murder punishable by death"", on the ground that such
deprivation constituted cruel and unusual treatment.

BEETZ J.—I do not find it necessary, for the purpose of this
case, to express any view as to

[Page 715]

whether or not s. 2 of the Canadian Bill of Rights creates
new rights or as to whether or not it is subordinate to s. 1.

However, I do agree with Mr. Justice Ritchie that s. 1 throws
some light on s. 2, that the words ""cruel and unusual"" in s. 2(6) are
to be read conjunctively and refer to ""treatment or punishment"" which
is both cruel and unusual and that punishment by death for murder is not
contrary to s. 2(b).

I also agree with Mr. Justice Ritchie on the effect of the Criminal
Law Amendment Act (No. 2), 1976 and on the merits of this case.

I would dismiss the appeals.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Corporations—Amalgamation—Continuance of
amalgamating corporations as a corporate entity—Responsibility of amalgamated
corporation for criminal acts of amalgamating corporations—Combines
Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-23—Canada Corporations Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-32 , s. 137 .

Criminal law—Amalgamation of corporations—Liability
of amalgamating companies to prosecution after amalgamation—Responsibility of
amalgamated corporation.

By an agreement dated January 15, 1971 Black
and Decker Manufacturing Company, Limited, DeWalt Canada Limited and Master
Pneumatic Tools (Canada), Ltd. agreed to amalgamate under the name of Black and
Decker Manufacturing Company, Limited and on the same date letters patent were
issued confirming the amalgamation agreement. On April 5, 1972 an information
was sworn charging Black and Decker Manufacturing Company, Limited with two
counts of retail price maintenance contrary to the Combines Investigation
Act. The offences were alleged to have occurred between October 1966 and
August 1970. The accused moved to quash the information or for dismissal on the
grounds that no criminal responsibility could be transferred to it with respect
to a period prior to the amalgamation. In the Court of Appeal the appellant
succeeded in obtaining an Order of Prohibition prohibiting further proceedings
on the information; that order is appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

Upon an amalgamation under the Canada
Corporations Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-32 , no “new” company is created and no
“old” company is extinguished. According to the Act the amalgamating companies

[Page 412]

are “amalgamated and continue as one
company”. One of the effects of this is that amalgamating corporations in their
new identity as the amalgamated corporation, remain liable to prosecution for
offences committed prior to the amalgamation.

Stanward Corporation v. Denison Mines
Ltd., [1966] 2 O.R. 585 approved; Re Quieting
Titles Act (1962), 40 W.W.R. 182 and R. v. Beamish Construction Co Ltd.,
[1966] 2 O.R. 867 disapproved; R. v. Howard Smith Paper Mills Ltd., [1954]
4 D.L.R. 161 referred to.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] allowing an appeal
from an Order of Fraser J. and making an Order of Prohibition. Appeal allowed.

the appellant.

J.M. Roland and J.G. Kennish, for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON J.—Black and Decker Manufacturing
Company, Limited was incorporated under the Companies Act of Canada, R.S.C. 1906, c. 79, by Letters
Patent dated April 15, 1922. By
an agreement dated January 25, 1971, the Company agreed to amalgamate with
DeWalt Canada Limited and Master Pneumatic Tools (Canada), Ltd. pursuant to
what was then s. 128A  of the Canada Corporations Act  (now s. 137  of
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-32 ) under the name of Black and Decker Manufacturing Company,
Limited and on the same date Letters Patent were issued confirming the
amalgamation agreement. A year or so later, on April 5, 1972 an information was
sworn charging Black and Decker Manufacturing Company, Limited with two retail
price maintenance offences, contrary to the Combines Investigation Act.
The first offence was alleged to have occurred at the Municipality of
Metropolitan Toronto and elsewhere in Canada between October of 1966 and August
of 1970, and the second offence at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto and
else-

[Page 413]

where in Ontario in the month of August 1970. On arraignment but prior to entering a
plea, the accused moved for an order quashing the information or alternatively
directing an acquittal on the ground that the charges being with respect to a
period prior to the amalgamation, no criminal responsibility “can be
transferred to” the amalgamated company. The Provincial Court Judge dismissed
the motion. The accused then moved for an order of prohibition before Fraser J.
of the Supreme Court of Ontario who was of the opinion that the point raised
went to the merits of the case rather than to jurisdiction and should
preferably be disposed of at trial. The Court of Appeal for Ontario allowed an appeal from the order of
Fraser J. and made an order prohibiting any judge of the Provincial Court (Criminal Division) of the
Judicial District of York from taking any further proceedings against Black and
Decker Manufacturing Company, Limited upon the information dated April 5,1972.

It will be convenient to quote the relevant
parts of s. 137  of the Canada Corporations Act , supra:

137. (1) Any two or more companies to which
this Part applies may amalgamate and continue as one company.

(2) Companies proposing to amalgamate may
enter into an agreement for the amalgamation prescribing its terms and
conditions and the mode of carrying the amalgamation into effect.

(3) The amalgamation agreement shall
further set out

(a) the name of the amalgamated
company;

(b) the objects of the
amalgamated company;

(c) the amount of its authorized
capital, the division thereof into shares and the rights, restrictions,
conditions or limitations attaching to any class of shares;

[Page 414]

(d) the place within Canada at which the head office of the
amalgamated company is to be situated;

(e) the names, callings and postal
addresses of the first directors thereof;

(f) when the subsequent directors
are to be elected;

(g) whether or not the by-laws of
the amalgamated company are to be those of one of the amalgamating companies
and, if not, a copy of the proposed by-laws; and

(h) such other details as may be
necessary to perfect the amalgamation and to provide for the subsequent
management and working of the amalgamated company and the manner of converting
the authorized and issued capital of each of the companies into that of the
amalgamated company as determined pursuant to paragraph (c) above.

…

(10) The amalgamating companies shall,
within six months of the date of the final vote on the amalgamation agreement,
jointly file with the Minister the amalgamation agreement together with a
certificate from the secretary of each of the amalgamating companies
establishing the percentage of those who voted in favour of the agreement and
the percentage of dissentient shareholders, in respect of each class of shares.

(11) Not less than eight days following the
final vote on the amalgamation agreement and upon receipt of evidence that no
application was made under this section for the annulment of the
amalgamation agreement or that, if such an application was made, it was
dismissed, the Minister may issue letters patent confirming the agreement: but
the requirement of eight days delay may be dispensed with if the amalgamation
agreement has received the approval of more than ninety per cent of the votes
of each class of shares cast at each meeting of the amalgamating companies.

…

(13) Upon the issue of letters patent
pursuant to subsection (11), the amalgamation agreement has full force and
effect and

(a) the amalgamating companies are
amalgamated and are continued as one company (in this section called the
“amalgamated company”) under the name and having the authorized capital and
objects specified in the amalgamation agreement; and

[Page 415]

(b) the amalgamated company
possesses all the property, rights, assets, privileges and franchises, and is
subject to all the contracts, liabilities, debts and obligations of each of the
amalgamating companies.

(14) All rights of creditors against the
property, rights, assets, privileges and franchises of a company amalgamated
under this section and all liens upon its property, rights, assets,
privileges and franchises are unimpaired by the amalgamation, and all debts,
contracts, liabilities and duties of the company thenceforth attach to the
amalgamated company and may be enforced against it. 1964-65, c. 52, s. 41;
1967-68, c. 9, s. 8.

Arnup J.A. who delivered the unanimous judgment
of a Court, comprising Gale C.J.O., Jessup and Arnup JJ.A., after quoting s.
137 , said:

Puzzling questions of great difficulty are
raised by this section and particularly from the expressions “continue as
one company” (s. 137(1)), “the amalgamating companies are amalgamated and are
continued as one company” (s.s.(13)(a)), and the use of the word
“possesses” in relation to rights and assets (s.s.(13)(b)), rather than
any words indicating a “transfer”. Finally, and in the end this case will turn
upon the meaning of this provision, what is meant by the language of s.s. (14)
that all liabilities (of the old company) “thenceforth attach to the
amalgamated company and may be enforced against it”?

then reviewed the authorities, and concluded:

We are therefore not concerned with whether
the old company has disappeared as a separate and distinct entity. What
concerns us is whether the new company can be prosecuted for the sins of the
old one. The case narrows down in the end to the question whether
subsection (13)(b) of s. 137 , in making the new company “subject to
all the liabilities” of each of the old companies, imposes upon the new company
criminal liability of one of the old companies. The word “liabilities” appears
not only in clause (b) of s.s. (13) but also in s.s. (14). Leaving aside
the rather curious fact that in clause (b) the matters to

[Page 416]

which the new company is subject are listed
as “all the contracts, liabilities, debts and obligations”, whereas s.s. (14)
lists these matters as “all debts, contracts, liabilities and duties”, of more
significance is the French version of the statute. The words used in clause (b)
as the French equivalent of “liabilities” is “engagements”, and the equivalent
of “liabilities” in s.s. (14) is given in French as “passifs”. My brother
Jessup, whose knowledge and grasp of the French language is much greater than
mine, has pointed out to me that both “engagements” and “passifs” are commercial
synonyms for the English word “liabilities”. In his view, if a connotation
of criminal liability had been intended the French synonym would have
been the word “responsabilités”. (For an example, see R.S.C. 1970, 1st. Supp.,
chap. 19, s. 4.5(6), amending the Canadian and British Insurance Companies
Act).

Furthermore, it seems clear to me from the
argument of the Crown that we are being asked to imply a penal sanction upon
the new company that has not been spelled out in express terms by Parliament.
In my view, we ought not to make any such implication. It is still the law that
penal sanctions are to be imposed by express language. “Liabilities”, without
more, cannot in my view be interpreted to include “criminal liabilities”, or
more accurately, “criminal responsibilities”.

This conclusion is sufficient to dispose of
this case. The new company could not be prosecuted for acts committed by the
old company. Since the new company was not even in existence during the period
covered by the dates in the charge, it cannot possibly be found guilty unless
it is liable for acts or omissions of the old company.

The Court of Appeal concluded as a matter of
construction of the language of s. 137  of the Canada Corporations Act  that
“liabilities” as used in subss. (13)(b) and (14) could not be
interpreted to include criminal liabilities, but in reaching that conclusion it
would seem that the Court accepted, as a first step, the proposition that the
“new” company, i.e. the amalgamated company, is a different, separate
and distinct company from the “old” companies, i.e. the

[Page 417]

amalgamating companies. Whether an amalgamation
creates or extinguishes a corporate entity will, of course, depend upon the
terms of the applicable statute, but as I read the Act, in particular s. 137 ,
and consider the purposes which an amalgamation is intended to serve, it would
appear to me that upon an amalgamation under the Canada Corporations Act  no
“new” company is created and no “old” company is extinguished. The Canada
Corporations Act  does not in terms so state and the following
considerations in my view serve to negate any such inference: (i) palpably the
controlling word in s. 137  is “continue”. That word means “to remain in
existence or in its present condition”—Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. The companies “are amalgamated and are continued as one company”
which is the very antithesis of the notion that the amalgamating companies are
extinguished or that they continue in a truncated state; (ii) the statement in
s. 137(13) (b) that the “amalgamated company possesses all the property,
rights...” If corporate birth or death were envisaged, one would have expected
to find, in the statute, some provision for transfer or conveyance or
transmission of assets and not simply the word “possesses”, a word which
re-enforces the concept of continuance; (iii) letters patent of amalgamation
are obtained for the purpose of “confirming the agreement” (s. 137(11) ), in
marked contrast to letters patent of incorporation which expressly create a
body corporate and politic; (iv) the French version of s. 137(1) , perhaps
better than the English version, serves to express what has occurred, “Deux ou
plus de deux compagnies…peuvent fusionner et continuer comme une seule et même
compagnie”. The effect is that of blending and continuance as one and the
selfsame company; (v) the Act contains a number of express provisions whereby
the life of corporate creations may be terminated—Videlicet where a
company carries on business not within the scope of its objects (s. 5(4) ), or
forfeits its charter (s. 31 ), or surrenders its charter (s. 32 ), or is
dissolved (s. 133(11) ). The Act is silent on the extinction of companies
by amalgamation; (vi) if Parliament had intended that a company

[Page 418]

by the simple expedient of amalgamating with
another company could free itself of accountability for acts in contravention
of the Criminal Code  or the Combines Investigation Act or the Income
Tax Act, I cannot but think that other and clearer language than that now
found in the Canada Corporations Act  would be necessary.

In Re Quieting Titles Act[2], Verchère J. held that by letters
patent of incorporation under The Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 71,
the “... existing undertakings were blended into one, and each amalgamating
company lost its previous separate identity...” and “…the amalgamating company
has now ceased to exist.” It is true that upon amalgamation each constituent
company loses its “separate” existence but it by no means follows that it has
thereby ceased to exist. Then, in Regina v. J.J. Beamish Construction Co.
Ltd.[3], Jessup
J., as he then was, stated, at p. 872:

I reached the conclusion of Verchère, J.
that the amalgamated company, in whose entity the amalgamating companies continue
under s. 96(4), is a separate entity and that the amalgamating companies cease
to have entity or identity once amalgamation is accomplished.

On the same date, July 4, 1966, that Jessup J.
delivered his reserved judgment in Beamish, Kelly J.A. delivered a
reserved judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Stanward Corporation
v. Denison Mines Ltd.[4], the
Court consisting of Kelly, Wells and Laskin JJ.A., in which Kelly J.A. said, at
p. 592:

[Page 419]

What we have here is an amalgamated company
into which, simultaneously, two amalgamating companies have fused along with
their assets and liabilities. Under this fusion, and by virtue of its statutory
implementation, it may be said, broadly, that the amalgamated company acquired
the assets and assumed the liabilities of the two component companies;…

and later, on the same page:

Returning to the view that the amalgamated
companies do not form a new company but continue to subsist as one, the
conclusion that there is no acquisition is, if anything, more apparent. The
language of s. 96 is in my opinion unambiguous in providing that the two
amalgamating companies shall continue as one company. While it may be difficult
to comprehend the exact metamorphosis which takes place, it is within the
Legislature’s competence to provide that what were hitherto two shall continue
as one.

Kelly J.A. compared the language of s. 96 of
Ontario Statutes 1953, c. 19, upon which the Stanward case was decided,
and that of its predecessor, s. 11 of The Companies Act, R.S.O. 1950, c.
59, upon which Regina v. Howard Smith Paper Mills, Ltd.[5], a judgment of my brother Spence,
was decided. The earlier legislation referred to the amalgamated corporation as
the “new corporation” and spoke of “the corporation so incorporated”. The language
expressed a clear intention to substitute a new corporation in the place and
stead of the amalgamating corporations. By the time the Stanward case
fell to be decided, however, the Legislature had re-enacted the section in
words which, in the opinion of Kelly J.A., with which I agree, indicated an
intention to change the effect of amalgamation. With respect, I am of the view
that the observations of Kelly J.A. in Stanward, although perhaps obiter,
are sound in law and correctly reflect the consequences of an amalgamation
pursuant to the language found in s. 96 of Ontario 1953, c. 19, or pursuant to
the

[Page 420]

substantially similar language found in s. 137 
of the Canada
Corporations Act .

The word “amalgamation” is not a legal term and
is not susceptible of exact definition: In re South African Supply and Cold
Storage Company[6]. The
word is derived from mercantile usage and denotes, one might say, a legal means
of achieving an economic end. The juridical nature of an amalgamation need not
be determined by juridical criteria alone, to the exclusion of consideration of
the purposes of amalgamation. Provision is made under the Canada
Corporations Act  and under the Acts of the various provinces whereby two or
more companies incorporated under the governing Act may amalgamate and form one
corporation. The purpose is economic: to build, to consolidate, perhaps to
diversify, existing businesses; so that through union there will be enhanced
strength. It is a joining of forces and resources in order to perform better in
the economic field. If that be so, it would surely be paradoxical if that
process were to involve death by suicide or the mysterious disappearance of
those who sought security, strength and, above all, survival in that union.
Also, one must recall that the amalgamating companies physically continue
to exist in the sense that offices, warehouses, factories, corporate records
and correspondence and documents are still there, and business goes on. In a
physical sense an amalgamating business or company does not disappear although
it may become part of a greater enterprise.

There are various ways in which companies can be
put together. The assets of one or more existing companies may be sold
to another existing company or to a company newly‑incorporated, in
exchange for cash or shares or other consideration. The consideration received
may

[Page 421]

then be distributed to the shareholders of the
companies whose assets have been sold, and these companies wound up and their
charters surrendered. In this type of transaction a new company may be
incorporated or an old company may be wound up but the legal position is clear.
There is no fusion of corporate entities. Another form of merger occurs when an
existing company or a newly-incorporated company acquires the shares of
one or more existing companies which latter companies may then be retained as
subsidiaries or wound up after their assets have been passed up to the parent
company. Again there is no fusion. But in an amalgamation a different result is
sought and different legal mechanics are adopted, usually for the express
purpose of ensuring the continued existence of the constituent companies. The
motivating factor may be the Income Tax Act or difficulties likely to
arise in conveying assets if the merger were by asset or share purchase. But
whatever the motive, the end result is to coalesce to create a homogeneous
whole. The analogies of a river formed by the confluence of two streams, or the
creation of a single rope through the intertwining of strands have been
suggested by others.

Counsel for the accused argued that an
amalgamation agreement provides for so many changes (s. 137(3)) and the
transformation of the amalgamating companies is so complete as to amount to
extinction of life. I do not agree. A company can, by supplementary Letters
Patent, make equally drastic changes without affecting, in the slightest,
corporate longevity.

It was also submitted that if the amalgamating
companies continue in amalgamation, in all their plenitude, then ss. 137(13)(b)
and 137(14) are mere surplusage. I would not so regard them. These
sections spell out in broad language amplification of a general principle,
a not

[Page 422]

uncommon practice of legislative draftsmen. If
ss. 137(13)(b) and 137(14) are to be read, however, as other than merely
supportive of a general principle and other than all-embracing, then some
corporate incidents, such as criminal responsibility, must be regarded as
severed from the amalgamating companies and outside the amalgamated company.
What happens to these vestigial remnants? Are they extinguished and if so, by
what authority? Do they continue in a state of ethereal suspension? Such
metaphysical abstractions are not, in my view, a necessary concomitant of the
legislation. The effect of the statute, on a proper construction, is to have
the amalgamating companies continue without subtraction in the amalgamated
company, with all their strengths and their weaknesses, their perfections and
imperfections, and their sins, if sinners they be. Letters patent of
amalgamation do not give absolution.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Theft—Imprisonment—Continuous
possession—Subsequent conviction for unlawful possession—Plea of “autrefois
convict”—Whether there were two offences—Meaning of words “Every one”—Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 ss. 3(4), 302(d), 312(1), 536, 537(1)(a), 605(1) and
618(2)—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, s. 399—Interpretation Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, s. 36(f).

Appellant was convicted of having, while
armed, stolen a sum of money, securities and documents, in breach of
s. 302 (d) of the Criminal Code . He served his
sentence and, after being released, was found in possession of a part of the
securities stolen by him three years previously. He was charged with unlawful
possession under s. 312(1)  of the Criminal Code  and he pleaded autrefois
convict. The trial Judge held that the accused’s possession was in
continuation of that acquired by him by the theft, and that after being
convicted of theft he could not be convicted of unlawful possession of the same
article. The Court of Appeal quashed the acquittal and ordered a new trial. The
appellant then appealed to this Court.

Held (Laskin
J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux
C.J. and Abbott and Judson JJ.: The text of s. 312(1)  of the Criminal
Code  no longer speaks of receiving or retaining. Relying strictly on this
text, the offence consists of having anything in one’s possession knowing that
the thing was obtained by the commission of an offence punishable by indictment,
or which would be so punishable, if committed in Canada. As provided by s. 36(f) of the Interpretation Act, this
new enactment is to be held to operate as new law, and is not to be construed
and have effect as declaratory of the law as contained in the former enactment.
The indefinite pronoun “every one” means “anyone”, “whoever”. So far as rules
of interpretation are concerned, there is no bar to a thief who has been
convicted and is then found in posses-

[Page 304]

sion of the thing stolen being, like any
other person, convicted of unlawful possession. One cannot validly maintain, on
the one hand, that continuation of the thief’s possession, whatever its
duration, is always a continuation of the act of theft, and, on the other hand,
that at the very time and place of the theft the thief commits the offence of
unlawful possession dealt with in s. 312(1) .

Per Martland
and Pigeon JJ.: When a subject-matter of an offence is a continuous state of
affairs such as possession, a first conviction does not bar a second charge if
the state of affairs subsequently continues in existence. This is then a new
violation of the law.

Per Ritchie
J.: The circumstances of this case disclose a clear severance in continuity
between the offence of armed robbery and that of possession contrary to
s. 312(1) . In the result these were two separate offences.

Per Laskin J. dissenting:
Possession cannot become the basis of a conviction of a separate offence
merely because the charge of that offence relates the possession to a different
date and to a different place than the earlier charge of robbery upon which the
accused was convicted. To convict the accused of unlawful possession in the
present case is to convict him because he was able to conceal the fruits of his
robbery after the event and to resist disclosing their whereabouts when he was
arrested on the robbery charge. This is not an offence defined in the Criminal
Code . Unlawful possession under s. 312(1)  is a different offence from
receiving or retaining under the old Code. However, the changes in the Criminal
Code  did not alter the force of the legal principle that precluded a
conviction of the thief, who has been in continuous possession, of both theft
and unlawful possession. Obtaining possession of property is an essential
ingredient of the offence of theft. After the theft is completed, the continued
possession by the thief is merely the continuance of the act of theft. Further,
the principle of res judicata suffices here to preclude successive
prosecutions for different offences with a substantial common element where
there has been a conviction on the first prosecution. Just as a conviction of
robbery would preclude a second conviction of the charge of unlawful possession
at the same trial, so does the conviction of robbery here preclude a succeeding
conviction of unlawful possession.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of
Queen’s Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec, quashing the acquittal. Appeal
dismissed, Laskin J. dissenting.

G. Gingras, for the appellant.

M.C. Laniel, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Fauteux C.J. and Abbott and
Judson JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—In 1966 appellant Louis Côté
was convicted of having, inter alia, in the City of Laval, district of
Montreal, on or about December 18, 1965, being armed with a revolver, stolen a
sum of money, bonds and documents, the whole amounting to about $723,300, in
breach of the provisions of s. 288(2)  of the Criminal Code —now
s. 302 (d). For this offence Côté was sentenced to three years and
four months’ imprisonment, and served his sentence.

Nearly three years after the date of this theft,
on November 26, 1968, Côté was found, at Ste. Béatrix, district of Joliette, in
possession of bonds and debentures which, admittedly, were part of the
documents and bonds he was convicted of having stolen in 1966. In fact, the
officers of the Quebec Police Force who, on the day in question, had gone to
Ste. Béatrix and had proceeded to a piece of land owned by Côté’s mother, saw
Côté there, who was heading towards his car. After watching him for a

[Page 306]

time, the officers approached him and found in
his car a polythene bag containing part of the stolen property; they
subsequently discovered another part in a padlocked suitcase concealed in a
barrel in the ground. Côté had the key to the padlock of the suitcase on his
person. He was arrested and subsequently accused on various charges of unlawful
possession under the provisions of s. 296 Cr. C.—now
s. 312(1) . At his trial, presided by Mr. Justice Lagarde of the Court
of Sessions of the Peace, Côté raised the special defence of autrefois
convict. With the consent of the prosecution and the defence, depositions
of the witnesses heard in 1966 on the theft charge were then produced as
evidence, to make proof as if those witnesses had again testified on the charge
of unlawful possession, and the prosecution further submitted on the charge evidence
which, according to the trial judge, showed, in particular, that in the period
of about three years elapsed between the day of the theft in 1965 and the day
on which appellant was found in possession of the stolen effects, the latter
had had them continually in his possession within the meaning of s. 3(4) 
of the Criminal Code . However, the judge acquitted appellant on a point
of law, which he summarized as follows:

[TRANSLATION] …an accused who is convicted
of theft cannot be convicted of unlawful possession of the same articles under
s. 296, and vice versa. Indeed, this section implies that the
accused received an article and retained it knowing that it was stolen.
Accordingly, the section is concerned with the handing over of an article
which was in the possession of someone else.

The Crown, considering that this reasoning was
incorrect at law, appealed from the acquittal to the Court of Appeal, as it is
entitled to do under s. 584(1)Cr. C.—now s. 605(1).

The Court of Appeal, consisting of Hyde, Taschereau
and Salvas JJ.A., unanimously allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial. The
reasons of the Court were stated by Mr. Justice Salvas as follows:

[Page 307]

[TRANSLATION] I shall not discuss the
question of whether the evidence established that Côté’s possession was
continuous from the time of theft. That is a question of fact with which we are
not concerned in these appeals, and I would add that it is not significant in
my opinion.

With all due respect, I cannot accept the
reasoning and conclusion of the learned judge.

It should first be noted that the offence
of possession (Cr. C. 296) is not included in that of robbery (Cr. C. 269 and
288).

1962 S.C.R. p. 229 re: Fergusson v.
R.

The wording of s. 296 (now 312) of the
present Criminal Code  is quite different from that of s. 399 of the
former Code (See also the English version of these sections). It is clear that
the legislator changed the law creating the offence of possession (1971 C.A. 73, re: R. v. St. Jean).
It is no longer possible to hold that, in principle, a receiver of stolen goods
cannot be the same person who stole them. On the contrary, I think the general
wording “every one…who has anything in his possession…” includes the person who
steals the thing, and accordingly that, depending on the circumstances, the
person who steals a thing may be convicted of possessing it. He may not be
convicted of theft and possession in every case. Thus, to take a simple
example, I think a thief found in possession of stolen goods at the time and
place of the theft may not be convicted of theft and of possession. In such a
case his possession is that of a thief, of one who “takes…anything” (Cr. C.
269, now 283). It is part of the act of theft itself. On this point each
specific case now raises merely a question of fact, as to whether the
possession of the thief who is also charged with criminal possession is the
possession acquired by him in the very act of perpetrating the theft. In
solving this problem, circumstances of time and place in particular, should be taken
into account (25 C.R. p. 151 re R. v. Van Dorn).

In the case at bar Côté stole the property
in the City of Laval, district
of Montreal, on December 18, 1965, and he is charged with having had a part of it in his possession
some three years later, on November 26, 1968, in Ste. Béatrix, district of
Joliette. In these circumstances I think that the Crown was legally justified
in laying the charges at bar against Côté, that the special defence of autrefois
convict presented by Côté should have been dismissed, that Côté should have
been required to plead to the merits of the charge and, if necessary, have his
trial (Cr. C. 516(4)).

[Page 308]

Relying on the provisions of s. 597(2) Cr.
C.—now s. 618(2)—which permit a person whose acquittal has been set
aside by the Court of Appeal to appeal on a question of law to the Supreme
Court, appellant has appealed to this Court.

The question of law at issue is thus as to
whether appellant, who had already been convicted of robbery, could in the
particular circumstances of the case be convicted on a charge of unlawful
possession of the effects which were stolen by him, and which remained
continuously in his possession for a period of some three years. It is thus
necessary to interpret the provisions of s. 296 or, to put it another way,
to define the nature of the offence described therein, and to consider the
question at issue in the light of that interpretation and of the circumstances
of the case.

Section 296, as well as what is now
s. 312(1) , reads as follows:

296. Every
one commits an offence who has anything in his possession knowing that it was
obtained

(a) by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by
indictment, or

(b) by an act or omission
anywhere that, if it had occurred in Canada, would have constituted an offence punishable by indictment.

The provisions of this section were
incorporated into the criminal law of Canada by the Act respecting the Criminal Law, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51. Section 745 of that Act, an
act which has Criminal Code  as its short title and which was brought
into force on April 1, 1955, repealed the previous Criminal Code , c. 36
of the Revised Statutes of Canada 1927, and consequently s. 399 of that
code, which read as follows:

399. Every
one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to fourteen years’
imprisonment, who receives or retains in his possession anything obtained by
any offence punishable on indictment, or by any acts wheresoever committed,
which, if committed in Canada would have constituted an offence punishable upon
indictment, knowing such thing to have been so obtained. R.S. c. 146,
s. 399.

[Page 309]

The terms of this section of the former
Code thus provided for two separate offences, receiving and retaining.

The following should be pointed out at this
stage:—prior to the incorporation of the offence of retaining into our criminal
law, by the 1892 Criminal Code , c. 28, s. 34, we knew only of the
offence of receiving, a situation which, moreover, is still the case in
England. When the provisions of s. 399 of the former Code were in force,
the weight of our case law was to the effect that a person could not be
convicted, with respect to the same thing, both of (i) theft and receiving,
because the thief could not receive from himself, (ii) theft and retaining,
because retaining implies that good faith exists at the time the stolen
property is received, and (iii) receiving and retaining, because a receiver is
in bad faith as soon as he receives the stolen property, which is not true in
the case of retaining. In short, theft on the one hand, and receiving or
retaining on the other hand, were mutually exclusive offences, and this was
also true of the offences of retaining and receiving, as compared with each
other.

The text of s. 296 above cited, which
replaces that of s. 399 in the former Code, no longer speaks of receiving
or retaining. Indeed, relying strictly on the text, the offence consists of
having anything in one’s possession knowing that the thing was obtained by the
commission of an offence punishable by indictment, or which would be so
punishable if committed in Canada. The provisions of the new enactment are thus no longer
substantively the same as those of its predecessor. Accordingly, as provided by
s. 36(f) of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
I-23, the new enactment is to be held to operate as new law, and is not to be
construed and have effect as declaratory of the law as contained in the former
enactment. This is especially true as it is impossible to conceive that an
enactment which literally described only one offence—unlawful possession—could

[Page 310]

implicitly as well as expressly combine two
offences—receiving and retaining—which by their very nature are mutually
exclusive. The new enactment is clear and unambiguous. It must therefore be
construed in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the words used, as
required by the first, most basic rule of interpretation. The indefinite
pronoun “quiconque” (every one) at the beginning of the sentence means, as is
indicated in the Petit Robert, dictionnaire de la langue française, among
other sources, “toute personne…” (anyone), “n’importe qui…” (whoever). It
follows that so far as rules of interpretation are concerned, there is now no
bar to a thief who has been convicted and is then found in possession of the
thing stolen being, in theory, in certain circumstances, and like any other
person, convicted of unlawful possession. The fact that his possession is a
common ingredient of both offences is no reason to exclude or ignore what is
actually the crucial factor distinguishing one from the other, and is of the
essence of their respective nature. In the commission of theft this crucial
characteristic consists in the fact of the taking or in the fact of the
conversion or constructive taking, two facts having a defined basis in time and
place. In the case of unlawful possession this crucial characteristic consists
in the fact that the offence can chronologically only be committed after that
of theft, and that it is the guilty knowledge of the unlawful origin of the
thing which then constitutes the offence, which may be continued for an
indefinite time in one place or, successively, in several different places. In
my opinion one cannot validly maintain, on the one hand, that continuation of
the thief’s possession—whether for weeks, months or years—is always a
continuation of the act of theft or, if one prefers, a continuation of the
commission of the theft, and one cannot, on the other hand, maintain that at
the very time and place in which the thief takes or converts the thing, and so
acquires possession of it, he is committing the offence of unlawful possession
dealt with in s. 296.

[Page 311]

Determination of the time when the offence of
theft is consummated and the offence of unlawful possession, described in
s. 296, so far as the thief is concerned, begins, cannot be resolved in
the abstract. However, the difficulty that may exist in determining this time,
according to the circumstances of each case, does not affect the substance of
the law.

The foregoing observations are not new. They can
be found in what I believe is the first reported decision dealing specifically
with the point, R. v. Van Dorn[1],
in which Coady J.A., delivering the unanimous opinion of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal, said the following:

In Regina v. Dale this Court held in
particular circumstances of that case that the accused had been properly found
guilty of theft and likewise of possession of the stolen goods knowing them to
have been stolen. There the goods were found in the possession of the accused
some months after the theft.

The present case does not differ in
principle from that case except that here the stolen goods were found in
possession some hours after the theft. The new offence of having in possession
property acquired by crime is a separate and distinct offence from the old
offences of receiving or retaining. The accused could not have been convicted
of theft and receiving since he could not receive from himself, nor could he
have been convicted of theft and retaining since the offence of retaining
involved the idea that he retained the goods in his possession with knowledge,
acquired after they came into his possession, that they were stolen goods.

It seems to me that where the possession
charged is so removed in time and place from the actual offence of theft as not
to be or form a part of the theft, or is not so intimately identified in time
and place with the theft as to form a part of it, that it is then a distinct
and separate offence for which the person may be convicted.

[Page 312]

It was argued that since theft necessarily
involves the actual physical temporary possession by the thief of the goods at
the time, then possession is necessarily involved in the act of theft itself,
and as such could be considered an included offence and the thief consequently,
under these circumstances, could not be convicted of both the offences of theft
and possession. But it seems to me that cannot be said to be true when the
possession is remote in time and place and is not the temporary possession
incidental to the act of theft.

Various provincial Courts of Appeal have
subsequently had to consider this unanimous decision of the British Columbia
Court of Appeal. This was the case for, inter alia, the Ontario Court of
Appeal in Regina v. Siggins[2], the
Nova Scotia Supreme Court in banco in Regina v. Fennell[3], and the Quebec Court of Appeal in Regina
v. St. Jean[4]. In the
Siggins case, supra, the appellant was simultaneously charged and
convicted on various counts of theft and unlawful possession of motor vehicles,
owned by various persons. The Court of Appeal held that, in the circumstances
of the case, the convictions for theft and the convictions for unlawful
possession could not both be maintained, and the convictions for unlawful
possession were set aside. The Court, whose attention was drawn by the Crown to
the Van Dorn decision, supra, was careful not to repudiate the
principle contained in that case; rather, in my view, it rendered a decision
limited to the specific case under consideration, as may be seen from the
following statements at the very beginning and in the body of the reasons given
by MacKay J.A., who with the concurrence of Porter C.J.A. formed the majority
on the question:

At p. 285:

I am of the opinion that in the circumstances
of this case the convictions for both theft and possession cannot stand and
that the jury having convicted on the counts charging theft, there should not
be a

[Page 313]

conviction on the counts charging unlawful
possession.

At p. 286:

Counsel for the Crown referred us to R.
v. Van Dorn (1956), 116 C.C.C. 325, in which it was held that
convictions for both offences, i.e. theft and possession, could stand where the
possession charged is not so intimately identified in time and place as to form
part of the theft itself. It may be that in certain circumstances this might be
so. But in a case such as the present where the appellant was the actual thief
and had had continuous possession of the motor vehicle from the time it was
stolen by him, I think the two offences arise from the one act.

It should be added that the reasons for judgment
in Siggins supra contain no indication or analysis of the circumstances
surrounding the commission of the offences with which appellant was charged. It
should also be noted that the contents of the counts are remarkably vague as to
these circumstances, in that they merely allege, e.g., that the offence
of theft of the vehicle owned by Mr. X was committed “on or about the 16th
of May, 1958”, and that the offence of unlawful possession of the same vehicle
was committed “in the month of May 1958”. Clearly, all this could not be
regarded as circumstances comparable to those in the case at bar. In Regina
v. Fennel supra, appellant, as in Siggins supra, was simultaneously
charged and convicted of theft and unlawful possession of the stolen property.
The Nova Scotia Supreme Court in banco dismissed Fennell’s appeal.
Subsequently, however, the same Court was asked by counsel for the
Attorney-General to consider the question of law now before this Court, and the
result of the new hearing was that the convictions for unlawful possession were
set aside. The Court, composed of Ilsley C.J.A. and Doull, Parker, Currie and
MacDonald JJ.A., referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in
R. v. Hogg[5], to
that of Van Dorn supra, and to that of Siggins

[Page 314]

supra. The Court
noted that appellant Fennel was found in possession of the property stolen by
him only a few hours after the theft. Implicitly approving the principle of the
decision in Van Dorn supra, Currie J.A., rendering judgment on behalf of
the Court, said at p. 69:

In my opinion, R. v. Siggins should
be applied in the instant case rather than R. v. Van Dorn, the facts of
which are clearly distinguishable from the instant case. The Crown has proved
beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant-defendant was one of those who
stole the goods, and that he had continuous possession of the goods until they
were found by the R.C.M.P. some hours after the theft.

In Regina v. St-Jean supra, St-Jean, as
in the two preceding cases, was simultaneously charged with theft and unlawful
possession of the stolen property. Asked to plead to these charges, appellant
pleaded not guilty to theft and guilty to unlawful possession. The Crown objected
to acceptance of the plea of guilty. The objection was dismissed and the judge
acquitted St-Jean of the theft charge, saying he had no alternative but to do
so. The Crown appealed from this acquittal. The Court of Appeal, composed of
Tremblay C.J.A. and Casey, Rinfret, Hyde and Rivard JJ.A., allowed the appeal,
held that the acquittal on the theft charge was unjustified, quashed this
acquittal and ordered that trial be held on the charge. Casey and Hyde JJ.A.
would also, for their part, have quashed the conviction on the charge of
unlawful possession while retaining in the record the plea of guilty, in order
to give it its full effect in the event of an acquittal on the theft charge.
Only Tremblay C.J.A. and Rinfret J.A. expressed an opinion on the question
whether in law a person could be convicted of both theft and unlawful
possession of the stolen property. The learned Chief Justice, whose opinion was
concurred in by Rinfret J.A., made a point of observing that prior decisions
were divided on the point, and indeed referred to several decisions, including

[Page 315]

those mentioned above. The ratio for the
affirmative answer he gives to the question may be found at the bottom of
p. 195 in the report:

[TRANSLATION] Section 296  of the Criminal
Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c.
51, creates an entirely new offence. There is no question of receiving (réception)
or of retaining (rétention). The essence of the offence is having
in one’s possession.

It should be noted at this point that in the
present case Hyde J.A. concurs in the reasons given by Salvas J.A. in support
of the judgment a quo, as may be seen at p. 109 of the Case on
appeal:

I agree with my colleague Mr. Justice
Salvas that this appeal should be maintained and a new trial ordered. The case
is to be distinguished from that of the Queen vs. St. Jean 1971
C.A. 73, which dealt with very different circumstances.

I share with my colleague the view that
there may be a separate and distinct offence of unlawful possession committed
where there is a substantial interval of time between his taking possession as
the thief and the possession of the same effects in full or in part at a later
date. This, as my colleague points out, was recognized by the Court of Appeal
of British Columbia in R.
vs. Van Dorn 25 C.R. 151 from the opinion of the Court given by Coady J. at
page 152…

It might be worthwhile to pursue the matter and
refer to decisions in which Courts have held differently, were it not that the
basic point of difference is that the one point of view recognizes, and the
other, be it said with the greatest respect, fails to appreciate, that the text
of s. 296  differs in substance from that of s. 399 in the former
Code, and accordingly, as required in such a case by s. 36(f) of
the Interpretation Act (supra), the new enactment is to be held
to operate as new law and is not to be construed and have effect as declaratory
of the law as

[Page 316]

contained in the former enactment. However, one
comment should be made on the decision of this Court in Fergusson v. R.
supra. The question which the Court had to decide, and did decide, in that
case, was whether the offence of unlawful possession was an offence included in
that of robbery, and not, as in the case at bar, whether the same person may be
convicted of both theft and unlawful possession with respect to the same
property.

In concluding, I would say that, in order to
find that Coté did commit two different offences respecting the same property,
it is sufficient to state that if the hiding-place of the property stolen by
him in the district of Montreal has been established and maintained by him for
three years in the district of Joliette, on a piece of land owned by another,
as a consequence of counsel or encouragement given by a third party to this
effect, the third party would, in that case, necessarily have committed the
offence of unlawful possession as an accomplice with Coté as principal, who
could hardly have escaped conviction for that offence by pleading that he had
already been punished for stealing the property.

For all these reasons I would dismiss the
appeal.

The judgment of Martland and Pigeon JJ. was
delivered by

PIGEON J.—On April 26, 1967 appellant Louis Côté pleaded
guilty to several crimes, including armed robbery of a sum of money and
securities amounting to $723,300 committed at Laval on December 18, 1965. Upon this plea, he was sentenced to three
years and four months imprisonment, commencing December 30, 1965. He served his sentence,
and after his release, namely on November 26, 1968, he was found in possession,
at Ste. Béatrix, district of Joliette, of a considerable part of the securities
stolen by him three years previously. Some of these securities were in his car,
the remainder in a suitcase buried underground in a barrel. The

[Page 317]

key to the lock on the suitcase was found on
him.

Three indictments were brought, accusing him of
having unlawfully had in his possession [TRANSLATION] “on or about November 26,
1968”, securities amounting to $8,000, $417,715 and $3,400 respectively,
knowing that they had “been obtained by the commission…of a theft, committing
thereby an indictable offence contrary to s. 296  (now s. 312) of the Criminal
Code ”. The accused pleaded autrefois convict to these charges. The
trial judge acted upon this plea, holding that the accused’s possession on
November 26, 1968 was in continuation of that acquired by him by the theft, and
that an accused who is convicted of theft cannot be convicted of unlawful
possession of the same article.

The Court of Appeal held this conclusion incorrect
in law and ordered a new trial. Hence the appeal to this Court.

In my view the point at issue in this case is
definitely not the same as that involved in the decision of the Nova Scotia
Court of Appeal in R. v. Fennell[6], the
decisions of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Hogg[7] and R. v. Siggins[8], and the decision of the British Columbia
Court of Appeal in R. v. Van Dorn[9].
In all of these cases the accused had been tried on counts of theft and of
unlawful possession. He had been convicted on both counts and the principal
point at issue was the correctness of the conviction on the second count. Save
in the Dorn case, which is the earliest, only the conviction for theft
was allowed to stand, on the ground that essentially only one offence was
involved. The courts held that the taking of the stolen article into one’s
possession was the essential element of theft, and that the unlawful possession
of the article by the accused had

 [Page 318]

been that alone which he had obtained by the
theft itself. In all these cases, the unlawful possession which was the subject
of the second conviction had been acquired prior to the conviction for the
crime of theft.

In the case at bar the situation is quite
different. The charge concerns unlawful possession at a date more than one year
subsequent to the conviction for theft. Assuming the more recent decisions
mentioned above to be correct, the question becomes the following: is prior
conviction for theft of a given article a bar to a charge based on unlawful
possession of that same article by the thief at a time subsequent to the
conviction? Since the trial judge in this case has held that the possession of
the goods stolen by the thief has been continuous despite his several years of
imprisonment, one may, on that assumption as well, ask the following more
general question: When the subject-matter of an offence is a continuous state
of affairs such as possession, is a conviction a bar to a second charge if the
state of affairs subsequently continues in existence?

In R. v. Siggins, MacKay J.A. said (at
p. 287):

…where the appellant was the actual thief
and had had continuous possession of the motor vehicle from the time it was
stolen by him, I think the two offences arise from the one act. The same act
that constituted the theft constituted the offence of having unlawful
possession. To apply the principles of the Quon case it is of course
necessary to treat the unlawful possession, whether, it be for a matter of
minutes or months, as one continuing offence. In my opinion this is so. It
would be clearly wrong to charge a man who had possession of stolen goods for a
continuous period of one month with separate charges for each day of that
period. It is only where the statute creating the offence provides that it
shall be a separate offence or that separate penalties may be imposed for
successive periods that a continuing offence can be treated as multiple
offences…

[Page 319]

This must obviously be read in the context of
the case: only one charge, based on an offence committed prior to the first
conviction, was involved. At a later date the situation is different, because a
conviction certainly does not relate to the future. An accused does not become
entitled to continue breaking the law because he has been convicted once. Thus,
there is no doubt that a person convicted of keeping a common bawdy-house may
be convicted a second time if he continues to do so: this is implicit in subs.
4 of s. 193. The rule that charges must not be multiplied applies to that
offence as to any other; but there is no undue multiplication of charges when
another information is laid after the first conviction, if the violation
continues.

In the Corpus Juris Secundum, Vol. 22,
para. 281, it is stated:

A prosecution for an offence which is a
continuing one is a bar to a subsequent prosecution for the same offence
charged to have been committed at any time previous to the institution of the
first prosecution. However, it is not a bar to a subsequent prosecution for
continuing the offense thereafter, as this is a new violation of the law…

Among the numerous decisions cited in support of
this proposition I would mention only the most recent, Dapper v. Municipal
Court San Diego Judicial District[10]. The
last paragraph of this decision by the California Court of Appeal reads as
follows (at p. 342):

Dapper’s contention there may be but one
prosecution for a continuing crime (21 Am. Jur. 2d, Criminal Law, par. 183,
p. 240) has application where a continuous crime, such as polygamy, is
charged as separate offenses, all committed during the period embraced by the
indictment. It is there held but one offense occurs down to the date the
indictment is found. (Ex parte Nielsen, 131 U.S. 176, 9 S.Ct. 672, 675, 33

[Page 320]

L.Ed. 118). The rule has no application
where the second charge is made after conviction for the first offense. A
conviction for maintaining a nuisance does not license the offender to continue
that nuisance free from further criminal sanctions.

In my view Salvas J.A. was entirely correct in
saying in his reasons in the Court of Appeal that the question whether Côté’s
possession had been continuous from the date of the theft was of no concern and
of no significance in the case at bar.

For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal.

RITCHIE J.—I agree with Chief Justice Fauteux.

In my view the special circumstances of this
case disclose a clear severance in continuity between the offence of armed
robbery for which the appellant was initially convicted and that of possession
contrary to the provisions of s. 269  of the Criminal Code  (now
s. 312 (1) ) of which he was subsequently indicted. In the result these
were two separate offences.

LASKIN J. (dissenting)—I have had the
advantage of reading the reasons for judgment prepared by the Chief Justice but
I come to a different conclusion on the same facts as those upon which he
proceeded. There is, indeed, no dispute as to the facts. A question of law
alone is involved in this appeal.

The accused pleaded guilty in 1966 to theft,
while armed, of certain government bonds (being “robbery” under the then
s. 288 (d) of the Criminal Code , now s. 312 (d))
and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years and four months as
from December 30, 1965. He pleaded guilty also to certain related charges in
respect of those bonds and in respect of certain other valuables and was given
concurrent sentences (none exceeding the three years and four months) on those
charges. He served the robbery sentence, and on or about Novem-

[Page 321]

ber 26, 1968, after his release from prison, he
retrieved the bonds from a hiding place. Subsequently, the police, who had been
tracking the accused, recovered the bonds from a suitcase. The key to the lock
on the suitcase was found on the accused.

He was brought before a magistrate on November 27, 1968, to answer a charge of
receiving (subsequently amended to a charge of unlawful possession), and later
before another magistrate to answer another such charge, and after certain
remands he was committed for trial on those charges. On October 29, 1970, three
charges of unlawful possession of the retrieved bonds were brought against the
accused under the then s. 296  of the Criminal Code , now
s. 312(1) . Each of the charges recited that on or about November 26, 1968,
the accused was in unlawful possession of certain bonds knowing that they were
obtained by the commission of an indictable offence, namely, robbery.

On the opening of his trial on October 30, 1970,
the accused pleaded autrefois convict to the charges of unlawful
possession. The trial judge acted upon this plea and directed an acquittal. He
found that the accused was in continuous possession of the bonds from the time
he stole them until they were recovered by the police, and he concluded that in
those circumstances the accused could not be convicted of the offence of
unlawful possession of the bonds when he had previously been convicted of their
theft while armed, a conviction which involved possession by the accused of
those very articles.

The Quebec Court of Appeal took a different
view, rejecting the plea of autrefois convict and ordering a new trial
at which the accused would plead to the merits. It was of the opinion that the
offence of unlawful possession under s. 296 

[Page 322]

of the Criminal Code  differed from the
offences of receiving or retaining (which it replaced upon the revision of the Criminal
Code  by 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51) and that in certain circumstances, such as
those present here, a thief could also be convicted of unlawful possession,
there being no coincidence of place and time in respect of the possession
referable to the robbery and that referable to the unlawful possession. The
Quebec Court of Appeal pointed to the fact that the charge of robbery recited
that the accused had stolen the goods in Laval in the district of Montreal on
December 18, 1965, whereas the charges of unlawful possession referred to the
accused having unlawful possession at Ste. Béatrix in the district of Joliette
on or about November 26, 1968. The Court conceded that a thief found in
possession of stolen articles at the place and time of the theft could not at
the same time be found guilty both of unlawful possession and of theft. There
would be, in that case, a taking of possession as part of the theft that
admitted of no further characterization of having unlawful possession
independently.

I find it impossible, both as a matter of logic
and of legal principle, to appreciate how, in the face of the accepted finding
that the accused was in continuous possession of the stolen articles, the
possession can, without more, become the basis of a conviction of a separate
offence merely because the charge of that offence relates the possession to a
different date and to a different place than the earlier charge of robbery upon
which the accused was convicted. The bonds were, of course, recoverable,
whether at the time of their theft or later, but the fact that the thief
managed to conceal their whereabouts for a period (without at any time
surrendering their possession to someone else and then reclaiming them) does
not involve any new factor upon which to mount a fresh charge when their
whereabouts are discovered.

[Page 323]

What counsel for the Crown would have it said is
that if the charge of robbery had not been laid until the stolen bonds were
recovered, the accused could at that time have been charged and convicted both
of the robbery as of December 18, 1965 and of the unlawful possession as of
November 26, 1968. I am unable to distinguish this situation from the one that
would exist if the accused, having robbed a bank of bonds and fled with them,
had been apprehended after a chase extending into the following day and had
been arrested in a neighbouring municipality with the bonds in his possession.
As I understand the reasons given in the Quebec Court of Appeal, it would not
be open to convict the accused in such a case of both robbery and unlawful
possession. In my view, to convict the accused of unlawful possession in the
present case is to convict him because he was able to conceal the fruits of his
robbery after that event and to resist disclosing their whereabouts when he was
arrested on the robbery charge. There is no such offence defined in the Criminal
Code .

Reliance was placed by the Quebec Court of
Appeal upon Regina v. Van Dorn[11], a
judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, and it distinguished its own
judgment in The Queen v. St. Jean[12],
which was considered at length by the trial judge in the present case. I wish
to deal with these cases, and as well with Regina v. Siggins[13], a judgment of the Ontario Court of
Appeal. Before doing so, it will be convenient to set out the terms of the
former receiving and retaining offences and the present offence of unlawful
possession, so far as relevant, and also the definition of possession in
s. 3(4)  of the Criminal Code , applicable both at the time of the
robbery charge and of the charges of unlawful possession.

[Page 324]


 
  
  Receiving or Retaining
  Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, s. 399. Everyone is guilty of an
  indictable offence and liable to fourteen years’ imprisonment who receives or
  retains in his possession anything obtained by any offence punishable on
  indictment…knowing such thing to have been so obtained.

  indictment….
  
 


Section 3(4)  of the Criminal Code  provides
as follows:

(4) For the purposes of this Act,

(a) a person has anything in
possession when he has it in his personal possession or knowingly

(i) has it in the actual possession or
custody of another person, or

(ii) has it in any place, whether or
not that place belongs to or is occupied by him, for the use or benefit of
himself or of another person; and

(b) where one of two or more
persons, with the knowledge and consent of the rest, has anything in his
custody or possession, it shall be deemed to be in the custody and possession
of each and all of them.

In Regina v. Van Dorn, the British Columbia
Court of Appeal appeared to have no difficulty in sustaining a conviction of an
accused for both theft and unlawful possession of the stolen goods which were
found in his possession some hours after the theft. This decision simply
affirmed in tighter circumstances an earlier decision, Regina v. Dale, referred
to in the Van Dorn case where two such convictions were registered in
respect of a thief who was found in possession of the stolen goods some months
after the theft. There is no indication, in respect of either of these two
cases, that the possession of the stolen goods was other than continuous in the
accused until he was apprehended with them.

In my opinion, both of these cases were wrongly
decided. Of course, unlawful possession under what was s. 296  is a
different

[Page 325]

offence from receiving or retaining under the
old s. 399. But how different in its application to a factual situation
where the accused has retained possession of the stolen goods from the time of
commission of the theft? Coady J.A. in Van Dorn states that such a thief
could not have been guilty of the former offence of retaining because that
involved knowledge, after the goods came into his possession, that they were
stolen. Is the position any different in respect of unlawful possession which
also requires the same guilty knowledge? And if a thief cannot receive from
himself so as to be guilty of theft and receiving, can he possess from himself
so as to be guilty of theft and unlawful possession when he has had possession
all along?

I am of the opinion that the sounder view is
stated in Regina v. Siggins which is consistent in principle with the
recent judgment of this Court in Kienapple v. The Queen, decided on
February 12, 1974 and not yet reported. In Siggins (which was followed,
in preference to Van Dorn, by the Nova Scotia Supreme Court in Regina
v. Fennell[14], the
Ontario Court of Appeal was concerned with concurrent charges of theft and
unlawful possession against the one accused in respect of two automobiles.
Theft in respect of one of the cars was charged as occurring on or about May
16, 1958 in the village of Markham, County of York. The unlawful possession of
that car was charged as of May, 1958 in the County of York and County of
Ontario. Theft in respect of the second car was charged as occurring on or
about June 12, 1958 in the town of Ajax, County of Ontario and the unlawful
possession as occurring in the months of June and July, 1958 in the town of
Ajax, County of Ontario. There were convictions on all charges but the
convictions of unlawful possession were set aside on appeal. The Court of
Appeal pointed out that it was quite proper to lay charges of theft and
unlawful possession but wrong to con-

[Page 326]

vict of both where the thief is the one accused
who has been in possession from the time of the theft until apprehended with
the stolen cars.

MacKay J.A. invoked the principle expressed by
Kellock J. in Rex v. Quon[15], at
pp. 519-20, upon which this Court expanded in its reasons in Kienapple. In
his concurring reasons, Morden J.A. considered the replacement of the offences
of receiving or retaining by the offence of unlawful possession, adverted to
the judgment of this Court in Clay v. The King[16], and concluded, rightly in my view,
that the changes in the Criminal Code  did not alter the force of the
legal principle that precluded a conviction of the thief, who has been in
continuous possession, of both theft and unlawful possession. As he said (at
p. 314 of 32 C.R. 306):

Obtaining possession of property is an essential
ingredient of the offence of theft. After the theft is completed, the continued
possession by the thief is merely the continuance of the act of theft.

I would add that as no new factor except that of
time (in the sense of continuity of possession) has intruded since the theft, I
do not see how, in the face of s. 3(4)  of the Criminal Code , that
is enough to provide the basis of another offence.

I am of the opinion that the judgment of this
Court in Kienapple should govern here so as to prevent multiple
convictions for the same matter. It was there indicated that if autrefois
convict as defined in what are now ss. 536  and 537(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code  (formely ss. 517  and 518(1) (a)) was too narrow to cover the
situation, res judicata was available for that purpose. The extended
meaning of autrefois

[Page 327]

convict (beyond
strict identity of charges) may be apt to cover the present case in that
s. 518(1)(a) (the provision in force at the time) asks whether “the
matter on which the accused was given in charge on the former trial was the
same in whole or in part”. Be that as it may, I am content to apply the
principle of res judicata as precluding successive prosecutions for
different offences with a substantial common element where there has been, as
here, a conviction on the first prosecution. In short, this case does not fall
to be decided on whether or not autrefois convict was technically the
proper plea or whether res judicata should have been pleaded alone or in
the alternative. The merits of this appeal are with the accused under the broad
principle adopted in Kienapple.

Finally, I wish to comment on the judgment of
the Quebec Court of Appeal in Regina v. St. Jean. In my opinion, it
does not touch the principle in issue here. It decides only that where
concurrent charges of theft and unlawful possession are laid (in that case, it
was break, enter and theft and unlawful possession) the accused could not
frustrate the trial on the more serious charge by pleading guilty to the less
serious charge of unlawful possession. The Court did not decide that
convictions could be entered on both charges where the accused was in
continuous possession of the stolen goods.

There is only one further matter on which I wish
to comment. The fact that the accused had already been convicted of robbery
before being charged with unlawful possession does not, in my opinion, present
any different situation than would exist if the two charges had been laid in
exactly the terms in which they were successively brought and were tried
concurrently. Just as a conviction of robbery would preclude a second
conviction on the charge of unlawful possession at the same trial, so does the
convic-

[Page 328]

tion of robbery here preclude a succeeding
conviction of unlawful possession.

Since writing these reasons I have had an
opportunity of seeing the reasons drafted by my brother Pigeon, in which he
refers to certain United States authorities. The more appropriate authorities,
in my opinion, are those dealing with theft, receiving and concealing offences,
failing any offence of unlawful possession that we now have in this country.
The general rule applied here in such cases as Siggins is also the
general rule there: see 76 Corpus Juris Secundum, s. 14, p. 18 ff.
In People v. Daghita[17], the
New York Court of Appeals held that a thief could not be convicted of both
larceny for stealing the goods and of concealing or witholding the stolen
property. Fuld J. (later Chief Judge), speaking for the Court, took the view
that the statute making it an offence for any person to conceal or withhold
property knowing it to have been stolen was aimed at persons other than the
thief; otherwise the statute could easily have specified “a thief or any
person” as offenders. He added this (at p. 651):

To conceal and withhold is the thief’s
purpose from the very moment that he gains possession of the property. That
being so, the question arises, when does the thief’s act of withholding change
from larceny…to receiving [or concealing]. The answer we suggest is “never”.

The Daghita case dealt with a situation
where the actual thief was in continuous possession from the moment of theft.
In Block v. U.S.[18],
cert.denied[19],
consideration was given to a federal statute making it a crime “to receive or
have in possession…goods….knowing the same to have been stolen”. The accused
there was not charged with theft, but in an obiter remark in dismissing
an appeal from conviction the Court stated that “it is clear that the unlaw-

[Page 329]

ful possession of stolen property by the thief is
not excluded from the terms of a statute which punishes the unlawful possession
as well as the unlawful receiving of stolen goods. The thief may well be also
the unlawful possessor of the property stolen by him”. No examples were given
where there might be multiple convictions, and it may be that the situation
envisaged was one where a person, although not the actual thief, was guilty of
theft by being a party to the offence and later came into possession of the
stolen property.

This was the very situation that arose in Milanovich
v. U.S.[20], where
husband and wife were convicted of stealing federal government property and the
wife was also convicted on a separate count of receiving and concealing. The
facts showed that the wife had never touched the stolen property until about
seventeen days after the theft by others; her conviction of theft was as an
aider and abettor. Notwithstanding these facts, the Supreme Court, in a 5-4
decision, held that the wife could not be convicted on the two counts. The
majority took the view, as a matter of statutory construction, that Congress
was trying to reach a new group of wrongdoers, not to multiply the offence of
the thieves. In a strong dissent, Frankfurter J. was of the opinion that the
case before him was not one of fragmentation of crimes for the purposes of
punishment. In the course of his reasons, he said this:

It is hornbook law that a thief cannot be
charged with committing two offenses—that is, stealing and receiving the goods
he has stolen…. And this is so for the commonsensical, if not obvious, reason
that a man who takes property does not at the same time

[Page 330]

give himself the property he has taken. In
short, taking and receiving, as a contemporaneous—indeed a
coincidental—phenomenon, constitute one transaction in life and, therefore, not
two transactions in law. It also may well be that a person who does not himself
take but is a contemporaneous participant as an aider and abettor in the taking
is also a participant in a single transaction and therefore has committed but a
single offense….

The case before us presents a totally
different situation—not a coincidental or even a contemporaneous transaction,
in the loosest conception of contemporaneity. Here we have two clearly severed
transactions. The case against the defendant—and the only case—presented two
behaviors or transactions by defendant clearly and decisively separated in time
and in will. The intervening seventeen days between defendant’s accessorial
share in the theft and her conduct as a recipient left the amplest
opportunities for events outside her control to frustrate her hope of sharing
in the booty, or ample time for her to change her criminal purpose and avail
herself of a locus poenitentiae. Two larcenies, separated in time, would
not be merged; what legal difference between the two situations here?

It surely is fair to say that in the common
understanding of men such disjointed and discontinuous behaviors by
Mrs. Milanovich—(1) bringing thieves to the scene of their projected crime
and departing without further ado before the theft had been perpetrated, and
(2) taking possession seventeen days later of part of the booty—cannot be
regarded as a single, merged transaction in any intelligible use of English.
And that which makes no sense to the common understanding surely is not
required by any fictive notions of law or even by the most sentimental attitude
toward criminals.

Even on the dissenting view taken by Frankfurter
J. in the Milanovich case, it is difficult to conceive, in view of the accepted
finding of continuous possession, that the accused Coté as, the actual thief
could be found guilty of unlawful possession as well as of theft. There are
some later state court cases that appear to

[Page 331]

prefer the approach of Frankfurter J. (without
regard to whether the theft is by the actual thief or involves an aider and
abettor) rather than of the majority in Milanovich. Thus, in People
v. Tatum[21], a
California appellate court said this (at p. 184):

We conclude that in the absence of facts indicating
a complete divorcement of the concealing activities from the course of conduct
of the thief in the initial concealing of the property stolen by him, a thief
may not be found guilty of concealment.

This negative dictum was made the basis of an
affirmative approach by the same court in People v. Williams[22], at p. 958 where this was said:

While generally a thief may not be
convicted under the [concealing] section…he may be adjuged guilty of violating
that section…where the theft has been completed and the facts indicate a
complete divorcement between a second concealment and the initial concealment
after the theft.

Although this goes beyond the facts upon which
Frankfurter J. proceeded, it still does not, in my opinion, embrace the present
case.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the order
for a new trial and restore the order of acquittal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Capital murder—Defence of
insanity—Inadequacy of charge to jury—Inflammatory nature of Crown prosecutor’s
argument—Criminal Code , s. 16 .

Appellant was convicted for the capital
murder of a police officer. The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction.
Appellant did not deny the facts, but claimed that at the time the crime was
committed he was mentally ill and therefore insane in the sense of s. 16 
of the Criminal Code . He also claimed that the judge’s charge to the
jury was not adequate and that the Crown prosecutor used inflammatory language
in his argument.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

A study of the evidence does not enable us to
establish on a balance of probabilities that appellant was an insane person
within the meaning of s. 16(2)  of the Criminal Code , and thus to
rebut the presumption of s. 16(4) , namely, that he was sane. Although he
was mentally ill, appellant was capable of distinguishing between right and
wrong and was therefore technically sane. What the evidence reveals on the
subject of the inner pathological process cannot be taken into consideration
under our criminal legislation, which does not recognize the diminished
responsibility theory.

So far as the grounds alleging prejudice
caused to appellant by the judge’s charge to the jury and by the argument of
the Crown prosecutor are concerned, there is nothing that could be the basis of
intervention by this Court.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal

dismissed.

Réal Chartrand, (in person).

François Beaudoin, for the respondent.

[Page 315]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DE GRANDPRE J.—Upon being convicted for the
capital murder of police officer Gabriel Labelle, which was committed on
October 12, 1971, appellant brought an appeal to the Court of Appeal which
dismissed it unanimously. He now asks this Court to grant him a new trial.

Appellant appeared at the hearing alone, having
dispensed with the services of his counsel a few weeks earlier. It should be
added, however, that the latter had first prepared the brief that was submitted
to the Court by Chartrand, who referred to it frequently during the hearing.

As emphasized by Gagnon J., speaking for the
Court of Appeal, and as admitted in the brief presented by appellant, the
latter had without any doubt committed the homicide. The grounds of appeal of
appellant are of a different nature and the inscription in appeal expresses
them in the following terms, to which I do not think I should make any
alteration:

[TRANSLATION] 1. Did the Court of Appeal
err in ruling that even if the judge, in his charge to the jury, did not make
an adequate summary of the defence by “not dealing with the observations of the
expert witnesses concerning the pre-psychotic tendencies of the accused”, no
prejudice had been caused to appellant?

2. Did the Court of Appeal err in
dismissing the appeal, even though the judge did not outline the defence theory
to the jury?

3. Did the Court of Appeal err in ruling
that the evidence did not establish that appellant, although mentally ill, was
not insane in the sense of s. 16  of the Criminal Code ?

4. Did the Court of Appeal err in ruling
that the argument of counsel for the prosecution was not inflammatory and was
not prejudicial to the accused?

The main ground is unquestionably the third one
and I am dealing with it forthwith in order to determine whether the Court of
Appeal was justified in holding that, in the words of Gagnon J.:

[TRANSLATION] It must therefore be
concluded—and the evidence taken as a whole, as well as the evidence most
favourable to appellant considered separately, does

[Page 316]

not leave any alternative—that although
Chartrand was mentally ill, he was not an insane person in the sense of
s. 16(2)  of the Criminal Code .

The starting point of the analysis undertaken by
the Court of Appeal, the conclusion of which is to be found in the paragraph
which I have just quoted, is evidently s. 16  of the Criminal Code . The
reasons of Gagnon J. contain the assumption made by the Court of Appeal:

[TRANSLATION] Starting from the presumption
that Chartrand was sane, (Cr. C. s. 16(4)), the Court must
determine whether it was established, not beyond all reasonable doubt but on a
balance of probabilities, that appellant was an insane person, that is to say:

“(having) disease of the mind to an extent
that renders him incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of an act or
omission or of knowing that an act or omission is wrong” (s. 16(2)  Cr. C).

This statement is unassailable and there was no
criticism of it by appellant.

Does the detailed study of the evidence relating
to the defence of insanity undertaken by the Court of Appeal, which I shall not
reiterate here, justify its conclusion that on October 12, 1971, appellant was
not insane within the meaning of s. 16  of the Criminal Code ? After
a careful reading of all the relevant testimony, I have no hesitation in
stating my concurrence with this conclusion. The following extract taken from
the cross-examination by the Crown prosecutor of Dr. A. Maufette, who was
treating appellant at the Institut Pinel, is particularly enlightening:

[TRANSLATION] Q. Well then, Doctor, the
question is: according to the examinations you made of the accused and the
treatments you gave him in the days preceding October twelfth (12), nineteen
hundred and seventy-one (1971), was Mr. Chartrand able to understand the
nature and quality of his actions?

A. Yes.

Q. Was his mental condition such that he
was able to distinguish between right and wrong?

A. Yes.

Q. Similarly, according to what you know
about October twelfth (12), nineteen hundred and seventy-one (1971), was
Mr. Chartrand, on October twelfth (12), nineteen hundred and seventy-one

[Page 317]

(1971), the date on which whatever… the
events with which he is charged occurred, was he not able to distinguish
between right and wrong?

A. Yes.

Q. And did he also understand the nature
and quality of his actions?

A. Yes.

There is nothing in the evidence to contradict
this statement.

Appellant’s argument emerges from this portion
of the testimony given by Dr. L. Béliveau, the medical director of the
Institut Pinel, when he was cross-examined by the Crown prosecutor:

[TRANSLATION] A. …Then “The Mask of
Sanity”, what it says is that… is:

“The psychopathic personality is a
psychosis not technically demonstrable, maximally concealed by another surface
of intact function and manifested only in behaviour.”

What this means is that there are really no
methods of demonstrating this technically in terms of… of the criteria for
diagnosing the illness, if you will. A bit like those used by psy… by experts
to find out whether a person is sane or not according to the McNaughton Rule.
In such an instance the person must, technically speaking, be diagnosed as
being… as being sane.

In other words, it is not possible to
demonstrate technically the underlying psychotic process, okay?

Without going so far as to say that perhaps
I am not of the opinion that Mr. Chartrand is psychotic in all respects, I
did mention prepsychotic a few minutes ago.

Q. What you described to us… your example
of a miracle?

A. Yes, that’s right. In addition, however,
even though I must answer your question by telling you that in this respect he
is capable of distinguishing between right and wrong, and so forth, I think I
should nevertheless add this remark, that okay, I answered your questions, but
there are schizophrenics and there are seriously ill psychotics who… who must
be confined in psychiatric hospitals for the remainder of their lives, who are
capable of distinguishing between right and wrong.

Q. Yes, but that’s not the case with
Mr. Chartrand.

[Page 318]

A. No, it is not, but I think that it is
important for… No, indeed, this is not the case with Mr. Chartrand.

Q. For sure.

A. And still… they are, I think… what I’m
driving at is that this is perhaps not one of the best criteria for determining
in the final analysis whether a person is ill or not. And just as a five-or
six-year old is perhaps unable at any given time to distinguish between right
and wrong, that in itself doesn’t mean he is ill. What I mean is, I must answer
your questions by telling you that he is capable of distinguishing between
right and wrong—he understands the nature of his actions, and so forth—but that
does not in itself mean that there is not an inner pathological process at work
that can prompt him to exhibit a form of behaviour that is unacceptable,
dangerous, violent and so on, as well as a psychotic process that would be
clearly, if you will, obvious in another person.

Chartrand was therefore able to distinguish
between right and wrong, and although he was ill, he was technically sane. What
the witness adds on the subject of the inner pathological process cannot be
taken into consideration under our criminal legislation, which does not
recognize the diminished responsibility theory. Our duty clearly is to apply
the law as it reads, as this Court did in R. v. Borg[1]. The medical facts are summarized by
Cartwright C.J., speaking for the majority: (at p. 560)

It appears to me that if the view of
Dr. Spaner’s evidence most favourable to the accused were taken by the
jury it could be said to show, (i) that Borg was suffering from a disease of
the mind called a psychopathic state and that he fitted into the classification
of the aggressive, anti-social, impulse-ridden type of personality, (ii) that
he had very few healthy coping mechanisms or ways of defending himself against
impulses such as homicidal or sexual ones, (iii) that this lack of impulse
control is chronic, (iv) that a major characteristic of this impulse type of
personality is being emotionally unbalanced by the illness, that the moral
issues cannot be differentiated, that he does not have the moral ethical part
of his mind functioning most of his life but ‘most important of all he can have
normal cognitive functioning—that is the knowing part of his mind functioning’,
(v) that the impulse is so powerful his

[Page 319]

judgment is impaired but he can still have
intellectual functioning, (vi) that the effect of alcohol is unpredictable; it
can wipe away any controls or it might even calm him; it is impossible to say,
(vii) that Borg hates authoritarian figures and under the influence of his
anti-social impulse driven, aggressive impulses, he can kill, (viii) that if
the force of the impulse cannot be resisted ‘at that moment’, and this is a
symptom of what he suffers from—an impulse—psychotic state—an irresistible
impulse when he neither reasons nor deliberates, (ix) that the irresistible
impulse is both a symptom of the disease of the mind and the disease itself,
(x) that he operates sometimes with normal intellect, sometimes with a little
better than normal intellect and sometimes like a little boy.

These facts were more favourable to the accused
than was the evidence in the case at bar, especially as there were two
additional factors that are not to be found here:

(a) no doctor had stated that Borg was capable
of appreciating the nature and quality of his acts;

(b) Borg’s sister had given a detailed
description of Borg’s unhappy childhood, and of the persecution and ill
treatment to which he had been subjected.

Notwithstanding this, the conclusion reached by
Cartwright C.J. and the majority judges was to dismiss the defence of insanity:
(at p. 561)

It appears to me that the effect of
Dr. Spaner’s evidence is that, in his opinion, at the time of the shooting
Borg may have been acting under an irresistible impulse such as the Doctor had
described. There is no evidence that Borg himself had that view and the
portions of his statement and of his answers read to the jury far from
suggesting anything in the nature of an impulse action indicate a careful and
deliberate plan which it took him some hours to carry out. The actions and
statements of Borg after the shooting indicate that he was well aware of what
he had done and that it was wrong. The evidence taken as a whole falls far
short of being sufficient to satisfy the onus of proof on the balance of
probabilities which rests on the defence when insanity is alleged.

The Court of Appeal was therefore justified in
finding that appellant, at the time when these events occurred, was not
suffering from insanity in the legal sense.

[Page 320]

Logically, since appellant is undeniably the
person who committed the homicide, and since his defence of insanity was not
established by the weight of the evidence, his other grounds are no longer
applicable. However, since the Court of Appeal has considered them and they
have been argued in this Court, I shall consider them briefly. They are of two
different types:

(1) in his charge to the jury, the judge did not
deal with the defence theory and did not make an adequate summary of the
observations of the expert witnesses, which was prejudicial to appellant;

(2) in his argument the Crown prosecutor used
inflammatory language that was prejudicial to appellant.

So far as the judge’s charge is concerned, the
solution is to be found once again in Borg, in which Cartwright C.J.,
after emphasizing that the evidence relating to the defence of insanity was
heard at the end of the trial and should have been fresh in the minds of the
jurors when the judge gave his charge, as is the case here, and after
acknowledging that the judge had neither analysed nor summarized this evidence,
quotes a passage from his charge which substantially affirms the obligation to
weigh all the evidence and discusses possible verdicts. I am of the opinion
that in the case at bar, the judge gave the jury instructions that were at
least equivalent. Furthermore, in Borg, the Alberta Court of Appeal
ordered a new trial because “the learned trial judge failed to review the substantial
parts of the evidence… and to instruct the jury as to how the law was to be
applied to the facts as they found them and thereby misdirected the jury by
such non-direction”. This judgment was quashed and the conviction reinstated,
the majority supporting Cartwright C.J. in his conclusion: (at p. 561)

It is not surprising that the learned and
experienced counsel for the defence did not request the judge to give a further
charge involving a detailed examination of the Doctor’s evidence. Such a request,
if acceded to, would have resulted in the judge having to point out to the jury
how far the evidence fell short of indicating that the accused was other than
sane at the time of the shooting.

[Page 321]

After considering all the evidence that had
any relevance to the defence of insanity I am satisfied that, in the particular
circumstances of this case, the charge on this branch of the matter, considered
as it must be in the light of all the evidence in the record, was sufficient in
law and more favourable to the accused than it could have been if the judge had
made a detailed analysis of Dr. Spaner’s evidence before the jury.

The same conclusion applies in the case at bar.

As to the ground based on the inflammatory
language allegedly used by the Crown prosecutor, we have considered it not only
by reading the text of the printed record but also by listening to the tape
recording which we ordered to be produced at appellant’s request. I should note
in passing that, before the hearing, appellant was able to listen to this tape
himself. Although the language at times was rather colourful, and the Crown
prosecutor on two occasions described himself as a psychopath, which the judge
immediately noted for the purpose of correction, I see nothing in this argument
that could be the basis of intervention by this Court in the light of the
applicable rules set forth in various cases, such as Pisani v. The Queen[2].

For all of the above reasons and for those given
by Gagnon J., I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Parole—Suspension on eve of
expiry of sentence—Revocation after expiry date of sentence—Accused not made
aware of reasons which prompted person designated by Board to suspend parole
and reasons which later prompted Board to revoke parole—Whether accused
entitled to writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid—Whether
s. 2(c)(i) and s. 2(e) of Canadian Bill of Rights, R.S.C. 1970, App.
III, applicable—Parole Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. P-2, ss. 16, 20.

The appellant was sentenced to a total term
of imprisonment of three years and two months following his conviction of a
number of offences. His term of imprisonment began on November 2, 1970, and was
to expire on January 1, 1974.
On November 9, 1971, he was released on parole which was suspended on September 6, 1972. The suspension was cancelled
on September 20, 1972, and the parole was continued. On December 24, 1973, the appellant was arrested
without reason or explanation but he learned from a warrant of committal of
December 27, 1973, that his parole had been suspended on December 24, 1973. He remained in custody
pursuant to the suspension past what would otherwise have been his release date
of January 1, 1974, and was still in custody on February 8, 1974, when the National Parole
Board by a warrant of apprehension of that date revoked his parole. Finally, by
a magistrate’s warrant of committal dated March 5, 1974, which, inter alia, recited
the revocation of parole, the appellant was committed to prison to serve again
a substantial portion of the term to which he was originally sentenced.

An application by the appellant for habeas
corpus with certiorari in aid was dismissed by the Manitoba Court of
Queen’s Bench. The dismissal was affirmed by

[Page 571]

the Court of Appeal and the appellant then
appealed to this Court.

Held (Laskin
C.J., Spence and Dickson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland
and de Grandpré JJ.: There was no violation of s. 16(1) of the Parole Act
in connection with the arrest of the appellant on December 24, 1973, and
there was no basis for the application of s. 2(c)(i) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights which provides that no law of Canada shall be construed or
applied so as to deprive a person who has been arrested or detained of the
right to be informed promptly of the reason for his arrest or detention. The
requirements of s. 2(c)(i) were met when the appellant was made
aware that his apprehension and subsequent detention occurred because his parole
had been suspended and, later, that it had been revoked. Nor could the
appellant rely on s. 2(e) of the Bill of Rights, which
provides that no law of Canada
shall be construed or applied so as to deprive a person of the right to a fair
hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for the
determination of his rights and obligations. Ex p. McCaud, [1965] 1
C.C.C. 168, decided that the provisions of s. 2(e) do not
apply to the question of the revocation of parole under the provisions of the Parole
Act and the subsequent amendments to the Act do not in any way alter the
principle stated in that case.

Per Judson,
Ritchie, Pigeon and Beetz JJ.: The essence of parole is that it is a privilege
accorded to certain prisoners in the discretion of the Parole Board and not a
right to which all prison inmates are entitled. The Parole Board is a statutory
body clothed with an unfettered discretion in the administration of the Parole
Act and is not bound to act on a judicial or quasi‑judicial basis. The
very nature of the task assigned to the Board makes it necessary that it be
clothed with as wide a discretion as possible and that its decision should not
be open to question on appeal or otherwise be subject to the same procedures as
those which accompany the review of decision of a judicial or quasi-judicial
tribunal.

It was within the power of the Board at its
discretion to revoke the parole of an inmate after the expiration of his
sentence if at the time of such revocation he was in custody pursuant to
s. 16, as the appellant was at the time of revocation in this case. The
statements contained in the appellant’s affidavits to the effect that he was
not given any reason for his arrest were not properly before

[Page 572]

the Court on his application. The
jurisdiction of the Court was confined to a consideration of the facts
contained on the face of the warrants.

A writ of certiorari would not lie to
inquire into and review the administrative acts of the Board, including its act
in causing the appellant’s parole to be suspended on December 24th and the
manner in which such suspension was effected, and, in any event, having regard
to the terms of s. 18  of the Federal Court Act , 1970-71-72 (Can.),
c. 1, the Court of Queen’s Bench of Manitoba would have no jurisdiction to
issue a writ of certiorari.

Ex p. McCaud, [1965] 1 C.C.C. 168; Howarth v. National Parole Board, [1976]
1 S.C.R. 453; Re Shumiatcher, [1962] S.C.R. 38; Security Export
Co. v. Hetherington, [1923] S.C.R. 539; Commonwealth of Puerto Rico v.
Hernandez, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 228, followed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Dickson J., dissenting: The contention that certiorari
in aid of habeas corpus was not open to the appellant in a
provincial superior Court because exclusive jurisdiction to invoke certiorari
against a federal agency like the National Parole Board was vested in the
Federal Court, either in its Trial Division under s. 18  or in the Court of
Appeal under s. 28  of the Federal Court Act , cannot be accepted.
The argument that the appellant could not bring up the proceedings before the
Board by certiorari in aid and could not, without resort to them, go
behind the bare terms of the warrant of committal through habeas corpus alone
was without merit. Section 2(c)(iii) of the Canadian Bill of Rights affirms
the right to habeas corpus, and this includes certiorari in aid
to make the remedy an effective one.

There is a marked difference between certiorari,
used to quash a conviction or an order by its own strength, and certiorari
in aid of habeas corpus to make the latter remedy more effective by
requiring production of the record of proceedings for that purpose. In any
event, jurisdictional questions may be raised on habeas corpus as going
to the authority of the tribunal through which detention of a person has been
effected, and defects of natural justice may be within that class of question.
Section 23 of the Parole Act, precluding review of any order, warrant or
decision made or issued under the Act, is not a bar to a habeas corpus proceeding.
Even assuming that it would cover an error of law in the exercise of undoubted
powers, it will not insulate a tribunal against

[Page 573]

habeas corpus arising
from an excess of jurisdiction, whether for want of natural justice or
otherwise.

The appellant, having been arrested illegally
because there was no supporting authority at the time as required by
s. 16(1) of the Parole Act, was still under illegal arrest on
January 1, 1974, when his sentence would have expired. His detention beyond
that date was, therefore, also illegal and he was entitled to his discharge on habeas
corpus. Section 10(1)(e) of the Act, which authorizes the revocation
of parole of a person in custody pursuant to apprehension under s. 16,
notwithstanding that his sentence has expired, does not avail the Board in this
case when the apprehension under s. 16 was illegal.

There was non-conformity with s. 2(c)(i)
and s. 2(e) of the Canadian Bill of Rights. Both
violations of the Bill of Rights were matters of departure from rules of
natural justice which were of jurisdictional significance, and, accordingly,
the appellant was detained under the authority of a tribunal that had acted
outside its jurisdiction.

Howarth v. National Parole Board, [1967] 1 S.C.R. 453, distinguished; Ridge v. Baldwin, [1964]
A.C. 40; R. v. London Borough of Hillingdon, Ex p. Royco Homes Ltd., [1974]
2 All E.R. 643; Alliance des Professeurs catholiques de Montréal v. Labour
Relations Board of Quebec, [1953] 2 S.C.R. 140, followed.

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: Concurs on the view that when the appellant was
apprehended on December 24, 1973, and no warrant of apprehension was issued
until December 27, 1973, he was illegally arrested and no subsequent step which
was taken could have any curative effect.

In Ex p. McCaud, [1965] 1 C.C.C.
168, the decision as to whether the sentence should be served within an
institution or at liberty on parole was merely administrative in nature.
However, the Parole Act was subsequently amended and under the
provisions of the present s. 20(1) when the appellant’s parole was revoked
on February 8, 1974, that revocation had the effect of causing a forfeiture of
the very considerable statutory and earned remission which stood to his credit
at the time of the granting of his parole and, therefore, the decision of the
Board was one not merely of an administrative

[Page 574]

character but one which deprived him of very
important personal rights. There could be no doubt that the provisions of the Canadian
Bill of Rights and the tenets of natural justice apply to such a decision.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal

C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ. dissenting.

appellant.

B.J. Meronek, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Dickson J. was
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—This
appeal, like that in Howarth v. National Parole Board, decided by this
Court on October 11, 1974, and as yet unreported[1],
concerns the exercise and the manner of exercise by the National Parole Board
of its powers of suspension and revocation of parole under the Parole Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. P-2. Howarth came to this Court, by its leave, from a
judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal quashing an application under
s. 28  of the Federal Court Act , 1970-71-72 (Can.), c. 1, to
review an order of the National Parole Board revoking the appellant’s parole.
This Court’s majority judgment in Howarth sustained the jurisdictional
approach of the Federal Court of Appeal that s. 28  was not available to
the appellant because what was in issue was “a decision or order of an
administrative nature not required by law to be made on a judicial or
quasi-judicial basis”. As is evident from the dissenting reasons of Dickson J.
in Howarth, the denial, and indeed self‑denial, of jurisdiction
carried important substantive determinations and

[Page 575]

consequences, some of which have been raised
again in the present case.

The appeal now before this Court, also by its
leave, arises, unlike the Howarth case, from a dismissal by the Manitoba
Court of Queen’s Bench of an application for habeas corpus with certiorari
in aid, a dismissal affirmed by the provincial appellate Court. The
uncontested facts on which the application was based tend to shock from their
mere narration. Mitchell was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of three
years and two months following his conviction of a number of offences. His term
of imprisonment began on November 2, 1970, and was to expire on January 1,
1974. On November 9, 1971, he was released on parole which was suspended on
September 6, 1972. The suspension was cancelled on September 20, 1972, and
the parole was continued. On December 24, 1973, while engaged in employment
which he obtained early in January of that year, Mitchell was arrested without
reason or explanation but he learned from a warrant of committal of December
27, 1973, that his parole had been suspended on December 24, 1973. So,
unceremoniously as far as the record shows, the appellant, looking forward to
his complete release in a week, found himself in custody and facing the
prolongation of imprisonment without the full benefit of his period on parole.
He remained in custody pursuant to the suspension past what would otherwise
have been his release date of January 1, 1974, and was still in custody on
February 8, 1974, when the National Parole Board by a warrant of apprehension
of that date revoked his parole. Finally, by a magistrate’s or provincial
judge’s warrant of committal dated March 5, 1974, which, inter alia, recited
the revocation of parole, Mitchell was committed to prison to serve again a
substantial portion of the term to which he was originally sentenced.

[Page 576]

It is unnecessary in this appeal to decide
exactly how much additional time the appellant must serve by reason of the
revocation of parole. The respondent in its factum made a calculation showing
that the appellant had been in actual custody for 457 days of his total term of
1,157 days. What he will have lost, if the Board’s position is sustained, is
the advantage of the time on parole, being the period from November 9, 1971, to
September 6, 1972, and the period from September 20, 1972, to December 24,
1973. I refer to ss. 13(1) and 20(1) of the Parole Act, reading as
follows:

13. (1) The
term of imprisonment of a paroled inmate shall, while the parole remains
unrevoked and unforfeited, be deemed to continue in force until the expiration
thereof according to law, and, in the case of day parole, the paroled inmate
shall be deemed to be continuing to serve his term of imprisonment in the place
of confinement from which he was released on such parole.

20. (1)
Where the parole granted to an inmate has been revoked, he shall be recommitted
to the place of confinement from which he was allowed to go and remain at large
at the time parole was granted to him, to serve the portion of his term of
imprisonment that remained unexpired at the time parole was granted to him,
including any period of remission, including earned remission, then standing to
his credit, less any time spent in custody as a result of a suspension of his
parole.

As in the Howarth case, the Board gave no
reason for its suspension and for its revocation of parole. Its position there,
as here, was that it is not obliged to give any reason, that it has an absolute
discretion to determine whether or not to suspend parole or to revoke it, that
it is not amenable to court process, whether by review in the Federal Court or
through habeas corpus, and that even if, as here, it suspends parole on
the eve of the expiry of sentence, it is immune from review albeit revocation
of parole takes place beyond the expiry date of January 1, 1974. I should add
that counsel for the respondent conceded that the Board might dally for an
undetermined period before deciding

[Page 577]

to revoke parole where it was suspended before
the expiry date of the sentence. He advanced the suggestion, however, that the
Court might hold the Board to a reasonable period. Certainly, the Act places no
time limit on the Board, and if its powers are as arbitrary as has been
contended by its counsel both in Howarth and here, I see no basis for
checking it in this respect if it cannot be checked in other, even more
important, respects.

The plain fact is that the Board claims a
tyrannical authority that I believe is without precedent among administrative
agencies empowered to deal with a person’s liberty. It claims an unfettered
power to deal with an inmate, almost as if he were a mere puppet on a string.
What standards the statute indicates are, on the Board’s contentions, for it to
apply according to its appreciation and without accountability to the Courts.
Its word must be taken that it is acting fairly, without it being obliged to
give the slightest indication of why it was moved to suspend or revoke parole.
All this is said to be expressed or found in the Parole Act, and is
said, moreover, to be this Court’s view of the Board’s powers under its
decision in the Howarth case.

A prime consideration in this appeal, both for
counsel for the appellant and counsel for the Board, was whether habeas
corpus with certiorari in aid was or was not available to the
appellant, or whether habeas corpus alone was or was not available, and
if available, whether it permitted the appellant to go behind the warrant of
committal of March 5, 1974, for the purpose of determining whether the Board
had exceeded its jurisdiction by acting in violation of the rules of natural
justice or in violation of the Canadian Bill of Rights.

As to the availability of habeas corpus through
a provincial superior Court I have no doubt. Nothing but express federal
legislation directed to such an end would exclude a subject’s right to resort
to

[Page 578]

habeas corpus. There
is nothing of that sort in the Federal Court Act . Section 17(5)  thereof
mentions habeas corpus as an exclusive remedy in that Court in relation
only to members of the Canadian armed forces serving outside of Canada; the Act
is otherwise silent on habeas corpus, which is not mentioned either in
s. 18  or in s. 28 , the two central provisions on review jurisdiction
in respect of federal agencies.

Although not seriously contesting the
appellant’s right to resort to habeas corpus in a provincial superior
Court, counsel for the respondent Board contended that certiorari in aid
was not open because exclusive jurisdiction to invoke certiorari against
a federal agency like the National Parole Board was vested in the Federal
Court, either in its Trial Division under s. 18  or in the Court of Appeal
under s. 28 . Counsel would have it that the appellant could not bring up
the proceedings before the Board by certiorari in aid and could not, without
resort to them, go behind the bare terms of the warrant of committal through habeas
corpus alone. This exercise in scholasticism is without merit, especially
when counsel conceded that it was at least open to the Court to look at the
Board’s warrant of apprehension of February 8, 1974. I do not regard
s. 710  or s. 711  of the Criminal Code  in their reference to certiorari
as having any bearing on the present issue. What to me is more relevant as
an affirmation of the right to habeas corpus is s. 2(c)(iii)
of the Canadian Bill of Rights, and, if necessary, I would read it as
embracing certiorari in aid to make the remedy an effective one and not
simply an exhibit in a show-case.

It is quite clear to me that there is a marked
difference between certiorari, used to quash a conviction or an order by
its own strength, and certiorari in aid of habeas corpus to make
the latter remedy more effective by requiring production of the record of
proceedings for that purpose. In any event, I have no doubt that jurisdictional
questions may be raised on habeas corpus as going

[Page 579]

to the authority of the tribunal through which
detention of a person has been effected, and defects of natural justice may be
within that class of question. In this connection, s. 23 of the Parole
Act, precluding review of any order, warrant or decision made or issued
under the Act, is not a bar to a habeas corpus proceeding. Even assuming
that it would cover an error of law in the exercise of undoubted powers, it
will not insulate a tribunal against habeas corpus arising from an
excess of jurisdiction, whether for want of natural justice or otherwise.

This brings me to the kernel of this case which
differs from Howarth in the significant fact that there this Court did
not deal with the application of the Canadian Bill of Rights. Moreover, Howarth,
strictly considered, dealt with the jurisdiction of the Federal Court of
Appeal, and not with the substantial questions that would arise if jurisdiction
had been taken. None the less, it would be playing with words if I did not
recognize that the majority of this Court concluded that the National Parole
Board was not a tribunal bound to act on a judicial or quasi-judicial basis.
This conclusion was wrapped up in the very question of jurisdiction decided by
the Federal Court of Appeal and by this Court.

The Howarth case appears to me to have
proceeded as much on a classification of the Board as not being a judicial or
quasi-judicial tribunal as on it being involved in an exercise of
administrative authority only. I do not think it follows that a denial of
judicial or quasi-judicial status to a tribunal relieves it from observance of
some at least of the requirements of natural justice. Ridge v. Baldwin[2], and many of the cases cited in it
may be invoked in support of this statement. Whether a hearing must be given,
whether at least an opportunity must be given in some other way to meet an
adverse decision or proposed decision, should not

[Page 580]

be determined merely by a classification of the
tribunal so as to carry the result by the mere fact of classification. Even certiorari
can no longer be said to be the test of whether a tribunal is of a judicial
or quasi-judicial character: see R. v. London Borough of Hillingdon, Ex
p. Royco Homes Ltd.[3]

In my opinion, it is the substantive issue that
a tribunal is called upon to determine, and its consequences for the affected
person, whether in respect of his person, his status or his property, that
ought to be considered as relevant to the application of the rules of natural
justice. Comments made by Rand J. in this Court in L’Alliance des
Professeurs catholiques de Montréal v. Labour Relations Board of Quebec[4], a case where certification of a
teachers’ association was revoked without notice or hearing, are apt here. He
said this, at p. 161:

The only answer suggested to this is that
the Board, being an “administrative body”, can, in effect, act as it pleases.
But in this we are too much the prisoners of words. In one sense of
administration, in the enactment of subordinate legislation or
quasi-legislation, the principle has a limited application; but in the
complexity of governmental activities today, a so-called administrative board
may be charged not only with administrative and executive but also with judicial
functions, and it is these functions to which we must direct our attention.
When of a judicial character, they affect the extinguishment or modification of
private rights or interests. The rights here, some recognized and others
conferred by the statute, depend for their full exercise upon findings by the
Board; but they are not created by the Board nor are they enjoyed at the mere
will of the Board; and the Association can be deprived of their benefits only
by means of a procedure inherent in judicial process.

Moreover, I cannot disabuse my mind that if this
Court could find a violation of natural justice in Board of Health for
Saltfleet Township v.

[Page 581]

Knapman[5], a case involving municipal condemnation of a dwelling as unfit for
human habitation and a direction that the occupants vacate it, there is much
more reason to find such a violation in a case like Howarth and, as
well, in a case like the present one. There is nothing in the language of the Parole
Act to prevent such a conclusion. The discretion reposed in the Board by
ss. 6 and 10(1)(e), its powers under s. 16(4), and the provision in
s. 11 that it is not required to give an interview in respect of the grant
or revocation of parole do not, singly or collectively, militate against a duty
to act fairly in the exercise of its powers.

In so far as the Howarth case stands for
the proposition that the National Parole Board is in no way fettered by any
rules of natural justice in suspending and revoking parole, but may do so
without giving reasons and without giving an opportunity to the parolee to
contest the order or proposed order of revocation, it stands as a decision made
without reference to the effect of the Canadian Bill of Rights. It is my
opinion that the Canadian Bill of Rights puts a different complexion on
this case so as to make the decision in Howarth inapplicable. In view of
what follows, it is unnecessary for me to deal with the appellant’s attempt to
distinguish suspension of parole from revocation by contending that even if
hearing or notice was not required in case of revocation (as appears to have
been decided by Howarth), it was required in the case of
suspension to satisfy the provisions of s. 16 authorizing suspension and
prescribing review thereof.

There is one, to me crucial, point which must be
taken on the facts of this case, entirely apart from the Canadian Bill of
Rights. It is clear that the National Parole Board violated s. 16(1)
of the Parole Act if it authorized the arrest of the appel-

[Page 582]

lant on December 24, 1973, without the previous
issue of a warrant of apprehension. Section 16(1), in its material part, reads
as follows:

A member of the Board or any person
designated by the Board may, by a warrant in writing signed by him, suspend any
parole… and authorize the apprehension of a paroled inmate…

The record does not indicate any warrant of
suspension dated December 24, 1973, or earlier, and the appellant’s affidavits,
sworn on May 13, 1974, and on May 22, 1974, state that no warrant of suspension
was served on him until December 27, 1973, the same day on which a warrant of
committal was issued and served, apparently pursuant to s. 16(2) of the Parole
Act. Indeed, according to those same affidavits, the prior suspension of
parole on September 6, 1972, was not supported at the time by a warrant of
suspension, such a document not coming to the appellant’s notice until
September 8, 1972. The warrant of committal dated December 27, 1973, recites
that Mitchell was apprehended under a warrant given by a person designated by
the National Parole Board on December 27, 1973, thus confirming the affidavit
evidence of the appellant. The only seeming contradiction of this record is in
a statement in para. 2 of the respondent’s factum which recites that
parole was suspended on December 24, 1973, by a suspension warrant duly signed
by a person designated by the Board pursuant to s. 16(1). Even if one
takes this to mean a warrant of even date, this statement is not evidence and
is in the face of the record.

In view of the record before this Court, I do
not think I would be justified in applying any principle of omnia
praesumuntur to the conduct of the National Parole Board. The question then
is

[Page 583]

whether the illegal apprehension of Mitchell on
December 24, 1973, was curable save by his release and a proper re-arrest if
the Board should be moved to that. There was no such release and
re-apprehension prior to January 1, 1974; rather the Board proceeded on the
basis of the validity of the arrest upon the suspension of the parole effected
in December 1973.

In my opinion, the appellant, having been
arrested illegally because there was no supporting authority at the time as
required by s. 16(1), was still under illegal arrest on January 1, 1974,
when his sentence would have expired. His detention beyond that date was,
therefore, also illegal and he is entitled to his discharge on habeas
corpus. Section 10(1)(e) of the Parole Act, which authorizes
the revocation of parole of a person in custody pursuant to apprehension under
s. 16, notwithstanding that his sentence has expired, does not avail the
Board in this case when the apprehension under s. 16 was illegal.

On a broader base, I see no answer to the
application of s. 2(c)(i) of the Canadian Bill of Rights which
enjoins against a construction or application of the Parole Act, as a
law of Canada, that would “deprive a person who has been arrested or detained
of the right to be informed promptly of the reason for his arrest or
detention”. Counsel for the respondent urged that there was no violation of
s. 2(c)(i) because the appellant was made aware that his parole had
been suspended, and this satisfied the obligation to give a reason. This is
rather specious because, if the Board has acted properly, any arrest in the
circumstances is an arrest upon a suspension, and hence it is the reason for
the suspension that must be provided if s. 2(c)(i) is to have more
than an empty meaning. I am of the opinion that the same objection must be
maintained in respect of the continued detention of the appellant following the
revocation of parole. He was given no reason for the suspension of parole, nor
a reason for revocation of parole. I would add that enforcement of s. 2(c)(i)
would

[Page 584]

have the virtue of providing a basis for
judicial review, even if it be a limited one, so as to bring the National
Parole Board to that extent into the class of accountable statutory bodies.

Neither in Howarth nor in this case did
the Board, through its counsel, or in any record material, indicate that there
were reasons that could not easily be disclosed or that, on any ground,
disclosure should not be openly made. The Board has continued to insist on its
non‑accountability. The Supreme Court of the United States, in its recent
decision in Morrissey v. Brewer[6],
stated through Chief Justice Burger that there was a violation of due
process under the fourteenth amendment in the failure to give a parolee, whose
parole had been summarily revoked, at least “a simple factual hearing”. The
Court considered that there was more in parole than mere privilege that could
be granted or withdrawn at the pleasure of the state. Revocation is, of course,
fraught with serious consequences for a parolee apart from the prospect of a
prolonged imprisonment. It may mean loss of job, which occurred here, loss of
conditional liberty, loss of family and other association. Morrissey v.
Brewer supports a parolee’s entitlement to reasons for revocation of parole
so that he may offer explanation or submissions in exoneration or mitigation.

In fine, not only was there non-conformity here
with s. 2(c)(i) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, there was
also non-conformity with s. 2(e) which proscribes
construction or application of a law of Canada that would “deprive a person of
the right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice for the determination of his rights and obligations”. The phrase
“rights and

[Page 585]

obligations” has particular significance in the
context of a revocation of parole. A hearing in the sense of s. 2(e)
need not be a full-fledged adversary proceeding. Between them, s. 2(c)(i)
and s. 2(e) call for at least minimum procedural safeguards
in parole administration where revocation is involved, despite what may be said
about the confidentiality and sensitiveness of the parole system. The Parole
Act proclaims “reform and rehabilitation of the inmate” as central in
parole, provided there be no undue risk to society in the release of the
inmate. This bespeaks some humane consideration for the parolee if it is intended
to return him to custody.

Both violations of the Canadian Bill of
Rights are matters of departure from rules of natural justice which I
regard as of jurisdictional significance, and I would accordingly hold that the
appellant is detained under the authority of a tribunal that has acted outside
its jurisdiction. His appeal should therefore be allowed and there should be a
direction that he be discharged from custody. This Court treated a
jurisdictional defect in this way in affirming the quashing of a labour board
certification order in Toronto Newspaper Guild v. Globe Printing Co.[7] There does not appear to be any
authority to order costs in habeas corpus as there is under s. 713 
of the Criminal Code  in certiorari applications. This is
certainly a case where I would have ordered costs to the appellant throughout
if I had the power to do so.

The judgment of Martland and de Grandpré JJ. was
delivered by

MARTLAND J.—I have had the advantage of reading
the reasons of the Chief Justice and of my brothers Ritchie and Spence.

I do not find that there was any violation of
s. 16(1) of the Parole Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. P-2, in

[Page 586]

connection with the arrest of the appellant.
Section 16(1) and (2) provide as follows:

16. (1) A
member of the Board or any person designated by the Board may, by a warrant in
writing signed by him, suspend any parole, other than a parole that has been
discharged, and authorize the apprehension of a paroled inmate whenever he is
satisfied that the arrest of the inmate is necessary or desirable in order to
prevent a breach of any term or condition of the parole or for the
rehabilitation of the inmate or the protection of society.

(2) A paroled inmate apprehended under a
warrant issued under this section shall be brought as soon as conveniently
may be before a magistrate, and the magistrate shall remand the inmate in
custody until the suspension of his parole is cancelled or his parole is
revoked or forfeited.

The appellant, pursuant to subs. (2), was
brought before a magistrate on December 27, 1973. That warrant specifically
recites that the appellant’s grant of parole “was suspended on the 24th day of
December 1973 by a person designated by the National Parole Board, pursuant to
section 16 of the RSC CP-2 to suspend any parole”. The subsequent
reference in the warrant of committal to the 27th day of December 1973 does not
refer to the date of issuance of the warrant of suspension but to the date of
apprehension. Presumably that date was inserted as being the date on which he
was apprehended for removal from The Pas Correctional Institute to be brought
before the magistrate. Whether that is the explanation or whether the date of
initial apprehension was not correctly stated, it does not affect the validity
of the warrant of committal. There is no evidence to contradict the statement
in the warrant of committal that parole was suspended on December 24, 1973, by
a person designated under the Act. Such suspension could only be made by
warrant. No question was raised by the appellant in his originating notice of
motion, or in the subsequent notice of motion, both seeking the issuance of a
writ of habeas corpus, nor in the Courts below as to the existence on
December 24, 1973, of a

[Page 587]

warrant of suspension, and that question was not
argued in this Court.

I see no basis for the application of s. 2(c)(i)
of the Canadian Bill of Rights, which provides that no law of Canada
shall be construed or applied so as to deprive a person who has been arrested
or detained of the right to be informed promptly of the reason for his arrest
or detention.

The reasons for the arrest and the subsequent
detention of the appellant were that his parole had been suspended and later
revoked pursuant to the provisions of the Parole Act. The appellant’s
complaint is not that he was not made aware of those reasons when arrested and
subsequently detained. His complaint is that he was not made aware of the
reasons which had prompted the person designated by the Parole Board to suspend
his parole and the reasons which later prompted the Parole Board to revoke his
parole. The person designated by the Parole Board was entitled to make his
decision to suspend parole if he was satisfied that the arrest was neessary or
desirable for any one of the reasons stated in s. 16(1). The decision to
revoke parole was made by the Board itself. The Board was entitled to make that
decision in its absolute discretion, as provided in s. 6 of the Act. What
the appellant is contending is that the Bill of Rights requires that the
Parole Act should be so construed as to require disclosure of the
reasons which led to those decisions. Such application of the Bill of Rights
to the Parole Act was considered and rejected by this Court in Ex
p. McCaud[8].

In that case and in the later case of Howarth
v. National Parole Board[9], it
was held that an order of the Parole Board revoking parole was a decision
entirely within the discretion of the Parole Board

[Page 588]

and was an administrative matter. In my opinion,
in the light of those decisions, the requirements of s. 2(c)(i) of
the Canadian Bill of Rights were met when the appellant was made aware
that his apprehension and subsequent detention occurred because his parole had
been suspended and, later, that it had been revoked.

The appellant also relies upon s. 2(e)
of the Bill of Rights, which provides that no law of Canada shall be
construed or applied so as to deprive a person of the right to a fair hearing
in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for the determination
of his rights and obligations. In the McCaud case, supra, Spence
J., whose view was adopted unanimously on appeal, held that the provisions of
s. 2(e) do not apply to the question of the revocation of
parole under the provisions of the Parole Act.

The appellant had no right to parole. He was
granted parole as a matter of discretion by the Parole Board. He had no right
to remain on parole. His parole was subject to revocation at the absolute
discretion of the Board. As Spence J. put it in the McCaud case:

The question of whether that sentence must
be served in a penal institution or may be served while released from the
institution and subject to the conditions of parole is altogether a decision
within the discretion of the Parole Board as an administrative matter and is
not in any way a judicial determination.

The fact that revocation of parole is now
attended with consequences more severe than those which existed at the time the
McCaud case was decided does not, in my opinion, alter in any way the
principle stated.

For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 589]

The judgment of Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon and
Beetz JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought with leave
of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba affirming a
judgment of Chief Justice Dewar of the Court of Queen’s Bench delivered by him
on the return of a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum issued pursuant
to an order granted by Mr. Justice Wilson of the Queen’s Bench Division of
Manitoba, whereby the appellant, Mitchell, was brought before the Court for the
determination of the validity of his detention pursuant to a warrant of
committal issued under s. 18 and s. 10(1)(e) of the Parole
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. P-2, on March 5, 1974, by Provincial Judge Enns,
which recited that the said Mitchell’s parole from the Saskatchewan
Penitentiary had been revoked under order dated February 8, 1974, and that his
term of imprisonment had expired on January 1st of the same year.

The order of Mr. Justice Wilson and the
writ issued pursuant thereto are dated May 22, 1974. The writ is addressed to
the keeper of the Manitoba Penitentiary at Stony Mountain, Manitoba, and
commands him to have the said Mitchell brought before the Court on May 24,
1974, “together with the day and cause and all documents relating to the day
and cause of the taking and detaining of the said Fred Mitchell.”

No appeal was taken from the order of
Mr. Justice Wilson and the adequacy of the writ issued pursuant thereto
has never been questioned at any stage of the proceedings, although it will be
seen that it has none of the characteristics of a writ of certiorari issued
to bring forward the proceedings before the Board for the purpose of reviewing
or quashing any of the orders made by it. Indeed, the order of Mr. Justice
Wilson is an order for habeas corpus simpliciter and there is nothing in
the material before us to show that any such writ of certiorari was
issued.

As will hereafter appear I am, like Chief
Justice Dewar, of opinion that the judgments of this Court

[Page 590]

in Ex p. McCaud[10], and Re Howarth v. National
Parole Board, as yet unreported[11],
establish that the procedures leading up to revocation of parole are
administrative in nature and that even if the Court of Queen’s Bench had
jurisdiction to grant such a writ, it would not lie to effect them. On the
return of the writ before him, Chief Justice Dewar was confined to a
consideration of the facts disclosed on the face of the documents relating to
the cause of the taking and detaining of the said Fred Mitchell. These
documents were:

(1) The warrant of committal issued by
Magistrate Perchaluk on December 27, 1973, under the authority of s. 16 of
the Parole Act which was forwarded to the Court by Provincial Judge Enns
and which disclosed (a) that the appellant’s term of imprisonment was deemed to
continue in force until his sentence expired on the 1st of January, 1974; and
(b) that his parole was suspended on the 24th of December 1973, pursuant to the
said s. 16.

(2) The warrant issued by the Assistant
District Representative of the Parole Board on February 8, 1974 under
s. 18 of the Parole Act which was marked as Exhibit 1 at the
hearing and which disclosed that the appellant’s parole was revoked by order
dated the 8th of February, 1974.

(3) The warrant of committal issued by
Provincial Judge Enns on March 5, 1974, which was marked Exhibit 2 at the
hearing and which commanded the keeper of the Manitoba Penitentiary at Stony
Mountain to take the appellant into custody in that prison “there to undergo a
term of imprisonment pursuant to s. 20 of the Parole Act.”

It will be seen that these three documents
disclose all the information summarized by Chief Justice Dewar at the beginning
of his reasons for judgment where he said:

The applicant was under a sentence of
imprisonment due to expire on January 1, 1974. On December 24, 1973, while he
was on parole he was apprehended pursuant to s. 16 of the Parole Act by
reason of suspension of his parole and was remanded in custody for a review of
this case. His detention lasted beyond January 1, 1974. On that occasion while
his case was referred to

[Page 591]

the parole board for review, s. 16(5)
of the Parole Act provides that a person who is in custody pursuant to
s. 16 shall be deemed to be serving his sentence.

On February 8, 1974, as appears from the
material before me, the National Parole Board revoked the applicant’s parole
and on that date a warrant pursuant to s. 18(1) of the Act was issued.
That warrant is marked as Exhibit 1 in these proceedings.

That warrant was followed on March 5, 1974,
by the warrant of Provincial Judge Enns, again a warrant issued pursuant to the
Parole Act. This warrant is the present authority for the applicant’s
confinement beyond the date of January 1, 1974. I say that it is the present
authority relied upon by the keeper of the prison.

Section 10(1)(e) of the Parole
Act gives the National Parole Board the power to revoke a parole after the
expiration of a sentence, if an inmate is in custody pursuant to s. 16 of
the Act as was the case here.

The relevant sections of the Parole Act to
which the Chief Justice refers read as follows:

10. (1) The
Board may…

(e) in its discretion, revoke
the parole of any paroled inmate, other than a paroled inmate to whom discharge
from parole has been granted, or revoke the parole of any person who is in
custody pursuant to a warrant issued under section 16 notwithstanding that
his sentence has expired.

16. (1) A
member of the Board or any person designated by the Board may, by a warrant in
writing signed by him, suspend any parole, other than a parole that has been
discharged, and authorize the apprehension of a paroled inmate whenever he is
satisfied that the arrest of the inmate is necessary or desirable in order to
prevent a breach of any term or condition of the parole or for the
rehabilitation of the inmate or the protection of society.

[Page 592]

(2) A paroled inmate apprehended under a
warrant issued under this section shall be brought as soon as conveniently
may be before a magistrate, and the magistrate shall remand the inmate in
custody until the suspension of his parole is cancelled or his parole is
revoked or forfeited.

(3) The person by whom a warrant is signed
pursuant to subsection (1) or any other person designated by the Board for
the purpose shall forthwith after a remand by a magistrate of the paroled
inmate named therein review the case and, within fourteen days from the time of
such remand, either cancel the suspension of his parole or refer the case to
the Board.

(4) The Board shall, upon the referral to
it of the case of a paroled inmate whose parole has been suspended, review the
case and cause to be conducted all such inquiries in connection therewith as it
considers necessary, and forthwith upon completion of such inquiries and its
review it shall either cancel the suspension or revoke the parole.

(5) An inmate who is in custody by virtue
of this section shall be deemed to be serving his sentence.

18. (1) If
any parole is revoked or forfeited, the Board or any person designated by the
Board may, by a warrant in writing, authorize the apprehension of the paroled
inmate.

(2) A paroled inmate apprehended under a
warrant issued under this section, shall be brought as soon as conveniently may
be before a magistrate, and the magistrate shall thereupon make out his warrant
under his hand and seal for the recommitment of the inmate as provided in this
Act.

20. (1)
Where the parole granted to an inmate has been revoked, he shall be recommitted
to the place of confinement from which he was allowed to go and remain at large
at the time parole was granted to him, to serve the portion of his term of
imprisonment that remained unexpired at the time parole was granted to him,
including any period of remission, including earned remission, then standing to
his credit, less any time spent in custody as a result of a suspension of his
parole.

In so far as the implementation of the
provisions of the Parole Act is called in question in this

[Page 593]

appeal, it should I think be recognized at the
outset that the very essence of the parole thereby established is that it is a
privilege accorded to certain prisoners in the discretion of the Parole Board
and not a right to which all prison inmates are entitled.

This distinction is in my view of fundamental
importance in considering the true meaning and effect to be given to the Parole
Act and other statutes such as the Penitentiary Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. P-6, which recognize the authority vested in the Parole Board.

The case of Howarth v. National Parole Board,
supra, affords ample authority for the proposition that the Parole Board is
a statutory body clothed with an unfettered discretion in the administration of
the Parole Act and that in so doing it is not bound to act on a judicial
or quasi-judicial basis. The very nature of the task entrusted to this Board,
involving as it does the assessment of the character and qualities of prisoners
and the decision of the very difficult question as to whether or not a
particular prisoner is likely to benefit from re-introduction into society on a
supervised basis, all make it necessary that such a Board be clothed with as
wide a discretion as possible and that its decision should not be open to
question on appeal or otherwise be subject to the same procedures as those
which accompany the review of decision of a judicial or quasi-judicial
tribunal. (See Parole Act, s. 23.)

The conditional nature of parole is well
described by Mr. Justice Spence in Ex p. McCaud[12], which was affirmed on appeal to
this Court and again adopted in the Howarth case. Spence J. there said,
at p. 169:

The question of whether that sentence must
be served in a penal institution or may be served while released from the
institution and subject to the conditions of parole is altogether a decision
within the discretion of the Parole

[Page 594]

Board as an administrative matter and is
not in any way a judicial determination.

As Dewar C.J. has said, it was within the power
of the Parole Board at its discretion to revoke the parole of an inmate after
the expiration of his sentence if at the time of such revocation he was in
custody pursuant to s. 16, as the appellant was at the time of revocation
in this case. The appellant, however, relies on statements contained in his
affidavits of May 13 and 22, 1974, respectively, to the effect that the
officers who arrested him on December 24, 1973, failed to give any reason for
his arrest, and he argues that such failure tainted the validity of all the
warrants subsequently issued at the instance of the Parole Board up to and
including the warrant of March 5, 1974. As I have pointed out, Chief Justice
Dewar in the hearing before him on the return of the writ of habeas corpus, was
confined to a consideration of the facts contained on the face of the warrants
then produced, and in my view the statements made in the appellant’s affidavits
were not properly before him and it is apparent from his reasons for judgment
that he did not take them into consideration. The law in this regard is set out
in the judgment of Judson J. in Re Shumiatcher[13], an application for habeas
corpus in which, after having reviewed the relevant cases and having
observed that the jurisdiction of this Court was concurrent with that of the
judges of the superior Courts of the Provinces in matters of habeas corpus, he
went on to say:

My jurisdiction is limited to a
consideration of the warrant of committal and the other material that I have
referred to—the recognizances and the order of Judge Hogarth. I cannot look at
evidence, whether a transcript of the evidence at the preliminary hearing or
evidence sought to be introduced by way of affidavit identifying a portion of
such evidence.

I have indicated that I do not think a writ of certiorari
would lie to inquire into and review the administrative acts of the Parole
Board, including its act in causing the appellant’s parole to be

[Page 595]

suspended on December 24th and the manner in
which such suspension was effected. In this regard the law has not changed
since the case of The Security Export Co. v. Hetherington[14], where Sir Lyman Duff had occasion
to say at pp. 549 and 550:

The general rule touching the office of the
writ of certiorari is usually expressed by saying that it lies to remove acts
of inferior courts and judicial acts of bodies possessing statutory
jurisdiction, but it does not lie to remove acts which are merely ministerial.

In any event, the Court of Queen’s Bench of
Manitoba would, in my opinion, have had no jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari
having regard to the terms of s. 18  of the Federal Court Act , 1970-71-72
(Can.), c. 1, which provides that the Trial Division of that Court

…has exclusive original jurisdiction

(a) to issue an injunction,
writ of certiorari, …or grant declaratory relief, against any federal
board, commission of other tribunal…

In the case of Commonwealth of Puerto Rico v.
Hernandez[15], at
p. 235, Mr. Justice Pigeon, speaking for the majority of this Court
said of this section:

The scope of this enactment is limited by
reference to the persons or bodies amenable to it, not as in the Criminal Code 
by reference to the nature of the proceedings before them. To the extent
that those matters are criminal, this involves a transfer to the Federal Court
of the jurisdiction of the superior courts of criminal jurisdiction as against
federal boards, commissions or other tribunals. In civil matters, the effect of
the provision is also to take away the jurisdiction of the superior courts of
the Provinces…

For these reasons, as well as for those
contained in the reasons for judgment of Chief Justice Dewar which were
affirmed by the Court of Appeal of Manitoba, I am satisfied that it has not
been shown that the warrant of March 5, 1974, was in any way defective or that
the appellant was not lawfully detained pursuant to the terms thereof and I
would accordingly dismiss this appeal.

[Page 596]

Since writing the above, I have had the
advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Martland. If
I took the view that the contents of the appellant’s affidavits of May 13 and
22, 1974, should have been considered by Chief Justice Dewar and by this Court
on the ground that a writ of certiorari in aid of habeas corpus should
have been issued so as to bring them before the Court, I would agree with my
brother Martland that, having regard to the judgment of this Court in Ex
p. McCaud and Howarth v. The National Parole Board, the
requirements of s. 2(c)(i) of the Canadian Bill of Rights
were met in the present case and those of s. 2(e) of
that Bill do not apply to the revocation of parole under the provisions of the Parole
Act.

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—I have had the
opportunity of reading the reasons which are being delivered by the Chief
Justice and I agree that the appeal should be allowed and that there should be
a direction that the appellant be discharged from custody.

It would be sufficient to reach this result were
I merely to concur with the view that when the appellant was apprehended on
December 24, 1973, and, so far as one is able to gather from the record, no
warrant of apprehension was issued until December 27, 1973, he was illegally
arrested and no subsequent step which was taken could have any curative effect.

In view, however, of my decision in Ex p. McCaud[16], which, as noted on p. 170,
was affirmed by this Court, I feel I must make a further statement. Ex
p. McCaud was determined in reference to an apprehension on June 6,
1963, and it would appear that the parole had been revoked on that day. At that
time, s. 16(1) of the Parole Act provided:

16. (1)
Where the parole granted to an inmate has been revoked, he shall be recommitted
to the place of confinement to which he was originally committed to serve the
sentence in respect of which he was granted

[Page 597]

parole, to serve the portion of his
original term of imprisonment that remained unexpired at the time his parole
was granted.

The majority of this Court in Marcotte v.
Deputy Attorney General for Canada et al., by a judgment delivered on
November 27, 1974[17],
determined that under that section of the Parole Act a revocation
of parole did not entail any forfeiture of either the statutory or earned
remission of sentence provided for under the provisions of the Penitentiary
Act. Therefore, in Ex p. McCaud, I was simply deciding whether
the Board, in exercising its jurisdiction under the provisions of s. 8(d)
of the Parole Act as it then read, which empowered it to revoke
parole in its discretion, was exercising a jurisdiction altogether
administrative in nature. As I there pointed out, s. 11(1) of the Parole
Act then provided that the sentence of the paroled inmate should be deemed
to continue in force until the expiration thereof according to law. It was
under these circumstances that I could find that that decision as to whether
the sentence should be served within an institution or at liberty on parole was
merely administrative in nature.

The Parole Act was amended by 1968-69
(Can.), c. 38, s. 102, and s. 16(1) was enacted in the form
presently found in R.S.C. 1970, c. P-2, s. 20(1), and reads as
follows:

20. (1)
Where the parole granted to an inmate has been revoked, he shall be recommitted
to the place of confinement from which he was allowed to go and remain at large
at the time parole was granted to him, to serve the portion of his term of
imprisonment that remained unexpired at the time parole was granted to him,
including any period of remission, including earned remission, then standing to
his credit, less any time spent in custody as a result of a suspension of his
parole.

[Page 598]

Note the important addition, “including any
period of remission, including earned remission, then standing to his credit,
less any time spent in custody as a result of a suspension of his parole”.

It is, therefore, apparent that when Mitchell’s
parole was revoked on February 8, 1974, that revocation had the effect of causing
a forfeiture of the very considerable statutory and earned remission which
stood to his credit at the time of the granting of his parole and that,
therefore, the decision of the Board was one not merely of an administrative
character but one which deprived him of very important personal rights. Surely
there can be no doubt as the Chief Justice of this Court has pointed out that
the provisions of the Canadian Bill of Rights and the tenets of natural
justice apply to such a decision. I realize that Howarth v. National Parole
Board, decided by this Court on October 11, 1974, also dealt with a
revocation of parole occurring after the amendment of the provisions of the Parole
Act. I distinguish the decision of this Court for the reasons which have
been set out by the Chief Justice in his reasons in the present appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
SASKATCHEWAN

Criminal law—Non-capital
murder—Evidence—Statements—Voir dire—Person in authority—Crown psychiatrist.

The appellant was charged with murder. The
defence called only one witness, a psychiatrist, who testified that the
appellant was quite unable to give him a history of the events which occurred
because the appellant suffered from organic amnesia in reference to that time,
and that this was due to a heavy degree of intoxication. The Crown, in
rebuttal, proposed to call a psychiatrist, D, who had had two interviews with
the appellant at the request of the police. The trial judge ruled that if the
psychiatrist was to be a witness of fact, then the voluntary nature of the
statements made by the appellant to him would have to be established and that a
voir dire would have to be conducted. Crown counsel agreed that the
psychiatrist was a person in authority but declined to hold a voir dire. He
said that he did not intend to lead the psychiatrist to report any statements
made by the accused and that there was no subject-matter for a voir dire. The
jury found the appellant not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. The
Court of Appeal set aside the verdict of manslaughter and directed a new trial
on the charge of non-capital murder. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held (Ritchie,
Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux
C.J. and Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.: The question whether the psychiatrist
was a person in authority should not have been an issue at trial. The only
issue in this case is whether the Crown has a right to call rebuttal evidence
by a psychiatrist on the question of the mental state of the accused in
circumstances where it might be dangerous for the defence to cross-examine the
psychiatrist because of the possibility of eliciting a confession. There was
error in the ruling of the trial judge that a voir dire was necessary
because Crown counsel did not intend

[Page 660]

to lead any evidence of a statement and,
therefore, there was nothing on which to hold a voir dire. The witness
was simply being called as an expert entitled to give evidence on a psychiatric
question, and he was not a witness as to facts.

Per Ritchie, dissenting:
In the circumstances of this case, the statements which the appellant made
were made when he was under the authority and control of the police and there
was therefore a situation affording grounds for a suspicion which could only be
properly dispelled by the holding of a voir dire to show that the
statements were in all respects voluntary.

Per Spence and
Laskin JJ., dissenting: The position taken by the trial judge in
requiring a voir dire prior to the psychiatrist being permitted to
testify was a proper position justified even if his testimony had been limited
both in examination and cross-examination to a statement only that the accused
had exibited a memory of the events which had occurred on the night in
question. It would have been quite impossible to so limit the testimony of the
psychiatrist without a determination that the witness had the factual basis
upon which he could make his assessment. The expert evidence must be based on
facts and those facts must be available in cross-examination of the expert
witness. Furthermore, the question as to whether the psychiatrist was a person
in authority ought to have been determined upon a voir dire. Under the
circumstances of this case, there is no reason to doubt that the psychiatrist
was a person in authority.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Saskatchewan[1],
setting aside a verdict of manslaughter and directing a new trial on a charge
of non-capital murder. Appeal dismissed, Ritchie, Spence and Laskin JJ.,
dissenting.

P.W. Klassen, for the appellant.

S. Kujawa, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Fauteux C.J. and of Abbott,
Martland and Judson JJ. was delivered by

[Page 661]

JUDSON J.—The appellant, Armand Marcelin Perras,
was charged with murder. The jury found him not guilty of murder but guilty of
manslaughter. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal and
ordered a new trial on the charge of murder.

There is no dispute that Perras killed one
Kenneth Henry Knoll shortly before midnight on April 24, 1970, and that Perras
had done a lot of drinking. The defence called only one witness, Dr. F.E.
Coburn, Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Saskatchewan. His evidence
was that under sodium pentothal, Perras was unable to remember the killing and
that this indicated to him that he was suffering from organic amnesia. This
meant that at the time Perras committed the crime, his acts did not register on
his conscience and were uncontrolled by his judgment, presumably because of
drunkenness. On cross-examination, Dr. Coburn said that if Perras had been
able to remember the crime at some point after it was committed, his conclusion
would be that he was suffering not from organic amnesia but rather from feigned
or hysterical amnesia. If he was suffering from hysterical amnesia, it meant
that he knew what he was doing when he committed the crime, but afterwards
repressed his memories of it because of their upsetting nature. This was the
whole of the evidence adduced by the defence.

The Crown, in rebuttal, proposed to call
Dr. Demay, who was the Director of the Psychiatric Services Branch of the
Department of Public Health, Province of Saskatchewan. He had had two
interviews with Perras, the first on Sunday, April 25, 1971, at 5:50 p.m.,
approximately 18 hours after the killing, and again, on Monday afternoon,
April 26, 1971. He had conducted these interviews at the request of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police. The trial judge ruled that if Dr. Demay was to be
a witness of fact, then the voluntary nature of the statements made by Perras
to him would have to be established and that a voir dire would have to
be conducted. Crown counsel agreed that Dr.

[Page 662]

Demay was a person in authority but declined to
hold a voir dire. He said that he did not intend to lead Dr. Demay
to report any statements made by the accused and that there was no
subject-matter for a voir dire. After receiving an adverse ruling from
the trial judge, he stated his position in full in the following terms:

I think I must accede to that proposition
but I should, My Lord, if I may, indicate that the ambit of the evidence I
would have attempted to lead from Dr. Demay in rebuttal would have been
restricted to the following points: The nature and extent of the examinations
of the prisoner at bar conducted by the witness on the 25th and 26th days of
April, 1971. Secondly, the question of whether such examinations were in
keeping with established and recognized psychiatric investigatory procedures.
Thirdly, the opinion of the witness as to the mental condition of the prisoner
at bar on the dates and at the times of the examinations. Fourthly, the opinion
of the witness as to the ability of the prisoner at bar to remember events
which occurred immediately prior to the 25th and 26th days of April, 1971.
Fifthly and finally, the opinion of the witness as to whether the prisoner at
bar was suffering from organic amnesia or any other form of amnesia or any
other form of mental disorder at any time on the 24th and 25th days of April,
1971. I assure you, My Lord, that it was never my intention to attempt to lead
from the witness any statement of any kind which may or may not have been made
by the accused person during the course of the examination. Thank you, My Lord.

In view of these submissions, it is my opinion
that the question whether Dr. Demay was a person in authority should not
have been an issue at the trial. The only issue in this case is whether the
Crown has the right to call rebuttal evidence by a psychiatrist on the question
of the mental state of the accused in circumstances where it might be dangerous
for the defence to cross-examine the psychiatrist because of the possibility of
eliciting a confession.

The Court of Appeal held that there was error in
the ruling of the trial judge that a voir dire was necessary because
Crown counsel did not intend to lead any evidence of a statement and,
therefore, there was nothing on which to hold a voir dire. I agree with
the Court of Appeal. The

[Page 663]

Crown’s submission throughout has been that
Dr. Demay was simply being called as an expert entitled to give evidence
on a psychiatric question, and that he was not a witness as to facts.

The nature and extent of Dr. Demay’s
examinations within the limits stated by Crown counsel had to be elicited to
enable the jury to assess the foundation for any opinion that he might give.
The fact that the doctor had examined Perras a short time after the event
would, in itself, be a part of the foundation.

I have dealt with this appeal on the basis of
the admission of Crown counsel that Dr. Demay was a person in authority.
In my opinion, Wilband v. The Queen[2]
is strong authority against any such proposition.

I would dismiss the appeal.

RITCHIE J. (dissenting)—I agree with my
brother Spence that this appeal should be allowed and the verdict and sentence
recorded at trial should be restored, but as I reach this conclusion for
somewhat different reasons, I think it desirable to express my views briefly.

I do not think that the fact that Dr. Demay
was a psychiatrist constituted him a person in authority, nor do I think that
the fact of his having been retained to examine the accused on behalf of the
Crown is of itself sufficient to convert him into being such a person. I am,
however, of opinion that in the circumstances of this case, having regard to
the fact that the accused was under arrest and in custody at the time of his
interview with the doctor, which took place at police headquarters, the
statements which he then made were made when he was under the authority and
control of the police and there was therefore, in my view, a situation
affording grounds for a suspicion which could only be properly dispelled by the

[Page 664]

holding of a voir dire to show that the
statements were in all respects voluntary.

I am aware of the fact that counsel for the
Crown was careful to preface his examination of the doctor by indicating that
no statements made by the accused would be elicited in that examination, but it
appears to me that the opinion sought from the doctor was based on the
statements made to him by the accused and that the effect of those statements,
whatever they may have been, was therefore incriminating because the opinion so
based constituted a direct denial of the only defence open to the accused.

It appears to me that the difficulties raised in
this appeal would not have arisen if a voir dire had been held but the
Crown did not follow this course. I need hardly say that I cast no reflection
on Crown counsel for this decision which was no doubt made in the exercise of
his best judgment.

It is for these reasons that I would dispose of
the appeal in the manner proposed by my brother Spence.

The judgment of Spence and Laskin JJ. was
delivered by

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[3] pronounced on May 26, 1972. By that
judgment, the said Court of Appeal allowed an appeal by the Crown from the
verdict of the jury acquitting the appellant on the charge of murder and
convicting him on the charge of manslaughter. The judgment of the Court of
Appeal set aside the verdict of manslaughter and directed a new trial on the
charge of non-capital murder. Although that verdict was unanimous, the
appellant had an appeal as of right under s. 618 (2) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.

[Page 665]

Although in a commendable attempt to reduce the
cost of the appeal counsel had agreed on the production of a very scanty
record, counsel for the appellant in his statement of facts, being Part I of
his factum, has set out relevant matters in considerable detail and counsel for
the respondent commenced his factum with the statement, “The respondent accepts
the statement of facts as set out in the factum of the appellant herein”. In
addition, it would appear from some of the evidence which has been produced in
the appeal case and from the reasons for judgment that the appellant was
charged with murder under the provisions of s. 206(2)  of the Criminal
Code  which reads:

206. (2) A person commits homicide when he
causes injury to a child before or during its birth as a result of which the
child dies after becoming a human being.

It was the whole defence of the accused that he
was in such a state of intoxication at the time he committed the act which
constituted the offence that he could not form the intent necessary for a
conviction upon the charge.

The appellant was apprehended by the police at a
roadblock on a highway in Saskatchewan at 2:45 a.m. on April 25, 1971. The
charge was that the killing took place on or about that same April 25, 1971. He
was taken by the police to the office of Staff Sergeant Simpson of the R.C.M.P.
at the Regina Detachment of that force and there detained until about 5:25 a.m.
During the interval, other procedures were carried out and at approximately
3:10 a.m. the officers demanded, under the provisions of what now is
s. 235(1)  of the Criminal Code , that the appellant submit himself
to a breathalizer test. It is to be noted that that section applies only
when the peace officer has reasonable and probable grounds for believing that a
person has committed, within two hours prior thereto an offence under the
provisions of s. 234 , to wit, driving a motor vechicle when his ability
was impaired by alcohol or a drug. The appellant, after demurring, did consent
to such a test being taken. No place in the record before this Court is the
result of such test revealed.

[Page 666]

At 5:10 a.m., the appellant was warned by the
police officer, Staff Sergeant Simpson, and was asked certain questions which
he answered. The appellant was taken to the cells at 5:25 a.m. Again,
there is nothing in the record to indicate what questions were put or what
answers were given or whether those questions and answers were ever submitted
to the jury in evidence. The appellant remained in the cells from 5:25 a.m.
until 5:50 p.m. on the same day and then at the same offices of the R.C.M.P.
the appellant was interviewed by a Dr. Demay.

Dr. Demay at that time was a full-time
employee of the Province of Saskatchewan as Director of the Psychiatric
Services Branch of the Department of Public Health and he conducted the
interview at the request of the R.C.M.P. The Province of Saskatchewan, of
course, was in charge of the administration of justice and, therefore, the
prosecution of the appellant. At the trial, only one witness was called for the
defence and that witness was Dr. Frank Emerson Coburn, a psychiatrist and
a professor of psychiatry at the University of Saskatchewan, who had examined
the appellant for the first time only on September 10, 1971.

Dr. Coburn examined the appellant at the
request of his counsel. It was Dr. Coburn’s theory, based upon his
examination of the appellant, that the appellant was quite unable to give him a
history of the events which occurred because the appellant suffered from
organic amnesia in reference to that time. The organic amnesia prevented events
registering on the mind of the appellant and therefore the appellant was unable
to recall them, that is, there was nothing in his mind to recall.
Dr. Coburn had attempted to assist his examination by the administration
of certain drugs which had the effect of breaking down an amnesia which was
only the failure to remember but finding no memory of these events even after
the administration of such drugs, he concluded that the appellant had an
organic amnesia as to such

[Page 667]

events. Since the appellant displayed no other
signs of brain illness and since there was evidence that the appellant had, in
fact, consumed alcohol at or about the time of the events in question,
Dr. Coburn concluded that this organic amnesia was due to a heavy degree
of intoxication. Dr. Coburn was cross-examined in great detail by Crown
counsel and it is relevant to quote some of that cross-examination:

MR. PICK: All right. Let me just revert to
something you said during the course of your recent statement. You said these
events were performed at a time while he was confused and this confusion led to
an onset of organic amnesia in respect of those events, is that correct?

A. Yes. At a later date when he tried to
recall the events they hadn’t registered.

Q. Yes. Could he have recalled them the
next day?

A. No, I don’t think so.

Q. And if he had would you change your
position on organic amnesia?

A. If he had recalled the events?

Q. The shooting, the killing, the running
away, would you change your position?

A. Well, if he had the memory of the events
which I wasn’t able to get back under sodium pentothal, if he had them the next
day then he could not have been in a position, in a condition, where he
couldn’t register.

Q. That’s right.

THE COURT: That is, there could not have
been a failure of registration?

A. There could not have been a failure of
registration. His brain must have been capable of registering. And if it were
then I couldn’t say that he had an organic amnesia.

MR. PICK: Your position would be changed I
take it?

A. Yes.

Q. Right. And if I were to suggest to you
that the next following day, namely April 27th, he could remember the critical
period in fair detail, in other words I’m giving you two consecutive days, I
take it for granted that you would alter

[Page 668]

your position and say that he couldn’t have
had organic amnesia?

A. Yes, it makes no difference whether it’s
one day or two days, if it registered, you know, to the point where he could
reproduce it accurately the next day.

Q. Assuming, Doctor, such to be the case
hypothetically, what could he have had when you examined him on November 26th
this year if he didn’t have organic amnesia?

A. Well, you know, I said earlier on that
this was not absolute.

Q. Yes.

A. And that’s all I can say, and I never
said absolutely that he didn’t have a feigned or an hysterical amnesia.

It is, therefore, quite plain that Crown counsel
had obtained from the sole defence witness and the expert the admission that if
the appellant had on the day of and several days after the events in question
been able to recall those events then the appellant would not have been
suffering from an organic amnesia at the time he committed the acts which
constituted the offence.

Upon the evidence of Dr. Coburn having been
concluded, counsel for the appellant closed his defence and Crown counsel
called Dr. Maurice E. Demay in rebuttal. So soon as Crown counsel had
caused this witness to identify himself, list his qualifications and state that
he had examined the appellant, the learned trial judge excluded the jury for
the balance of that day and through part of the next day. The learned trial
judge heard argument from counsel for both the Crown and the appellant as to
whether it was necessary to conduct a voir dire and determine that the
evidence which Dr. Demay would be giving was voluntary in view of it being
admissions to a person in authority. The learned trial judge concluded that the
evidence of Dr. Demay could not be submitted to the jury without such a
voir dire. Counsel for the Crown refused to put forward his witness in a voir
dire and it would appear that the rebuttal then concluded. The jury
returned a verdict of manslaughter only.

[Page 669]

Although Crown counsel stressed in his
submissions to the learned trial judge and again in the Court of Appeal for
Saskatchewan, and in this Court, that it was not his intention of adducing from
Dr. Demay “one jot or tittle of what the accused told” Dr. Demay,
there were other submissions made by said counsel which would indicate that
even in the evidence which the Crown would adduce such statements by the
accused to Dr. Demay would have to have been recounted. Counsel for the
Crown on one occasion said:

All right. I say this witness, with
respect, in rebuttal to what we have heard from Dr. Coburn has the right
to lay a professional groundwork for his opinion which he will no doubt express
if he’s asked to do so, and to do that he has to disclose to the Jury the
nature and extent of the examinations he conducted. I’m not suggesting for a
minute that he should say “one jot or tittle of what the accused told” him.

It is difficult to understand how the witness
could disclose to the jury the nature and extent of the examinations he
conducted, being a psychiatric examination, without saying “one jot or tittle”
of what the accused told him. Again, counsel for the Crown said:

But let’s again speak hypothetically, My
Lord. Is it fair for this witness to tell the Jury that he, this witness,
reviewed the recent memories of the accused with him and that his memory was
relatively clear and cogent at that time of all the events of April 24th-25th?
That’s what I have to rebut.

I view the witness recounting that he reviewed
the recent memories of the accused with him and that his memory was relatively clear
and cogent at that time [i.e., the 25th to 27th of April] of all the events of
April 24 and 25 as being a plain statement that the witness would have to make
a statement as to what the accused had said in reference to that period. Under
these circumstances, and considering the evidence which was proposed to be
adduced from Dr. Demay as factual evidence, it becomes crucial to
determine whether or not Dr. Demay

[Page 670]

was on those 25th and 27th days of April a
person in authority. Indeed, counsel for the Crown at the trial stated not once
but on many occasions that he could not deny that Dr. Demay was a person
in authority. Had counsel for the Crown taken any other position, then it would
have been perfectly proper to have held a voir dire on not only whether
the statements were voluntary in the meaning given to them in a series of
Canadian cases terminating in The Queen v. Fitton[4], but whether Dr. Demay was, in
the particular circumstances of the particular case, a person in authority: Loiselle
v. The Queen[5]; R. v.
Pettipiece[6].

Indeed, after the admission made by
Dr. Coburn in his cross-examination by Crown counsel, the only important
evidence which the Crown required to answer Dr. Coburn’s diagnosis was by
Dr. Coburn’s own admission proof of the fact that the appellant had a
memory on the 25th and 27th days of April of the events which had occurred
on the 24th-25th days of that month. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the
position taken by the learned trial judge in requiring a voir dire prior
to Dr. Demay being permitted to testify was a proper position justified
even if his testimony had been limited both in examination and
cross-examination to a statement only that the accused had exhibited on the
25th and 27th days of April a memory of the events which had occurred on the
night preceding Dr. Demay’s first examination.

It would, of course, have been quite impossible
to so limit Dr. Demay’s testimony. If Dr. Demay gives evidence as to
facts then he may be cross-examined on his evidence as to such facts and it
would be improper to permit such evidence to be given without permitting such
cross-examination. According to Dr. Coburn, the symptoms of the organic
amnesia were, amongst others, a spotty memory, and if Dr.

[Page 671]

Demay had been permitted to testify that the
appellant had a clear memory of events of that night then it was
incumbent upon defence counsel in cross-examination to attempt to show that the
memory was, in fact, a spotty one, and that cross-examination would lead
inevitably into a detailed examination of what the appellant had told
Dr. Demay so that the clarity or spottiness of the memory exhibited in
such statements by the appellant to Dr. Demay could be examined and
determined by the jury. Moreover, if, as counsel for the Crown contended, in
his final statement to the learned trial judge, all he desired from
Dr. Demay was the opinion of the witness as to the mentality of the
prisoner, the opinion of the witness as to the ability of the prisoner to
remember events, and the opinion of the witness as to whether the prisoner was
suffering from organic amnesia or any other form of amnesia, in short, the
professional expert judgment of the witness, then that expert judgment could
not be given without a determination that the witness had the factual basis
upon which he could make his assessment. That factual basis is often obtained
by putting to the witness hypothetical questions but it may be obtained by
having the witness himself hear the evidence upon which it is based, or himself
carry out the examinations upon which he bases his testimony. But the expert
evidence must be based on facts and those facts must be available in cross‑examination
of the expert witness: Bleta v. The Queen[7].

In the particular case, the foundation for any
professional opinion which Dr. Demay might advance was his examination of
the appellant including the all important test of his memory of the very
preceding night and therefore this factual evidence would have to be given
either as straight factual evidence or as the factual basis for a professional
opinion.

[Page 672]

Turning now to whether Dr. Demay was a
person in authority, a question which, as I have said, ought to have been
determined upon a voir dire, I do not think it can be said as a rule
applicable to all cases that a medical doctor examining a person is not a
person in authority. As was pointed out by Branca J. in Regina v.
Pettipiece, supra, whether or not a person is to be considered a person in
authority must be determined by a subjective test to determine what was the
effect on the mind of the accused in the particular case. Branca J. was
considering statements made to a police officer who had disguised himself as a
fellow inmate of the jail and he came to the conclusion that when a person does
not know that the one holding out the inducement is a person in authority then
the authority of that person can have no effect on the mind of the accused
making a statement. Two illustrations occur, firstly, the one from Regina v.
Pettipiece of a police officer disguising himself as an inmate of the jail
where the accused could not be considered to have made a statement to a person
in authority, and, on the other hand, a person having no authority whatsoever
clothing himself in the guise of a police officer and vehemently asserting
authority. In the latter case, in my view, unless the statement were voluntary
in the legal sense, it was not admissible despite the true utter lack of
authority of the person who received it. Woods J.A., in giving reasons for the
Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, cited Wilband v. The Queen[8], in which in turn was cited Regina
v. McKenzie[9]. In
both of those cases, the doctors who were giving evidence were doctors who had
been required to examine a prisoner in order to give the psychiatric evidence
required by what is now s. 689  of the Criminal Code .

In those cases, there was no question of guilt
or innocence. The accused person had already been convicted and what was left
to determine was whether he should be adjudged to have the

[Page 673]

status of a dangerous sexual offender.
Therefore, the problem of admissions against interest by the accused simply did
not come up for decision and, in my view, the statement of the present Chief
Justice of this Court in Wilband v. The Queen at pp. 20-21 is applicable
only to the situation dealt with in that case. In the present case, the
circumstances are very different indeed.

The accused was being held, either charged with
or suspected of murder, in the offices of the R.C.M.P. in Regina and had, in
fact, been confined to a cell for about twelve hours. At the request of the
police, he was examined by Dr. Demay and the purpose of the examination
could only have been to meet a plea of lack of intent due to intoxication. It
was quite evident in the cross-examination of Dr. Coburn that when this
defence was advanced by counsel for the accused, it was the intention of the
Crown to adduce the evidence of Dr. Demay to meet that defence. In short,
the examination by Dr. Demay and the attempt to produce his evidence was
part of the prosecution of the accused person and Dr. Demay might well be
described as part of the prosecution team just as much as the said Staff
Sergeant, the officer who arrested the appellant, or any of the others. Under
such circumstances, and applying the subjective test that we should apply, I
have no reason to doubt that Dr. Demay was a person in authority.

Finally, it is said, perhaps in an attempt to
have applied the provisions of what is now s. 613(1)(b)(iii), that
whatever factual evidence would have been given by Dr. Demay as to
statements made to him by the appellant could not have been accepted as
evidence of the truth or falsity of their contents but only as the material
upon which Dr. Demay could base his opinion and that had such evidence
gone in before the jury it would have been the duty of the learned trial judge
to so instruct the jury in his charge. That kind of submission is most
attractive as a legal theory. After many years of

[Page 674]

experience as a trial court judge, I am of the
opinion that its practice is well-nigh impossible. If a jury heard detailed
before them statements made by the accused at length on the 25th and 27th of
April of events which had occurred on the night of the 24th and 25th of April,
they would be quite incapable of refusing to accept that evidence as applicable
to the truth of such facts rather than limiting the effect of the evidence to
merely establishing the basis for Dr. Demay’s opinion. That difficulty was
recognized by the learned trial judge and was admitted by the Crown counsel in
the following exchange:

THE COURT: Because he happens to be a
psychiatrist sent there by the Crown to examine the accused does this make that
admissble? Can I say to the Jury you recognize this evidence for what it is,
that is, psychiatric evidence to rebut Dr. Coburn but not to determine the
guilt or innocence of the accused as to whether or not he did the shooting?

MR. PICK: No, I don’t think you can. THE
COURT: I can’t.

I could not justify the use of s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
under these circumstances.

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and
restore the verdict of the jury and the sentence of the learned trial judge.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Narcotics—Trafficking—Drug sold
to undercover agent—Accused taking money—Delivery by another person—Criminal
Code , 21—Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N-1, s. 4(1).

Criminal law—Appeal—Question of law alone.

A, an undercover agent, told L that he would
love to have some hashish. L introduced A to the accused who said that he was
on his way to get some and that the price was $8 a gram. A gave the accused the
money for two grams and L said that he would go with the accused and return
with the drug. Some twenty minutes later L met A in the washroom of a beverage
room and delivered the hashish. The accused was charged with trafficking
contrary to s. 4 (1) of the Narcotic Control Act. The trial judge
acquitted the accused on the ground that the evidence was as consistent with
the fact that the accused was acting for A alone as it was consistent with the
fact he was delivering or selling or trading in drugs or offering to do so. By
a majority judgment, the Court of Appeal set aside the verdict of acquittal and
registered a conviction. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held (Laskin
J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie and Dickson JJ.: The civil law of “agency” cannot be applied in
this context. “Agency” does not serve to make non-criminal an act which would
otherwise be attended by criminal consequences. Even if the appellant could be
said to be the agent of A for the purposes of civil responsibility, his acts
may, none the less, amount to trafficking in narcotics or aiding in such
trafficking. If the evidence was consistent with the accused delivering or
selling or trading in drugs or offering to do so, the fact that he may have
been acting as an agent for A would not exculpate him. An alternative view is
that the appellant aided and abetted an un-identified

[Page 650]

vendor in selling, and L in delivering the
narcotic to A.

Per Laskin J.,
dissenting: One who buys a narcotic does not by that act engage in
trafficking, and, similarly, one who assists in a purchase is not guilty of
trafficking through the effect of s. 21 of the Code. The evidence supports
no other purpose than that of aiding in a purchase. It was L and the unknown
seller who were the traffickers.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
of Manitoba[1],
setting aside the acquittal of the appellant and registering a conviction.
Appeal dismissed, Laskin J. dissenting.

G. Brodsky, for the appellant.

S.F. Sommerfeld, Q.C., and J.E. Hodges,
for the respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie and
Dickson JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J.—In May 1970 an undercover agent with
the R.C.M.P. Drug Squad, Constable Arsenault, assumed the role of singer with a
rock band known as the Prodigal Son. The band played in the beverage room of
the Westminster Hotel in Winnipeg. One afternoon in the beverage room Arsenault
said to one Little, “I would really love to get my hands on some good hash. I
feel like really getting stoned”. Shortly after, Little, followed by Arsenault,
left the hotel in search of the accused, known as the Beast, whom they located
on the street not far from the hotel. Arsenault was introduced to the accused
and the following dialogue ensued:

Little (to the accused): We were wondering
if you had any hash?

The accused: No, I was just on my way to
the Diggers (the name of a house in the vicinity) to get some.

The accused (to Arsenault): How much do you
want?

Arsenault: Two grams will be plenty.

[Page 651]

The accused: They are going for $8.00 a
gram.

Arsenault: Do you have change for twenty?

Arsenault’s twenty dollar bill was changed at a
drug store located in the Westminster Hotel and $16.00 handed by him to the
accused. Arsenault had to return to the beverage room to sing and asked the
accused when he might expect the accused to arrive with the hashish. Little
interrupted and said he was going to accompany the accused to the Diggers and
would be returning with the hashish. Arsenault went back to the beverage room.
Some twenty minutes later Little met Arsenault in the wash room area of the
beverage room, and delivered the hashish.

The accused was charged with unlawfully
trafficking in hashish (Cannabis Resin) contrary to the provisions of the Narcotic
Control Act and amendments thereto. Hashish is a narcotic. The definition
of “trafficking” is found in s. 2 of the Act:

(a) to manufacture, sell, give,
administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute, or

(b) to offer to do anything
mentioned in paragraph (a);

otherwise than under the authority of the
Act or the regulations.

Section 21(1)  of the Criminal Code  provides
that anyone who does or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding any
person to commit an offence or abets any person in committing it is a party to
the offence. It follows that anyone who sells or delivers hashish or offers to
do so, or does anything for the purpose of aiding another person to do so, is
guilty of an offence.

At the conclusion of the trial of the accused in
County Court Judges’ Criminal Court, Thompson C.C.J. said:

I find that the facts in evidence which
have been placed before the Court have not established trafficking as defined
in the Narcotics Control Act, beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence indicates
it is as consistent with the fact that this accused was acting for Arsenault
alone as it is consistent with the fact he was delivering or selling or trading
in drugs or offering to do so.

[Page 652]

It seems to me that there is not a clear
case here of proof of trafficking, and I am finding the accused not guilty.

It seems manifest that Thompson C.C.J. relied on
what was said by Jessup J.A. in Regina v. Madigan[2]:

It is not an offence under the statute to
purchase controlled drugs. Accordingly, no criminal liability would attach to
the acts of the accused if he had been the purchaser. It follows that similarly
no criminal liability attaches to such acts if they were on behalf of the
purchaser as his agent. In my opinion, on the peculiar facts of this case, it
cannot be said they are consistent only with the accused acting as an agent
either for the vendor or for both the vendor and the purchaser; they are
equally consistent with him acting as an agent for the purchaser alone.

An appeal from the judgment of Thompson C.C.J.
was taken to the Court of Appeal of Manitoba[3]
and that Court by a majority, Freedman C.J.M. dissenting, allowed the appeal,
set aside the verdict of acquittal and registered a conviction against the
accused. Freedman C.J.M. held that the judgment did not involve a question of
law alone and, therefore, the appeal failed for lack of jurisdiction.

As I read the judgment of Thompson C.C.J., he
found the evidence placed before him to be consistent with the fact that the
accused was acting as an agent for Arsenault in the purchase, and consistent
with the fact that the accused was delivering or selling drugs or offering to
do so. Then, seemingly applying the rule in Hodge’s case, and finding
the evidence equally consistent with two alternative theories, the one pointing
to innocence and the other to guilt, he acquitted the appellant. The fallacy,
if I may say so, in this reasoning lies in the fact that even if the appellant
can be considered to have been “acting for” Constable Arsenault, it does not

[Page 653]

follow that he could not also have done one or
more of the acts which constitute “trafficking” under the Narcotic Control
Act. It was argued on behalf of the appellant that the words “to buy” do
not appear in the definition of “trafficking” under the Narcotic Control
Act; therefore a mere purchaser does not traffic and an agent for the
purchaser comes under the same protective umbrella. I do not agree. One cannot
apply the civil law of “agency” in this context. “Agency” does not serve to
make non-criminal an act which would otherwise be attended by criminal
consequences. Even if the appellant could be said to be the “agent” of
Constable Arsenault for the purposes of civil responsibility, his acts may,
none the less, amount to trafficking in narcotics or aiding in such
trafficking. If, as the trial judge would seem to have found, the evidence was
consistent with the accused delivering or selling or trading in drugs or
offering to do so, the fact that he may have been acting as an agent for
Arsenault would not exculpate him.

I am further of the opinion that the question
before the Court of Appeal of Manitoba, and before this Court is a question of
law, and law alone. It can be identified readily in the judgment of Thompson
C.C.J., namely, does the fact that an accused is acting as an agent for a
purchaser of narcotics afford a good defence. This question can be asked, and
answered, without reference to the detail of the particular case.

In The Queen v. Lemire[4], Martland J., for the majority of the
Court, said:

In my opinion, the guilt of the respondent
in the present appeal depends upon the legal effect of facts found, or
inferred, in the Court below. This raises questions of law in respect of which,
for the reasons already stated, I think there was error. There is no ground not
involving such questions upon which Lemire’s appeal could have been allowed.
There was,

[Page 654]

therefore, a right of appeal to this Court
and the appeal should succeed.

I would only add this. On the evidence, it was
undoubtedly open to the judge to find that there were present the three
essential elements of any sale: the agreement or bargain, the payment of the
price and, through the aid of Little, the delivery or conveyance of the
property. An alternative view is that the accused aided and abetted an
unidentified vendor in selling, and Little in delivering the narcotic to
Constable Arsenault. Whichever view one takes, the appellant did unlawfully
traffic in a narcotic contrary to the provisions of the Narcotic Control
Act.

I would dismiss the appeal.

LASKIN J. (dissenting)—I have had the
advantage of reading the reasons of Dickson J. before preparing my own. He has
accurately recited the facts upon which the accused was acquitted at trial but
convicted on appeal, Freedman C.J.M. dissenting, on a charge of unlawful
trafficking in hashish contrary to s. 4(1) of the Narcotic Control Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c.N‑1. In my opinion, the trial judge came to the
correct result which I support for different reasons.

Trafficking under s. 4(1) and possession
for the purpose of trafficking under s. 4(2) are serious offences, life
imprisonment being the ultimate penalty in each case. By contrast, mere
possession of a narcotic, an offence under s. 3, is punishable on summary
conviction (by fine or imprisonment or both, the term of imprisonment being six
months for a first offence and one year for a subsequent offence) or on
indictment by imprisonment up to seven years. Trafficking is defined in
s. 2 of the Act as follows:

(a) to manufacture, sell, give,
administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute, or

[Page 655]

(b) to offer to do anything
mentioned in paragraph (a);

otherwise than under the authority of the
Act or the regulations.

It is to be noted that one who buys a narcotic
does not by that act engage in trafficking, and, similarly, one who assists in
a purchase is not guilty of trafficking through the effect of s. 21  of the
Criminal Code . Section 21  makes a person a party to an offence if he
does or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it.
In a broad sense, every purchaser by reason of the purchase may be said to be
aiding in a sale of a narcotic, and if this is enough to make him guilty of
trafficking then on this reasoning every person who aids a purchaser would
likewise be guilty unless excused by the Regulations. This broad sense of the
matter fails to take account of the words in s. 21  “for the purpose of
aiding”. Moreover, since possession of a narcotic is an offence, and there is
an onus on an accused who pleads not guilty to a charge under s. 4(2)  to
establish that his possession was not for the purpose of trafficking (see
s. 8 of the Act), it would, in my opinion, be incongruous to turn a mere
purchaser into a trafficker by using s. 21  of the Criminal Code  to
supply the want of definition. I did not understand that there was any dispute
with this view in the present case.

The question becomes therefore whether what the
accused did should be viewed as done for the purpose of aiding an unknown
seller to make a sale. There is no evidence that the accused himself sold the
hashish or that he transported it, sent it or delivered it or distributed it.
The evidence shows that the accused went away with Little, that it was Little
who said he would be returning with the hashish and that it was Little who
delivered it to Arsenault. There is no evidence that the accused returned to
the place of delivery with Little, and it is clear he was not with Little when
the latter made the delivery. All there is to connect the accused with the
hashish is the fact that Arsenault gave

[Page 656]

him $16 which the accused said was the price of
two grams and that he went off with Little.

If, on the facts of this case, one had to decide
if the accused was party to a contract for the sale and purchase of hashish it
would be an extravagant conclusion so to find. It would, however, be open to
find, as a matter of the civil law, that he had agreed to obtain or assist in
obtaining hashish for Arsenault. Such a finding would be equally open as a
matter of the criminal law if it was an offence to purchase a narcotic substance.
Since it is not, this Court is being asked to conclude that the accused was
acting for the purpose of aiding an undisclosed seller to supply hashish for
Arsenault. Having regard to the burden of proof on the Crown, it would, in my
opinion, be conjecture to come to that conclusion just as it would be
conjecture to conclude that the accused was himself the seller.

I agree with my brother Dickson that doctrines
of agency are apt to mislead if one should seek to apply them in the criminal
law in their full civil law significance. As he says, the accused could be
agent for Arsenault and still be guilty of trafficking if he delivered the
hashish to his principal. That does not mean, however, that an agent for a
purchaser who does not engage in any of the acts enumerated in s. 2 may
none the less be guilty of trafficking. We come full circle here if, apart from
involvement in any such acts, s. 21  of the Criminal Code  is invoked
to implicate such an agent.

What is left then to implicate the accused is
that he may have directed Little to a seller, having received $16 from
Arsenault. There is no evidence to show that the accused kept the money or
whether he did not give it to Little or who paid it to the seller or even if it
was so paid. Little gave no evidence, although he was associated with Arsenault
and was the person who had agreed to bring the hashish to Arsenault. In my
opinion, the accused was not,

[Page 657]

in what he did, acting for the purpose of aiding
in the sale or delivery or distribution of a narcotic unless it can be said, as
a matter of law, that by taking Little to a source of supply, if that is what
happened, he did so for the purpose of aiding in the sale or delivery of the
hashish to Arsenault.

In my opinion, the evidence supports no other
purpose than that of aiding in a purchase. It was Little and the unknown seller
who were the traffickers. The incidental effect of what the accused did was to
aid indirectly in a sale or transportation or delivery of a narcotic drug, but,
again, thus cannot be brought within s. 21  of the Criminal Code  when
the definition of “trafficking” in s. 2  excludes purchase.

I would accordingly allow the appeal, set aside
the conviction and restore the acquittal of the accused. I would add that I
also agree with Freedman C.J.M. that the appeal to the Manitoba Court of Appeal
from the decision of the trial judge was not upon a question of law alone.
Whether the Crown has proved guilt beyond a reasonable doubt does not raise a
question of law alone; and, in finding as he did that the burden of proof had
not been met, the trial judge weighed the evidence and found it wanting. What
he said on the aspect of consistency of the evidence with guilt or no guilt
does not afford any basis upon which to charge him with having erred in law
alone; it was again simply an assessment of the evidence.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Arrest—Assault on police
officer in execution of duty—Arrest without a warrant—Warrant outstanding—Officer
not informed of the offence charged in the warrant—Duty of arresting officer—Criminal
Code , ss. 29(2) , 246(2) , 450(1) (c).

The appellant was charged with assaulting a
peace officer engaged in the execution of his duty. The incident occurred when
the peace officer sought to arrest the appellant against whom a warrant was
then outstanding for his arrest. The officer told the appellant that he was
under arrest for an outstanding warrant. The officer did not know the nature of
the charge with respect to which the warrant had been issued, but he had been
told of its existence at the police station. Following an altercation with the
accused, the officer telephoned the police station for reinforcements but did
not at the time ask the nature of the charge involved. The trial judge
acquitted the appellant of the charge as laid and convicted him of common assault.
The Court of Appeal directed that a verdict of guilty be entered against the
appellant on the charge as laid. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held (Spence
and Laskin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Judson,
Ritchie and Pigeon JJ: The officer was clearly acting under the authority of s.
450(1) of the Code, having reasonable and proper grounds to believe that a
warrant was in force for the arrest of the appellant. The arrest was being made
without the officer having the warrant in his possession and, therefore, s.
29(2)  was applicable. The provisions of subs. (a) and (b) of that
section are to be read disjunctively so that when an arrest is being made
without a warrant, the duty of the arresting officer is fully discharged by telling
the arrested person that the

[Page 641]

reason for his arrest is the existence of an
outstanding warrant therefor. It was no part of the officer’s duty to obtain
the warrant to show to the appellant or to ascertain its contents.

Per Spence and
Laskin JJ, dissenting: A police officer does not give either notice of the
warrant or the reason for the arrest by simply informing the person whom he is
arresting that there is some kind of warrant “out for him”. On the
circumstances of this case, it has been clearly demonstrated that it was
feasible to inform the accused as to the contents of the warrant. The police
officer failed to carry out the specific statutory duty put on him by section
29 and, therefore, he was not in the course of duty when he attempted to arrest
the accused.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], setting aside the
acquittal of the appellant and directing a verdict of guilty. Appeal dismissed,
Spence and Laskin JJ., dissenting.

R.G. Murray and E.J. McGrath, for the appellant.

M. Manning, for the respondent.

The judgment of Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.
was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal from a unanimous
judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario whereby that Court allowed an appeal
from the acquittal of the appellant at trial and directed that a verdict of
guilty be entered against him on a charge that he:

...did assault John Cronkwright, a Peace
Officer of the City of London,
engaged in the execution of his duty, contrary to section 232, subsection 2,
clause (a) of the Criminal Code .

The incidents giving rise to this charge
occurred when the Peace Officer sought to arrest the appellant against whom a
warrant was then outstanding for his arrest.

The Peace Officer had called out to the
appellant at a time when he was just entering his

[Page 642]

house, and when it became apparent that he did
not intend to pay any attention, Cronkwright ran towards the house and caught
up with the appellant just as he was opening the front door, and, taking hold
of his arm, told him that he was under arrest under an outstanding warrant. In
fact the officer did not know the nature of the charge with respect to which
the warrant had been issued, but he had been told of its existence at the
police station. The appellant pulled away and went into his house and when the
officer followed an altercation took place during which the appellant attempted
to push the officer out of the house and the officer, being apprehensive of
what might follow, telephoned the police station for reinforcements but did not
at the time ask the nature of the charge involved. After this the appellant
became quite violent and picked up a large jar or jug from the kitchen counter
which he held over his head and appeared to be about to throw at the officer.
Cronkwright backed away and finally ran out onto the porch where a pushing
match ensued and the officer was pushed down the steps, falling on the cement
with the appellant partly on top of him with the result that his left elbow was
broken and dislocated.

At trial, while acquitting the accused of the
charge as laid, the learned judge convicted him of assault causing injury to
the police officer. It is of interest to consider the doubts which caused the
learned trial judge to acquit Gamracy and these are illustrated by the
following excerpts from his judgment:

Certainly Gamracy was resisting arrest and
in fact was assaulting Cronkwright and was not leaving the premises willingly.
It is simply a matter of the degree of assault, and I would hold that there was
an assault by Gamracy upon Cronkwright, an officer on duty at the time, and the
sole question to be determined was whether or not Cronkwright, having advised
Gamracy only of the fact that he had a warrant for his arrest and without
mentioning what the warrant was for, was in fact performing his function.
Cronkwright, in cross-examination, indicates that he did not know what the
warrant was for and Cronkwright’s evidence is as follows: ‘I told him he was
under arrest for an

[Page 643]

outstanding warrant’. In these
circumstances can the accused be found guilty?

In my view the officer was clearly acting under
the authority of s. 450(1)  of the Criminal Code  which reads as follows:

450. (1) A peace officer may arrest without
warrant…

(c) a person for whose arrest he has
reasonable and proper grounds to believe that a warrant is in force within the
territorial jurisdiction in which the person is found.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this section,
and in spite of his having held that Cronkwright was “an officer on duty at the
time”, the trial judge appears to have concluded that he was not “performing
his function” because of the provisions of s. 29  of the Criminal Code  which
provides:

29. (1) It is the duty of every one who
executes a process or warrant to have it with him, where it is feasible to do
so, and to produce it when requested to do so.

(2) It is the duty of every one who arrests
a person, whether with or without warrant, to give notice to that person, where
it is feasible to do so, of

(a) the process or warrant under
which he makes the arrest, or

(b) the reason for the arrest.

As I have said, the arrest was being made
without the officer having the warrant in his possession and it is therefore
clear, in my opinion, that s. 29(2)  is the applicable section and that the
provisions of subs. (a) and (b) of that section are to be
read disjunctively so that when an arrest is being made without a warrant, the
duty of the arresting officer is fully discharged by telling the arrested
person that the reason for his arrest is the existence of an outstanding
warrant therefor. The trial judge appears to have thought, however, that when
calling the police station for reinforcements because of the appellant’s
violent and aggressive behaviour, the officer should at the same time have
asked for

[Page 644]

details of the warrant for arrest. In this
regard the trial judge said:

Was it feasible for Cronkwright to have
informed the accused of the nature of the charge facing him. Here the facts are
in part contradictory. As soon as the accused asked why he was being arrested,
I am satisfied that the officer could have told the accused that he did not
know the offence set out in the warrant and could have offered to secure such
information either by telephone or by radio, from the cruiser, he Cronkwright
was operating. However, such was not done by Cronkwright. On the other hand
there is no doubt that the actions of Gamracy throughout the entire incident
made it obvious that he had no intention of co-operating with the officer, and
in this narrow sense it was not feasible for the officer either to show the
warrant to Gamracy nor to tell him the reasons for his arrest. Certainly in
retrospect there was fault on both sides.

In my view it was not only “not feasible” in a
“narrow sense”, but it was no part of the officer’s duty to obtain the warrant
to show to Gamracy or to ascertain its contents. The duty was fully discharged
by telling the accused that the outstanding warrant was the reason for his
arrest.

Counsel for the appellant contended that the
provisions of ss. 450(1)  and 29  of the Criminal Code  should be
interpreted in light of the observations made by Viscount Simon in the House of
Lords in Christie v. Leachinsky[2],
where he said:

...a citizen is entitled to know on what
charge or on suspicion of what crime he is seized.

That was an action for false imprisonment and it
is interesting to note that Viscount Simon, in the course of a very learned
judgment, observed, inter alia, that the person arrested cannot complain
that he has not been supplied with

...information as and when he should be, if
he himself produces the situation which makes it practi-

[Page 645]

cally impossible to inform him, e.g., by
immediate counter-attack or by running away.

Although the case is no doubt an interesting one
in the English context and naturally entitled to the greatest respect, I think
it should be said that such cases afford no assistance in determining the true
meaning and effect to be given to ss. 450(1) and 29 of the Canadian Criminal
Code and I do not think that any further comment is necessary.

It will be seen that in the result I agree with
Chief Justice Gale when he said, in the course of the reasons for judgment
which he rendered on behalf of the Court of Appeal:

Here the police officer did not have a
warrant with him; therefore, he was making the arrest without a warrant. But he
was making the arrest pursuant to a warrant which was then outstanding and
valid; and therefore, upon being asked the reason for the arrest, he gave
notice to the respondent that the arrest was being made by virtue of that
warrant. That is sufficient compliance with the provisions of s. 29(2) .

For all these reasons, as well as for those
advanced by Chief Justice Gale, I would dismiss this appeal.

The judgment of Spence and Laskin JJ. was
delivered by

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—I have had the
opportunity of reading the reasons written by my brother Ritchie and I am
content to accept the facts as outlined therein with such additions as I shall
hereafter cite. I must, however, disagree with my brother’s conclusion and I
believe that I can state my disagreement very shortly.

It is common ground that when officer
Cronkwright did not have in his possession the warrant naming the accused
person then he was in fact arresting the accused without a warrant. Under the
express words of s. 450(1) (c) a peace officer may arrest without a warrant a
person for whose arrest he has reasonable and probable grounds to believe that
a warrant is in force within the territorial jurisdiction in which the

[Page 646]

person is found. Officer Cronkwright had such
reasonable and probable grounds. He had been so informed by the officers of his
own police department.

Section 29  of the Criminal Code  then sets
out the duty of a person arresting another and s. 29(2)  has direct
application to the circumstances in the present appeal. It provides:

29. (2) It is the duty of every one who
arrests a person, whether with or without warrant, to give notice to that
person, where it is feasible to do so, of

(a) the process or warrant under
which he makes the arrest, or

(b) the reason for the arrest.

That section, it will be seen, requires the
police officer “to give notice to that person, where it is feasible to do so,
of (a) the process or warrant under which he makes the arrest, or (b)
the reason for the arrest”. It is said that those two requirements are
alternative and disjunctive. With that I agree. The question is what is (a)
notice of the warrant, or (b) the reason for the arrest, and I am
strongly of the opinion that a police officer does not give either notice of
the warrant or the reason for the arrest by simply informing the person whom he
is arresting that there is some kind of warrant “out for him”.

These sections of the Criminal Code  put
in statutory form requirements of common law which have existed literally for
centuries, and the duties of a police officer at common law have been dealt
with in courts of the highest authority. It is true that these cases usually
deal with actions for false arrest but I think they are equally applicable to
the test as to whether the police officer is in the course of carrying out his
duty.

I stress that s. 29(2)  commences with the words
“it is the duty of”. Perhaps one of the chief of those cases is Christie v.
Leachinsky[3] in the
House of Lords, and I repeat the oft-quoted

[Page 647]

statement from the speech of Lord Simonds at
p.593:

These and similar considerations lead me to
the view that it is not an essential condition of lawful arrest that the
constable should at the time of arrest formulate any charge at all, much less
the charge which may ultimately be found in the indictment. But this, and this
only, is the qualification which I would impose upon the general proposition. It
leaves untouched the principle, which lies at the heart of the matter, that the
arrested man is entitled to be told what is the act for which he is arrested. The
“charge” ultimately made will depend upon the view taken by the law of his act.
In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the same words may be used to define the
charge or describe the act, nor is any technical precision necessary: for
instance, if the act constituting the crime is the killing of another man, it
will be immaterial that the arrest is for murder and at a later hour the charge
of manslaughter is substituted. The arrested man is left in no doubt that the
arrest is for that killing. This is I think, the fundamental principle, viz.,
that a man is entitled to know what, in the apt words of Lawrence L.J., are
“the facts which are said to constitute a crime on his part”.

(The italics are my own.)

It is the attempt to carry that principle into
statute which is reflected in the use by Parliament in the words of s. 29(2) of
the Code “to give notice to that person… (a) the process or warrant…, or
(b) the reason for the arrest”.

In the present case, it was certainly feasible
for the police officer to give notice by informing the accused man not only
that there was a warrant in force but the charge set out in the said warrant.
When the officer driving his cruiser approached the accused on the highway, he
testified that he was headed for 26 Redan Street for the purpose of arresting Gamracy because he had been told that
there was a warrant outstanding for Gamracy’s arrest. I find it quite
incredible that the police officer should have been given this information and
not informed of the offence charged in the warrant. Yet later in

[Page 648]

the home of the accused, it appearing that the
accused intended to resist arrest, the officer telephoned to the police station
requesting some assistance. The officer, in cross‑examination, admitted
that he did not request information from whoever answered at the police station
as to what was the charge in the warrant although the accused’s constant demand
was for that information. The constable repeats in cross-examination that the
only information he gave the accused was that “it was for an outstanding
warrant”.

On these circumstances, I think it has been
clearly demonstrated that it was feasible to inform the accused as to the
contents of the warrant and that simply informing him that a warrant existed
did not give him either notice of the warrant or the reason for his arrest.

I am, therefore, of the opinion that the police
officer failed to carry out the specific statutory duty put on him by the
provisions of s. 29  of the Criminal Code  and that therefore he was not
in the course of duty when he attempted to arrest the accused and the accused
cannot be convicted under s. 246(2) of the charge of an assault on a peace officer
engaged in the execution of his duty.

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and
restore the decision of the Provincial Court Judge acquitting the accused on
the charge of the assault of a police officer but convicting him of common
assault.
