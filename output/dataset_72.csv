Judgment:
 
 
 
 
YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 The appellant was charged with driving motor car SBP 9320 J while there was not in force a policy of insurance in respect of third-party risk, an offence under s 3(1) Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks Compensation) Act (Cap 189) (MVA). He was convicted and fined $600 and sentenced to one year disqualification for all classes. The appellant paid the fines but appealed against the disqualification order. I dismissed his appeal and now give my reasons.
 2.
 Background
On 5 March 1998 the appellant`s car was involved in an accident along with two other vehicles at the Whampoa East junction of Serangoon Road. Investigations revealed that the appellant drove his vehicle without valid insurance coverage. The insurance policy for the car had expired approximately 3 months and 21 days before the date of the accident. The appellant pleaded guilty to the offence charged but contended that there were special reasons on the facts of his offence that justified dispensing with the mandatory disqualification order prescribed by s 3(2) of the MVA. The district judge found it incredulous that the appellant had continued driving his car without bothering to verify his cheque or that he was properly insured. He held that the appellant`s omission to do so could not be a special reason not to be disqualified.
 3.
 The appeal
Before me, counsel for the appellant submitted that the circumstances leading to the offence, if exceptional, could amount to special reasons. The defence was that at the material time, the appellant held a belief that the car was validly insured against third party risks. It is clear, following 
Knowler v Rennison
 
[1947] KB 488
, that the facts must show not only that the belief was innocent but that it was based on reasonable grounds. I could find no reasonable ground for such a belief on the facts before me. In fact, given that the appellant`s first cheque had been dishonoured, and hence no valid insurance coverage applied to his car, it would have been reasonable to expect the appellant to ensure his second cheque was properly processed if indeed he genuinely sought to be covered by insurance. He made no effort to do so.
 4.The policy behind the 12 months mandatory disqualification of s 3(2) MVA was considered in 
Stewart Ashley James v PP
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 426
  which found it to be the deterrence of vehicles being used in circumstances endangering the user and other persons on the road, leaving such persons without compensation should the user not be able to satisfy the judgment. More recently, I examined the authorities which dealt with the present offence in 
MV Balakrishnan v PP
 (Unreported) and discussed what amounted to `special reasons` within the meaning of s 3(2). The law is clear that the reason must be special to the offence, not the offender: 
Re Kanapathipillai
 
[1960] MLJ 243
 . On the facts before me, I found no reason special to the offence to dispense with mandatory disqualification. It would appear that had the accident not occurred, the appellant would have continued driving around Singapore with the excuse that he had not received any notice that his insurance had lapsed. To permit road users to escape with such irresponsible conduct would go against the policy behind the enactment and would be an abuse of the legislature`s leniency accorded to cases where genuine special reasons exist.
 5.On the appellant`s own facts, it did not go unnoticed that his counsel`s submission of his being `not without means` was supported by an Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore statement of account accompanied by a demand note dated 21 March 1998 informing the appellant that a 5% penalty had been imposed on his overdue income tax. It was clear to me that this appellant could not be of sufficient means to be a road user should he continue to fail meeting payments. In all the circumstances of his case, I found no merit to his appeal. It was dismissed and the disqualification order upheld.",1998-07-22 00:00:00,SG High Court
