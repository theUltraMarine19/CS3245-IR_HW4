   DECISION: 
   In respect of the appeal against the sentences imposed upon MAK the appeal is dismissed. In respect of the appeal against the sentences impose upon MSK the appeal is allowed and the sentences imposed by Hidden J are varied as follows: The sentence of 8 years imprisonment for the third count on the indictment relating to TW is to commence on 13 August 2019. The non-parole period of 4 years is to commence on that date and to expire on 12 August 2023. The sentence of 8 years imprisonment for the fourth count on the indictment relating to TW is to commence on 13 August 2021. The non-parole period is quashed and in lieu there is to be a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months commencing on that date and to expire on 12 February 2026. The sentence in relation to the offence against CH is quashed and the respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for 9 years to commence on 13 August 2025 with a non-parole period of 12 months to commence on that date and to expire on 12 August 2026 the date upon which the respondent is first eligible to be considered for release to parole.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: These are appeals by the Crown against sentences imposed upon each of the respondents by Hidden J for sexual assault offences. The respondents are brothers. Their younger brother, MMK, was also charged with a sexual assault offence and sentenced by Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 The Court has dismissed an appeal by the Crown against the sentence imposed on MMK: see R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272. Although many of the arguments raised by the Crown in support of the present appeal were also raised in the appeal against the sentence imposed upon MMK, the facts of the matters were significantly different to justify hearing and determining that appeal separately from the appeals relating to these two respondents. 
     
      
    3 The complainants shall be referred to by the use of initials in order to protect their anonymity. The Court is aware that one of the complainants has allowed herself to be publicly identified. She is of course entitled to do so. Section 578A of the Crimes Act 1900 prohibits publication of material identifying a complainant in a prescribed sexual offence unless certain circumstances exist, one being that the complainant, who is of or over the age of 14 years at the time of the publication, consents. It is also an offence to publish the name of a complainant under the age of 16 at the time of the offence by reason of s 11 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. There are exceptions to that prohibition one being where the complainant, who is of or above the age of 16 at the time of the publication, consents. Notwithstanding that the name of one of the complainants has been lawfully published, the Court considers it appropriate to maintain the use of initials for the purposes of this judgment. 
     
      
    4 The respondents are referred to by the use of initials, not because they are entitled to any anonymity, but because the Court is concerned to ensure that the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 is not inadvertently breached. Although this Court is not bound by the provisions of this Act, publication of this Court’s judgments, especially on the Court website can, by reason of its electronic format, lead to widespread dissemination. Neither MAK nor MSK are entitled to any benefit from the operation of that Act but two of their brothers, including perhaps most relevantly MMK, were juveniles at the date of a range of offences that have become publicly notorious. Accordingly, naming either MAK or MSK would entail an unacceptable risk of an inadvertent breach of s11 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. 
     
      
       
      M.A.K. 
       
       The sentences 
      
    5 MAK pleaded guilty on 20 June 2005 to a count on an indictment alleging an offence of aggravated sexual assault against TW contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900. That is an offence for which there is prescribed a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. MAK also asked the Judge to take into account, when sentencing for that offence, a matter on a Form 1 alleging an offence of indecent assault against TA, an offence contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act and for which a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment is prescribed. 
     
      
    6 On 5 April 2006 the Judge sentenced MAK to imprisonment for 9 years to commence on 1 August 2012 with a non-parole period of 4 years to expire on 31 July 2016: see [2006] NSWSC 237. 
     
      
    7 At the time of being sentenced by Hidden J, MAK was serving sentences amounting to a total period of imprisonment of 16 years from 1 August 2002 with an effective non-parole period to expire on 31 July 2014. Sully J had imposed these sentences on 22 April 2004 for nine offences of aggravated sexual assault in company contrary to s 61JA of the Crimes Act; see [2004] NSWSC 319. An appeal against those sentences by MAK to this Court was dismissed: see [2005] NSWCCA 369. 
     
      
    8 As a result of the sentence imposed by Hidden J, the overall sentence imposed by Sully J was increased by three years with an extension of the minimum period to be served by two years. MAK cannot be considered for release to parole before 31 July 2016. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
      
    9 The offences for which the applicant was to be sentenced by Hidden J occurred on 14 June 2002. The facts were placed before his Honour by way of an agreed statement. They were set out in his remarks on sentence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ………….TW and her two friends had travelled to Sutherland, where they were picked up by the offender and MMK in the offender’s car. He drove to the Ashfield home, stopping on the way for the men to buy alcohol and soft drinks.  
         
         
        In the course of socialising in the lounge room at the home, the offender sat next to TW and put his hand between her thighs. Discomforted by this, she left the lounge room to go to the toilet, intending to sit next to one of her friends when she returned. However, when she came back to the lounge room she was met by the offender, who took her hand and led her to the bedroom.  
         
         
        There, they sat on the bed with the light off, talking. The offender then kissed TW, to which she responded for a short time before realising that his contact was going further than she wanted. She said as much to him and tried to get up to leave, but he pushed her back onto the bed. He touched her under her clothing, pulled down her underpants and inserted his finger into her vagina. Then, despite her protest that she did not want him to do what he was doing, he had penile/vaginal intercourse with her until he ejaculated. He left the room, and it was then that MSK entered it. 
         
          
         
        …………… TW eventually left the bedroom and made her complaint to her friends, and the offender drove the three of them to a nearby railway station. The following morning, TW told members of her family what had happened and was interviewed by police. Biological testing of the underpants she had been wearing revealed an area of seminal staining with a DNA profile consistent with that of the offender 
        
       
      
    10 The offence on the Form 1 against TA occurred on 20 January 2002. The Judge stated the facts as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        TA’s older sister was acquainted with MMK, and on that day MMK had arranged to take out the sister in the evening. The sister asked TA to accompany her. The offender drove MMK to the young women’s residence in south-western Sydney. Also in the car was another of his brothers, MRK. They picked up the young women and the offender drove back to the Ashfield home. Again, they stopped on the way and MRK bought a bottle of vodka.  
         
         
        At the house the group sat in the lounge room. MRK poured vodka for everyone and encouraged TA to drink some, despite her saying that she did not want to. At one stage the brothers were discussing the type of girls to whom they were attracted, and the offender said to TA, “I like blonde Australian girls.” As he said this, he put his arm around her shoulder.  
         
         
        After a time, TA’s sister left the lounge room with MMK and went to another room. In an attempt to get away from the offender, TA got up from the lounge and went to the toilet. However, when she emerged from the toilet, the offender was standing there. He told her that he would show her the house. He took her to a bedroom and asked her to sit on the bed. She said she would like to go back to the lounge room, but he asked her to stay for “a couple of minutes.” She had “a bad feeling” about the situation, but thought that he might become angry with her if she did not do what he wanted.  
         
         
        She sat on the bed and the offender turned the light off. He sat next to her and tried to kiss her, but she said, “No, I have a boyfriend.” He told her to relax and massaged her shoulders. As he did this, he began to push her back so that she would be lying on the bed. She kept pulling herself back up and said, “No, can we just go back out into the lounge room? I have a boyfriend and I really don’t want to do this.”  
         
         
        He then pushed her down onto the bed and rolled onto her, so that she could not get up. He massaged her chest, and then moved his hand onto her top and inside her bra, rubbing her left breast. She began to cry and said, “I don’t want to do this. Can we please go back out to the lounge room?” The offender said, “Just a few minutes”, and moved so that he was sitting on top of her. He again tried to kiss her but she turned her head away. She was very upset and crying loudly. He said, “Be quiet, they’ll hear you.” She asked him to get off her and get her sister.  
         
         
        He rolled off her, but he then put his hand under her lower garments and touched her pubic area. She twisted to her side and pulled his hand away. He then left the room. Shortly afterwards, she told MMK and her sister what had happened.  
        
       
       
       Subjective features 
      
    11 MAK was aged between 21 and 22 at the time of the offences. There was in evidence before the Judge a pre-sentence report and a psychological report that had been tendered before Sully J. There was also a more recent psychological report dated 11 October 2005. MAK gave evidence at the sentence hearing before Hidden J but not at the hearing before Sully J. 
     
      
    12 MAK came to Australia from Pakistan in 1998 in order to complete his secondary education and to pursue a tertiary course of studies in engineering. This did not eventuate but he completed a security course and obtained work in that industry. He lived in a house in Ashfield with some of his younger brothers who were still at school. Although in the reports that had been prepared for the proceedings before Sully J MAK had portrayed his early life positively, the more recent psychological report contained an account in which he stated that he had been subject to harsh discipline by his father, that he was bullied at school and that he grew up in a lawless and threatening environment. He claimed to have been the victim of physical and sexual abuse while in Pakistan. After coming to Australia he was the victim of three armed robberies in the course of his employment, he was burdened with the responsibility for his brothers and he developed an escalating drinking problem. Hidden J accepted that this account of his upbringing was reliable. 
     
      
    13 In the course of his remarks Hidden J noted that the gravity of the offences was apparent from the facts. He gave MAK the benefit of a “clear criminal record at the time of these offences” and discounted the sentence by 15 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty and remorse. His Honour assessed his rehabilitation as favourable. He took into account the fact that MAK was serving his sentence on protection and would continue to do so indefinitely with consequential restrictions on his access to educational courses and library services. 
     
      
    14 Hidden J noted that the criminality for the offences for which he was sentenced by Sully J was “considerably more serious” than those before him. He determined, however, that the sentence he was to pass must be partly cumulative “taking into account the principle of totality”. He found special circumstances for varying the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the total term by reason of the accumulation of sentences. 
     
      
       
        
        The principle of totality 
        
       
      
    15 The Court noted the importance of the principle of totality to the task that was before Hidden J in relation to the sentencing of MMK. It was the application of that principle that required that the Crown appeal be dismissed in his case. It is a fundamental sentencing principle that Hidden J was, and this Court is, legally obliged to apply. Whenever the Court sentences an offender for multiple offences, including when there are different victims, or sentences an offender who is already serving a sentence after conviction for other offences, it is necessary for the judge to ensure that the aggregation of all of the sentences is a ‘just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved’: Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 307-308 per McHugh J. The need to maintain an appropriate relationship between the totality of the criminality involved in a series of offences and the totality of the sentences to be imposed for those offences arises for at least two reasons.  
     
      
    16 The severity of a sentence is not simply the product of a linear relationship. That is to say severity may increase at a greater rate than an increase in the length of a sentence. As Malcolm CJ said in R v Clinch (1994) 72 A Crim R 301 at 306: 
     
      
       
        
         
         … the severity of a sentence increases at a greater rate than any increase in the length of the sentence. Thus, a sentence of five years is more than five times as severe as a sentence of one year. Similarly, while a sentence of seven years may be appropriate for one set of offences and a sentence of eight years my be appropriate for another set of offences, each looked at in isolation. Where both sets were committed by the one offender a sentence of 15 years may be out of proportion to the degree of criminality involved because of the compounding effect on the severity of the total sentence of simply aggregating the two sets of sentences. 
         
        
       
      
    17 The second matter that is considered under the totality principle is the proposition that an extremely long total sentence may be ‘crushing’ upon the offender in the sense that it will induce a feeling of hopelessness and destroy any expectation of a useful life after release. This effect both increases the severity of the sentence to be served and also destroys such prospects as there may be of rehabilitation and reform. Of course, in many cases of multiple offending, the offender may not be entitled to the element of mercy entailed in adopting such a constraint. 
     
      
    18 A sentencing court must, however, take care when applying the totality principle. Public confidence in the administration of justice requires the Court to avoid any suggestion that what is in effect being offered is some kind of a discount for multiple offending: R v Knight (2005) 155 A Crim R 252 at [112]. For similar reasons in a case such as the present where an offender who is already serving other sentences comes to be sentenced for additional offences, the impression must not be given that no, or little, penalty is imposed for the additional offences.  
     
      
       
      The Crown submissions 
      
    19 The Crown submitted that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. It further asserted that the Judge had erred in the following ways: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (i) in imposing a sentence that was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively. In addition or in the alternative, it may be inferred that his Honour placed too much weight on the subjective circumstances of the respondent; 
         
         
        (ii) in rejecting the Crown’s submission that the sentence imposed on the respondent should be cumulative or substantially cumulative 
         
         
        (iii) in reducing the respondent’s sentence by 15 per cent for his guilty plea and remorse; 
         
         
        (iv) in failing to take into account the respondent’s prior convictions recorded by Sully J for the purpose of determining whether the respondent was deserving of lenient treatment, even though the convictions were for offences that took place later in time than the offence against TW; and  
         
         
        (v) in rejecting the Crown’s submission that the vulnerability of the victim was an aggravating factor that should be taken into account pursuant to s 21A(2)(l) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
        
       
      
    20 The Crown noted that the sentence imposed was “less than half of the maximum penalty for an offence under s 61J” and it was not proportionate to the seriousness of the offence. Reliance was placed on a passage in the judgment of this Court in R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354 that stressed the need for a sentence to reflect the “gravity of the offence viewed objectively”. It was submitted that, although the Judge was required to have regard to promoting MAK’s rehabilitation, in doing so he failed to give appropriate weight to the other purposes of punishment set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In particular the Crown argued that the sentence failed to ensure that the offender was adequately punished, to denounce the conduct of the offender or to recognise the harm done to the victim and the community. 
     
      
    21 The Crown submitted that, not only was the sentence inadequate to reflect the criminality of the offence on the indictment and the matter on the Form 1, but it was to a very large extent subsumed within the sentences imposed by Sully J so that in the result MAK was required to spend only a further period of two years in custody before being eligible for release to parole. Such a result, the Crown asserted, demonstrated a sufficiently egregious error in the exercise of Hidden J’s discretion as to warrant this Court’s intervention. 
     
      
       
      Respondent’s submissions 
      
    22 On behalf of MAK Mr Hamill SC submitted that there was no patent error in the sentencing remarks of the Judge nor did the sentence imposed reflect latent error. It was submitted that the sentence was within a legitimate range, that the Judge applied the correct sentencing principles, and that it was open in the exercise of discretion for the Judge to find special circumstances and to structure the sentence with those imposed by Sully J in the way that he did. 
     
      
    23 In respect of the offences for which MAK was sentenced by Hidden J it was argued that they fell within the low to middle range of seriousness of offences of their kind particularly in light of the absence of a number of aggravating features provided in the legislation for this type of offence. There was no threat to the complainant in the count for which MAK was sentenced and the offences were both opportunistic. MAK also relied upon positive findings by the Judge in respect to his remorse and his status as a protected prisoner. 
     
      
    24 It was noted that there was no standard non-parole period applicable for the offence and hence any increase in sentencing range that might result from the enactment of Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act did not apply to the respondent: cf R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575. It was submitted that the extent to which the sentence was to be served cumulatively with the sentences imposed by Sully J was a matter that fell within Hidden J’s discretion and cannot be regarded as unjust or unreasonable: see generally R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66. Mr Hamill stressed that, when he came to be sentenced by Hidden J, MAK was a very young man facing a lengthy period in custody before he could be eligible for release for much more serious offences of a similar kind. 
     
      
    25 Mr Hamill, as did Mr Odgers SC appearing for MSK, stressed the limited basis upon which this Court can intervene in a sentencing judge’s discretion at the behest of the Crown and the very lively discretion that the Court has to refuse to intervene even though patent error can be shown or where in the Court’s assessment the sentence is “unreasonable or plainly unjust”. The Court was referred to the summary of the relevant principles set out by Wood CJ at CL in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70]. It is not necessary to set out once more the considerations that apply in appeals by the Crown but the Court has kept them in mind. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of appeal 
      
    26 The first two grounds of appeal are of a general nature and amount to no more than a complaint about the leniency of the sentence imposed and the degree of the partial cumulation. They can be put to one side while the specific complaints are considered. 
     
      
       
      Ground (iii) The discount for plea and remorse 
      
    27 It has been noted that the Judge gave MAK the benefit of a discount from the otherwise appropriate sentence of 15 percent to reflect the plea of guilty and his remorse. The Crown contends that this discount was excessive. 
     
      
    28 MAK stood trial for the offence against TW jointly with his brother MMK. The trial commenced on 13 May 2005. However, as a result of the conduct of MMK during the course of the trial, Hidden J considered that the fair trial of MAK was in jeopardy and on 31 May 2005 granted him a separate trial. A new trial date was fixed for 14 June 2005 but later adjourned to 20 June 2005. On that date MAK pleaded guilty to the offence. However, before the trial of MAK aborted, the complainant had given evidence and had been extensively cross-examined on his behalf. 
     
      
    29 The Judge stated in his remarks on sentence at [90]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        …….His plea of guilty to the offence against TW has some utilitarian value, given that there might have otherwise been a further trial in which she would have to have given evidence, and he is entitled to a reduction of sentence on account of that plea and his remorse. I would reduce the sentence otherwise appropriate by fifteen percent. As I have said, he has also expressed remorse for the offence against TA. I assess his prospects of rehabilitation as favourable. 
        
       
       
      Later, just before imposing sentence, the Judge stated at [93]: 
       
        
         
        …………… But for his plea of guilty and his remorse, I would have imposed a sentence of ten and a half years. A reduction of fifteen percent for those factors yields a term a little under nine years, which I shall round off at nine years………… 
         
        
       
      
    30 At the hearing of the appeal, the Court raised with the parties whether there was any error committed by the Judge in determining the extent of the discount at 15 per cent after taking into account MAK’s remorse or the fact that the plea had saved the complainant the trauma of giving further evidence. The parties asked for, and were given, leave to file further submissions on this issue once the Court had reserved its decisions. Both parties availed themselves of that opportunity. 
     
      
    31 The Crown submitted that the passages in the remarks on sentence set out above could be read in one of two ways, but that both revealed error. On the one hand, the Crown contended, the statement that the respondent was “entitled to a reduction of sentence on account of that plea and his remorse” may be understood as indicating that the Judge had reduced the sentence by 15 per cent by reason of both the utilitarian value of the plea and such remorse as flowed from the “bare fact of [the respondent’s] plea”: see R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [118]. If this is the preferred interpretation then, according to the Crown, the discount was unduly generous having regard to the lateness of the plea and the fact that the complainant had already given evidence and been cross-examined on behalf of MAK. The Crown submitted that a discount of no more than 10 per cent was warranted. 
     
      
    32 On the other hand, according to the Crown, the statements may be understood as indicating that Hidden J reduced the sentence by the stated discount to recognise “not only all of the matters that were manifested by his plea of guilty but also the respondent’s more general expressions of remorse”. If that were the case, then the Judge erred in attributing a percentage value to MAK’s general expressions of remorse as well as recognising other mitigating factors which, to a more or less degree, were based upon the finding that the respondent was remorseful, for example that he had good prospects of rehabilitation. The Crown relies upon a number of statements in judgments of this Court, including Thomson and Houlton, commenting upon the interrelation of factors in determining the appropriate sentence including the plea of guilty, evidence of remorse, and preparedness to assist authorities. The Crown submits that a quantifiable discount should only be given in relation to the utilitarian value of the plea and assistance to the authorities and not otherwise. 
     
      
    33 Mr Hamill submitted that the only reasonable interpretation of the portion of the Judge’s remarks quoted above is that the sentence was being reduced by 15 per cent for both the utilitarian value of the plea and the remorse demonstrated by that plea, that is the first interpretation suggested by the Crown. He then submitted that such a discount was within the Judge’s discretion and could not be shown to be unreasonable or wrong. He accepted that the preferable course was to identify a numerical discount based only upon the utilitarian value of the plea but submitted that it was not an error to include in the stated discount the other factors flowing from the plea itself. Mr Hamill relied upon decisions of this Court including R v Scott [2003] NSWCCA 286 and R v Moore [2005] NSWCCA 212 to support this last submission. 
     
      
    34 It was established in the guideline judgment in R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 that an offender is entitled to a discount of the otherwise appropriate sentence of somewhere between 10 percent and 25 percent by reason of the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty. The amount of that discount would largely depend upon the timing of the plea and the complexity of the case; at [154] to [155]. The discount was a discrete factor to be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed independent of any remorse or contrition on the part of the offender for the criminal conduct; at [122]. It was recognised that the plea might also be evidence of remorse, as might the effect of the plea in saving the complainant or other witnesses in being required to give evidence and the trauma that this frequently entails particularly in sexual assault trials; at [117] to [121]. But the discount was based upon public policy considerations in encouraging offenders to plead guilty at an early point in the proceedings thus saving both court time and the limited recourses of the State in investigating and preparing allegations of criminal offences for committal proceedings and trial; at [122], [133]. 
     
      
    35 The guideline judgment itself recognised that it may be appropriate for a sentencing court to quantify a discount flowing from a plea of guilty that transcends its purely utilitarian value. The second paragraph of the guideline is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (ii) Sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of the plea on the sentence insofar as they believe it appropriate to do so. This effect can encompass any or all of the matters to which the plea may be relevant - contrition, witness vulnerability and utilitarian value - but particular encouragement is given to the quantification of the last mentioned matter. Where other matters are regarded as appropriate to be quantified in a particular case, e.g. assistance to authorities, a single combined quantification will often be appropriate. 
        
       
      
    36 In R v Sharma (2002) NSWLR 300 the discount there under consideration related to the element of contrition and the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. No attention was given by the Court to the issue now raised but there was nothing said by the Chief Justice, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, to indicate that the sentencing judge was in error in taking into account both factors in determining the appropriate numerical discount. However, the judgment of the Chief Justice did stress that the discount of 10 to 25 per cent, as laid down in the guideline judgment and consistently with the relevant statutory provision in this State, reflected the value of the plea viewed objectively without any consideration of the offender’s purpose or motivation in pleading guilty. 
     
      
    37 In R v Scott [2003] NSWCCA 286, a case relied upon heavily by Mr Hamill, the complaint by the applicant was that the sentencing judge erred in his assessment of “the appropriate discount for the plea and the contrition”. There the judge had accepted that the plea of guilty represented an expression of true remorse and that the plea of guilty was made at the earliest point in the proceedings. He granted a discount of 25 per cent. It was submitted before this Court, relying upon Thompson and Houlton, that the judge should have given a discount of more than 25 per cent to reflect both the utilitarian value of the plea and genuine remorse. 
     
      
    38 In dismissing the appeal Howie J, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court and after referring in depth to the judgment of the Chief Justice in Thomson and Houlton, stated in reference to that decision: 
     
      
       
        
         
        23. …….It should be noted that sentencing judges were being encouraged to specify the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea ""where it was appropriate to separately deal with that matter."" There are situations where it may not be appropriate to specify a discrete discount for the plea. The guideline in Thomson and Houlton itself recognised at [160(ii)] (that, in cases involving assistance to authorities, a ""single combined quantification will often be appropriate"", and see R v Sharma (2002) 54 NSWLR 300 at [72]. In such a case an early plea will simply be one component of the assistance being given by the offender and generally follows a full and frank disclosure of the offender’s guilt to the authorities. 
         
         
        24. Another case where it may not always be appropriate to give a separate discount for the plea is one such as the present where the plea is simply one event in a course of conduct by the offender following the commission of the offence which not only indicates remorse but reveals an attempt by the offender to redress the harm occasioned by the offence and to ensure that it does not occur again. Where, as in the present, there is a subjective case presented on behalf of the offender to show that the offence was out of character, that the commission of the offence had a salutary effect upon the offender and that his rehabilitation was well under way by the date of sentencing, I have some difficulty in appreciating how the plea can be viewed as anything but part of that process of rehabilitation and reform. Thomson and Houlton recognised that the then existing practice of giving a discount of up to thirty-five per cent for the plea by encompassing all relevant matters remained appropriate. This is the type of case where such a course might have been adopted. 
         
        
       
      
    39 That was a case where the plea had been forthcoming nine months after the offence and it did not justify a discount at the highest level for the utilitarian value of the plea alone. The judge, however, gave a discount of 25 per cent taking into account other aspects of the plea of guilty, such as remorse. But it was a case where, as Howie J pointed out, much of the remorse and rehabilitation had occurred between the commission of the offence and when the plea of guilty was forthcoming. That is why the plea of guilty in that case was seen as part of the process of rehabilitation that had occurred before the applicant was sentenced. 
     
      
    40 It should be noted that Scott was an offender’s appeal, and the Court was not called upon to consider whether the approach adopted by the judge might have led to an unduly generous discount in light of the circumstances of the particular case and the other matters taken into account by the judge in mitigation of the sentence. The argument that a more generous discount should have been given was rejected. The other cases relied upon by Mr Hamill, or to which he referred, similarly did not give rise to the particular issue that is now being considered. 
     
      
    41 In any event it seems to us that events have moved on somewhat since Thomson and Houlton was decided. In particular s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act has been enacted and requires the sentencing court to take into account specifically, as matters in mitigation of sentence, not only the plea of guilty but also that the offender is unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation. In respect of the last two matters it is clear that remorse will be a major factor in determining whether those matters of mitigation exist: without true remorse it is difficult to see how either finding could be made. Although it is accepted that nothing in s 21A affects, or was intended to affect, the matters that were taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence before the section was enacted, the section does highlight the fact that there is an overlap between various sentencing considerations and has led this Court to be more sensitive to the fact of, or at least the appearance of, double counting either in favour of, or to the detriment of, the offender; see for example Elyard v R [2006] NSWCCA 43. 
     
      
    42 Rarely, if ever, at the present time does a sentencing court give a rolled up discount for all aspects of the plea of guilty. Yet this was a practice recognised by the Court when Thomson and Houlton was decided; see at [162]. In this Court’s experience the usual practice now is to specify a discount only for the utilitarian value of the plea and then to take remorse into account as it is reflected in the mitigating factors to which reference is made in s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and other considerations such as the absence of any need for specific deterrence. If remorse does not give rise to any of those findings in mitigation of sentence, it is difficult to see its relevance, let alone why the sentence should be discounted in recognition of it. 
     
      
    43 In R v Salieb [2005] NSWCCA 85 Bell J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        It is preferable for sentencing judges not to separately quantify the discount for the aspect of the plea that evidences an offender’s remorse. The interplay of remorse with the other subjective factors forms part of the “complex of inter-related considerations” to which Gleeson CJ referred in  
        R v Gallagher 
         (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 at 228 and, as his Honour observed, the attempt to separate out one or more such considerations may be an artificial exercise. 
        
       
      
    44 We would go further and indicate that an approach quantifying a discount due for remorse generally, or as it is manifested by the plea of guilty, or in combination with the discount resulting from the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty is to be avoided as it is likely to result in a sentence that is unduly lenient by reason of double counting. In Thomson and Houlton the Court specifically rejected the submission by the Crown and the Attorney General that a quantifiable discount resulting from a plea of guilty should reflect both the utilitarian value of the plea and remorse. 
     
      
    45 In Markarian v The Queen (2005) 79 ALJR 1048 at [39] the Justices who participated in the joint judgment recognised that there may be occasions when “some indulgence in an arithmetical process” may be appropriate to serve the ends of transparency in the sentencing process. But in our view the benefit of transparency should not be achieved at the risk of double counting or by giving a discount for a factor, such as remorse, that is not susceptible to isolation from the other relevant factors or to mathematical evaluation. 
     
      
    46 In the present case, with respect, the discount of 15 per cent cannot be justified on any basis. Mr Hamill SC quite frankly conceded in oral submissions that it would have been open on the facts of this case for a court to give a discount of less than 10 per cent. Although MAK gave evidence that he was remorseful and this expression of remorse was accepted by the Judge as genuine, it should be noted that such remorse as the applicant felt for TW arose sometime in the month between the order for a separate trial and the plea of guilty. It is difficult to see what value it could have been accorded standing alone or in conjunction with the plea. The matter was further complicated by the fact that Hidden J found that MAK was also remorseful in respect of the offence against TA. As his Honour found that MAK’s prospects of rehabilitation were favourable, presumably based upon his expressions of remorse, there was a real likelihood in this case of double counting. 
     
      
    47 Mr Hamill has submitted that the evaluation of the discount was a matter within the discretion of Hidden J and could not in this case amount to an error justifying interference by this Court. But the discount of 15 per cent in the circumstances of this case was in our view unreasonable and plainly could not be warranted by the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty which, as a matter of practical reality, was negligible. The only benefit to the administration of justice by the plea of guilty in the circumstances of this case was the saving of court time by a further trial. Hidden J did not indicate how long that trial might have taken but it could only have been days rather than weeks. At the very most the discount should have been no greater than 10 per cent and we would have thought that something in the order of 5 per cent was appropriate. However, this error alone would not justify the intervention of this Court on a Crown appeal simply to increase the sentence by 10 per cent. 
     
      
       
      Ground (v) The vulnerability of the complainants 
      
    48 The fifth ground can be dealt with briefly. It was noted in the judgment dismissing the appeal against the sentence imposed upon MMK that the Crown had abandoned this ground in that appeal. The Crown conceded in oral argument that the submission that s 2A(2)(l) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act was engaged by the facts of the offences committed by MMK was inconsistent with the decision of this Court in R v Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145 which the Crown accepted as correctly stating the relevant principles. 
     
      
    49 The Crown also abandoned this ground so far as the appeal against the sentences imposed upon these respondents was concerned. That concession was well founded. Although relevant as a circumstance surrounding the commission of the offences, the fact that the complainant was intoxicated and in the respondent’s home at the time of the offending was not a matter that engaged s 21A(2)(l) as a matter of additional aggravation. There was thus no error by Hidden J in failing to refer to this matter as an aggravating feature of the offence. 
     
      
       
      Ground (iv) The relevance of the prior convictions 
      
    50 Hidden J noted that MAK was “entitled to the benefit of a clear criminal record at the time of these offences”. His Honour did not indicate how that benefit impacted upon the sentence he was to impose. Nor did his Honour identify the relevance of the absence of a criminal record at the time of the offending in light of the fact that MAK had subsequently committed more serious sexual assaults for which he had been convicted and sentenced to a lengthy term of imprisonment. 
     
      
    51 Section 21A(2)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that the fact that an offender has a record of previous convictions is an aggravating factor to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence. This Court comprising a bench of five judges recently considered the application of s 21A(2)(d) to the determination of a sentence. In R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242 it was held that a record of previous convictions cannot be taken into account in an assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence because to do so would infringe the principle of proportionality. The only relevance of such a record is whether it discloses that more weight is to be given to retribution, personal deterrence and the protection of the community than would be the case if such a record did not exist. 
     
      
    52 In the present case at the time he was sentenced by Hidden J MAK had a record of previous convictions by reason of the sentences imposed by Sully J. But those sentences related to offences committed after the offence for which he was before Hidden J. The question arises as whether that record should be used as a factor in aggravation of the sentence under s 21A(2)(d) or to the detriment of the MAK in some other way. The Crown submitted that such a record could, and should in the present case, be used to deny him the leniency that might otherwise be shown to him. It was submitted that Hidden J was in error because he appeared to sentence MAK as if the absence of a prior criminal record was a matter of mitigation: see s 21A(3)(e) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    53 In R v McInerney (1986) 42 SASR 111 the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal considered the relevance of prior offences where conviction for those offences had occurred subsequent to the offence for which sentence was being passed. Cox J reviewed authorities on the question since 1789, including the decision of this Court in R v Hutchins (1957) 75 WN(NSW) 75. 
     
      
    54 In Hutchins the Court considered the relevance of convictions that had arisen between the commission of the offence in 1954 and sentencing in 1957. Street CJ, with whom Roper CJ in Eq agreed, stated (at 76):  
     
      
       
        
         
        I think it is clear that in sentencing the applicant in June 1957, for a crime committed in September 1954, his Honour was entitled to take into account as matters for his consideration the convictions which the applicant had incurred between those two dates, and he was entitled to take them into account for the purpose of considering whether he should reduce what he would otherwise have regarded as the proper sentence because some leniency should be extended to the applicant in the light of his youth. 
        
       
      
    55 In McInerney Owen J held (at 77): 
     
      
       
        
         
        ……………[The Chairman of Quarter Sessions] was entitled to look at those convictions, not for the purpose of imposing a sentence on the present charge heavier than would otherwise have been imposed, but for the purpose of considering whether the applicant was deserving of lenient treatment. Where I differ from the learned Chairman of Quarter Sessions is that I think that a proper penalty for the present offence, if that matter had come up for consideration in 1954, would have been imprisonment for a term of twelve months. Nothing that has happened since then seems to me to justify a reduction of that sentence, but nothing appears to emerge from the facts of that case which would have called for a heavier penalty. 
        
       
      
    56 Cox J in McInerney concluded that the weight of authority was in favour of a sentencing court taking into account subsequent convictions because the sentencer may have regard “to all of the defendant's behaviour, favourable or unfavourable, prior to sentence”. He thought that to ignore relevant subsequent convictions would be “artificial and unmeritorious and in some cases it could lead to quite absurd results.” He went on: 
     
      
       
        
         
        That is not to say, of course, that subsequent convictions will necessarily be taken into account in the same way as previous convictions. Whether the offences were committed before or after the offence for which the defendant is being sentenced may make a difference in some cases. The fact that it was not a first or isolated offence, that the defendant's recent history shows a procession from one offence to another, may well be important, but the conviction itself adds a significant dimension. A conviction is a formal and solemn act marking the court's, and society's disapproval of a defendant's wrongdoing, so that a prior offence may not assume quite the same significance as a prior offence coupled (by the time the instant offence is committed) with a prior conviction. So far as subsequent offences are concerned, they cannot justify the court in imposing a higher sentence than the instant offence intrinsically merits, but they might well lead the court to conclude that any leniency to the defendant would be misplaced. As always, of course, it will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case. 
        
       
      
    57 King CJ in agreeing with Cox J stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In my opinion the true rule is that a sentencing court may take into account in an appropriate way and for appropriate purposes, offences committed by an offender whether such offences were committed before or after the commission of the offence for which sentence is being passed and whether the convictions for such offences occurred before or after the commission of the offence for which sentence is being passed. For the reasons which I have given I do not think that it is necessary to reconsider any previous decision of the Full Court, in order to give effect to that view. 
         
         
        I conclude with some observations as to the way in which and the purposes for which subsequent offences may be taken into account. The cardinal rule is that while good character may operate to reduce the sentence which the facts of the crime would otherwise attract, bad character cannot increase it. A person is not to be punished, or punished again, for crimes other than the crime for which sentence is being passed…………….. 
         
         
        Where the other offences have been committed after the immediate offence, they are relevant only in special circumstances. The offender has not committed the immediate offence with his character already affected by the offences nor after the experience of conviction. In circumstances, however, in which the offender might otherwise have been given credit for having lived a law abiding life in the period between crime and sentence, it is relevant that he has not so lived but has committed an offence or offences in that period. In some circumstances, the nature of the subsequent offences may be such as to suggest that a greater degree of personal deterrence than would otherwise have been contemplated, is required. It seems to me that the circumstances in which offences subsequent to the commission of the offence for which sentence is being passed, are relevant to the sentence, are more restricted than those in which prior offences are relevant………….. 
        
       
      
    58 The decision of Hutchins was applied by this Court in R v Boney (NSWCCA unreported 22 July 1991). There the offender had committed offences between the time of the commission of the offence for which he was to be sentenced and the date upon which sentence was imposed. The Court confirmed that the sentence could not be increased by reason of what were referred to as “interim offences” but that the judge could withhold leniency to the offender by reason of those offences. Boney was applied in Charara v DPP (2001) 120 A Crim R 255 where at [38] it was noted that: 
     
      
       
        
         
        It is obvious that, even if taken into account only for the purpose of withholding leniency, offences committed after the offence for which sentence is imposed can result in increased punishment in the sense that the punishment is greater than it would have been in the absence of the later offences…………………. 
        
       
      
    59 The fact that MAK had been convicted and sentenced for offences by Sully J was a matter relevant to the sentence imposed by Hidden J for the offences before him: not by way of aggravating the offences, but by depriving the respondent of any leniency to which he might otherwise have been entitled by the fact that he had no criminal record at the time of the commission of those offences. The offences for which Sully J sentenced MAK might have indicated that personal deterrence was a relevant factor in sentencing for the earlier offences, however Hidden J found that MAK was unlikely to re-offend and so specific deterrence was not a consideration. 
     
      
    60 With respect it does not appear to us that the fact that MAK had no criminal record at the time of the offences was a significant factor in the determination of the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon him by Hidden J. Certainly it was not a matter that could justify any degree of leniency being shown to MAK in the circumstances of this case. In particular the criminal conduct for which Hidden J was imposing sentence could not be considered as an aberration or as foreign to MAK’s character. Rather the offence against TW was the first of a number of acts of sexual violence committed by him in the first half of 2002. This conduct escalated in seriousness with the offence against TA and then with the offences that were before Sully J. 
     
      
    61 We appreciate that less regard might be paid to later offending because at the time of the offence for which sentence is to be passed the offender has not been subject to the “formal condemnation of the law” or been given “the warning as to the future which the conviction experience implies”; see McInerney at 113 applied in R v Bui (2002) 137 A Crim R 220 at [27]. But in the circumstances of this case and given the seriousness of the conduct for which he was before Hidden J we do not think that the fact that MAK had not been convicted of sexual assault offences when he committed the offences against TW or TA was a basis for treating as a mitigating factor the absence of any criminal record. 
     
      
       
      Grounds (i) and (ii) Manifest inadequacy 
      
    62 Two errors therefore can be identified in the approach taken by Hidden J to assessing the sentence to be imposed upon MAK. But it does not follow that the Court should necessarily intervene to increase the sentence imposed. It has already been noted that the unjustified discount granted to MAK by reason of his plea of guilty would not itself warrant the appeal being upheld. The second error was relatively minor and it is difficult to believe that it could have had any substantial effect upon the exercise of the Judge’s discretion. However, these errors in approach might be considered as symptomatic of a leniency shown to MAK by the Judge that has resulted in sentences that appear to be at the lower end of what was appropriate if not inadequate. 
     
      
    63 But the Court must pay due regard to the discretion of the sentencing judge and should only interfere if the resulting sentence can be considered as being unjust or unreasonable. In dismissing the appeal in relation to MMK we quoted from the joint judgment in Makarian v The Queen (2005) 79 ALJR 1048 at [27]. It is apposite to quote the passage again in relation to this appeal: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Express legislative provisions apart, neither principle, nor any of the grounds of appellate review, dictates the particular path that a sentencer, passing sentence in a case where the penalty is not fixed by statute, must follow in reasoning to the conclusion that the sentence to be imposed should be fixed as it is. The judgment is a discretionary judgment and, as the bases for appellate review reveal, what is required is that the sentencer must take into account all relevant considerations (and only relevant considerations) in forming the conclusion reached. As has now been pointed out more than once, there is no single correct sentence. And judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies. 
        
       
      
    64 It must be stressed that it is not correct to consider the adequacy of the sentence imposed by simply having regard to the percentage of the maximum penalty that the sentence represents as the Crown did. Although the maximum penalty is an important consideration because it reflects the view taken by Parliament of the seriousness of the offence, the maximum penalty is to be used as a guideline against which the seriousness of a particular act of offending can be judged: Markarian at [30]. Not each matter of aggravation listed in the section creating the offence for which MAK was convicted would be of equal seriousness in every case. The nature of any matter of aggravation charged and the number of statutory aggravating factors relied upon will obviously affect the objective seriousness of the offence. But it is not appropriate to consider that each instance of an offence under the section results in the offender being liable, at least technically, for the maximum penalty prescribed for the category of offences coming within the scope of the section: see Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447. 
     
      
    65 Nor is it appropriate simply to have regard to the increase in the sentences imposed by Sully J and ask whether that increase reflects the objective seriousness of the offences before Hidden J and fulfils the purposes of punishment set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. As was made clear in R v MMK a sentencing court is constrained and limited in applying that section by other important principles of sentencing that do not find express acknowledgment in that Act. In the case of MMK those principles warranted the approach taken by Hidden J of not imposing any further punishment upon that respondent. In the case of MAK those same principles required that there be some amelioration of the punishment otherwise warranted. Although in our opinion the actual punishment imposed for those offences is lenient, it is not such that requires the Court to intervene in the wider community interest or to establish proper sentencing guidance. A proper regard to the limits applying to Crown appeals leads to the conclusion that the appeal should fail. 
     
      
       
      M.S.K. 
       
       The sentences 
      
    66 On 14 June 2005 the respondent MSK was convicted by a jury of four counts of aggravated sexual assault in relation to the complainant TW. Each of the offences was contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act for which there is prescribed a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. The circumstances of aggravation relied upon were that he was in company and that the complainant was under the age of 16 years. In one of the offences MSK was the principal offender, but in the other offences he was convicted on the basis of acting in a common purpose with the principal. Each of the offences arose from an incident on 14 June 2002. 
     
      
    67 On 18 July 2005 MSK pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s 61J. That offence was committed against a complainant, CH on 14 July 2002. The circumstance of aggravation was that the complainant was under the age of 16 years. 
     
      
    68 Hidden J sentenced the respondent for these offences on 5 April 2006 as follows: in respect of the first two counts against TW fixed terms each of imprisonment for 8 years to date from 13 August 2014 and to expire on 12 August 2022; on count 3 imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 4 years to commence on 13 August 2016 and to expire on 12 August 2020; on count 4 imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 4 years to commence on 13 August 2018 and to expire on 12 August 2022; and for the offence against CH imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 13 August 2021 and to expire on 12 August 2024. This was an effective sentence of imprisonment for 14 years to commence on 13 August 2014 with an overall non-parole period of 10 years to expire on 12 August 2024: see [2006] NSWSC 237. 
     
      
    69 On 22 April 2004 Sully J sentenced MSK for nine counts of aggravated sexual assault in company contrary to s 61JA of the Crimes Act. These offences had occurred on 27 July 2002. The effective sentence imposed was a total term of 22 years to date from 13 August 2002 with an overall non-parole period of 16 years 6 months to expire on 12 February 2019; see [2004] NSWSC 319. An appeal against those sentences by MSK to this Court was dismissed: see [2005] NSWCCA 369. 
     
      
    70 The effect of the sentences imposed by Hidden J was to lengthen the overall term by four years with an increase in the non-parole period of five years and 6 months. MSK cannot be considered for release until 12 August 2024 by which time he will have been in custody for 22 years. 
     
      
       
        
        The facts 
        
       
      
    71 Hidden J summarised the facts relating to the offences against TW as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        On that evening [24 June 2002], TW went with two of her friends to the home at Ashfield where the offender and his brothers lived. The gathering had been arranged by one of her friends, but she herself did not know the offender or any of the other residents at the home. She was fourteen years old at the time. There was evidence that she told the men that she was fifteen, but nothing turns on this for present purposes.  
         
         
        The group socialised for a time in the lounge room, and the men produced alcohol. The victim had a number of glasses of vodka and coke and became intoxicated. The Crown prosecutor submitted that I should find that the offender was a party to providing her with alcohol so as to weaken her resistance to sexual advances. I would not make that finding but, in any event, I do not consider it either to be a matter of significance. What the evidence does reveal is that the offender did in fact take advantage of her intoxicated state to achieve sexual contact with her.  
         
         
        At one stage she was sitting on a lounge between the offender and his brother, MAK. There was some evidence that she placed her hand on the offender’s leg in a flirtatious manner. Her own evidence was that the offender put his arm around her while MAK touched her leg and that she, feeling uncomfortable about this, got up and went to the bathroom at the back of the house. Yet again, I do not find this conflict of such significance as to require resolution. No sexual advantage should have been taken of a girl of her age and in her state of intoxication, whatever the circumstances.  
         
         
        When she returned to the lounge room, MAK took her to a bedroom off the hallway which adjoined the lounge room. The bedroom was in darkness. There, after some kissing, he inserted his finger into her vagina and had penile/vaginal intercourse with her over her protests. This gave rise to the first two counts, the offender having been in company with MAK at the time, that is, in close proximity to the bedroom, sharing with MAK his intention to have intercourse with TW whether or not she consented, and encouraging him to do so.  
         
         
        MAK left the room and the offender entered it. He massaged TW’s head, apparently in an attempt to relax her. She told police in a recorded interview that at this stage she was “kind of totally out of it.” He then had penile/vaginal intercourse with her, again over her protests, ejaculating inside her. It was this conduct which led to the third count. That count was left to the jury on the basis that the circumstance of aggravation was either that MAK was in the offender’s company in the relevant sense, or that TW was under the age of sixteen. The verdict does not tell us which circumstance of aggravation the jury found but, clearly, both were available on the evidence.  
         
         
        The offender left the room, whereupon a man who cannot be conclusively identified on the evidence came in. That man also had penile/vaginal intercourse with her against her will. Immediately prior to that act she kicked him, and he slapped her face and threatened to stab her. (The Crown did not suggest that he in fact had a knife.) The offender would not have been aware of this violent episode and, despite a submission by the Crown prosecutor to the contrary, I am not satisfied to the requisite degree that he anticipated that conduct of that kind might occur. This third incident gave rise to the fourth count, the offender again having been in company with that man in the relevant sense.  
         
         
        TW left the room after the third incident and complained to her two friends about what had occurred. Shortly afterwards, the three of them left the home and MAK drove them to a nearby railway station. 
        
       
      
    72 The Judge noted in his remarks the traumatic effect upon the victim of these assaults upon her and the serious aspects of the offence both by reason of the complainant’s age, 14 years, and the fact that the offences were part of a common enterprise between MSK and the other two men. 
     
      
    73 As to the facts in respect of the offence against CH, the Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The agreed facts are that in the evening of 14 July 2002, by arrangement, the offender, his brothers MAK and MMK, and another young man whom I shall call RS, picked up CH at Bexley North in MAK’s car. They then picked up another young lady at Fairfield, and proceeded to the Ashfield home. CH was thirteen years old at the time.  
         
         
        In one of the bedrooms at that home MMK had consensual sexual intercourse with CH. He left the bedroom, whereupon the offender entered it, seized CH by the arm, and said, “I’m going to fuck you too.” He told her that he had hung his previous girlfriend from a balcony in Iraq. Not surprisingly, the victim became extremely fearful for her safety. The offender then had penile/vaginal intercourse with her without her consent, saying during this assault, “I choked her, I choked her, I killed her, I strangled her.” He withdrew from her before he ejaculated, and left the room.  
         
         
        Shortly afterwards, RS entered the room and also sexually assaulted the victim. The offender then returned to the room and acted in a threatening manner towards her. After he left, MMK returned to the room and the victim complained to him about the actions of the other two men. She walked out of the room and began to scream and cry. A short time later she was driven back to Bexley North by MAK and MMK.  
         
        
       
      
    74 Hidden J accepted evidence from MSK that, although he knew that CH was under the age of 16 years, he did know her actual age, 13 years. 
     
      
       
        
        Subjective features 
        
       
      
    75 MSK was aged 23 years when the offences were committed and was aged 27 years when sentenced by Hidden J. He was like his brother born and raised in Pakistan and was the eldest of the children. He travelled to Australia on nine occasions between 1998 and 2002 initially in order to study medicine but stayed for very short periods of time before returning home. His final trip to Australia was in June 2002 when he decided to settle permanently here. He arrived some days before the offence against TW. At the time of offending he was living with his brothers. 
     
      
    76 Although MSK married in Pakistan and had a son, aged six years at the time of sentencing, his family did not come to Australia until after he had been arrested for these offences and remanded in custody. 
     
      
    77 There was a large body of evidence before Hidden J as to MSK’s mental state both at the time of offending and when being sentenced. He had undergone proceedings to establish his fitness to stand trial for the offences shortly before the trial before Hidden J commenced. A jury found he was fit to stand trial notwithstanding evidence given by his father and his wife of a history of psychiatric disturbance since his childhood. He had explained his conduct either by reason of his psychiatric disorder or because of his cultural background. Hidden J rejected both explanations for reasons that he gave in the course of the sentencing remarks. They need not be repeated here except to note that the Judge found he was a witness of no credibility. Hidden J also found that he was prepared to manipulate the legal system “in any way he can to avoid facing the consequences of his crime”. 
     
      
    78 Hidden J found that the respondent’s behaviour “demonstrates an attitude to sexuality which is exploitive, dominating and aggressive”. His Honour concluded that he was not genuinely remorseful but was prepared to give evidence that would advance his case in mitigation of sentence. The Judge did recognise that there was some utilitarian value in the plea of guilty to the offence against CH and allowed a discount of ten per cent. 
     
      
    79 The respondent was serving his sentence on protection and this resulted in restrictions on the time he could spend outside of his cell. The Judge found that this would be so for the indefinite future. However, he did share a cell with his brother MAK. 
     
      
    80 Hidden J noted that the offences for which MSK was sentenced by Sully J were “significantly more serious” than those before him. His Honour was guarded about the prospects of his rehabilitation but was not prepared to find that there were none. He stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I must fashion an overall sentence which can foster his rehabilitation by providing the opportunity of a lengthy period of conditional liberty, subject to supervision and the sanction of parole. 
        
       
       
      The Crown submissions 
      
    81 The Crown submitted that the sentences were manifestly inadequate and that his Honour had erred in the exercise of his discretion in the following ways: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (i) in rejecting the Crown’s submission that the offences against TW and CH were at the high end of the scale of criminality. Even if his Honour were correct in rejecting that submission, it is contended that the sentences imposed were not proportionate to the gravity of the offences viewed objectively; 
         
         
        (ii) in settling sentences that resulted in a period of parole eligibility and a total term of imprisonment which did not accord with his Honour’s stated intention, so that even on his Honour’s own reasoning, the sentences were manifestly inadequate; 
         
         
        (iii) in rejecting the Crown’s submission that the sentences imposed on the respondent should be cumulative or substantially cumulative; 
         
         
        (iv) with respect to the offence against CH, in failing to take into account that the offences against TW took place before that offence, so that the respondent should not have been sentenced for the offence against CH as a first offender, but as a person whose character was affected by previous offending; 
         
         
        (v) in failing to take into account the respondents’ prior convictions recorded by Sully J for the purpose of determining whether the offender was deserving of lenient treatment, even though the convictions were for offences that took place later in time than the offences against TW and CH; and 
         
         
        (vii) in rejecting the Crown’s submission that the vulnerability of the victims was an aggravating factor that should be taken into account pursuant to s 21A(2)(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
         
         
        
       
       Respondent’s submissions 
      
    82 Mr Odgers SC, who appeared for MSK, reminded the Court of the principles that govern Crown appeals and that are set out at length in his written submissions. He also made specific arguments against each of the asserted errors relied upon by the Crown. We have taken into account those submissions when dealing with the grounds common to both the respondents. Mr Odgers referred the Court generally to the decision in R v Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 297 that includes a review by this Court of sentences for sexual offences not falling within the worst category of offending and submitted that on an analysis of those decisions the sentences imposed upon MAK could not be found to be inadequate. He also stressed that the question of totality and the structure of the sentences with those imposed by Sully J was a matter of discretion upon which minds might legitimately differ: see R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66. Mr Odgers cautioned against the Court imposing a crushing sentence without due regard for the process of rehabilitation during the course of the sentences imposed by Sully J. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
      
    83 A number of the grounds relied upon by the Crown can be dealt with briefly. It has already been noted that the Crown conceded that there was no merit in the last complaint; that is that the Judge erred in rejecting a Crown submission that the offences were aggravated by reason of the vulnerability of the victims (ground (vii)). We have dealt with this ground earlier and need not address it again in respect of this respondent. 
     
      
    84 We have also dealt with the complaint about the manner in which his Honour took into account the lack of prior record (ground (vi)). The Judge stated that MSK was “entitled to the benefit of the absence of any significant criminal record at the time of these offences”. His Honour noted that Sully J had also given the respondent the benefit of that fact. For the reasons we have given above, the fact that MSK had no prior record could not have been taken into account by way of mitigation in the circumstances of this case, but rather the Judge would have been justified in withholding the leniency that such a fact might otherwise have suggested. Seen in context, within days of arriving in this country, the respondent chose to embark upon a course of conduct of sexual violence albeit on an opportunistic basis. This was conduct in which his brother MAK had already been involved. In any event in respect of the offence against CH the respondent had already committed the offences against TW (ground iv). Although he had not been convicted of those offences, there was little or no mitigation in that fact in light of the seriousness of the offending. 
     
      
       
       
       
        
        Ground (ii) Calculation error 
        
       
      
    85 It was conceded by Mr Odgers that this ground should succeed at least in so far as there should be an increase in the total term in order to reflect the stated intention of Hidden J. 
     
      
    86 His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The sentences I pass upon this offender must be partly cumulative upon Sully J’s sentences. Moreover, there must be some accumulation of the sentences on the four counts relating to TW, so as to mark their criminality and preserve the relativity between this offender’s culpability and that of MAK, who is to be sentenced for one count in relation to that victim. There must also be some further accumulation of the sentence for the offence against CH. All this must be done guided by the well established principle of totality, with an eye to the practical effect of the accumulation. 
         
         
        Because of the accumulation I propose, I find special circumstances warranting a departure from the usual statutory ratio in the non-parole periods I shall fix. The result will be a period of parole eligibility of six years. I do not believe that an effective non-parole period less than that which I propose would be sufficient to reflect the offender’s criminality. Because of the dates of the offences, I shall pass sentence in accordance with the procedure prior to the 2002 amendments to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
        
       
      
    87 As has been pointed out, the effect of the sentences imposed by Hidden J was to increase the total term over that imposed by Sully J by four years rather than the six years intended. The total sentence ought to have expired on 12 August 2030 rather than on 12 August 2028. This result could be achieved by simply altering the sentence imposed in respect of CH. 
     
      
       
      Ground (i) and (ii) Sentences manifestly inadequate 
      
    88 The sentencing exercise confronting Hidden J was not an easy one by reason of the seriousness of the offences before the court, on the one hand, and yet having regard to the principal of totality on the other. That principle was involved at three points in the sentencing exercise: setting the total sentence for the offences against TW, the overall sentence for the offences before his Honour, and the totality of the criminality, including that before Sully J, for which MAK was ultimately to serve a period of imprisonment. Each of these decisions involved a significant degree of discretionary judgment. Ultimately it is probably the last assessment that is the most significant both to the respondent and the public generally: how long should the respondent serve in prison for all of his conduct against the complainants whom he sexually assaulted? However the Court should not overlook the importance of denunciation and the other purposes of punishment when considering the component parts of the sentence imposed by Hidden J even though there might appear to be a degree of artificiality in determining individual sentences and their commencement dates. 
     
      
    89 The Crown contention is both that the sentences imposed for the offences individually and collectively failed to reflect their objective criminality and that the ultimate period of punishment inflicted upon the respondent as a result of the exercise of Hidden J’s sentencing discretion is manifestly inadequate. As we have noted, his Honour imposed an overall sentence of 14 years with a non-parole period of 10 years for the offences before him. He also determined that the respondent should serve an additional period to the sentences imposed by Sully J of a total term of 6 years with an additional non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months. His Honour did not give effect to the intention. 
     
      
    90 Of course it must be borne in mind throughout a consideration of the sentences imposed that the final outcome cannot be considered in a vacuum. Clearly the further period for which the respondent is to remain in custody by reason of the offences before Hidden J cannot fully reflect the seriousness of the offences for which his Honour was passing sentence or what is required under s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. As this Court explained in R v MMK, that section and the purposes of punishment generally must be constrained by the principle of totality. 
     
      
    91 The Crown submitted that the offences before Hidden J each fell within the higher range of criminality for offences coming within the scope of the section under which they were charged. It is further argued that, this being the case, the sentences imposed do not reflect this consideration, notwithstanding statements by the Judge acknowledging their seriousness. Of course one of the factors relied upon substantially by the Crown in support of this argument, the vulnerability of the complainants as an aggravating feature, was withdrawn at the hearing. 
     
      
    92 Of the offences relating to TW the Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Of course, these offences are serious not just because of the behaviour of each of the men involved in the bedroom, but also because they were clearly engaged in a joint criminal enterprise to have sexual intercourse with TW whether or not she consented. In s61J of the Crimes Act Parliament has recognised that fact of combination as a matter which significantly aggravates the offence of sexual intercourse without consent, quite apart from the victim’s youth. 
        
       
      
    93 The offences against TW were indeed serious examples of their kind. True it is not difficult to imagine more serious scenarios but that does not decrease their gravity. The maximum penalty prescribed is imprisonment for 20 years. This is a significant matter in determining the appropriate sentence. As we have already noted, the maximum penalty provides a sentencing yardstick and invites a comparison between the case before the court and the worst possible case. There was little in the way of mitigation of sentence in our view: there was no remorse or contrition, there was little or no significance in the fact that he had no prior record in the circumstances of this case, and, although the Judge was not prepared to find that MAK had no prospects of rehabilitation, this finding did not act as a matter in mitigation of the sentence and reduced any importance that his age might have had. The only matter of significance was the fact that the respondent was in protective custody. 
     
      
    94 We are not persuaded that the individual sentences imposed by the Judge were manifestly inadequate although it must be said that any lesser sentence for the offence in which the respondent was the principal would have been so unreasonable as to give rise to a serious question whether this Court should intervene. However, the overall sentence of 12 years to reflect that criminality was in our view below the range of a legitimate sentencing discretion and a sentence that should attract this Court’s intervention on a Crown appeal notwithstanding the absence of any significant sentencing error. The respondent was criminally responsible for the activities of his co-offenders and therefore to be sentenced for his involvement in four acts of penetration of the complainant including three acts of penile penetration of her vagina. As we have indicated, there was little by way of mitigation of the offence or the sentences to be imposed to reflect their criminality. The least overall sentence that could have been imposed was in our view one of 15 years. There were no special circumstances to have reduced the overall statutory non-parole period applying to that sentence so that however structured the result should have been a total non-parole period of 11 years 4 months. 
     
      
    95 Hidden J said nothing about how he assessed the seriousness of the offence against CH. Presumably by starting at a sentence of 8 years before applying the discount he thought it was roughly of the same seriousness as the offence committed against TW by the respondent as a principal. With respect, we cannot agree with that assessment. The offence against CH was more serious objectively that any one of the offences committed against TW. She was only 13 years of age and, although the Judge accepted that the respondent did not know her age, he knew she was under sixteen and, therefore, there is little mitigation in the fact that he did not know how young she was. Although the fact that the complainant was under the age of 16 years is an element of the aggravated offence, the fact that she was well under that age is a significant matter. The threats of violence while implicit were grave and intended, as the Judge found, to terrify her, as undoubtedly they did. The fact that the complainant, prior to the offence by MAK, had consensual intercourse with his younger brother was irrelevant. 
     
      
    96 In our view there was little to mitigate the objective seriousness of the offence. The fact that the Judge held that the offence was opportunistic had little significance in light of the earlier offences committed against TW: the respondent was prepared to take advantage of a situation when it arose to seriously assault a young and helpless female. Nor in light of the earlier offences was the fact that MSK might have been intoxicated of any great moment. The only matters of significant mitigation were the plea of guilty, for which a 10 per cent discount was given, and the fact that the respondent was on protection. With respect we are of the view that the sentence imposed failed to reflect to a very significant degree the objective seriousness of the offence. The starting sentence should have been at least 10 years. With a discount of 10 per cent the least sentence that it was open to the Judge to impose was one of 9 years. 
     
      
    97 The totality of criminality involved in the offence before Hidden J was high. On its face the two instances of offending were completely independent and serious acts of sexual violence committed a month apart. There was little reason to make the sentences concurrent other than as an act of leniency so that the sentences that were otherwise justified might not be crushing. But elements of denunciation, retribution and deterrence were substantial while the prospect of any reform was minimal. The protection of the community was not an insignificant issue. The least sentence that could have served those purposes of punishment notwithstanding the totality principle was in our opinion one of 18 years. There being no special circumstances, but for considerations of accumulation, the non-parole period relating to that overall sentence should be 13 years 6 months. 
     
      
    98 However the next issue is how that sentence should be structured as against the sentences imposed by Sully J. It is important to note that Sully J was sentencing the respondent for completely separate acts of criminality from those before Hidden J although committed only three days after the offence against CH. They were more serious than the individual offences before Hidden J but of course Hidden J was sentencing for two separate acts of criminality whereas the offences before Sully J were related. Hidden J, rightly with respect, rejected a submission by the Crown that the sentences for offences before him were aggravated in that they involved a number of acts of criminality: cf s 21A(2)(m) and see R v Tadrosse, above. But all the offences committed by MSK could be considered as repeat offending over a relatively short period of time with an increasing degree of seriousness. 
     
      
    99 It should be made clear that, where a judge is sentencing for offences in a situation where another judge has already sentenced the offender for other offences, the second judge must regard the first sentence as an appropriate exercise of the first judge’s discretion and not seek to reduce or increase it by the sentences the second judge imposes. We are not suggesting that this is what Hidden J did or attempted to do. But we note the difficulty that confronts the second judge in trying to determine what the overall sentence would have been had a single judge been sentencing the offender for all offences for which he is, and has been, punished. That is in effect part of what an application of the principle of totality requires. We should approach the task, as Hidden J was required to do, by taking into account that the sentences imposed by Sully J were appropriate to reflect the seriousness of the offences before him. 
     
      
    100 As we noted in R v MMK, the sentences imposed by Sully J were justifiably heavy as the criminality was high and there was little by way of mitigation of the objective seriousness of the offences or otherwise. But as we have already stated, the total criminality before Hidden J was also substantial and there was little by way of mitigation. The principal consideration was therefore to impose a sentence that significantly reflected the total criminality and the proper purposes of punishment but took into account the purposes to be served by the principle of totality discussed above. 
     
      
    101 With respect and paying due regard to the discretion of Hidden J and the flexible approach he should be allowed in structuring sentences in such a difficult exercise of discretion, we believe that his Honour failed sufficiently to reflect the totality of the criminality before him having regard to the sentences imposed for the offences before Sully J. The ultimate sentence that the respondent is presently to serve is unreasonable in failing sufficiently to reflect the purposes of punishment that such serious offending warrants in light of the relative lack of subjective considerations justifying a lenient or merciful approach. In our opinion an increase in the sentences imposed by Sully J of the extent to which Hidden J intended, that is an increase of the total term of 6 years and of the non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months, is manifestly inadequate. Further we have come to the view that, notwithstanding the principle of double jeopardy and the other discretionary considerations attending a Crown appeal, we should intervene and increase the overall sentence the respondent is to serve. 
     
      
    102 We intend that the respondent should serve a further period in custody after the completion of the sentence imposed by Sully J and before being eligible to parole of 8 years with an extension of the head sentence by 10 years. This means that the respondent is to serve a total sentence of 32 years with a non-parole period of 24 years from 13 August 2002. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
      
    103 In respect of the appeal against the sentences imposed upon MAK the appeal is dismissed. 
     
      
    104 In respect of the appeal against the sentences imposed upon MSK the appeal is allowed and the sentences imposed by Hidden J are varied as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The sentence of 8 years imprisonment for the third count on the indictment relating to TW is to commence on 13 August 2019. The non-parole period of 4 years is to commence on that date and to expire on 12 August 2023. 
         
         
        The sentence of 8 years imprisonment for the fourth count on the indictment relating to TW is to commence on 13 August 2021. The non-parole period is quashed and in lieu there is to be a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months commencing on that date and to expire on 12 February 2026. 
         
         
        The sentence in relation to the offence against CH is quashed and in lieu the respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for 9 years to commence on 13 August 2025 with a non-parole period of 12 months to commence on that date and to expire on 12 August 2026 the date upon which the respondent is first eligible to be considered for release to parole.

      2006/736 - REGINA v Antony Richard BOULDEN 
       
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Antony Richard Boulden (to whom I shall refer as the offender) comes before me for sentence. On 2 June 2006, the offender pleaded guilty before Barr J in this Court to one count of being privy to the fraudulent altering of the books of a company contrary to s 590(1)(c)(iii) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).  
     
      
    2 This offence carries a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment. 
     
      
    3 The relevant facts are, as might be expected, not without their complication. The Crown was represented in the sentence hearing by Mr Game of Senior Counsel and Mr Wigney. Ms Fullerton SC appeared for the offender. The parties came to a sensible agreement, which reflected itself in the presentation of an agreed statement of facts. It will be sufficient, accordingly, if I simply set out in this decision those agreed facts. They are as follows. 
     
      
       
       
       
       
      Statement of facts 
       
       
       
        
        “1. At all relevant times in 1997 and 1998 FAI Insurances Limited (“FAI”) was a publicly listed company. FAI was obliged to provide half-yearly consolidated results to the Australian Stock Exchange Limited (“ASX”) including its consolidated results for the half year ending 31 December 1997. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        2. At all relevant times FAI General Insurance Company Limited (“FAIG”) was a wholly owned subsidiary of FAI. FAIG was a licensed insurer and conducted the majority of insurance operations on behalf of the FAI Group of Companies.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        3. On 19 February 1998 FAI released its half yearly to 31 December 1997 consolidated results to the ASX. These results disclosed an operating profit before tax of $3.175 million. This operating profit was inflated by improper reductions to the liabilities of FAIG that occurred on 23 January 1998 and totalled approximately $5.5 million.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        4. The Offender holds a Bachelor of Commerce in Accounting, Finance and Systems from the University of New South Wales. He commenced employment with FAIG in 1990 and on 1 September 1995 became the Financial Controller of the Corporate and Professional Insurance Division (""CPID"") within FAIG, which operated out of premises in Kent Street, Sydney 
        . 
         Although the Offender resigned from FAIG on 9 December 1997, he withdrew that resignation shortly thereafter upon an offer 
          
        of promotion and instatement into the position of Financial Controller New Zealand. A Contract of Employment was executed on 15 December 1997 but the position was not filled by Mr Boulden at any time thereafter due to the repeated postponement of his departure date at management’s direction. Whilst awaiting the transfer to New Zealand the Offender was transferred to the Management Information Division of FAIG located at Ryde, New South Wales. The Offender continued to act in the role of Financial Controller of the CPID during the relevant period and continued to be responsible for producing the CPID Monthly Management Accounts for the half-year end for December 1997. He requested that the improper reductions to FAIG’s liabilities be carried out on 23 January 1998. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        RELEVANT PERSONNEL OF FAI GROUP OF COMPANIES 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        5. Rodney Adler (“Adler”) was a director of FAI and Chief Executive Officer of the FAI Group of companies. Timothy Mainprize (“Mainprize”) was a director of FAI, FAIG and the head of Finance and Administration of the FAI Group of companies. Mainprize reported to Adler. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        6. At all relevant times Adler, Mainprize, Daniel Wilkie (“Wilkie”) and Ashraf Kamha (“Kamha”) were directors of FAIG. Wilkie reported to Adler.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        INSURANCE OPERATIONS OF FAIG 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        7. Prior to November 1997, FAIG had the following two Insurance divisions: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) The General Insurance Division (“GID”). The GID underwrote retail lines or ‘short tail’ classes of insurance and was headed by Wilkie. The short tail classes of insurance included, for example, CTP “green slip” insurance. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) The CPID underwrote FAIG’s ‘long tail’ classes of insurance and was headed by Kamha. The long tail classes of insurance included professional indemnity, public liability, certain property and marine insurance, overseas insurance and a class of insurance known as ‘inwards re-insurance’.  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        8. The two Divisions were referred to in FAI’s accounts as “General Insurance”. In a restructure in November 1997 GID and CPID merged. Nevertheless during the period of time relevant to this matter, both GID and CPID continued to report internally as two Divisions.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        9. Wilkie became Chief Operating Officer of the merged insurance business. Kamha was Managing Director of CPID and after the restructure reported to Wilkie. Whilst Wilkie had ultimate responsibility for the merged insurance business from late November 1997, Kamha had day-to-day responsibility for CPID. Both Kamha and Wilkie were responsible for CPID for the reporting period ended 31 December 1997.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        FAI’S ELECTRONIC BOOKS OF ACCOUNT: CASE ESTIMATES, IBNRS AND IBNERS 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        At all relevant times insurance companies had an obligation to: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) Estimate the amount which would be required to meet outstanding insurance claims (“case estimates” but also referred to variously as the claims 
          
        estimates, case reserves, claims 
          
        reserves or reserves); 
         
         
        (b) Estimate claims which had been incurred but not yet been reported (“IBNR”); and  
         
         
        (c) Estimate an allowance for expected increases in case estimates for the reported claims referred to as incurred but not enough reported (“IBNER”).  
         
         
         
        10. The case estimates, IBNR and IBNER were required to be accounted for as an expense and liability of FAIG.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        11. FAIG claims officers calculated the case estimates. The IBNR and IBNER were derived from calculations usually made or reviewed by actuaries.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        12. FAIG maintained an electronic database, called AEGIS, to process and record premiums, payments, insurance details and outstanding case estimates. Once the case estimates, were determined by FAIG claims officers, they were entered into AEGIS by authorised staff.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        13. The normal process to make an adjustment to an existing case estimate on AEGIS, where the adjustment was below $100,000 was by a case officer completing a File Action Request Form. Where the adjustment was above $100,000 it was by completing and having approved a Major Loss Report. Those increases above $100,000 but below $500,000 could be approved by the Deputy CPID Claims Manager, Ronald Shorter. Those increases above $500,000 but below $1 million could be approved by the CPID Claims Manager, Robert Spratt. Increases above $1 million required approval through Kamha.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        14. CPID also conducted claims file reviews on an annual basis. The annual claims file reviews were conducted in the lead up to the end of the financial year at 30 June each year. In December 1997 there was a ‘mini’ claims file review directed at CPID claims exceeding $500,000. Any adjustments to existing case estimates arising out of such reviews were entered into AEGIS. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        15. AEGIS data was interfaced to FAIG’s “Masterpiece” electronic general ledger (“the general ledger”) on a monthly basis. The case estimates data on AEGIS was not transferred to the general ledger on an individual claim basis, instead case estimates were transferred to the general ledger in aggregated batches determined by the type of insurance involved. Manual adjustments could be made to the general ledger with respect to the various aggregated case estimates. 
          
        IBNR and IBNER were entered directly into the general ledger. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        OFFENDER'S ROLE WITHIN CPID 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        16. The Offender was Financial Controller of CPID. He reported to Kamha on CPID matters but he also reported to Mainprize on financial matters. The Offender was responsible for consolidating the various underwriting results of CPID and posting those results into the general ledger, which was consolidated each month into the FAI general ledger. The Offender had authority to request that entries be made to CPID’s general ledger after it had been closed for the preparation of accounts. He was also responsible for producing the CPID Monthly Management Accounts.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        17. Howaida Azer (“Azer”) was a Management Accountant in CPID and reported to the Offender. Azer’s responsibilities included preparing draft CPID Monthly Management Accounts. Azer provided the draft accounts to the Offender each month and discussed them with him. The Offender in turn provided the draft CPID Monthly Management Accounts to Kamha and Mainprize.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        18. On approximately 3 to 4 occasions prior to February 1998, the Offender had instructed Azer to reduce the IBNR liability in the general ledger. On each occasion, the instructions had come after the Offender had met with Mainprize and 
        / 
        or Kamha to discuss the draft CPID results. Azer understood from conversations with the Offender that if Kamha or Mainprize  
        “… did not like the result then … [the offender] … would be required to make adjustments improving the CPID result.” 
          
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        19. Azer was concerned about these adjustments and on one occasion raised her concern with the Offender. The Offender told her “Don’t worry about it. We will reverse the journal for the next month. Whatever we do now will be reviewed by the Actuaries and it will all come out in the wash anyway.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        THE FINANCIAL PICTURE IN LATE 1997 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        20. The performance of the insurance operations of the FAI Group from July to December 1997 had steadily deteriorated with the exception of a spike in CPID results in September 1997.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        21. Monthly Corporate Management Accounts 
          
        were prepared for the FAI Group. These Accounts contained consolidated data from the business operations of the FAI Group, including GID and CPID.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        22. The internal FAI Group Monthly Corporate Management Accounts 
          
        for November 1997 (annexed and barcoded  
        S01369337

          (a) FAI Group year to date made an operating before tax loss of $72.329 million against a year to date budgeted profit of $4.642 million. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) General Insurance (both GID and CPID) made a year to date underwriting loss of $29.755 million against a budgeted loss of $16.749 million. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) The General Insurance underwriting result for the month of November 1997 was a loss of $5.716 million which was $3.691 million worse than the budgeted loss of $2.025 million. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        23. It was noted in these Accounts that “The year to date underwriting loss for CPID is $9.209 million which is $8.214 million [worse] than the budgeted loss of $0.995 million”.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        THE REDUCTIONS OF 23 JANUARY 1998 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        24. On 2 December 1997, the timetable for the production and then release of the FAI 31 December 1997 results to the ASX was circulated to a number of FAI officers, including the Offender. A copy of this document, barcode  
        S01254062 
        , is annexed. The timetable recorded that 23 January 1998 was the final date that journal adjustments could be made to the general ledger for the month of December 1997. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        25. On 15 January 1998 Azer prepared draft CPID results which identified a loss of $26.78 million. A copy of this document, barcode  
        S01144145 
        , is annexed. 
          
        Her practice was to provide draft CPID results and then discuss them with the Offender. It was Azer’s understanding that the Offender would usually discuss the draft CPID results with Kamha and Mainprize. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        26. By 23 January 1998, the CPID staff who usually made adjustments to the general ledger, no longer had direct access to the general ledger. Access was limited for control purposes so that Marc Gross (“Gross”), Assistant Group Financial Controller of the FAI Group, could prepare the statutory accounts for the FAI Group. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        27. At about 9.26 am on 23 January 1998 the Offender sent Gross an email which was copied to Kamha and Azer. A copy of this document, barcode  
        S01144541 
        , is annexed. The email was headed “Dec 97” and the Offender wrote,

        28. At about 9.32 am on 23 January 1998, Gross emailed the Offender to advise that he would arrange for the journals to be posted. Gross also asked  
        “As a matter of urgency could you please provide explanation for these journals so that they can be attached to the journals.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        29. At about 10.50 am on 23 January 1998, the Offender replied to Gross, “Reduction in reserves due to claim review in December 1997 not processed (sic) in Aegis due to staff resourcing issues. Should be processed in AEGIS in January 1998.” A copy of Gross’s email and the Offender’s reply, barcode  
        S01144156 
        , is annexed.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        30. Gross then arranged for a number of entries to be booked into the general ledger in accordance with the instructions of the Offender. 
          
        He assumed that the Offender had authority from Kamha and Mainprize to make the adjustments. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        31. There was no proper basis for the adjustments requested by the Offender on 23 January 1998. 
          
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        32. The Offender gave a false explanation for the reductions. There was no claim 
          
        file review in December 1997 that would have formed the basis of the 
          
        reductions, there was no shortage of staff that would have prevented entries being made in AEGIS at the appropriate time and no entries related to the reductions were to be made to AEGIS in January 1998.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        33. The Offender’s intention in sending the email was to bring CPID’s underwriting loss for the half-year to under $20 million and thereby increase the FAI Group profit for the half-year.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        THE EVENTS AFTER THE 23 JANUARY 1998 REDUCTIONS 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        34. Azer finalised the CPID Monthly Management Accounts for July to December 1997, which incorporated the improper reductions made to the general ledger and recorded a year to date loss of $19.676 million. A copy of these accounts, barcode  
        S01436001 
         is annexed. The CPID Monthly Management Accounts were incorporated into the FAI Group Corporate Management Accounts for December 1997. A copy of these accounts, barcode  
        SBA253090 
         is also annexed. The FAI Group Corporate Management Accounts for December 1997 showed: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) FAI Group year to date made an operating before tax profit of $3.175 million against a year to date budgeted profit of $5.927 million. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) General Insurance (both GID and CPID) made a year to date underwriting loss of $29.811 million against a budgeted loss of $20.149 million. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) The General Insurance underwriting result for the month of December 1997 was a profit of $.400 million, which was $4.644 million better than the budgeted loss of $4.244 million. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        35. It was noted in these Accounts that “The year to date underwriting loss for CPID is $19.676 million which is $19.844 million worse than the budgeted loss of $0.168 million."" 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        36. Mainprize approved the FAI Group Corporate Management Accounts for December 1997 to be included in papers provided to the FAI Board.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        37. In early February 1998, the following financial statements for the half-year ending 31 December 1997 (""the half yearly financial reports"") were prepared from information contained in the FAI general ledger: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) Appendix 4B (not equity accounted) Half Yearly report for FAI Insurances Limited 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) FAI Insurances Limited Half-Year Financial Statements and Reports 
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
        38. The operating profit before tax 
          
        for FAI reported in the half yearly financial reports was $3.175 million. This profit reflected the adjustments made to the general ledger on 23 January 1998.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        39. Mainprize approved the half yearly financial reports prior to them being presented to FAI’s Board of Directors. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        40. On 19 February 1998 there was an FAI board meeting. The FAI Group Corporate Management Accounts for December 1997 were tabled and discussed at the meeting. The Board also resolved to approve the half yearly financial reports together with a 3-page announcement to the ASX. The announcement referred to the FAI Group’s operating before tax profit of $3.175 million.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        41. Without the 23 January 1998 adjustments totalling approximately $5.5 million made at the direction of the Offender, FAI would have recorded a loss of approximately $2.325 million. FAI would also have recorded additional liabilities of $5.5 million. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        42. The half yearly financial reports and announcement referring to FAI’s profit were released to the ASX on 19 February 1998. A copy of this announcement, barcode  
        SBA265071 
        , is annexed. 
          
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        43. The Offender is 41 years old. He has no prior convictions. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        44. The Offender’s remuneration from FAIG included the following: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) From October 1997 as Financial Controller of CPID, his total remuneration package was $111,500 per annum. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) From 15 December 1997 the Offender’s total remuneration package increased to $150,000 per annum in anticipation of his transfer to New Zealand. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        45. In late 1998 HIH Insurance Limited (“HIH”) took over FAI. The Offender was made redundant by HIH in March 1999. HIH collapsed in March 2001.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        46. There is no evidence that the Offender held shares in FAI or HIH.” 
        
       
       
      Further matters 
       
      
    4 The agreed facts refer to a series of attachments. I have not reproduced these because of their bulk. I have, however, read the attachments and taken them into account for the purpose of better understanding the agreed facts. The attachments form part of Exhibit “A”.  
     
      
       
      Chronology 
       
      
    5 It may be useful if I briefly mention the way in which the subject offence came to light and the history of the prosecution. As indicated at the outset, the offence occurred on 23 January 1998. HIH Insurances Limited (HIH) completed the acquisition of FAIG’s parent company FAI Insurances Limited in January 1999. Provisional liquidators were appointed to HIH on 15 March 2001. The company was formally placed in liquidation in August 2001.  
     
      
    6 Letters Patent were issued in August 2001 to the Honourable Justice Owen to enable him to conduct a Royal Commission in respect of the notorious failure of HIH. The offender himself gave evidence during this Royal Commission. Justice Owen’s Report was tabled in the Federal Parliament in April 2003. This led to the involvement of ASIC to establish a Taskforce to investigate matters referred to it by the Royal Commission and other matters considered appropriate.  
     
      
    7 Although the Royal Commissioner made no referral with respect to the conduct of the offender in relation to the subject offence, ASIC’s own investigation led to a situation where the offender was asked to participate in a record of interview. As he was entitled to do, the offender declined to so participate. This was in late 2005. 
     
      
    8 A court attendance notice was issued and served on the offender in October 2005. The matter first came before Downing Centre Local Court on 22 November 2005. Bail was granted on conditions that were agreed by consent. 
     
      
    9 On 28 March 2006, the offender, with the consent of the prosecution, waived his right to a committal hearing. The offender was then sent for trial in the Supreme Court, the proceedings to be mentioned in this Court on 5 May 2006. The matter was adjourned until 2 June 2006. On that day, the offender entered his plea of guilty to the charge in the indictment. Barr J stood the sentencing hearing over until later in the year. I was nominated as the sentencing Judge. At the same time Barr J directed that a report be obtained from the Department of Corrective Services in the nature of a pre-sentence report. 
     
      
    10 A pre-sentence report was tendered before this Court on 13 November 2006. It indicated (Exhibit “B”) the offender’s ability to meet a financial penalty and his suitability for a Periodic Detention Order. He was assessed, however, as unsuitable for a Community Service Order on the basis that he resided in Queensland. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    11 I turn next to consider the subjective case for the offender. He was born on 7 November 1964. This means he has in fact recently turned 42 years of age. He is married and has young children. Prior to this matter, he had no criminal record. At the present time he lives in Queensland and, as I understand it, his move to that State was in part related to the personal and professional difficulties he faced as a consequence of the subject offence and its publicity in the aftermath of the HIH catastrophe. The offender was educated in Sydney and obtained a Commerce Degree from the University of New South Wales. He worked in the insurance industry at FAI from approximately 1990 to 1999, at which time when he was made redundant. Prior to his involvement with FAI, he worked with H L B Mann Judd as a professional staff member between 1983 and 1988. Thereafter, he worked with Dexta Corporation Limited as chief financial officer before taking up his employment with FAI. 
     
      
    12 There are a number of testimonials before me which attest to the offender’s good character and his record of community involvement. These speak well of his general honesty, reliability and strength of character. They all suggest that the commission of the subject offence was completely out of character and may have been due to pressure placed on him at FAI during the relevant period. For example, a chartered account, Graham Woods, said in his reference: - 
     
      
       
        
        “I was shocked to hear that Tony had been charged with a criminal offence. I knew that he was under a lot of pressure at FAI during 1997 and 1998 and was struggling personally with the demands being placed upon him, but the offence is quite out of character for the friend I have known for more than 20 years. 
        
       
       
        
        Perhaps because of my background as an accountant, I understand the stressful position Tony was placed in at FAI. I know that Tony is reluctant to challenge authority, and that he had a high regard for his mentor, Tim Mainprize, and that when directed to perform a task his initial reaction is to do so. Loyalty is also one of Tony’s strongest characteristics and I suspect that he felt obliged or pressured to act as the company wanted”. 
        
       
      
    13 There is another telling testimonial from Bob Wheeldon who worked with the offender at FAI for a period of time. Mr Wheeldon said: - 
     
      
       
        
        “9. FAI had an extremely small head office with minimal middle management and junior management reporting straight through to directors. I think this encouraged a yes mentality by the younger staff who did not have sufficient authority to challenge older staff. The capacity to report through to directors gave junior management the impression of seniority which really did not exist. 
        
       
       
        
        10. In my opinion, FAI directors did not value independent critical thinking by junior management. For instance, I was heavily criticised by Rodney Adler for negative comments I made in 1993 in relation to Brad Cooper and FAI security, which I copied, to a number of directors and senior management”. 
        
       
      
    14 Mr Wheeldon attached to his reference a copy of a memorandum from Mr Adler to himself dated 29 July 1993 which bears out, only too well, the criticism suggested by Mr Wheeldon. 
     
      
    15 In all other respects, the testimonials reflect the fact that, partly as a consequence of the commission of this offence, the offender has been virtually forced out of the insurance business. He has had to find, with some difficulty, other avenues for earning an income to support himself and his family. The testimonials also speak of the offender’s shame and embarrassment as a result of the commission of the offence, his contrition and his recognition of the mistake he made in the role he played in misleading the market and shareholders of the insurance company. 
     
      
       
      Objective criminality 
       
      
    16 In my opinion, the objective criminality involved in the present offence is at a not insignificant level. Indeed, it was not suggested by Ms Fullerton SC, in her helpful and thorough submissions, that the position was otherwise. The offender was in a responsible middle management position. He had the ability to give instructions and take steps that could, in the ultimate, affect the material that was to be published and given to the Stock Exchange in due course. The e-mail he composed on 23 January 1998, and sent to Mr Gross, was plainly his own work, although it is true he may have been acting at the direction of or prompting of others. But the creation of the document itself was clearly his own work. The fraudulent nature of the exercise is illustrated by the fact that on 23 January 1998, he again e-mailed Mr Gross and lied to him about the reason for the alteration to the journals. (See paras 29 and 30 of agreed facts). 
     
      
    17 On the other hand, it is clear that, apart from “hanging on” to his own position with its well paid salary, the offender did not stand to gain personally in a financial manner from the creation of the fraudulent document. It is to be supposed that he might have refused to carry out the prompting of his superiors; and that accordingly his moral culpability lay in his inability to refuse to be the architect of the fraudulent alteration. But, in truth, his moral culpability is at a rather higher level than this: the offender was in a middle management position with a direct capacity to alter the recorded estimates. He had subordinates who answered to him. As I shall later discuss, he would not have been unaware of the likelihood of the ultimate placement of the altered figures into the FAI Group Corporate Management Accounts and the half yearly financial reports for the FAI Group. It was precisely because of the position he occupied that those who prompted, invited or directed him to the commission of the criminal act chose him for the task. The offender would not have been unaware of this, particularly as there had been earlier instances of executive interference followed by alterations (see paras 18 and 19 of the agreed facts). There was plainly a culture of dishonesty at the company. Regrettably, the offender became infected by that culture and corrupted by it. 
     
      
       
      Submissions of the parties 
       
      
    18 The Crown has submitted that, given the nature and circumstances of the offence, a sentence of fulltime custody is the most appropriate sentence in relation to the offence. This is particularly so because of the presence of what were described as aggravating features of the offender’s conduct. They were, so it was submitted, the following: - 
     
      
       
      (a) The offender occupied a senior position in a significant public company 
       
       
      (b) The offender knew and intended that the false entry in the ledger that he caused to be made would directly lead to a false reduction of FAIG’s underwriting loss for the year ended 31 December 1997 of about $5.5 million. The offender also knew and intended that, when consolidated with the accounts of FAI Insurance Limited, this would directly lead to a false increase in FAI’s profit of about $5.5 million, thereby converting what would have been an overall loss for that period into a small profit. 
       
       
      (c) The offender knew that the false profit figure for FAI would be released to the market, with the consequence that the market would receive materially false information about a significant publicly listed company; and 
       
       
      (d) The offender lied to other employees of the FAI Group of Companies about the reasons for the false entries. 
       
      
    19 As to the first matter, the Crown submitted that the offender played a central role in effecting the fraudulent alterations. As Financial Controller of the CPID, the offender was responsible for consolidating and posting CPID’s underwriting results into the general ledger. In that capacity, he had the authority to request late entries to be made to the general ledger. The fact that he sent the request for alterations knowing that the request had no proper basis, and then gave a false explanation about it, leads to the conclusion that he played a role in planning, and a significant role in implementing the alterations. 
     
      
    20 In relation to the second and third matters, the Crown concedes that the offender was not responsible for FAI’s accounts or the announcement being made to the Australian Stock Exchange concerning FAI’s profit. But, the Crown submits, the only reasonable inference is that at the time the offender engaged in the conduct, he must be taken to have known that it would affect the accuracy of FAI’s announcement to the Stock Exchange. He must be taken to have known that the purpose of the adjustments was to improve the results that FAI was to announce to the market at year-end. The matters supporting this submission, according to the Crown submission, are the offender’s formal qualifications, his professional experience, his executive position as CPID’s Financial Controller; and that he had been specifically informed that FAIG’s accounts would be incorporated into FAI’s Group accounts for the half-year ending 31 December 1997 and be released to the Stock Exchange. This last matter, the Crown argued, appears clearly from the timetable for the consolidation of accounts and the finalisation of the ASX announcement which are contained in a memorandum sent to a number of people within the organisation, including to the offender himself. 
     
      
    21 Although the Crown submitted that a sentence of fulltime custody was the most appropriate sentence in all the circumstances, the Crown submitted that any sentence less than actual custody of one kind or another would be entirely inappropriate. The Crown’s general stance had, as its pillar of support, the contention that general deterrence was the most significant consideration in the exercise of the present sentencing discretion. The Crown argued that, anything less than either fulltime imprisonment, or at the very least, periodic detention, would send entirely the wrong message to the business community. 
     
      
    22 In this regard, the Crown stressed the important role that general deterrence must play in sentences for white collar crime, particularly those involving breach of trust (R v Glenister (1980) 2 NSWLR 597; R v Pantano (1990) 49 A Crim R 328; R v Halabi (unreported NSWCCA 17 February 1992); R v Corner (unreported NSWCCA 19 December 1997) and R v Rivkin [2004] NSWCCA 7 at [423]). 
     
      
    23 On the offender’s behalf, Ms Fullerton SC submitted that the outcome of this sentencing exercise was, in some respects, a difficult one and was finely poised. In that respect, the Crown generally agreed. 
     
      
    24 Ms Fullerton’s primary submission was that the Court should consider imposing a suspended sentence in the present matter. In other words, Ms Fullerton acknowledged that the Court might properly come to a conclusion that, having considered all other available sentences, no sentence other than imprisonment was appropriate in the circumstances (s 17A of the Crimes Act (Commonwealth) 1914). On the other hand, Ms Fullerton argued that of the three types of imprisonment available, namely fulltime custodial sentence, periodic detention or suspended sentence, the third option would be the most appropriate. (I should add that I have used the expression “suspended sentence”, as did the parties as a term of convenience. Strictly speaking, the correct order falls within the rubric of a recognizance release order (s 20(1)(b)). 
     
      
    25 The three matters relied upon by Ms Fullerton as warranting such an approach were these: first, the fact that the offending occurred in January 1998 but was first charged in November 2005. In this regard, Ms Fullerton was careful to submit that the penalty in this case should not, in the strict sense, be mitigated by delay. Ms Fullerton did not suggest that there had been an unacceptable delay on the part of the prosecuting authorities. With that qualification I entirely agree. The point made by senior counsel, however, was that, throughout this long period of many years, the offender had entirely rehabilitated himself to such an extent that it could legitimately be said that there was no possibility of any further offending. 
     
      
    26 The second point made by Ms Fullerton was that there were, in fact, no features of aggravation such as to place this offender in a serious category and to place his offending in a serious class of offending. Ms Fullerton took issue with the Crown’s four separate features of aggravation and argued that they were not of such quality as to aggravate the outcome as the Crown had argued. 
     
      
    27 I accept that Ms Fullerton’s first point has some substance in it. The offender was 33 at the time of the commission of the offence. He had an unblemished record prior to that time. He is now 42, as he comes before the Court for sentence, and there is no suggestion that he has been guilty of any criminal conduct since early 1998. The delay in prosecuting arose because of the complexity of the HIH Royal Commission and because of the natural and entirely reasonable delay that followed upon the publication of the Commissioner’s report. The ASIC investigators had many avenues to follow and there can be no criticism of the fact that a number of years passed before the decision to prosecute was made in the present matter. As I have made clear, Ms Fullerton has not advanced any submission critical of the investigating process or the prosecution. Rather, she points to the fact that the passage of many years has resulted in a situation where the offender’s position has changed significantly so as to demonstrate, beyond doubt, his complete rehabilitation. 
     
      
    28 In relation to Ms Fullerton’s second point, it will be necessary to examine each of the four allegedly aggravating features. 
     
      
    29 As to the first feature, Ms Fullerton argued that the position occupied by the offender was somewhat more limited than the Crown had submitted. For example, it was pointed out that the offender was the Financial Controller of only one of the two divisions within FAIG, namely the Corporate Professional and Insurance Division. He played no role at all in respect of the General Insurance Division. He was not even a manager of his division, nor did he exercise any executive responsibilities. He had no responsibility or authority in dealing with the external accountants or auditors. 
     
      
    30 In particular, Ms Fullerton argued that the offender was not the architect of the decision to manipulate the underwriting loss. There was no evidence, for example, that he was consulted about that matter or expressed any views about it himself or contributed to any decision that the alteration be made. Rather there is, by inference, evidence to suggest that he may have been prompted or directed to take the steps he did. Senior counsel pointed to the facts in paras 18 and 19. These relate to three or four earlier occasions where the offender had instructed his subordinate to reduce the estimates in the general ledger. Of course, the offender is not charged with any offence in relation to any of these earlier occasions and does not fall to be punished in any respect for them. They do, however, provide some insight into the culture of dishonesty which plainly pervaded the company at the relevant time. As the facts indicate, the instructions to make these changes came after the offender had met with Mr Mainprize and/or Mr Kamha to discuss the draft CPID results. If either of those gentlemen did not like the result, then the offender would be required to make any adjustments improving the result. A further indication of the situation appears in para 30 of the agreed facts where Mr Gross made an assumption that, in relation to the January alterations, the offender had authority from the Messrs Kamha and Mainprize to make the adjustments. 
     
      
    31 The resolution of this difference between the parties carries with it some advantage for each side. On the one hand, Ms Fullerton is plainly correct in indicating that the offender was not the architect of the decision to set in train the alteration of the records. Secondly, it is true that he was prompted, if not directed, by his superiors to take the action he did. Thirdly, his role in the company is correctly stated as being middle management rather than senior executive. On the other hand, as I indicated in an earlier statement in these reasons, it was precisely because of the position that the offender occupied that he was chosen for the task entrusted to him. His criminality lies in the fact that he did not resist the urgings of his superiors but went along with them, no doubt influenced by the general culture of dishonesty within the corporate group. Additionally, he was, at least, the architect of the means by which the alteration to the record was to be effected. It was precisely because of the position he occupied that he was able to set the ball rolling towards the later significant alterations in group accounts and the subsequent notification to the Stock Exchange. 
     
      
    32 This brings me to the second point. Ms Fullerton rightly pointed out that the offender had no role or any interest in the achievement of a particular quantifiable profit over and above the bottom line. Moreover, the offender had no role to play at all in ensuring that, from an accounting perspective, the outcome set in train by his actions would be achieved. Ms Fullerton submitted that there is no evidence that Mr Boulden could have known, as at 23 January, how the alteration to the ledger would ultimately impact upon the performance of other business and operations of other entities in the group. 
     
      
    33 Ms Fullerton argued that the offender did not know and intend that the false profit figure for FAI would be released to the market, that is that the market would receive materially false information about the affairs of the public company. At most, Ms Fullerton argued, the offender may have contemplated that there would be an overall conversion from loss to profit but that was the extent of his state of mind. In my view however, matters two and three do contain matters of aggravation for this offence. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender knew that the alteration he directed would be likely to be reflected in false profit figures released to the market. For example, the memorandum (S01254062 dated 2 December 1997) from Rachael Kenna is in the following terms: - 
     
      
       
        
        “It is planned that the half yearly release to the FAI Insurance Group to the Australian Stock Exchange will be finalised by 4 February 1998. The following items will be reported: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          1. Consolidated profit and loss result for the six months ending 31 December 1997; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          2. The consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 1997; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          3. Consolidated statement of cash flows. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Based on the completion date of 4 February 1998, a timetable has been prepared detailing the tasks required and persons responsible. If you foresee any problems, I would be grateful if you would contact me as soon as possible. 
        
       
       
        
        Rachael Kenna”. 
        
       
      
    34 At the foot of this memo there is note initialled by Mr Kamha and dated 4 December 1997. It is in these terms: - 
     
      
       
        
        “Tony Boulden, 
        
       
       
        
        Pls discuss”. 
        
       
      
    35 The distribution list for this memo includes the name of “Tony Boulden”. The timetable annexed to the memo indicates that the offender’s specific task was to provide draft CPID results to head office by 12 January 1998. Further details in the timetable, which would have been seen by the offender, make it clear that these matters would flow through to the ultimate preparation of consolidated results and consolidated balance sheet. They would flow through as well to the finalisation of corporate accounts and the preparation and delivery of a Stock Exchange release. 
     
      
    36 In my view, there can be no doubt whatsoever that the offender would have known that, by making a reduction of $5.5 million, there would be a direct effect flowing through the accounts to the Stock Exchange release. The offender plainly would have expected, or at least contemplated, that the alteration that he was making would directly lead to a false reduction of the underwriting loss for the half-yearly period. In turn, he would have contemplated and understood that, when consolidated with the accounts of FAI, this would directly lead to a false increase in FAI’s profit situation. 
     
      
    37 In relation to the final matter, Ms Fullerton submitted that the lies told by the offender to Mr Gross were part of the fraudulent alteration, that is an element in the offence itself, and should not be assessed as a separately aggravating feature. I agree with that submission. The lie, however, may be taken into account as part and parcel of the assessment of the seriousness of the criminal behaviour involved, although it does not, in my view, separately aggravate the criminality.  
     
      
    38 In all, what is revealed, I think, is an offence that falls comfortably into the mid-level range of seriousness. It is not the most serious offence of this kind but, as Ms Fullerton conceded, it is certainly a serious offence. 
     
      
    39 The third matter relied upon by Ms Fullerton is her argument that the situation in the case of R v Hodgson [2002] SASC 234 should be distinguished from the present matter. The defendant in that case was a senior finance executive of the Harris Scarfe Group. He pleaded guilty to making and procuring false entries in the accounts of the company. The offences were numerous and committed over a period of about three to four years. Hodgson’s sentence was reduced by the operation of s 16G of the Crimes Act 1914 and as a result of his assistance to authorities. He received an overall effective sentence of five years and six months with a non-parole period of two years and nine months. Debelle J, with whom Doyle CJ and Williams J agreed, held that the sentence of eight years which the Judge fixed as his starting point was, in all the circumstances, a merciful sentence. Debelle J said at [25} 
     
      
       
        
        “Employees of companies holding office at this level of seniority, like directors, have a social and moral obligation, as well as a statutory obligation, to act honestly and responsibly. A great trust is imposed in them by directors, shareholders and creditors alike. Their actions have the capacity to affect many, especially shareholders and creditors. It has the capacity to affect staff who may lose employment because of false accounting. Dishonesty of this kind has the capacity to undermine confidence in published accounts and in the integrity of commercial dealings. Sentences of this kind of offending must, therefore, reflect a significant element of general deterrence.” 
        
       
      
    40 Ms Fullerton argued that these comments must be seen in the context of the facts relevant to the sentencing exercise involved in that case. The points of distinction made by Ms Fullerton in relation to the facts were these: first, Hodgson was primarily responsible for the preparation of the financial accounts for the entire group whereas Mr Boulden was not. Secondly, Hodgson faced 32 counts altogether and the offending conduct was over a significant number of years. Moreover, the Court in South Australia did not accept Hodgson’s claim that he had been pressured by one of the directors into making the alterations. 
     
      
    41 I agree with Ms Fullerton that there are some marked points of distinction between the facts in the Hodgson matter and those in the present situation. But, as a general statement, Debelle J’s remarks have a wide application and extend to the situation in which the offender found himself here. I also agree with Debelle J that sentences for the kind of offending that was involved in Hodgson’s case and, for that matter in the present case, must, appropriately, reflect a significant element of general deterrence.  
     
      
       
      Commonwealth sentencing principles – statutory background 
       
      
    42 The sentence to be imposed upon the offender for the offence against the Corporations Act, being a Commonwealth Statute, is to be determined in accordance with Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). Section 16A(2) of the Crimes Act provides a “check list” of the matters which the Court must take into account in the sentencing of Federal offences. It is common ground between the parties that this is not a catalogue of considerations, exclusive of other relevant considerations. In this regard, the consideration of general deterrence, a matter of particular significance in the present matter, must also be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence, even though that matter is not mentioned in the relevant section (R v Karhani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370 at 377; R v Thomas (1997) 37 ATR 296 at 307). 
     
      
    43 As I have said, the element of general deterrence is always important in white-collar crimes. It is of course, an important part of the sentencing process in all crimes. It is, however, an especially important matter in crimes such as the present because of the need to mark out to employees of companies who hold office at the level of seniority of the offender that they have a social and moral obligation, as well as a statutory duty, to act honestly and responsibly. An important reason why this is so relates to the oft-remarked difficulty in detecting and investigating white-collar crime. 
     
      
    44 In determining the appropriate sentence, the Court must have regard to the nature and severity of the conditions that may be imposed on, or may apply to the offender, under that sentence: s 16A(3). In addition, the principle of prison as a last resort is embodied in s 17A(1) of the Act. 
     
      
    45 I have concluded, as the parties tacitly agreed I should, that in the present matter, having considered all other available sentences, no sentence other than imprisonment is appropriate in the circumstances. The reasons are these: first, the offence itself is a reasonably serious one, as I have explained. The maximum penalty itself, although not high, reflects the intention of Parliament that an offence of this kind should not be regarded as trivial or unimportant. Secondly, the level of criminality involved in the commission of the offence was at a reasonably high level. I have described it as mid-level seriousness. Thirdly, although the offender, I am satisfied, will not offend again, there is a need to reflect the aspect of general deterrence. 
     
      
    46 There are a number of matters which require, however, a considerable degree of discernment relevant to the appropriate term to be imposed. There is, first, the fact of the plea entered by the offender. The circumstances I have outlined indicate that the offender would be entitled to a reasonably generous discount for the utilitarian value of his plea and the fact it represents a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. The range of discount available for an early plea in relation to a State offence is discussed in R v Thomson & Houlton [2000] 49 NSWLR 383. Although that range was not expressed in that case as applying to Commonwealth offences, it appears to me to be not unreasonable to adopt an approach in similar terms (R v Bugeja [2001] NSWCCA 196 per Hodgson JA (with whom James and Adams JJ agreed on this point) at[28]; see also R v Simon [2003] 142 A Crim R 166 and R v Otto [2005] 157 A Crim R 525). 
     
      
    47 Given the history of the entry of the plea, I would consider that, were a discount to be allowed, the offender would be entitled to a discount of 25%. As I shall mention later, an early plea may, however, be reflected in the sentencing process otherwise than by way of a discount applied to the term of the sentence. 
     
      
    48 Other matters required to be taken into account are the offender’s general statements of remorse and contrition. While it is true that the offender has not given evidence before me, I see no reason to refrain from taking into account the expressions of remorse he has made to his friends and business acquaintances, as evidenced in the testimonials presented on his behalf. This is also reflected in the fact that he has not committed any further offences of any kind since 1998. It is proper to take these matters into account although, as the authorities have observed on a number of occasions, white-collar crimes are frequently committed by persons of previous good character and by persons who have no previous convictions. (R v Rashid (NSWCCA unreported 7 April 1995). While remorse and contrition are appropriate matters to be taken into account, they do not require, at least in this case, a precise mathematical calculation or evaluation (R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381. 
     
      
       
      Imposition of a sentence 
       
      
    49 What sentence then should be imposed? Both the Crown and offender’s side agree that this is a finely balanced matter and is, for that very reason, a difficult discretionary decision to make. In my view, leaving aside for the moment the issue of a discount for an early plea, the appropriate term of imprisonment is for a period of twelve months. In view of the offender’s good record and his undoubted rehabilitation, there is no need to make a recognizance release order. In addition, there is no need to impose a fine and indeed, the Crown does not suggest that a fine be imposed. 
     
      
    50 The one matter which does, however, require a high degree of consideration relates to the decision as to whether any of the available alternatives to fulltime imprisonment should be utilised in the circumstances of this matter.  
     
      
    51 Ms Fullerton argued strongly for the imposition of a suspended sentence. In my view, such an order would entirely fail to recognise the need to stress the aspect of general deterrence in relation to this offence. The imposition of a suspended sentence would, I agree with the Crown’s submission, send entirely the wrong message to the business community. It would not only appear inadequate, it would, in fact, be inadequate. In general terms, the real bite of general deterrence takes hold only where an actual custodial sentence is imposed. As Howie J pointed out in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at paras [29-32], the question as to whether any particular sentencing alternative, including a suspended sentence, is an appropriate or adequate form of punishment must be considered on a case by case basis, having regard to the nature of the offence committed, the objective seriousness of the criminality involved, the need for general or specific deterrence and the subjective circumstances of the offender. Here, there would be little achieved by the suspension of a sentence so far as the rehabilitation of the offender is concerned. This is because he is already fully and entirely rehabilitated. This is another reason why I consider that the suspended sentence alternative is not appropriate in the present matter. 
     
      
    52 The task that remains to be determined is whether fulltime imprisonment is appropriate or whether periodic detention may be the more appropriate. 
     
      
    53 In my view, there is justification for selecting an alternative to fulltime imprisonment in the present matter. It is my view that the important aim of general deterrence will be preserved if the sentence to be served by the offender is served by way of periodic detention. In all the circumstances of the present offence, periodic detention will reflect adequately the objective seriousness of the offence and fulfil the manifold purposes of punishment. I am conscious that in choosing this alternative to fulltime custody, I am choosing a sentence that is more lenient than fulltime custody. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that such a sentence would, as I have said, be adequate so as to reflect appropriate recognition of the objective seriousness of the offence while, at the same time, attenuating the punishment so as to take account of the offender’s strong subjective case, especially in relation to his demonstrated rehabilitation over a period of many years. He is, as I have said, quite unlikely to ever offend again. I also take into account that the criminality in the present offence is at mid-level rather than at the higher-level; and that the offender’s criminal actions were taken at the prompting, invitation or direction of others more senior than he in the organisation. Finally, I have regard to the offender’s plea and his clear willingness to facilitate the course of justice. As Spigelman CJ noted in Thomson at [156], there are some cases where the “discount” for plea, otherwise available, will be reflected in a step down in the hierarchy of sentencing options. This is such a case. 
     
      
    54 Notwithstanding that the offender has been shown leniency in this regard, I intend that the sentence I am about to impose should send a clear message to those in the business community that the Court will not tolerate offences of this kind. 
     
      
    55 As I have indicated earlier, the pre-sentence report confirms the suitability of the offender for a Periodic Detention Order. He has signed an undertaking as required by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
     
      
    56 Antony Richard Boulden, you have pleaded guilty to an offence of being privy to the fraudulent altering of the books of the company, contrary to s 590(1)(c)(iii) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). 
     
      
    57 In relation to that offence, you are convicted. I sentence you to imprisonment for a term of twelve months, such sentence to be served by way of Periodic Detention. I decline to make a recognizance release order. 
     
      
    58 I direct that the offender attend the Grafton Detention Centre, or such other Centre, as he may be directed to attend, by 4pm on Friday, 15 December 2006 (or at such other time and date as he may be directed), to commence serving his Periodic Detention.

     APPLICATION BY JOHN FAIRFAX PUBLICATIONS PTY LTD RE MSK, MAK, MMK AND MRK 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd (“the Applicant”) seeks the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        “1 An order pursuant to s11(4B) of the  
        Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act  
        1987 (NSW) authorising the publication of the names of the prisoners known as MRK and MMK in connection with the charges for which they were convicted in proceedings numbers 70202/03 and 70203/03. 
        
       
       
        
        2 An order that the order made by Sully J on 27 June 2003 in proceedings numbers 70201/03, 70002/03, 70203/03 (which order was continued by Sully J on 22 April 2004 in each of those proceedings numbers 2004/1711 and 2004/1712 and on 30 June 2005 in 2005/885 and 2005/3), prohibiting the publication of the names of the prisoners known as MSK, MAK, MRK and MMK, be varied so as to permit the publication of the names of those prisoners in connection with the charges for which each of them was convicted in those proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        3 An order that the order made by Hidden J on 12 May 2005 in proceedings numbers 2003/158, 2003/3 and 2003/149 (which order was varied on 21 July 2005 and continued on 5 April 2006 by his Honour), prohibiting the publication of the names of the prisoners known as MSK, MAK and MMK, be varied so as to permit the publication of the names of MSK and MAK in connection with charges for which each of them was convicted in proceedings numbers 2003/158 and 2003/3.” 
        
       
      
    2 In April 2004, each of MSK, MAK, MRK and MMK was convicted of multiple counts of aggravated sexual assault in company, in contravention of s61JA of the Crimes Act 1900 for conduct which occurred in July 2002. 
     
      
    3 All of the offenders are brothers. The offences were committed, generally, in each other’s company. At the time of the offences for which they were convicted, each of MSK and MAK was an adult. However, at those times MMK was aged 16 years and MRK was aged 17 years and eight months. 
     
      
    4 Subsequently, MSK was convicted of four counts of aggravated sexual assault in contravention of s61J of the Crimes Act 1900, and pleaded guilty to a fifth count. Furthermore, MAK pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated sexual assault in contravention of s61J of the Crimes Act 1900.  
     
      
    5 MMK pleaded guilty on a subsequent occasion to a charge of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16 years, contrary to s66C(1) of the Crimes Act. The Crown appeal against sentence was dismissed. 
     
      
    6 On 1 November 2006, this Court made orders for the separate determination of the issues that had arisen in the appeal concerning standing and the competency of the application. This judgment relates to those separate issues. 
     
      
       
      The Statutory Discretion 
       
      
    7 The first order sought invokes s11(4B) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings Act) 1987 (“the Act”), which confers power on the Court to make an order overturning the effect of the prohibition contained in s11(1) of the Act. It is relevant to set out the whole of the section: 
     
      
       
        
        “11(1) The name of any of the following persons must not be published or broadcast in a way that connects the person with the criminal proceedings concerned:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) any person who:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) appears as a witness before a court in any criminal proceedings, or to whom any criminal proceedings relate, and 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (ii) was a child when the offence to which the proceedings relate was committed, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) any person who is mentioned in any criminal proceedings in relation to something that occurred when the person was a child, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) any person who is otherwise involved in any criminal proceedings and was a child when the person was so involved, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) any person who is a brother or sister of a victim of the offence to which the proceedings relate, where that person and the victim were both children when the offence was committed. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (1A) The prohibition in subsection (1) applies to the publication or broadcast of the name of a person:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) whether the publication or broadcast occurs before or after the proceedings concerned are disposed of, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) even if the person is no longer a child, or is deceased, at the time of the publication or broadcast. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) A reference in subsection (1) to criminal proceedings does not include a reference to proceedings held before a court other than the Children’s Court in respect of a traffic offence. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) A person who publishes or broadcasts the name of any person the publication or broadcasting of which is prohibited by subsection (1) is guilty of an offence.  
        
       
       
        
        Maximum penalty: 500 penalty units (in the case of a corporation) or 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 12 months, or both, in any other case. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (4) Subsection (1) does not prohibit:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the publication or broadcasting of an official report of the proceedings of a court that includes the name of any person the publication or broadcasting of which would otherwise be prohibited by subsection (1), or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the publication or broadcasting of the name of a person:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) in the case of a person who is a child under the age of 16 years at the time of publication or broadcasting—with the consent of the court concerned, or 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (ii) in the case of a person who is of or above the age of 16 years at the time of publication or broadcasting—with the consent of the person, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the publication or broadcasting of the name of a person who has been convicted of a serious children’s indictable offence, if the publication or broadcasting is authorised by a court under subsection (4B). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (4A) The consent of the court referred to in subsection (4) (b) (i) shall not be given except with the concurrence of the child or (if the child is incapable of giving concurrence) where the court is of the opinion that the public interest so requires. 
        
       
       
        
        (4B) A court that sentences a person on conviction for a serious children’s indictable offence may, by order made at the time of sentencing, authorise the publication or broadcasting of the name of the person (whether or not the person consents or concurs). 
        
       
       
        
        (4C) A court is not to make an order referred to in subsection (4B) unless it is satisfied:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that the making of such an order is in the interests of justice, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) that the prejudice to the person arising from the publication or broadcasting of the person’s name in accordance with such an order does not outweigh those interests. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (4D) The burden of establishing the matters referred to in subsection (4C) (a) and (b) lies on the prosecuting authority. 
        
       
       
        
        (4E) A court that makes an order referred to in subsection (4B) must indicate to the person, and make a record of, its reasons for doing so. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) For the purposes of this section, a reference to the name of a person includes a reference to any information, picture or other material that identifies the person or is likely to lead to the identification of the person. 
        
       
       
        
        (6) For the purposes of this section, a reference to a person who appears as a witness before a court in any criminal proceedings includes a reference to a child who gives evidence in the form of a recording in proceedings in accordance with Part 3 of the  
        Evidence (Children) Act 1997 
        .” 
        
       
      
    8 The offences committed by this group of brothers has achieved a considerable degree of public notoriety. No doubt for that reason it appeared to be common ground that publication of the surname of the brothers, who were adults at the time of the offences, would necessarily lead, at least in the present circumstances, to the identification of the other two brothers, who were children at the time of the offences. 
     
      
    9 The heinous nature of the systematic course of predatory conduct indicates that this is an appropriate case in which the additional element of public shaming could fulfil the function of retribution and also the function of general deterrence that criminal sentences are designed to serve. There may well be a strong case for the exercise of the discretion under s11(4B) of the Act, on the basis of the test set out in s11(4C). However, legal points have been raised and, if they are good points, this Court is obliged to uphold them. 
     
      
    10 All relevant criminal proceedings, including appeals, have now been completed. There is no outstanding charge for a “serious children’s indictable offence” as defined in s3 of the Act. Nor is there any outstanding sentence proceedings or appeal with respect to any such offence by MMK or MRK. 
     
      
    11 The Applicant seeks to invoke the exception to the prohibition in s11(1) set out in s11(4)(c). This requires the Court to make an order under s11(4B). A number of objections have been the subject of submissions to this Court questioning the standing of the applicant and the jurisdiction of the Court to make the order.  
     
      
    12 One of those objections is, in my opinion, determinative of the issue. Section 11(4B) empowers “a court that sentences a person” to authorise publication “by order made at the time of sentencing”. I find these words to be intractable. All relevant sentencing proceedings and appeals have been concluded. It is no longer possible for any order to be made “at the time of sentencing” by “the court that sentences,” either MMK or MRK. 
     
      
    13 Although it was not relied upon by the Applicant, a power of this character may be subject to flexibility in terms of the timing of the exercise of the power by force of s48 of the Interpretation Act 1987, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “48(1) If an Act…confers or imposes a function on any person or body, the function may be exercised…from time to time as occasion requires.” 
        
       
      
    14 However, as with all such provisions in the Interpretation Act, s48 operates subject to any contrary intention in the particular legislation. In my opinion, the words “a court that sentences” and “by order made at the time of sentencing” constitute such a contrary intention. 
     
      
    15 The legislature gave careful attention to the circumstances in which publication of the name of a child convicted of a serious children’s indictable offence could occur. Section 11(4B) cannot be invoked until after a conviction. The question of timing with respect to this discretion was clearly in the forefront of the mind of the drafter.  
     
      
    16 More significantly for present purposes, is the fact that there is a perfectly understandable policy basis for requiring the relevant discretion to be exercised at the time of sentencing and at no later time. It is at the time of sentence that the Court reviews the objective gravity of the offence, considers the impact on victims, assesses the weight to be given to general deterrence, acquires the full range of evidence about the subjective features of the offender and assesses the prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    17 It is, accordingly, during the sentencing process that the Court is apprised, in the most detailed manner, of the full range of matters relevant to determining whether publication is “in the interests of justice” within s11(4C)(a). It is also at that time that the Court is in the best position to make the judgment within s11(4C)(b) as to the prejudice to the person convicted of the offence from publication of his or her name.  
     
      
    18 Furthermore, publication of the names may, of itself, be relevant to the sentencing process. There is a significant public shaming element involved in such publication. The power to authorise publication should not be exercised for the purpose of punishment, however publication does have an adverse consequence which could be taken into consideration in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. That is to say where, as part of a distinct statutory process, public shaming is to occur, that could influence the sentencing judge to ameliorate the sentence that would otherwise be appropriate. 
     
      
    19 It appears that Parliament made a judgment that the court that was fully apprised of matters relevant to the exercising of the sentencing discretion was the appropriate court to determine the issue of whether publication should be authorised. 
     
      
    20 On this basis, this Court should give effect to the natural meaning of the words in s11(4B). Parliament intended to confine applications for an order of this character to the time and to the court which undertakes the sentencing task. That time has in all relevant respects passed. 
     
      
    21 The Applicant made a submission to the effect that there were practical difficulties associated with the Court not being able to make an order after the completion of a sentence hearing. I do not see that any of the suggested practical difficulties exist. It was suggested that a convicted offender could resist an application to authorise publication on the basis that s/he intended to lodge a conviction appeal and that the identification of the offender could prejudice any subsequent trial. The Court has sufficient flexibility to adapt to circumstances of this character. For example, the order authorising publication could be made but stayed until such time as the appeal was determined and any new trial concluded. 
     
      
       
      The Orders of the Court 
       
      
    22 The second order sought by the Applicant is for variation of the order made by Sully J on 27 June 2003 and continued on 22 April 2004 and 30 June 2005. 
     
      
    23 The Applicant’s submissions make it clear that it is concerned with the pseudonym orders made by Sully J, namely an order that the Respondents be referred to only by their initials. His Honour had made earlier orders preventing publication of the names of the accused and of the complainants pursuant to s292 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. However, those orders were varied.  
     
      
    24 The pseudonym order available to the Court is not dated 27 June 2003, but 27 November 2003. It was that order which his Honour continued on 22 April 2004.  
     
      
    25 The order, including a reference to another offender, was: 
     
      
       
        
        “That until the further order of this or of a higher court, any report or any part of the evidence or other procedure connected with the joint trial of MMK, MRK and RS, or the joint trial of MSK and MAK, is to refer to those five persons only by their initials that I have myself used and is not in any other way personal and particular to any one of the five to identify any such person.”  
        
       
      
    26 Section 11(1) of the Act is self-executing. The prohibition contains its own penalty in subs(3), its own exclusions in subs(4) and a mechanism for the application of those exclusions in subss(4A)-(4E). It is unnecessary and, generally, would be inappropriate, for the Court to make an order for the purpose of serving the same policy objectives as the scheme for which Parliament has legislated in s11. 
     
      
    27 It is not uncommon for the courts to make orders requiring the use of pseudonyms in cases involving children, as if to give effect to the terms of s11(1) of the Act. Section 11 confers no power to make such an order. The power may be found elsewhere, but the order itself is otiose. However, non-publication orders and pseudonym orders can be made for other purposes. This could include, as apparently was the case at the time that Sully J and Hidden J made their orders, the objective of ensuring a fair trial in subsequent proceedings for other offences, or in view of the prospect of an appeal and a new trial, with respect to the same offences. To avoid confusion, it would be preferable if a court, concerned to make the public and media aware of the operation of s11, gave directions drawing attention to the obligation imposed by the section and indicating the manner in which the court proposed to give effect to it. If there were a separate application for a non-publication order, that could then be addressed on its merits and the Court would no doubt identify the purpose which made the order appropriate, quite apart from the statutory prohibition imposed by s11. 
     
      
    28 As set out above, s11(4)(a) makes it clear that there is no prohibition on the publication of an official report of proceedings by the Court, which report would in the normal course contain the names of the accused, including in the very title of the case. Courts have adopted a practice of publishing only the initials of offenders, often to protect the identity of the complainants. However, courts have also adopted such a practice with a view to ensuring that the policy objectives of s11(1) of the Act are in fact served. Publication in digital form of the judgments of the Supreme Court on the Court’s website are, by their very nature, capable of such widespread transmission that the policy objective of the Act could readily be undermined unless the Court adapted its procedures in the way it does. Such a practice does not, however, justify an order in the same terms directed to third parties. 
     
      
    29 The Court should not, in the normal course, make orders of this character which carry with them the prospect of contempt proceedings of a character parallel to any proceedings for a contravention of s11 of the Act. In my opinion, in the normal case where no issue or purpose is to be served by an order other than the purpose of protecting the identity of a child, for which s11 makes provision, then a non-publication order should not be made. The Act should be allowed to operate in accordance with its terms and with the sanctions which Parliament has prescribed. 
     
      
    30 There does not appear to me to be any continuing purpose served by the pseudonym order of Sully J other than the purpose of s11 of the Act. I would have made order 2, although it would have been necessary to vary the terms of the order so that it did not override the continuing operation of s11. The proposed order was no doubt drafted in those terms because it was intended to be consequential on a variation of the prohibition in s11 made by an order under s11(4B). However the applicant made it clear that, if it did not obtain an order under s11(4B), it would not press order 2.  
     
      
    31 Order 3 sought by the Applicant relates to an order made by Hidden J on 12 May 2005. That order was expressed in terms of preventing the publication of the names of the accused. It was not in terms a pseudonym order. However, my above analysis of the order made by Sully J applies equally to this order. I would have made order 3 (subject to the necessary variation to avoid inconsistency with s11), but for the fact that the Applicant did not seek the order unless it obtained the order under s11(4B). 
     
      
       
       
      Costs 
       
      
    32 Counsel for MMK and MRK made an application for costs, in which counsel for MSK and MAK joined. The Respondents relied upon the Court’s implied power to control an abuse of process. Counsel relied on Markisic v Vizza [2002] NSWCCA 53 as authority.  
     
      
    33 In the case of MSK and MAK I can see no basis for an order for costs. As adults at the time of the offending, they are the unintended beneficiaries of a legislative scheme designed to protect MMK and MRK. They had an interest sufficient to justify their joinder. However their active participation in the proceedings was not required and no order for costs in their favour should be made on any view. 
     
      
    34 With respect to the application of MMK and MRK, the submissions did not identify in any respect what it was that could have constituted an abuse of process sufficient to invoke the implied power affirmed by this Court in Markisic.  
     
      
    35 The most that could be said was that, in view of the jurisdictional issue on which the Applicant has failed, the proceedings were at all times hopeless. Indeed the original submissions filed in support of the application failed to recognise in any way the jurisdictional issue that has proven to be decisive. 
     
      
    36 Nevertheless, a successful jurisdictional objection is not enough to justify a finding of abuse of process for the purpose of making a special order as to costs. 
     
      
    37 The order I propose is:  
     
      
       
        
        Application dismissed. 
        
       
      
    38 BASTEN JA: The application in this matter should be dismissed, with no order as to costs, for the reasons given by the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    39 HISLOP J: I agree with the Chief Justice.

      2005/116 REGINA v Ivan CHRISTOV [No 2] 
       
       
      JUDGMENT ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: At about 1.00 am on 11 January 2004, the body of Lynette Phillips was found in the front bedroom of her home at Engadine. She had been strangled. Two ligatures had been tied tightly around her neck. Ambulance officers were unable to revive her. They ceased any attempt at resuscitation at 1.45 am. 
     
      
    2 Mr Christov was charged with her murder. On 28 August 2006, having been arraigned before me in respect of that charge, he pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty of manslaughter. It was said that he was substantially impaired by reason of an abnormality of mind. The Crown, however, refused to accept the plea of manslaughter. The matter proceeded on the charge of murder. Mr Christov, with the consent of the Crown, elected to be tried by a Judge sitting alone. Having heard the evidence, I gave judgment on 22 September 2006 (R v Christov [2006] NSWSC 972). I found Mr Christov guilty of the murder of Lynette Phillips. 
     
      
    3 When submissions on sentence were made on 27 October 2006, the Crown asked, with the consent of Mr Christov, to have two outstanding charges added to the matter for sentence on a Form 1. The matters were: 
     
      
    · first, that on 10/11 January 2004, Mr Christov stole a motor vehicle, the property of Lynette Phillips (s154AA(1) Crimes Act 1900); 
     
      
    · secondly, that on 12 January 2004 he drove a motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public (s42(2) Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999). 
     
      
    4 Originally, the offences on the Form 1 were to be dealt with pursuant to a certificate from the Local Court under s166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. In that context, the Crown urged that the sentences imposed should be made concurrent with the sentence imposed for murder. There were, however, difficulties in proceeding in that manner. Ultimately the Crown, with the consent of Mr Christov, determined that the offences should be placed on a Form 1. 
     
      
    5 It remains for me to pass sentence. To do so, I must first determine the facts relevant to the sentencing discretion. They must be determined in a manner consistent with the verdict of guilty of murder. Where the facts are adverse, they must be established beyond reasonable doubt. Where they favour Mr Christov, it is enough that they should be proved on the balance of probabilities.  
     
      
       
      The relationship between Mr Christov and Ms Phillips. 
       
      
    6 Mr Christov was born in Czechoslovakia on 26 July 1950. He came to Australia in about 1970. He is a tall man (5'11"" to 6') weighing in excess of 100 kilograms. He worked as a truck driver. 
     
      
    7 In September 2003, Mr Christov returned to Sydney from an interstate trip late on a Friday night. He was too late to pick up his wages. He went to a pawn shop in Rockdale, The Rockdale Trading Centre. He intended to pawn his mobile phone to give him enough money for the weekend. Ms Phillips, was the owner of that business. She met Mr Christov the following week when he returned to reclaim his phone. 
     
      
    8 Mr Christov invited Ms Phillips to coffee. She accepted his invitation. They began seeing each other and soon formed a relationship. According to staff members at The Rockdale Trading Centre, Ms Phillips at first seemed happy. She referred to Mr Christov as ""her boyfriend"". He periodically stayed at her home at Engadine. However, after several months the relationship soured. In November 2004 they parted. They came back together again shortly before Christmas, and spent Christmas and New Year together. 
     
      
    9 On 2 January 2004, however, Ms Phillips determined that she would end the relationship. In a statement made before her death she said, and I accept, that she said goodbye to Mr Christov, whereupon he physically put his arms around her and would not let her go. He only released her once she screamed. Nonetheless, he later telephoned her at home repeatedly, and came to her house. She would not permit him entry. 
     
      
    10 The next day, 3 January 2004, Mr Christov went back to the pawn shop at Rockdale. He refused to leave. He eventually left once Ms Phillips called the police. It was clear from the accounts given by a number of employees that Ms Phillips was frightened of Mr Christov. 
     
      
    11 The following day, Sunday 4 January 2004, there was a further incident. Mr Christov again went to The Rockdale Trading Centre. He banged on the door and ultimately placed his foot in the door so that it could not be closed. Ms Phillips repeatedly asked him to leave her alone. He then said this:  
     
      
       
        
        ""You're picking on the wrong person; you'll play fire with fire."" 
        
       
      
    12 Ms Phillips, at that point, pressed the duress alarm, which alerted the police. Mr Christov closed the door and left. The police arrived at about 4.15 pm. They discussed with Ms Phillips the prospect of obtaining an Apprehended Violence Order. There were difficulties. Mr Christov had broken no law. The police officer said, nonetheless, that she would make enquiries concerning Mr Christov. 
     
      
    13 There was evidence that, after speaking to the police, Ms Phillips may have met Mr Christov in a coffee shop at Sutherland. The evidence was puzzling because, later that evening, Ms Phillips made a statement to the police complaining about Mr Christov. On balance, although recognising that the matter is uncertain, I think it likely that Ms Phillips did see Mr Christov shortly before she went home on Sunday, 4 January 2004. She agreed to meet in a public place, no doubt hoping they could have a civilized parting. 
     
      
    14 The police, in the meantime, made enquiries concerning Mr Christov. They discovered that he had a criminal history. That history was later described by police in the application for an Apprehended Violence Order in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The defendant has an extensive criminal history, which includes 3 counts of sexual assault, numerous assault charges and has been the defendant of 7 previous domestic matters, the majority of which involved similar circumstances of a threatening and stalking behaviour. 
        
       
       
        
        It is the defendant's criminal history that has prompted police to apply for an order."" 
        
       
      
    15 That information, no doubt, was communicated by the police to Ms Phillips. The police told her that they entertained fears for her safety. Arrangements were made immediately for Ms Phillips to make a statement in support of the application for the Apprehended Violence Order. She attended the police station and completed the statement the same day. From that point, it cannot be doubted that Ms Phillips wanted nothing further to do with Mr Christov and was frightened of him. 
     
      
    16 However, Mr Christov was not prepared to accept her decision. She confided to a friend on 6 January 2004 that she had seen his distinctive car driving past her home. 
     
      
    17 Meanwhile, the application for the Apprehended Violence Order was filed. It was made returnable on 22 January 2004. Attempts were then made to locate Mr Christov to serve him with the application, but without success. 
     
      
    18 On Thursday, 8 January 2004, an employee of The Rockdale Trading Centre saw Mr Christov having coffee across the road from the shop. Ms Phillips at the time was absent from Sydney on the mid north coast, staying with her daughter. The employee spoke to Mr Christov, who enquired whether Ms Phillips had returned from her holiday. During the course of the conversation he said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""If she's riding a vehicle I hope she has an accident and I hope she dies, don't worry about Danny, her daughter I don't want her dead.""  
        
       
      
    19 Mr Christov then drove a truck to Wagga Wagga making a delivery and returning to Sydney on Friday 9 January 2004. Late that day he dropped off a note at Ms Phillips' home. The note was a love letter of sorts, although with ominous references to death. 
     
      
    20 Ms Phillips returned to Sydney on Friday 9 January 2004. She was obviously concerned about Mr Christov. She spoke at length about her concerns to a friend, Mrs Sonia Mapp. It may be inferred that, later that evening, she got the note from Mr Christov. 
     
      
       
      Saturday 10 January 2004. 
       
      
    21 One then comes to the day of the murder, Saturday 10 January 2004. Ms Phillips left her home at Engadine some time after 7.30 am to drive to work at Rockdale. As she was driving along the highway, Mr Christov drove up behind her in his distinctive white car. He repeatedly flashed his headlights. Ultimately, Ms Phillips pulled over to the side of the road. As he began talking to her, she pressed 000 on her mobile telephone. The conversation commenced at 7.49 am. It was overheard by the operator at the Emergency Service 000 and was recorded. However, it was a very one-sided conversation. Ms Phillips made the following comment and then said very little else: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Look, I don't want to upset you, but I don't have to go out with you and I'm not ... "" 
        
       
      
    22 She was then interrupted by Mr Christov. He told her that he was still in love with her. However, his words were mingled with threats. Amongst other things he said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... I don't hate you yet. I don't hate you. I not gunna hurt you. ... I don't hate you. I never gunna hurt you ... If I gunna hurt you, then I'm gunna hurt you mental, in the head ... "" 
        
       
      
    23 Mr Christov invited Ms Phillips to re-read his letter. He said: ""I'm gonna die tonight."" 
     
      
    24 They then parted. Ms Phillips immediately spoke to the 000 Operator who had been listening to the conversation. He advised her to drive directly to a police station and make a statement. She did so. She was then accompanied by two uniformed officers as she drove to work at Rockdale. 
     
      
    25 Ms Phillips remained at work throughout Saturday 10 January. At approximately 4.00 pm she again spoke to police. She discussed the service of the Apprehended Violence Order, offering advice about where Mr Christov might be located so that he could be served. Between 6.30 and 7.30 pm she drove to her daughter's home at Blakehurst for a barbeque. She spent the evening with her daughter and partner. Both described her as upset. She again spoke of her fear of Mr Christov. Ms Phillips left her daughter's home at about 10.00 pm, intending to drive to her own home in Engadine. She had previously made arrangements to pick up her youngest daughter, Danielle, from a party at about midnight.  
     
      
    26 Mr Christov, meanwhile, drove to Engadine at about midday. He parked his car in the street behind the home of Lynette Phillips. There was a connecting lane from that street to Higgerson Avenue where Ms Phillips lived. Mr Christov was observed walking along that lane shortly after midday. Danielle, Ms Phillips' daughter, was at home until 2.00 pm when she left for work. At some point thereafter Mr Christov gained entry to the house, although the means by which he did so was uncertain. He then lay in wait for Ms Phillips. At some stage he entered an upstairs bedroom. Within a bedroom cupboard there was a pair of women's shoes. Mr Christov removed a shoelace from one of the shoes. As stated in my previous judgment (para [132]), I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time Mr Christov removed the shoelace, he recognised that it could be used to strangle Lynette Phillips. I accept the possibility that he had not necessarily, at that point, formed the intention of killing Ms Phillips. Although he deeply resented her attitude, he still harboured feelings of love towards her. I believe, at that point, his intention was confrontation, where the issue would be sorted out one way or another. 
     
      
    27 Ms Phillips returned home some time after 10.00 pm. She was completely unaware of Mr Christov's presence in her home. She settled down with a cup of tea to watch television. I think it likely that she positioned a kitchen knife alongside her for protection, because she feared Mr Christov. 
     
      
    28 Mr Christov then appeared. One can only imagine the terror that Ms Phillips must have felt upon seeing him. I think it likely that she took hold of the knife once he appeared. I infer that she held it in front of her to defend herself (R v Christov (supra) para [138]). No doubt Mr Christov endeavoured to persuade Ms Phillips to resume their relationship and was met with resistance. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, that he then formed the intention of killling her. 
     
      
    29 Ms Phillips was a small woman. Although she had a knife, she was confronted by a much larger and determined man. Mr Christov attempted to take the knife from her and, in the process, received a laceration to his hand, as did Ms Phillips. Once he had taken the knife, she was defenceless. He then assaulted her, as he acknowledged. He slapped her face and endeavoured, manually, to throttle her. He then tied the shoelace tightly around her neck with a knot at the back. He later took hold of a leather dog lead and cut the metal clasp from the end. The clasp was underneath Ms Phillips when she was found. Mr Christov used the lead as a further ligature around her neck. Again it was tied tightly with a knot at the back. 
     
      
    30 Both ligatures were later tested and found to have DNA with a profile that matched that of Mr Christov. Mr Christov claimed that he had no memory of having tied the ligatures. I reject his account. I have no doubt that he knew exactly what he was doing. 
     
      
    31 As I remarked in my previous judgment, the puzzle in this tragedy concerns two telephone calls made by Lynette Phillips at 11.08 pm. They were directed to 000 and her daughter. Nothing was said in either call before each was terminated. The calls were clearly an attempt to seek help. Ms Phillips either could not, or dare not, speak. Again, one can only imagine her terror. 
     
      
    32 Mr Christov then left the house. It is reasonable to infer that he did so in a hurry. He did not retrieve the handkerchief and car keys which he had left in the cupboard upstairs. Instead, he took Ms Phillips' car keys and her car. The taking of the car is the first matter on the Form 1. 
     
      
    33 On Wednesday 12 January 2004, at 4.34 am, a little less than thirty hours after leaving Ms Phillips' home, Mr Christov was seen by the police driving her car on the Hume Highway towards Wagga Wagga. There followed a high speed police chase over a number of kilometres. Spikes were then placed on the road, which deflated the tyres of the vehicle Mr Christov was driving. Nonetheless, he kept driving on the rims of the vehicle at high speed for a further four kilometres. The vehicle ultimately left the road and crashed into a stand of trees. Mr Christov was injured and taken by ambulance to the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital. The chase is the second matter on the Form 1. 
     
      
    34 When Mr Christov left the house at Engadine, Ms Phillips was still alive. She was left to die slowly of asphyxiation. Her daughter arrived home shortly after 1.00 am. A flicker of life remained at that point. The ambulance officers, as mentioned, ceased their attempts at resuscitation at 1.45 am. 
     
      
       
      The subjective case. 
       
      
    35 Let me turn from the circumstances of the offence, to the circumstances of Mr Christov himself. Whilst it appeared that there may be some doubt as to his correct age, it became clear that he was born on 26 July 1950. He was therefore 53 years old at the time of the offence. He has been in custody since 12 January 2004. He is now 56 years old. 
     
      
    36 Mr Christov has, as mentioned, a criminal record. He was convicted of a number of offences in South Australia soon after his arrival in Australia in 1970. Relevantly, he was convicted in 1975 of a series of offences which included assault. The incident which gave rise to these charges was the subject of much evidence in the trial. It was relevant to the psychiatric issues investigated during the trial. Mr Christov, when about 24 years old, was rejected by a woman with whom he had been having a relationship. He went to the woman's home with a loaded rifle. He threatened her and others. The police were called. He then fled and hid up a tree. Once discovered by the police, he shot himself in the jaw. He was later charged with attempted murder and acquitted. He was subsequently convicted of lesser charges, namely, several counts of assault. He was also found to be unfit to possess a firearm. One gathers that he had spent time in custody awaiting trial on the more serious charge. He was ultimately placed upon a bond in respect of the lesser charges. 
     
      
    37 In the years that followed, Mr Christov had a number of relationships. Some were quite lengthy. He never married, but he did have a number of children. He was, during this period, convicted of a number of offences of dishonesty. He was either fined or required to enter a recognisance. In 1986 he was imprisoned for six months, having been convicted of break, enter and steal. 
     
      
    38 In 1996, Mr Christov was involved in a further incident. He had formed a relationship with another woman over a period of three months. The woman attempted to end the relationship. Mr Christov went to her home, armed with a knife. He assaulted the woman, stabbed her in the right thigh, and ultimately barricaded himself and the victim in her room. The siege lasted a number of hours. A police negotiator eventually persuaded Mr Christov to release the victim and then give himself up. He was convicted of unlawfully imprisoning the victim and having maliciously wounded her (two counts). He was sentenced to fixed terms of imprisonment of twelve months concurrent in respect of each charge of malicious wounding, and to a minimum term of seven months with an additional term of two years, partially concurrent, in respect of the remaining charge. 
     
      
    39 Mr Christov has a long history of substance abuse. In his early years he used a number of drugs recreationally, including cocaine. When he became a truck driver in 1994, he began using massive amounts of amphetamines. On occasions these drugs induced psychotic effects. In these proceedings, Mr Christov was examined by two forensic psychiatrists. There were differences in their diagnoses. However, both agreed that Mr Christov suffered from poly-substance abuse. Dr Giuffrida said, and I accept, that such long term abuse has affected Mr Christov's behaviour. He has become increasingly irritable, angry and subject to explosive fits of temper. For the reasons I stated in my first judgment, I do not believe that Mr Christov was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind. I accept, nonetheless, that to some degree Mr Christov was impaired by reason of his prolonged drug abuse. Nonetheless, I believe, as the Crown submitted, that his crime in murdering Ms Phillips was fundamentally a function of his personality and attitude, rather than any such impairment. Moreover, his criminal record does not entitle him to any leniency. 
     
      
    40 When giving evidence, Mr Christov expressed remorse. It appeared to be genuine (T331). He has now been in custody for almost three years. In that time he has behaved well. He says, and I accept, that he has abstained from drug taking whilst in gaol. He spent a period of six months in protection (19 March 2004 to 18 September 2004) during a time that he was suffering from a back condition. The prison authorities believed he may be vulnerable and should be removed from the general prison. He has since returned to the ordinary gaol. He has been made a sweeper, which is a position of trust. 
     
      
    41 Dr Skinner, psychiatrist, was asked to consider the issue of dangerousness, that being relevant to Mr Christov's prospects of rehabilitation. Her conclusion was in these terms: (Ex B on Sentence: p4) 
     
      
       
        
        ""From the information available it appears that Mr Christov's behaviour has been controlled rather than impulsive. I do not consider that he would present a risk to the community at large on release. There would be a risk of violence towards persons with whom he develops relationships, and that risk is significantly increased by his poly-substance abuse."" 
        
       
      
    42 Ms Nash of counsel submitted that, for a number of reasons, Mr Christov should be regarded as having good prospects of rehabilitation, and unlikely to present any future danger. First, having been convicted of murder, he will inevitably be sentenced to a significant term of imprisonment. By the time he emerges from gaol, he will be considerably older. Secondly, Dr Skinner associated Mr Christov's offending behaviour with drug taking. As mentioned, Mr Christov has abstained from drug taking whilst in prison. He is likely to abstain for the duration of his term. Such a significant period of abstinence would make relapse unlikely. Thirdly, there is the suggestion in Mr Christov's medical history that he was given hormone injections in 1995, possibly because of sexual dysfunction. Such problems, if they existed, are likely to get worse with age. Finally, once eligible for parole and before release, Mr Christov will, no doubt, be re-examined medically so that there will be a further opportunity for assessment. 
     
      
    43 I accept these submissions. I believe that Mr Christov's prospects of rehabilitation are reasonable. 
     
      
       
      The standard non parole period. 
       
      
    44 I then come to the issue of sentence. Submissions were made on behalf of Mr Christov that the crime did not warrant a life sentence under s61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Act""), that is, a sentence of life imprisonment without the prospect of release on parole. The Crown did not suggest that such a sentence was appropriate. Although the crime committed by Mr Christov was brutal and horrifying, I do not believe it comes within the worst category. 
     
      
    45 I must therefore fix a term of imprisonment and a non parole period. The Act has fixed a ""standard non parole period"" of twenty years imprisonment in respect of a person convicted of murder. The issue is whether the standard non parole period should be adopted in the case of Mr Christov. It represents ""an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"" (s54A(2) of the Act). In considering whether the standard non parole period should be adopted or moderated, the Court is obliged to address a number of issues as set out in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168; R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575; MLP v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 271 at para [33]. 
     
      
    46 In characterising whether the offence falls within the mid range, the Court must have regard to aggravating or mitigating factors relating to the offence (including the offender's state of mind) as set out in s21A of the Act. There are a number of such matters. First, unquestionably, there was a degree of planning and premeditation. Mr Christov entered the house without invitation. He removed the shoelace from the shoe in the upstairs bedroom and he lay in wait for the victim. I cannot say beyond reasonable doubt that he intended, at that point, to kill Lynette Phillips, since there is at least a reasonable possibility that he intended to confront her. Nonetheless, I have no doubt he recognised the potential for violence in that confrontation. Secondly, whatever his intentions when he entered the house, there is no question that eventually Mr Christov formed an intention to kill Lynette Phillips and did so in a determined manner, notwithstanding the knife which she held to protect herself. Thirdly, the crime itself was brutal, callous and cowardly. It was an attack upon a much smaller woman who had been rendered defenceless. Not one, but two, ligatures were tightly tied around her neck. She was left to die slowly, no doubt conscious of her fate. 
     
      
    47 It was submitted on behalf of Mr Christov that there was a degree of provocation on the part of the deceased. She had been ""playing with"" Mr Christov's head. I reject that submission. There was no provocation. Ms Phillips made it absolutely clear that she wished to end the relationship. She had indeed ended the relationship. That was her right. 
     
      
    48 The Crown submitted that the level of objective seriousness of Mr Christov's crime was above the mid range. Counsel for Mr Christov submitted that the offence was ""at the lower end of objective seriousness"". In choosing between these submissions, and characterising the crime, the impairment suffered by Mr Christov is relevant. Dr Giuffrida said, and I accept, that psychologically Mr Christov was to some degree (although, I believe, not to a large degree) impaired by reason of his prolonged drug use. To that degree his culpability is moderated. But for that impairment, I would have characterised Mr Christov's crime as above the mid range. Taking account of the impairment, I believe it appropriate to characterise the offence as being within the mid range of objective seriousness. 
     
      
       
      Should the non parole period be moderated? 
       
      
    49 The next issue is whether there are reasons in the matters identified in s21A of the Act for departing from the standard non parole period? That issue requires a consideration of matters which relate to the offender, as opposed to the offence. These are matters which are usually termed ""the subjective case"", together with any additional matters the Court is required or permitted to take into account by any Act or rule of law. 
     
      
    50 Here there are four matters that seem to me to call for some moderation of the standard non parole period. First, I accept that Mr Christov does regret his actions. His remorse appeared genuine. Secondly, for a short period of about six months, Mr Christov was on Protection. I have no information about the conditions of his incarceration. However, I accept that some small adjustment to the sentence is appropriate. The reason Mr Christov was on Protection was that he had back pain, which made it difficult for him to climb stairs, and which made him vulnerable within the general prison population. On the day submissions were made on sentence in this Court, it was evident that Mr Christov again had back pain. I have no medical evidence. I accept, nonetheless, that he does have a back disability which is likely to get worse with increasing years and likely to make gaol more onerous for him. Thirdly, for the reasons stated, I accept that Mr Christov's prospects of rehabilitation are reasonable. 
     
      
    51 That brings me to the final matter, which is one of some importance, that is, Mr Christov's age. His sentence will obviously be backdated to 12 January 2004 when he entered custody. Mr Christov is aged 56 years. His relatively advanced age is a relevant consideration. In Holyoak v Regina (1995) 82 A Crim R 502, Allen J identified three reasons why age should be taken into account (Handley JA and Hulme J agreeing). The first was expressed in these terms: (at 507) 
     
      
       
        
        “It is, of course, clear that a sentence imposed upon an offender when he [is] of such an age that, should he not die in gaol, he will have little worthwhile life left after his release is likely to bear more heavily upon the offender than a similar term imposed upon a younger man who can look forward to a worthwhile life after release. This is so obvious that I would not infer that his Honour did not recognise it.” 
        
       
      
    52 His Honour added: (at 507) 
     
      
       
        
        “Of course, account must be taken of how much more onerous it will be for him to serve a gaol sentence than it would be if he were younger. That is material to the appropriate length of the full-time custody.” 
        
       
      
    53 Secondly, advanced age is also relevant to the suitability of the case as a vehicle for general deterrence. Thirdly, it must be acknowledged that gaol can be a dangerous place where there is the risk of violence at the hands of other prisoners. Advanced age may put a prisoner at a disadvantage. On the other hand, Mr Christov is a tall and large man and there is no suggestion that he had been subjected to brutality to this point. 
     
      
    54 These matters in combination, and especially Mr Christov's age, make it appropriate in my view to moderate to some degree the standard non parole period.  
     
      
    55 Murder has always been regarded as the most serious crime in the criminal calendar. Absent extraordinary circumstance, it calls for a substantial sentence by way of imprisonment to serve the interests of punishment, including denunciation and general deterrence. The crime was, as I have said, a brutal, callous and cowardly act directed against a much smaller and defenceless woman. 
     
      
    56 I have a number of victim impact statements from members of Lynette Phillips' family. One is from her daughter, Danielle, who was seventeen years old at the time of her mother's death, and who came upon her mother's body lying on the floor of the family home. I have a statement from her son, Adam, who records the changes to his life and his deep sorrow at his mother's senseless death. There is, as well, a poignant statement from Lynette Phillips' sister, Valerie, who's life has been thrown into turmoil and who experiences daily the effects of this family tragedy. One can only imagine the anguish to Lynette Phillips' mother who has been required to endure the loss of her daughter.  
     
      
    57 I must, of course, deal with this material in a manner consistent with the principles in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 85.  
     
      
       
      Special circumstances. 
       
      
    58 Counsel for Mr Christov has urged a finding of special circumstances. The age of Mr Christov and his history with drugs and alcohol would ordinarily justify such a finding. However, in the case of murder, inevitably the parole period will be lengthy and usually adequate for the supervision and guidance which Mr Christov will require upon release. I have made a small adjustment to the sentence. 
     
      
    59 Ivan CHRISTOV, taking account of the matters on the Form 1, I sentence you to a period of imprisonment of 23 years commencing on 12 January 2004 and expiring on 11 January 2027. I fix a non parole period of 17 years, commencing on 12 January 2004. The balance of the term will therefore be 6 years. The first date upon which you will be eligible for release on parole is 11 January 2021.

      SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The tragic events involved in this trial occurred late in the evening on 13 February 2005. The scene of the tragedy was a small house at 90 Commerce Street Taree. About midnight, or shortly after, neighbours noticed the smell of smoke. Peter Moy, who lived at 88 Commerce Street Taree, on closer examination, saw a fire flickering inside the house and smoke pouring out the back of the house. Mr Moy rang the Fire Brigade at about 12.28am on 14 February and alerted other neighbours to the fire, which by this time was burning strongly. 
     
      
    2 The Fire Brigade responded to the call and arrived soon after the emergency call. Two trucks arrived at the scene and the fire fighters set about trying to control the blaze. It seems the fire was quite fierce for a time, particularly towards the front part of the house. Eventually, the fire was brought under control and, during this period of time, police officers arrived at the scene. Members of the fire brigade had observed in the main bedroom the badly incinerated body of a male person. This was, in fact, the occupant of the house, Warren Dickson, whom I shall refer to as the deceased. Detective Sergeant Whayne Day arrived at the crime scene at about 4.45am on 14 February 2005. He observed that the deceased had sustained full depth burns to the majority of his body. The deceased was lying on his back on the floor with his legs on the remains of a bed and his head and torso were pointing towards the entry door to the bedroom. Detective Sergeant Day observed a significant area of injury to the front portion of the neck of the deceased. He also observed large amounts of what appeared to be blood in the kitchen of the house, particularly near the rear door, which led to the backyard. Tests were done and these showed strong positive reactions for the presence of blood on the kitchen floor. Commerce Street itself was closed off to traffic and a crime scene was established in accordance with police protocol and procedures. 
     
      
    3 Detective Day’s further observations indicated to him that the kitchen window had been broken from the outside and that this had happened prior to the fire. The fire had very substantially damaged the house and parts of it were destroyed. The seat of the fire appeared to be in the main bedroom area. There were marks in the hallway and near the bedroom, which indicated that the deceased’s body may have been dragged from the kitchen area through into the bedroom where the fire appeared to have been started. 
     
      
    4 The officer-in-charge of the initial investigation and subsequent matters was Detective Sergeant Rodney Blackman. He arrived at the premises at about 2am on 14 February and inspected the house and the body of the deceased. He said: - 
     
      
       
        
        “The corpse was terribly burnt. The extremities of the corpse were burnt beyond recognition, the general person was unrecognisable save for, I could establish that it was a deceased male”. 
        
       
      
    5 A little later Dr Lyons a forensic pathologist came to the crime scene and made observations of the deceased’s body. Later, Dr Lyons conducted a post mortem on the body. 
     
      
    6 The post mortem carried out by Dr Lyons on 15 February 2005 at the Newcastle Department of Forensic Medicine revealed the following: there were two substantial wounds to the neck of the deceased. The first, although not necessarily the first in point of time, was a gaping wound on the middle of the front of the neck in which the trachea and the oesophageus had been cut right through to the top of the vertebral column. The major structures that were observed in the wound were separated by a gap of approximately 70 millimetres. The second injury was an oblique wound extending under the sternomastoid muscle involving a partial transection of the carotid artery. This is the main artery from the aorta. It distributes blood to the brain. In this instance, there was a gap of 80 millimetres by 20 and, as I have said, the wound was oblique at an angle.  
     
      
    7 Dr Lyons concluded that the deceased had been dead at the time of the fire. The deceased’s urine level had been tested for alcohol and Dr Lyons concluded that the tests showed a result consistent with the deceased “having been involved in a light drinking session”. He thought the death of the deceased was caused by a combination of mechanisms that related to the two wounds he had sustained. There would have been an inability to breathe normally because of the transection of the airway; and there would have also been a transection of the major vessels resulting in a significant blood loss. Dr Lyons’ opinion was that the deceased would have become rapidly unconscious and died within a matter of a few minutes. Either injury would, of itself, have been sufficient to have led to the death of the deceased. The injuries were consistent with the loss of the entire blood volume of the deceased’s body. Dr Lyons thought this was consistent with the amount of blood he had observed in the kitchen area. 
     
      
    8 He described the first wound as “an incised wound” and the second as “being consistent with the application of blunt force trauma”. In other words, the first was consistent with a slash wound, and the second was consistent with being a stab wound. 
     
      
    9 The police investigation focussed next on two particular individuals. The first was a young lady named Nicole Deluca. She came from Koorainghat, an area just outside of Taree. She lived there with her parents and two children and was involved in running a poultry-egg distribution business. The second person was Brian Steer. (I shall refer to him as the offender, as it later became clear that it was he who killed the deceased). He lived at Hughes Street Taree with his four young children. The offender had been previously married but the marriage had ended sometime before. 
     
      
    10 Ms Deluca and the offender met during chat sessions over the Internet. This occurred back in December 2003. Sometime afterwards, they entered into a relationship. They did not live together but generally spent each weekend together. They appeared to have a good relationship but by January 2005, Ms Deluca was becoming dissatisfied and looking for other interests.  
     
      
    11 On Friday 28 January 2005, Ms Deluca went out with friends. During the evening, she met the deceased. She had not met him before this occasion. They spent the early part of the evening together at the Manning Hotel and then all went back to the house of a friend, Michelle Bennett. Ms Deluca, who later expressed embarrassment about this, was obviously attracted to the deceased and spent the night with him on this occasion. They slept together and it is clear that she was attracted to the deceased and quite interested in extending the friendship. 
     
      
    12 In the following week, this relationship between the deceased and Ms Deluca was rekindled. They met once more and socialised together on both the Wednesday and Thursday of the following week. On the Friday, Ms Deluca stayed the night at the deceased’s place and slept with him again. Ms Deluca did not however, tell the offender, in any substance, about her newfound relationship. It seems she rather avoided the topic because she found it difficult to tell the offender that she had decided that their relationship should come to an end. The offender, however, spent some time on the evening of 4 February 2005 trying to locate Ms Deluca. He drove past Michelle Bennett’s house and went out to Ms Deluca’s home at Koorainghat. He was unable to find her at either place and he surmised, accurately as it happened, that she had spent the night with another man. 
     
      
    13 On 5 February 2005 the offender and Ms Deluca met and gave back their respective keys to each other’s house. Thus it was that, by this symbolic and practical gesture, the relationship was brought to an end. 
     
      
    14 The offender, however, did not leave the matter there. He persisted in endeavouring to resecure Ms Deluca’s affection during the following week. On 11 February Ms Deluca went to the deceased’s house in the early evening. Later, they went to the movies and spent the night again at 90 Commerce Street Taree. Unbeknown to them, the offender followed them home from the movies and, by this stratagem, found out where the deceased lived. On Saturday 12 February, the couple again socialised during the early part of the evening and came back by taxi to 90 Commerce Street Taree where again they stayed the night. Once more, unbeknown to them, the offender, earlier in the evening, had visited the house and observed that both their cars were there, even though the couple apparently were still in town at the time of this clandestine visit. 
     
      
    15 On the afternoon and evening of Sunday 13 February, Ms Deluca continued to enjoy her developing relationship with the deceased. They went to a barefoot skiing competition, and, afterwards, came back to the deceased’s home. In the late afternoon, Ms Deluca went to pick up her daughter and returned home to her house at Koorainghat. She did not see the deceased alive again. It was, it will be recalled, during the latter part of this evening that the deceased met his death and the house at 90 Commerce Street Taree was set on fire. 
     
      
    16 The police notified Ms Deluca about 5.30am on 14 February 2005 that the body of Warren Dickson had been found deceased in the burning house at Commerce Street. She was undoubtedly very distressed by this news but went about her usual task of taking her daughter Jamie to the bus stop near the Old Bar turnoff. There, to her surprise, she encountered the offender, waiting for her with his four children. She told him that a friend had been found dead in a house but the offender feigned ignorance about the matter. He gave her a photograph, which had been taken the previous year, of Ms Deluca and himself when they had been on holiday at Lord Howe Island. He asked Ms Deluca whether she would be prepared to move in and live with him. Ms Deluca, who was upset and in tears, indicated that the suggestion was inappropriate at that point of time. Later on the same day, a dozen red roses, which had been ordered the previous Friday by the offender, arrived at Ms Deluca’s house. It was Valentine‘s Day and this gesture, together with his attempts earlier that morning, were plainly manoeuvres calculated to reinstate his relationship with Ms Deluca. 
     
      
    17 On 15 February 2005, the offender sent a text message to Ms Deluca. The message said: - 
     
      
       
        
        “The police have been to see me. I hope you don’t think I had anything to do with this”. 
        
       
       
      Ms Deluca assured him that she did not. 
       
      
    18 In fact, the police officers (Detective Sergeant Blackman and Detective Hartcher) had visited the offender’s house at 19 Hughes Street during the afternoon of 15 February 2005. Detective Blackman had told the offender that the police were there to ask some questions about the fire in Commerce Street. The offender told them that he had been expecting them. He said: - 
     
      
       
        
        “Lucky I didn’t know the guy or I would be the prime suspect”. 
        
       
      
    19 He went on to say that he had been seeing Nicky and that Nicky was seeing the deceased. The offender also said that he did not know the deceased, he just knew of his name. He agreed to provide a statement on the next day. 
     
      
    20 On 16 February 2005 the offender provided a written statement to the police at Taree Police Station. In one part of this statement, the offender said that he had not left his home on the evening of 13 February 2005. In another part, he indicated (Exhibit “T” para 29) that he did not know the deceased; he did not know where the deceased lived or worked and that this could be verified if the police were to speak to Ms Deluca or Michelle Bennett. 
     
      
    21 Later that afternoon, the police, by arrangement with the offender, inspected his house and his motor vehicle. During the course of the search, Detective Buining apparently detected blood on some portion of the offender’s motor vehicle. It seems this threw him into a panic and he decided to collect his children from school to take them up to their mother’s home in Ipswich, Queensland. The journey commenced later that evening, after he had been to a barbecue at the home of a friend of his, Jeremy Moy. 
     
      
    22 The offender arrived in Ipswich early the next morning and had a conversation with his ex-wife. He told her, in relation to the fire at Commerce Street, “I did it, I killed him”. The offender told his ex-wife he had informed his children on the way to Ipswich as to the events of the evening when the deceased met his death. She asked him if there was any other way he could have handled it and he replied, “No. I am sick of being walked on and shitted on. The things that I am going to have to do to survive”. 
     
      
    23 He told his ex-wife that the police had found blood on his car and indicated that this would mean he was “stuffed”, or words to that effect. The offender also said to Ms Matthews, regarding the deceased “the bastard deserved it”. 
     
      
    24 Shortly after this conversation, the offender left Ipswich. Apparently, he had seen a car out the front of Ms Matthews place and, fearing it was a police car, took instant leave and returned to New South Wales. 
     
      
    25 On 18 February 2005, the offender went to the Wauchope branch of the ANZ bank. This was at about 4.40pm on that day. He had, according to evidence he later gave, a replica pistol with him. He held up the bank, in the following circumstances: the offender stood in the queue and, when it was his turn, he approached Jacqueline Preston a young bank teller. He told her to be calm and uncovered a gun that he was holding in his right hand. This had been covered by a white calico bank bag that he had been holding in his left hand. He had an earpiece in his left ear with a wire coming from the bottom of the earpiece. The wires attached to the earpiece were in a plastic cover that went into his top pocket. It appeared to Ms Preston that he had one finger on the trigger of the gun when he showed it to her. She was distressed, as might be expected but the offender told her to be calm. He told her he wanted the money and asked her to give him whatever she had. He told her not to press the button but to remain calm. He said he was “wired” and pointed to the wire he had in his ear. He told her he was “wired to the police” and he could hear them if she were to call them. 
     
      
    26 The offender ordered Ms Preston to go over to the other teller, Mrs Walsh, and to inform her that he had a gun. She was to tell Mrs Walsh not to call the police or press the buttons. The offender then approached the two women, who by now, were standing near one another. He showed the gun to Mrs Walsh and told both women “Don’t press the button”. He demanded they give him whatever money they had in their teller boxes. The offender returned to where Ms Preston was removing the money. She said to him: - 
     
      
       
        
        “Isn’t there any other way? Are you sure you want to go through with this?” 
        
       
       
      The offender replied: - 
       
       
        
        “Once they find out what I did last week, that’s it. I need the money”. 
        
       
      
    27 Ms Preston, demonstrating a degree of courage, pressed the device in her teller drawer that activated a silent alarm and caused the cameras in the bank to activate. At the same time, she handed the money to the offender. He then said to her “Can you just wait until I get out the door before you ring the cops?” He then turned and walked out of the bank with the money he had collected from Ms Preston and Mrs Walsh. This amounted to approximately $23,430.00. 
     
      
    28 The offender left the vicinity of the bank. He had purchased a bike from Wauchope Sports & Trophies on that day for $437.00. It was an adult size Peak mountain bike. Later, on the same day, the offender bought a motor car, which was for sale in the Wauchope area and stashed the bike in that car. He had, prior to the bank robbery, abandoned his own vehicle in the State Forest area behind Timbertown at Wauchope. This vehicle was later found by Ms Hilder who was walking in the State Forest area. She reported the presence of the vehicle to the police. 
     
      
    29 On the next day, or shortly thereafter, the offender borrowed his mother’s motor vehicle. He did so because the car he had bought on the day of the robbery proved unreliable and had broken down. He went to Sydney with the idea of “lying low” to avoid detection and later went to Bathurst. Eventually, the offender thought better of escape and decided to hand himself into the police. This happened on 23 February 2005 when the offender’s solicitor made arrangements for the police to collect him near her Wingham office. He was arrested and taken to Taree Police Station where he was charged with both offences. 
     
      
       
       
       
      The trial of the accused 
       
      
    30 On 14 September 2006 an indictment was presented against the offender containing one count. He was arraigned on a charge that, between 12 February and 15 February 2005 at Taree in the State of New South Wales, he did murder Warren Leslie Dickson. The offender pleaded not guilty to this charge. He had, however, earlier pleaded guilty to a second charge that, on 18 February 2005 at Wauchope in the State of New South Wales, armed with an offensive weapon, he did rob Jacqueline Lee Preston and Karen Anne Walsh of an amount of money the property of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited. The offender had first pleaded guilty to this charge on 25 August 2006. He repeated his plea on 13 September 2006 and thereafter adhered to the plea. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 20 years. 
     
      
    31 In relation to the murder charge, the jury returned its verdict on Friday 20 October 2006. The verdict was one of guilty of murder. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for life. There is a standard non-parole period prescribed under s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 of 20 years. 
     
      
    32 At the trial, the offender did not dispute that he had broken into the house at 90 Commerce Street Taree on the evening of 13 February 2005. Nor did he dispute that he had set fire to the house and to the body of the deceased. Moreover, the offender did not put in issue that the fatal wounds were inflicted by him on the deceased during the course of a struggle or confrontation between the two men. The defence case, however, was that the struggle was one in which the offender had struck the fatal blows while acting in self defence. It was his case that, when he broke into the house, he had been confronted by the deceased who had a knife in his hand, and who was acting in a singularly aggressive and violent manner. After an initial struggle between the two men, according to the defence version, the offender had the deceased pinned to the ground. The deceased, however, broke free and proceeded to beat the offender savagely about the head, arms and back with an iron bar. Again, according to this version, the deceased said that he was going to kill the offender and, it was at that stage, that the offender seized a knife and swung it defensively, thereby inflicting the fatal wounds. After the killing, the offender decided to cover up the evidence and burn the house and body. He said he did this out of concern for his children who, he feared, would be left without anyone to look after them. 
     
      
    33 There was a second major issue left to the jury: the accused gave evidence that, during the latter part of the struggle between himself and the deceased, the deceased had made some disgusting remarks to him about the deceased’s sexual intentions towards the offender’s children; and that this had engendered in him a feeling of anger and possible loss of self control. In short, there was left before the jury the issue of provocation, in addition to that of self defence. 
     
      
    34 In e-mails or letters written to various people shortly after the killing, the offender had, in fact, said that he had been confronted by the deceased with a knife when he entered the house and that he had been involved “in a life and death struggle”. These somewhat self serving notes supported the contention that he had been acting in self defence when he killed the deceased.  
     
      
    35 So far as the bank robbery was concerned, the offender gave evidence that his intention in going to the bank on 18 February 2005 was to bring about a situation where his life would be ended by police officers shooting him dead. He told the jury, however, that, when he was in the bank, he became concerned about, and sympathetic towards, the young bank teller, Ms Preston. He had changed his mind and went ahead with the robbery instead. He also gave evidence that he did not make admissions to two other women namely, Elizabeth Mitchell (the wife of Jeremy Moy) and Ms Barkwill (the sister of Ms Mitchell). These two women had given evidence during the trial that the offender had made admissions to them. It was the offender’s evidence that the only admissions he made were to Jeremy Moy and that these two women had made up this story in order to protect Jeremy Moy from being prosecuted as an accessory after the fact to both the murder and the bank robbery. The offender said Jeremy Moy had lent him vehicle number plates on 15 February 2005, so that he could travel with his children to Ipswich undetected. 
     
      
    36 In relation to the accused’s version of the events, that is the events directly relating to the death of the deceased, I find, consistently with the verdict of the jury, that the offender’s version was entirely fabricated. The offender was, throughout the struggle, the aggressor and it was the deceased who was fighting for his life. I reject completely the notion that the offender was acting in self defence. Rather I accept that, in the heat of the struggle, the offender made up his mind to despatch his rival and to eliminate him for good. I find, and do so beyond reasonable doubt, that the offender inflicted the fatal wounds while he had the deceased at a physical disadvantage and that he did so with the direct intention of killing him. Secondly, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased did not provoke the offender by the offensive words and conduct attributed to him. No such words or conduct were used or carried out by the deceased. Further, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, when he killed the deceased, the offender had not lost his self control but was acting out of a deliberate decision, as I have said, to eliminate his rival. It was simply anger, jealousy and the expediency of the moment that prompted his decision to kill the deceased. It is clear from the description I have earlier given that he did so cruelly, savagely and viciously. Although it is difficult to be precise about the sequence of the injuries sustained by the deceased, I am satisfied that the first wound was a stabbing to the left side of the throat. When the deceased fell to the ground, the offender cut his throat with a second swing of the knife. 
     
      
    37 I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, once the offender realised that the deceased was dead, that is when he saw his body lying on the kitchen floor and saw his blood pump out, he set about, in a calm and calculated way, to destroy all possible evidence that might implicate him in the killing. This was the reason he set fire to the house, having positioned the body of the deceased in the bedroom where the fire was started. It is significant to note that he moved his car to a safer position before he started the fire. Equally, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender’s behaviour on the next day when he met Ms Deluca, and his behaviour over the next couple of days, reflected a bold and calculated fulfilment of his plan to reinstate himself with Ms Deluca, without letting on that he had been involved so violently in the death of the deceased. It was the chance and unexpected discovery of possible blood stains in his car that caused him at that stage to panic and to plan and carry out the flight from Taree. Moreover, I reject the offender’s stated reasons for the bank robbery. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the robbery was carried out precisely to enable him to obtain funds so that he could flee and avoid arrest by the police. 
     
      
    38 There are two areas where, however, I am unable to accept certain aspects of the Crown case beyond reasonable doubt. The first is the suggestion that the offender went to the house on that evening with the intention of killing the deceased. I do not accept that this was his intention at the time he arrived at the house. The offender “shimmied” up the pipe outside the rear window, broke the glass and climbed in. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had an iron bar or a crowbar with him (not the piece of “reo” he described in his evidence). I am not able to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, however, that he was at that time carrying a knife. I accept that he went there “to bash” the deceased and indeed, he said so himself in Exhibits “K” and “W“. His purpose in going to the house was to confront the deceased, to physically intimidate him and to hurt him, if necessary, so that he would cease being a rival for the affections of Ms Deluca. I reject the offender’s story that he went to the house simply to check on the van and to confront the lovers. I find that he knew the deceased would be alone in the house and probably asleep. 
     
      
    39 I accept that the offender was wearing gloves, as he later told his daughter, Kimberley. I also accept that he was wearing a balaclava as he told Ms Barkwill. The deceased, as it happened, was woken by the noise of the entry and came from his bedroom to the kitchen area where the two men confronted and spoke to one another. The deceased assumed the intruder was a burglar and offered him money and “pot”. Once a struggle ensued between them, it was at that point of time that the intention to kill the deceased formed itself in the offender’s mind; and it was at that point of time, with that specific intention in mind, the injuries were inflicted. Although the murder weapon has never been located, I am satisfied that the offender killed the deceased with a knife from the kitchen. I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, during the early part of the struggle, the offender hit the deceased a number of times with the bar he had brought into the house. 
     
      
    40 The Crown argued that the entire sequence of events demonstrated that the offender went to the house with the intention to kill the deceased. The Crown argued that any other finding would be illogical because, had he simply gone there to assault the deceased, Ms Deluca would have discovered his actions and would have been unlikely to rekindle her relationship with him for that reason. There is, of course, some sense in this submission. It cannot be assumed, however, that the offender was acting in an entirely rational way. First, his desire to be revenged upon his rival was not necessarily to be equated with a desire to kill him. Secondly, he was, as I have said, disguised when he went to the house. Thirdly, I think that the offender had managed to persuade himself that the relationship between the deceased and Ms Deluca was not necessarily a long-term one; but, rather, one in which the deceased was some kind of sexual predator who had taken advantage of his girlfriend. This was, of course, not true. But that is the way it was perceived by the offender. In those circumstances, I consider that his mental state at the time was one in which he had convinced himself that if he could “bash” the deceased and physically intimidate him, this would advance his cause with Ms Deluca. At the very least, it would frighten the deceased away and persuade him to end his relationship with the young lady. There is simply not enough evidence to satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt that the offender went to the house with a pre-determined intention to kill. On the other hand, there is no doubt that his intention was to inflict serious physical injury upon the deceased; and that is what he set about doing when the two men first confronted one another in the kitchen. 
     
      
    41 The second matter relates to the alleged admissions to Ms Mitchell and Ms Barkwill. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that admissions were made to those women precisely in the terms given in their evidence. Moreover, I am not satisfied that the alleged admissions were made to them in the circumstances they each described. I accept that the offender did tell Jeremy Moy that he had been involved in the killing and that this happened on the day of the barbecue namely, 15 February 2005. I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was further discussion between the offender, Jeremy Moy, Elizabeth Mitchell and Kelly Barkwill on early evening of 18 February 2005. The circumstances surrounding these meetings and conversations, I am satisfied, involved a situation where Jeremy Moy, with the knowledge of the two women I have mentioned, had allowed the offender to borrow number plates from a car in the possession of Jeremy Moy at the relevant time. This was done to help the offender escape detection when he took his children to Ipswich on the evening of 15 February 2005. 
     
      
    42 I do not accept however that the admissions made to Jeremy Moy were as limited as those recounted by the offender in the evidence he gave before the jury. In that evidence, the offender was at pains to limit the information he had given to Jeremy Moy. He said that he had not given any information about the killing directly to either of the two women. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt however, that the nature of the admissions he made to Jeremy Moy, and to the women during subsequent conversations on 18 February 2005, were more detailed than he was prepared to admit. They were generally consistent with the facts I have found in relation to the circumstances of the killing. It is clear from Ms Barkwill’s evidence that a number of the matters she recounted could only have come from the accused, and not through the version allegedly given to Jeremy Moy. 
     
      
    43 In relation to admissions made by the offender, I should mention the evidence of Kimberley Steer, the 14 year old daughter of the offender. She gave evidence in the trial. The bulk of her evidence-in-chief was given by way of an audio-visual recording. In that evidence, Kimberley Steer told the jury that, on the evening of 15 February 2005, she had been provided with considerable detail by her father of the circumstances relating to the killing of the deceased. The young lady said that her father told her that he killed the deceased, that “he was struggling with the deceased because the deceased was trying to get a crowbar from him”. She also said that her father told her that he killed the deceased “because he took his girlfriend away from him”. 
     
      
    44 The offender had told Kimberley that he came in through the kitchen window and that the deceased had come into the kitchen after he had turned on the lounge room light. The offender had “hit the deceased over the head with the crowbar then pinned him to the ground and that was when he killed him”. 
     
      
    45 The offender told his daughter, that after he killed the deceased, he dragged him into the room onto his bed. He put “liquid stuff” all through the house and then he lit it. He also told her that before he “lit” the house, he moved the car. In addition, he told her that he had put “the suit stuff” he was wearing, and all the weapons he used in a plastic bag and “got rid of it”. Specifically, he mentioned to her the crowbar. He also said he had been wearing gloves but “he did not say what sort they were”. He also told her that he had to open the car door with the hand that had blood on it. Although he washed the car afterwards he had missed a spot, “that was his one mistake”. Kimberley said her father told her he did everything else right but that’s what he got wrong. “That was his one mistake” she said. 
     
      
       
      The subjective circumstances of the offender 
       
      
    46 The offender is a 40-year-old man who, at the time of the offences, was a single parent caring for four children whose ages ranged between 14 and 10. The offender was born in the United Kingdom but came to Australia as an infant with his parents. He grew up in Sydney. After his parents separated, he lived with his mother and step-father. His father, who is now in his early seventies, lives in the United Kingdom. His mother continues to reside in Taree. The separation occurred when the offender was about four. The offender was sexually interfered with by his step-father who was also violent to him on occasions. His step-father remained in the family home until the offender was about 10 or 12. 
     
      
    47 The offender was educated to the end of Year 9. He truanted from school but was never placed into a boys’ home or a juvenile facility. He has worked in the past as a labourer, a kitchen hand, a shop assistant and in a timber yard. He had been with the mother of his children for about 13 years, but their relationship was not satisfactory. There was evidence in the trial that his former wife had affairs with a number of men, including during the time the offender was in prison. This engendered in the offender a particular sensitivity towards the issue of marital infidelity and this was evident in his relationship with Ms Deluca.  
     
      
    48 The offender has a reasonably long criminal history but most of it is not relevant to the present offences. There were a number of dishonesty offences committed between 1990 and 1995. There was, however, an offence of armed robbery in February 1996. Later, there were two offences in April 1998, each being an armed robbery. On the first matter, the offender was sentenced to a fixed term of two years and three months to commence on 21 February 1998. On the charges in the second indictment, the offender was sentenced to concurrent minimum terms of two years and six months commencing at the expiry of the fixed term I have mentioned, together with an additional terms of two years. These sentences were imposed by Howie DCJ (as he then was) and the sentences were confirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 19 June 2000. There was also a conviction for fraud in the Australian Capital Territory in 1998. 
     
      
    49 Dr Bruce Westmore examined the offender in the Silverwater Prison Complex on 9 November 2006. He provided the Court with an extensive report dated 9 November 2006 (Exhibit 1). It appears that Dr Westmore was given a history by the offender of the circumstances relating to the death of the deceased. This version of events is the one that I have specifically rejected in making the findings of fact I did earlier in the decision. On page 7, Dr Westmore said: - 
     
      
       
        
        “I have not made any formal diagnosis of the psychiatric type in relation to Mr Steer although I would accept that if he was sexually abused as he describes, then that would have impacted adversely on his personality structure and development. I notice his criminal antecedents, which suggests some anti-social personality traits. I am unable at this time to diagnose an anti-social personality disorder. 
        
       
       
        
        I would accept that he was emotionally disturbed and distressed around the time his relationship with Nicky ended and with the circumstances of some of the events which he states followed that, in particular, her association with the deceased which apparently commenced shortly before his relationship with Nicky ended. 
        
       
       
        
        He states that during the altercation with the deceased, the deceased threatened to harm and kill him. He said the deceased also made a derogatory sexual comment about his children and that resulted in “a rush of energy and anger”.” 
        
       
      
    50 Dr Westmore expressed an opinion that because of the offender’s history of being sexually abused as a child, the deceased’s comments to him, if they had occurred, may have heightened his levels of anger and resulted in his extreme aggression towards the deceased. He may also have felt a sense of fear in view of the alleged threats towards him by the deceased. 
     
      
    51 As I have already said I do not believe the deceased made any threatening remarks to the offender and I reject, in particular, the suggestion that the deceased made offensive remarks regarding the children of the offender.  
     
      
    52 Nevertheless, Dr Westmore stated that the emotional drive which led the offender to enter the deceased’s home would have included emotions of jealousy and anger; and that, in the past, the offender had been confronted with other episodes of infidelity when he apparently discovered his wife having sexual intimacy with another man. In addition, his mother left his father for another man and Dr Westmore thought it likely that the offender does have some personality vulnerabilities but he was unable to confirm or exclude that view because of the short period of time he had been able to make clinical contact with the offender. 
     
      
    53 Finally, Dr Westmore noted that the offender is currently in segregation and that, if that situation were to continue, this would make his period of incarceration a more difficult and stressful experience for him. 
     
      
    54 There was evidence placed before me from the MRRC indicating that the offender had been placed on a segregation order on 17 June 2006 at Parklea Correctional Centre. This suggests that the offender may have been actively seeking assistance to attempt to escape from Parklea. Mr Stewart, counsel for the offender, stated that his instructions were that no such escape had been contemplated by the offender. However, there was an appeal heard by the Serious Offenders Review Council and on 29 August 2006 the order was confirmed. The offender was received at the MRRC on 22 October 2006 and remains in segregation at the present time as a consequence of the matters I have detailed. I am led to believe that there will be a review of the segregation situation in about a month’s time. 
     
      
       
       
       
      Victim Impact Statements 
       
      
    55 During the sentencing hearing, a Victim Impact Statement written by Mrs Dickson, the mother of the deceased, was read to the Court by her brother, Mr Kerry Redman. The Court was also provided with a Victim Impact Statement by the son of the deceased, James Lochrin-Dickson. It should be understood that I have not used the contents of these statements to increase the sentence that I believe is otherwise appropriate. I certainly appreciate, however, the terrible consequences for the family of the deceased, and in particular the impact on his parents and on his two children, as a result of the loss of his life in such brutal, violent and entirely unnecessary circumstances. Those persons, indeed all the family, have the complete sympathy of the Court, I trust that the opportunity to express their feelings and emotions may go some little way in making more bearable the loss of their loved one. 
     
      
       
      Objective seriousness – standard non-parole period 
       
      
    56 I consider that the criminality involved in the offence of murder in the present matter is at a high level. The Court needs to make it absolutely clear that in a situation where personal relationships go wrong; and one person is left by his or her partner to form a relationship with a new partner, there can be little or no sympathy extended to the rejected party who then intentionally takes a life in order to punish or eliminate his or her rival. That is essentially what happened here. In such circumstances, the Court needs to impose a sentence which is a substantial deterrence to others who might think it appropriate to behave in a similar way. Similarly, the Court needs to impose a sentence, which will denounce the actions of the offender and act as a personal deterrent to him. 
     
      
    57 As this is an offence to which a standard non-parole period applies, it is necessary to determine where, in the range of seriousness, the offence committed by the offender falls, taking into account those matters in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that affect the objective seriousness of the offence. The Crown submitted that the Court should find that it was above the mid range of seriousness although, in this regard, the Crown, in part, relied principally upon the assertion that the offender went to the home of the deceased with the specific purpose of killing him. That is, a matter I have rejected on the basis that I cannot be satisfied as to that matter beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    58 The offence, however, is a serious example of homicide even though the intention to kill was not formed until the two men confronted one another in the house. It must be kept clearly in mind that the offender went to the home of the deceased, intending to inflict really serious physical injury upon him. The offender had disguised himself and had broken into the house of the deceased in the late evening when it would be expected the deceased was asleep in his bed. The deceased would have been completely unprepared for such an attack. He was, for example, wearing nothing beyond his underpants. It would have been difficult for him, in any event, to evade or escape from his assailant. The offender broke in through the back window. This point of entry to the house was at a remove from the bedroom of the deceased. The offender was armed with an iron bar of some kind. He clearly intended to use this to beat and injure the deceased in a substantial way. Indeed, on the findings I have made, he did strike the deceased with the iron bar on a number of occasions. When the deceased fought back, the offender cut his throat in a very brutal and terrible way. It is clear the offender intended to kill the deceased when he struck these blows with the knife. Moreover, the deceased had been asleep in his own home and had never met the offender. He had never done anything harmful towards the offender other than to reciprocate the affections shown to him by Ms Deluca.  
     
      
    59 The deceased must have been terrified by the situation, which confronted him in his own home on the relevant evening. It follows from the findings of fact I have made that, throughout the confrontation, the offender was at all times the instigator and assailant; and that the fight was over very quickly indeed. There was some evidence from a Mr Jackson who lived nearby. This evidence suggested a prolonged and unusual sequel of events in the deceased’s house that evening. But I reject Mr Jackson’s evidence as being quite unreliable. As I have said, the confrontation would have ended promptly, probably within a matter of minutes. 
     
      
    60 The offender had obviously carefully planned breaking into the deceased’s home and he did so in the context of a plan to inflict really serious physical injury upon the deceased. It must have been apparent to the offender that the victim might fight back or try to defend himself and that is precisely the situation that the offender met in the kitchen of the deceased’s home. Whether the intention to kill the deceased was formed before going to 90 Commerce Street on 13 February or whether it was formed in the house, makes little difference, in the circumstances of this case, to the level of objective criminality. 
     
      
    61 Moreover, the offender burnt the body of the deceased in a callous and heartless fashion. This is a circumstance which I consider aggravated the offence of murder and demonstrated the utter indifference of the offender both towards the deceased and to the crime he had committed. 
     
      
    62 In that regard, I do not think that the offender has shown any remorse whatsoever for the death of his victim. He treated the deceased’s body with contempt and I think that his attitude towards the deceased has remained contemptuous, even to this day. He told his former wife, only a few days after the event, “The bastard deserved it”. During a conversation with Jeremy Moy, the latter said to the offender “Pricks like that deserve it”. Although these words were not uttered by the offender, they clearly reflected an attitude, which the offender shared with Jeremy Moy. There are other examples sprinkled throughout the evidence of the offender’s complete and utter indifference to the death of deceased. The fabricated version of the deceased’s alleged remarks to the offender in the kitchen do no credit to the offender at all. In addition, the fabricated comment attributed to Ms Deluca at the bus stop on the morning of 14 February 2005 – that she was more distressed about the loss of her dog than she was concerning the death of the deceased – fall into the same category. None of these matters, demonstrating an absence of remorse, apart from the burning of the body, require that the sentence to be imposed on the offender for the murder be increased. Nor do they impact adversely upon the selection of a non-parole period. But they certainly disentitle the offender to any discount for contrition or remorse. 
     
      
    63 Mr Stewart’s essential argument, focusing as it did on the state of mind of the offender, suggested that the criminality in the offence should be mitigated. This was because, according to the defence submission, the offender believed that the deceased had acted quite dishonourably towards Ms Deluca. Her infidelity to him, as he saw it, was something about which he was especially sensitive. In those circumstances, he was, in general terms, provoked by his perception of the deceased’s actions towards Ms Deluca (and hence to their impact on him). It was in that state of mind that he committed the murder. 
     
      
    64 I accept that the offender’s actions were motivated and directed in part by his feelings of jealousy, aggression and a desire for revenge. But they were also predicated upon the proposition that he wished to win Ms Deluca back. The offender’s behaviour on the morning after the killing, when he met Ms Deluca near the Old Bar Road, reflects that there was a great deal more cunning and calculation in his actions than the rather simplistic motives attributed to him by Mr Stewart. I do accept that jealousy and anger played their part. But there was also the need, when it presented itself, to get rid of his rival altogether. The elimination of the deceased opened the way, as he perceived it, for a reconciliation with Ms Deluca. 
     
      
    65 Dr Westmore found no psychiatric disorder operative in the offender at the time of the killing. He was not able to diagnose a personality disorder, although he suspected one may have been revealed upon further clinical examination. In my view, there was nothing in the psychiatric evidence that is relevant in the determination of the objective seriousness of the offence of murder. 
     
      
    66 In my opinion, the offence falls above the mid range of objective seriousness for the reasons I have indicated. It follows that a non-parole period that is several years above the standard non-parole period should apply, except so far as it might be varied by reason of any subjective factors and the presence or otherwise of special circumstances. I have, to this point, considered some of the subjective matters already. But it is necessary to give further consideration to other specific matters raised by Mr Stewart in this regard. 
     
      
    67 First, I do not believe that the history of sexual abuse in the offender’s background, sad though it is, has anything to do with the present matter. This is especially so, since I have rejected the offender’s version of the events that occurred in the house on 13 February. In particular, I have rejected any suggestion that the deceased made offensive and disgusting suggestions to the offender regarding his children or, for that matter, Ms Deluca. 
     
      
    68 Secondly, for the reasons I have already stated, I do not think there is any remorse or contrition in the offender regarding the death of the deceased. 
     
      
    69 Thirdly, the lengthy imprisonment term that must be imposed upon the offender will inevitably result in a lengthy separation between the offender and his children. This, however, is not of such consequence as to make it a matter to be taken into account. Mr Stewart next points to the fact that the offender surrendered to police. I do not, however, consider that this entitled the offender to any discount on his sentence as his capture was inevitable. Similarly, although the offender admitted that he had killed the deceased and that he had broken into the house and set the fire, I do not think that this represented any particular facilitation of the course of justice. The offender, as he was entitled to do, maintained a plea of not guilty to the murder and still maintains to this day that he was acting under provocation, and in the course of defending himself. The admissions made at trial did not relieve the Crown of proving the essential ingredients of the charge in a major number of respects. The admissions might be appropriately seen as a forensic tactical decision designed to yield a more lenient verdict than one of murder. I do not suggest that there is anything inappropriate in adopting such a course of action, quite the contrary. However, the making of the admissions does not entitle the offender to any mitigation of his sentence.  
     
      
    70 Finally, there is the issue of the prospect of rehabilitation in relation to both charges. I am not prepared to find that rehabilitation is beyond the offender although, it must be said, the offender has, to this point, never acknowledged or accepted responsibility for his criminality and culpability in relation to the cruel despatch of Mr Dickson. Nor has the offender shown any insight into his own actions. Rather, he has continued to blame other people for the situation in which he now finds himself. The imposition of a substantial sentence, however, will provide him with ample time to reflect upon the cruelty of the actions involved in his killing and upon the completely unnecessary death of the unfortunate Mr Dickson. This factor operates, accordingly, in the offender’s favour. 
     
      
    71 There are no special circumstances in the present matter. An application of the statutory relationship itself will produce a lengthy period of parole supervision necessary to address those problems that the offender might face in re-establishing himself in the community after a very lengthy period in custody. There is nothing that indicates that a shorter non-parole period should be fixed than that which would flow from the statutory relationship. In my opinion, there are no special circumstances to warrant a further reduction in the non-parole period. 
     
      
    72 In my view, the offender should be sentenced for the murder to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 22 years and a balance of term of seven years and four months. 
     
      
    73 I turn now to consider the bank robbery offence.  
     
      
    74 There is no need for me to repeat the facts of the bank robbery, which are set out in the early part of these reasons. This is not an offence that involves a standard non-parole period. The objective seriousness of the offence, however, may be stated as mid-range for an offence of this kind. The circumstances of the robbery were obviously quite frightening to Ms Preston and she displayed a degree of emotional fragility when giving her evidence before the Court. That is, by no means surprising since she was confronted with a man who displayed what appeared to be a hand gun to her and demanded that she hand the bank’s money over to him. There was a second bank teller who was similarly confronted and I have no doubt that the experience would have been most distressing and worrying for her as well. The Courts have said, time and time again, that offences of this kind are to be regarded as objectively very serious. That is the way in which this Court should approach an assessment of the objective seriousness of the present offence. The physical execution of the robbery was, however, not remarkable for any features of particular violence or unduly threatening behaviour. There was no actual violence and the offender remained calm throughout in his dealings with the bank tellers. 
     
      
    75 The offender pleaded guilty to the robbery but this plea occurred only a matter of weeks before the trial. The offender is entitled to a discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea but it must fall into the lower range. I am prepared to allow a discount of 10% in all the circumstances. I am unable to discern any evidence of remorse for the offence and I note, in relation to the aspect of rehabilitation, that the offender has a significant record in relation to previous armed robberies. One can only infer that, apart from the passage of time in the custodial environment, there is scant evidence of any prospect for future rehabilitation in relation to this type of offence. It seems that the offender has, in the past, demonstrated that, whenever it suits him, he will commit an armed robbery to obtain funds for his financial needs. Nevertheless, I cannot say that rehabilitation in this area is beyond him. 
     
      
    76 The Crown submitted that the two offences, murder and armed robbery, are separate acts of criminality requiring separate condign punishment. The Crown asked that the sentences be imposed consecutively, although the Crown recognised that the dictates of totality may produce the need for some degree of concurrence. 
     
      
    77 Mr Stewart, on the other hand, argued that the bank robbery was an offence intimately connected with the murder, being part of a continuing course of conduct which included the burning of the house, the trip to Ipswich, and the contemplation of flight. In those circumstances, Mr Stewart argued that, having regard to the principle of totality, most of the sentence for the armed robbery should be served concurrently, with a partial accumulation. 
     
      
    78 In my view, the appropriate exercise of sentencing discretion requires the imposition of a fixed term of imprisonment for the armed robbery. This is permitted by s 45 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It is particularly appropriate in the present situation where there is to be imposed a very significant sentence for the murder, containing both a lengthy non-parole period and a lengthy balance of term period. The fixed term will be the equivalent of the appropriate non-parole period of the sentence that would have been imposed had the circumstances not called for such a fixed term. The duration of the fixed term to be imposed has taken into account the discount which has been given for the utilitarian value for the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    79 In all the circumstances, I propose to set a fixed term of four years for the robbery offence. I will backdate it to the date when the offender was arrested namely 23 February 2005. The sentence for the murder will be partially concurrent with the fixed term sentence. It should commence on 23 February 2007 with the non-parole period for the murder offence to expire on 22 February 2029. The balance of the term will be for a further seven years and four months to expire on 22 June 2036. The offender will be eligible for parole on 22 February 2029. 
     
      
    80 I recommend to the prison authorities that a review be conducted of the offender’s segregation order and that such a review take place at the earliest possible time permitted by prison procedures and protocols. 
     
      
    81 Brian James Steer, in relation to the offence of robbery, armed with an offensive weapon, I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment for four years. The sentence is to commence on 23 February 2005 and to expire on 22 February 2009. In relation to the offence of the murder of Warren Leslie Dickson, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 22 years and the balance of term of seven years and four months. This sentence is to commence on 23 February 2007 and the non-parole period is to expire on 22 February 2029, the date upon which you will be eligible to be released to parole. The balance of the term will expire on 22 June 2036.

      PB0019/2006 Jim Lee v State Parole Authority of New South Wales 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: In McCallum v Parole Board [2003] NSWCCA 294, the Court of Criminal Appeal observed (at [30]) that the question of granting parole is usually one of considerable difficulty where the offender maintains his innocence, and the crime committed is one which evinces matters which need to be addressed before the offender is released on parole. 
     
      
    2 The present application is a further example of difficulties which arise in these circumstances. The Applicant, Jim Lee, is a convicted sex offender. He denies his guilt of the crime for which he was convicted. He has applied for entry to a custodial sex-offender’s rehabilitation programme but, because of his denial of guilt, he has been refused entry to such a programme.  
     
      
    3 The non-parole period component of the Applicant’s sentence expired on 11 September 2005. His total sentence will expire on 11 March 2008. On 22 September 2006, the State Parole Authority of New South Wales (“SPA”), the Respondent, refused to order the Applicant’s release on parole. The Applicant contends that this Court should intervene by way of statutory review under s.155 Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (“CAS Act”). 
     
      
    4 The issues raised on this application call, once again, for examination, of the approach adopted by the SPA with respect to an application for parole by a prisoner who has been convicted of a sexual assault offence, but who maintains his innocence and, for that reason, has been declined entry to a custodial sex-offender’s rehabilitation programme. It is not the first time that the Court has grappled with these issues: Galli v NSW State Parole Authority [2006] NSWSC 206; DCU v State Parole Authority of NSW [2006] NSWSC 526.  
     
      
       
      Nature of Application under s.155 CAS Act 
       
      
    5 Section 155 CAS Act is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “155  
        Application to Supreme Court by offender 
         
         
          
          (1) If: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (a) the Parole Authority decides that an offender should not be released on parole, and 
             
             
            (b) the offender alleges that the decision of the Parole Authority has been made on the basis of false, misleading or irrelevant information, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             the offender may, in accordance with rules of court, apply to the Supreme Court for a direction to be given to the Parole Authority as to whether the information was false, misleading or irrelevant. 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (2) The Supreme Court may give such directions with respect to the information as it thinks fit. 
           
           
          (3) An application under this section is to be considered by the Supreme Court if and only if it is satisfied that the application is not an abuse of process and that there appears to be sufficient evidence to support the application.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    6 The role of the Court under s.155 CAS Act is an extremely limited one. In DCU, I referred to authorities which demonstrated the confined nature of the jurisdiction ([5]-[7]): 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 155 does not provide a form of appeal from a decision refusing parole:  
        McPherson v Offenders Review Board 
         (1991) 23 NSWLR 61 at 69. The Act does not permit the Court to set aside the SPA’s decision and either to substitute its own decision, or to return the matter to the SPA to hear the matter again. It provides for no more than a direction to the SPA that the information upon which it acted is of a particular character:  
        McPherson 
         at 69.  
        
       
       
        
        The role of the Court under s.155 CAS Act has been described as ‘extremely limited’ and an application does not operate as a form of judicial review of an SPA decision:  
        R v Naudi 
         [2003] NSWCCA 160 at paragraph 19. On a s.155 application, the Court does not concern itself with questions pertaining to the merits of a decision nor with questions as to what weight is placed upon various factors:  
        Radford v Parole Board 
         [2002] NSWCCA 70 at paragraph 36;  
        McCallum v Parole Board 
         [2003] NSWCCA 294 at paragraph 33. In  
        Rozynski v Parole Board of New South Wales 
         [2003] NSWCCA 214, Greg James J (Hodgson JA and Simpson J agreeing) said at paragraph 13: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘For my part, I consider that action under the section will not be warranted unless the statutory conditions are met as a matter of substance. This means that information before the Board will not be characterised as false, misleading or irrelevant simply because it was challenged, even if challenged on such a basis before the Board and the challenge determined adversely to the applicant, nor if it is merely incorrect in detail but not false or misleading in substance. This court will need to be satisfied on appropriate (usually new) evidence that information was false or misleading in substance, and that the direction should be given. So far as there is a determination of the Board concerning information said to be false or misleading, before the court will so categorise that information, it will be necessary to satisfy the court that the Board's determination was plainly, not just arguably, wrong and further that the information was false or misleading and material to the Board's conclusion’.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    7 In McPherson v Offenders Review Board (1991) 23 NSWLR 61 at 67, Hunt J (as he then was) (Meagher JA and Studdert J agreeing) examined the origin of the statutory provision now contained in s.155 CAS Act. Hunt J described the purpose which the provision was designed to serve as “obscure” (at 67C). Aspects of the parole decision-making function had been touched upon in the reports of the Royal Commission into New South Wales Prisons presided over by Nagle J (1978) and of the Committee to Review the Parole of Prisoners Act 1966 conducted by his Honour Judge Muir QC (1979). Hunt J observed that the legislature had apparently agreed with the views of the Review Committee, in rejecting a proposal of the Royal Commission that prisoners should have an appeal to a court from a decision of the Parole Board (at 69B-C). The conclusions of Hunt J concerning the narrow function served by s.155 CAS Act (and its statutory predecessors) have been applied in the various cases to which reference was made in DCU. 
     
      
    8 In McCafferty v Offenders Review Board (Court of Criminal Appeal, 19 June 1995, unreported, BC9504950), James J (Gleeson CJ and Ireland J agreeing) said with respect to the predecessor to s.155 CAS Act (at page 15): 
     
      
       
        
        “However, I will note that these decisions have uniformly emphasised the very limited function this Court has on an application under s23 of the Sentencing Act. This Court is not a court of appeal from a decision of the Board refusing parole, nor can it conduct an administrative review of a decision by the Board refusing parole. It is not within the competency of this Court to say that a decision by the Board refusing parole was wrong or that the Board erred in accepting some evidence which was before it, rather than other evidence which was before it. This Court is concerned only with the information which was before the Board, and not with the Board's thought processes or its findings based on the information which was before the Board. All that the Court is empowered to do is to consider whether information on which the Board based it decision was false, misleading or irrelevant, and if it determines that information on which the Board based its decision was false, misleading or irrelevant, to give such directions to the Board with respect to that information as it thinks fit. As to whether information is irrelevant, information which has some significance, even if marginal significance, cannot be described as ‘irrelevant’ and what weight it should be given is a matter for the Board (see especially  
        McCamley 
         at 7).” 
        
       
       
      I note that  
      McCafferty 
       is one of the few cases where the Court has determined to give a direction that certain information was irrelevant, with a bare direction to that effect being given. 
       
      
    9 More recently, in Whalan v Parole Board of NSW [2005] NSWCCA 445, Simpson J (Grove and James JJ agreeing) observed at [4]-[6]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Applications to this Court under s 155 are becoming more frequent. This Court has more than once commented upon apparent inefficacy of the powers conferred on it by s155:  
        McPherson v Offenders Review Board 
         (1991) 23 NSWLR 61;  
        LMS v Parole Board 
         [1999] NSWCCA 371,  
        R v Naudi 
         [2003] NSWCCA 160. 
        
       
       
        
        The difficulties in the legislation have been expressly drawn to the attention of those in Attorney General’s Department responsible for law reform as appropriate for legislative amendment. Reform is urgent. There is a tendency quite unfairly to mislead offenders to believe that this Court is able to provide a remedy. 
        
       
       
        
        Typically, as in the present case, the applicant is not legally represented, and is forced to do his or her best to present a case without legal experience or training. Given that the section itself is ‘obscure’, to quote Hunt J (as he then was) in  
        McPherson 
        , this creates even more difficulties than are usual in the case of unrepresented litigants.” 
        
       
      
    10 In the course of short additional comments in Whalan v Parole Board of NSW, Grove J said at [36]: 
     
      
       
        
        “I would like to also observe myself that the very limited jurisdictional power that we have is made more difficult to exercise because the reasons of the Board are so brief in expression and sometimes cryptic in their terms.” 
        
       
      
    11 In Galli, Adams J directed the SPA to reconsider the question of the then Applicant’s parole. In the present case, the Applicant, who appears unrepresented, has urged me to make orders and directions as given in Galli. Ms Morris, counsel for the SPA, has submitted that the decision in Galli is not in accord with decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal concerning the limits of relief under s.155 CAS Act and ought not be followed. I am not bound by the decision of another single Judge but, as a matter of judicial comity, I ought follow that decision unless I am convinced that the judgment was wrong: Segal v Waverley Council (2005) 64 NSWLR 177 at 193 [57]. There is no reference in his Honour’s judgment in Galli to the various authorities which stand in the way of a broad construction of s.155(2) CAS Act. With respect, given the weight of authority (including binding authority), I disagree with his Honour’s conclusion that a direction to the SPA to reconsider its decision is open under the section.  
     
      
    12 I note that s.155(3) CAS Act purports to restrict the use of the provision so that an application under the section is to be considered by the Court if, and only if, it is satisfied that the application is not an abuse of process and that there appears to be sufficient evidence to support the application. As Simpson J observed in Whalan v Parole Board of NSW, it is frequently (if not usually) the case that an applicant under this provision will be unrepresented. The practical task confronting judges on these applications will usually be most effectively and fairly undertaken by moving to the substance of the application, and dealing with it on the merits, rather than attempting to determine, on a threshold basis, whether there appears to be sufficient evidence to support the application. Section 155(3) provides limited, if any, practical assistance as a filter on applications of this type. 
     
      
    13 Reference should also be made to a rarely used provision in s.156 CAS Act by which, if the SPA decides that a serious offender should be released on parole, the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may apply to this Court for a direction to be given to the SPA as to whether its decision to release on parole has been made on the basis of false, misleading or irrelevant information. Application has been made under s.156, as an alternative claim to relief under s.69 Supreme Court Act 1970 in Attorney General for NSW v NSW State Parole Authority [2006] NSWSC 865. There, it was contended that the SPA made its decision on information that was false or misleading in relation to the relevant legislative regime. In refusing to make a direction under s.156 CAS Act, McClellan CJ at CL said at [73]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion this submission must be rejected. It was a matter for the Authority to consider and apply the legislative regime provided by the Parliament. Although it was appropriate for it to receive submissions and, if persuaded that it should do so, act upon them, the nature of the submissions received did not provide information in the relevant sense. To my mind the information contemplated by s 156 is information going to the characteristics of the offence and the offender, and all matters relevant to whether or not it may be appropriate to allow their release. In the broadest sense the section has in contemplation factual information. The construction and appropriate application of the legislation does not fall into this category.” 
        
       
      
    14 The observations of the Chief Judge at Common Law concerning s.156 appear to have equal application to the term “information” in s.155 CAS Act. This construction serves to emphasise, once again, the limited nature of review which this Court can undertake under ss.155 and 156 CAS Act. 
     
      
       
      Functions of the SPA 
       
      
    15 It is necessary to bear in mind the functions of the SPA and the nature of the parole-granting function. In DCU, I said [12]-[14]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The SPA is constituted under s.183 CAS Act. The functions of the SPA include the determination of matters with respect to the granting of parole and the conditions on which parole is granted: s.185(1)(a). The SPA is not bound by the rules of evidence, but may inform itself of any matter in such manner as it thinks appropriate: clause 11(4), Schedule 1, CAS Act.  
        
       
       
        
        The SPA consists of at least four judicial members, at least one police officer, at least one officer of the Probation and Parole Service and at least 10 community members who should reflect, as closely as possible, the composition of the community at large: s.183(2) CAS Act. Of the community members, at least one must be a person who, in the opinion of the Minister, has an appreciation or understanding of the interests of victims of crime: s.183(2A) CAS Act. Thus, the SPA comprises persons with a variety of interests and expertise including the expression of community views:  
        Medical Board of Queensland v Thurling 
         [2003] QCA 518 at paragraph 12;  
        SB v Queensland Community Corrections Board 
         [2005] QSC 155 at paragraph 13. 
        
       
       
        
        Where a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for a term of three years or less, being a sentence that has a non-parole period, the court must make an order directing the release of the offender on parole at the end of the non-parole period: s.50 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Where the sentence of imprisonment exceeds three years, and a non-parole period is fixed, then the question whether the offender will be released on parole is one for consideration by the SPA. The sentencing court will fix a non-parole period which represents the minimum period for which the offender must be held in custody for the offence. The SPA has the authority to release an offender conditionally from confinement in accordance with the sentence imposed upon him. The full sentence of imprisonment stands and during its term the prisoner is simply released upon conditional parole:  
        Power v The Queen 
         (1973) 131 CLR 623 at 627-628;  
        R v Simpson 
         (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at 716-717 (paragraphs 55-58). It is a misnomer to speak of a minimum sentence and a maximum sentence as there is, in truth, but one sentence, being that imposed by the trial judge, which cannot be altered by the paroling authority:  
        Power v The Queen 
         at 629. The grant of parole by a paroling authority is a privilege and not a right:  
        McCallum v Parole Board 
         at paragraph 28.” 
        
       
      
    16 Section 135 CAS Act provides for the general duty of the SPA in determining whether a parole order will be made for an offender serving a sentence of imprisonment exceeding three years: 
     
      
       
        
        “135  
        General duty of Parole Authority 
         
         
          
          (1) The Parole Authority must not make a parole order for an offender unless it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the release of the offender is appropriate in the public interest. 
          
         
         
          
          (2) In deciding whether or not the release of an offender is appropriate in the public interest, the Parole Authority must have regard to the following matters:

            (b) the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice, 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (c) the nature and circumstances of the offence to which the offender’s sentence relates,

            (e) the offender’s criminal history, 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (f) the likelihood of the offender being able to adapt to normal lawful community life, 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (g) the likely effect on any victim of the offender, and on any such victim’s family, of the offender being released on parole, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (h) any report in relation to the granting of parole to the offender that has been prepared by or on behalf of the Probation and Parole Service, as referred to in section 135A, 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (i) any other report in relation to the granting of parole to the offender that has been prepared by or on behalf of the Review Council, the Commissioner or any other authority of the State, 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (j) such guidelines as are in force under section 185A,

          (3) Except in exceptional circumstances, the Parole Authority must not make a parole order for a serious offender unless the Review Council advises that it is appropriate for the offender to be considered for release on parole.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    17 Section 135A, which is mentioned in s.135(2)(h), is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “135A  
        Preparation of reports by Probation and Parole Service 
         
         
          
          A report prepared by or on behalf of the Probation and Parole Service for the purposes of section 135 must address the following matters: 
          
         
         
          
          (a) the likelihood of the offender being able to adapt to normal lawful community life, 
           
           
          (b) the risk of the offender re-offending while on release on parole, and the measures to be taken to reduce that risk, 
           
           
          (c) the measures to be taken to assist the offender while on release on parole, as set out in a post-release plan prepared by the Probation and Parole Service in relation to the offender, 
           
           
          (d) the offender’s attitude to the offence to which his or her sentence relates, 
           
           
          (e) the offender’s willingness to participate in rehabilitation programs, and the success or otherwise of his or her participation in such programs, 
           
           
          (f) the offender’s attitude to any victim of the offence to which his or her sentence relates, and to the family of any such victim, 
           
           
          (g) any offences committed by the offender while in custody, including in particular any correctional centre offences and any offence involving an escape or attempted escape, 
          
         
         
          
          (h) the likelihood of the offender complying with any conditions to which his or her parole may be made subject.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    18 In DCU, I observed with respect to the statutory function of the SPA ([17]-[20]): 
     
      
       
        
        “Accordingly, the SPA must not make a parole order for an offender unless it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the release of the offender is appropriate in the public interest: s.135(1). With respect to the term ‘appropriate’, the High Court observed in  
        Mitchell v The Queen 
         (1995-1996) 184 CLR 333 at 346: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The phrase ‘considers … appropriate’ indicates the striking of a balance between relevant considerations so as to provide the outcome which is fit and proper.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The factors identified in s.135(2) CAS Act throw light on the meaning of the term ‘public interest” in the present statutory context.  
        
       
       
        
        The report prepared by the Probation and Parole Service under s.135A is intended to provide the SPA with information relating to the offender and his circumstances by reference to the matters set out in s.135A(a)-(h). Section 135A(a) coincides with the factor contained in s.135(2)(f) CAS Act. Beyond that, the matters referred to in s.135A relate to topics not expressly contained in s.135. Nevertheless, matters such as the risk of the offender reoffending on parole and the measures to be taken to reduce that risk (s.135A(b)), the offender’s attitude to the offence to which his sentence relates (s.135A(d)), the offender’s willingness to participate in rehabilitation programs and the success or otherwise of his participation in such programs (s.135A(e)) and the offender’s attitude to any victim of the offence to which his sentence relates and to the family of any such victim (s.135A(f)) touch upon some of the primary considerations in s.135(2) CSA Act.  
        
       
       
        
        All the matters referred to in ss.135 and 135A shed light upon the nature of matters which are relevant to the SPA’s decision whether it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that an offender’s release is appropriate in the public interest.” 
        
       
       
      The Applicant’s Offence 
       
      
    19 On 25 March 2003, the Applicant was arraigned before his Honour Judge Patten in the District Court upon three counts: 
     
      
       
      (a) that on 14 December 2001 at Fairfield, he did take MC without her consent with the intention of obtaining an advantage (s.86  
      Crimes Act 1900 
      ); 
       
       
      (b) that at the same time and place, he had sexual intercourse with MC without her consent, and knowing that she was not consenting, in circumstances of aggravation, in that at the time, actual bodily harm was inflicted upon her (two counts under s.61J  
      Crimes Act 1900 
      ). 
       
      
    20 The Applicant pleaded not guilty to each charge and, following trial by jury, on 2 April 2003, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty upon the first and third counts and guilty upon the second count, an offence under s.61J Crimes Act 1900 punishable by a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment. In his remarks on sentence on 16 May 2003, his Honour Judge Patten recounted the facts in the following way (ROS1-2): 
     
      
       
        
         “The Crown case at trial was that the prisoner came upon the victim who was walking in Smart Street, Fairfield in the early hours of 14 December 2001, forced her against her will into his car parked a short distance away, and drove her to the parking area of Fairfield Showground where he sexually assaulted her on two occasions. The jury’s verdict on the first charge indicates that it was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he abducted the victim as alleged. It seems therefore that he must be sentenced on the basis that the victim went willingly in his car. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown case on the second count, which the jury did accept beyond reasonable doubt, was that in the back seat of his car in a remote section of the car park at Fairfield Showground he forced the victim to lie down, forcibly removed her jeans and underpants and proceeded without her consent knowing she was not consenting to insert a hard object which she said felt like a metal or plastic pipe or pole into her vagina. He pushed it up and down on a number of occasions causing her considerable pain and injury. He refused to heed her pleas to desist from this behaviour. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown case in relation to the third charge on the indictment was that shortly afterwards the prisoner without consent penetrated the victim’s vagina with his fingers. He was found not guilty in respect of this matter and nothing further need be said about it. 
        
       
       
        
        Medical examination of the victim a few hours later revealed, apart from minor injuries to other parts of her body, multiple scratch marks on her upper inner thighs, redness on her knee, redness adjacent to her right nipple, swelling about the vaginal area, fresh bleeding in the high vagina and abrasions on the posterial wall of the vagina. The victim was born on 9 September 1981 was aged twenty at the time of the offence.” 
        
       
       
      The Applicant’s Background 
       
      
    21 The Applicant was born in Iraq on 7 July 1979 and immigrated to Australia in July 1995 with an older brother and his family. According to the pre-sentence report before the District Court on 16 May 2003, the Applicant experienced a close and supportive upbringing in a Christian family. He sponsored his parents to come to Australia in 2000. The Applicant, at the time of sentence, had been in a close relationship with a girlfriend who was five years older than himself. The only matter recorded on his criminal history was a mid-range PCA offence for which, on 28 October 1999, he was sentenced in the Parramatta Local Court by way of a two-year recognisance under s.556A Crimes Act 1900. The learned sentencing Judge observed (ROS4): 
     
      
       
        
        “It is plain from references and from the evidence of his sister that in all respects, except for this offence, he has established himself as a very worthwhile man in the community and has a high reputation. He has been a caring family man and has accepted in recent years responsibility for looking after his parents since their arrival in Australia.” 
        
       
       
      The Applicant’s Sentence 
       
      
    22 With respect to the single count of which he was convicted, the Applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of two-and-a-half years and a balance of term of two-and-a-half years with the non-parole period commencing on 12 March 2003 and expiring on 11 September 2005 and the balance of term expiring on 11 March 2008. 
     
      
       
      Appeal to Court of Criminal Appeal 
       
      
    23 On 7 May 2004, the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed an appeal against conviction: R v Lee [2004] NSWCCA 133. The Applicant did not seek leave to appeal against sentence.  
     
      
    24 On appeal, the Applicant contended that the verdict in respect of Count 2 was unreasonable and could not be supported, or otherwise represented a miscarriage of justice, having regard to the evidence and to the verdicts of not guilty in respect of Counts 1 and 3. Having undertaken an assessment of the whole of the evidence, Smart AJ (Sully and Dowd JJ agreeing) concluded that it was open to the jury upon the whole of the evidence to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant was guilty of Count 2 (at [95]). Although the Court acknowledged that there were substantial issues concerning MC’s account of the incident, it was also observed that “the jury obviously thought that [the Applicant’s] improbable version of events in the car was not reasonably possible” (at [92]). 
     
      
       
      The Applicant and Custodial Sex-Offenders Programmes 
       
      
    25 On 11 October 2004, the Applicant gave written consent to a sex-offender programme’s referral to CUBIT (Custody Based Intensive Treatment) or CORE (CUBIT Outreach) (Exhibit 1, page 121).  
     
      
    26 According to Programs for Sex Offenders, a document issued by the Offender Programs Unit, Department of Corrective Services (November 2005), assessment of sex offenders involves the following (page 2): 
     
      
       
        
        “The assessment of sex offenders should focus on the risk of recidivism. These assessments take into consideration both static (historical; non-changeable) factors and dynamic (changeable) risk factors. The risk assessment instruments used by DCS to assess sex offenders are the STATIC-99 (static factors) (Hanson and Thornton, 1999) and the Stable and Acute (formerly known as SONAR) to measure dynamic factors (Hanson and Harris, 2000).” 
        
       
      
    27 It was common ground at the hearing of the present application that the criteria for sex-offender programmes included the following (Exhibit 1, page 2): 
     
      
       
        
        “The Sex Offender Programs are only available to  
        sentenced 
         offenders. In addition, an inmate who is alleged to have committed an offence for a sexual reason (eg. convicted for break and enter, but information suggests motive was sexual)  
        MUST 
         be referred to the Regional Senior Psychologist, for a risk assessment. The Sex Offender Risk Assessment form must be completed by the Case Management Team and a copy of the form sent to the Statewide Clinical Co-ordinator Sex Offender Programs. An inmate assessed as presenting a low risk of re-offending in a sexual manner will normally not be required to participate in a Sex Offender Program and may progress through the normal case management process in the centre of placement.” 
        
       
      
    28 The same Department of Corrective Services document described CUBIT and CORE in the following way (Exhibit 1, page 2): 
     
      
       
        
        “CUBIT 
        
       
       
        
        This is an intensive residential therapy program for men who have sexually abused adults and/or children. It is offered at the MSPC to offenders assessed as having medium-high or high risk/needs and is primarily, though not solely, group based. 
        
       
       
        
        Offenders of medium-high risk/needs will be expected to remain in the CUBIT for approximately 10 months. Offenders of moderate risk needs will be expected to remain for about 8 months. 
        
       
       
        
        CORE 
        
       
       
        
        This is a medium intensity therapy program for men who have sexually abused adults or children and whose risk/needs fall in the medium-low range. It runs in a group format and is 5 months in length, with two half-days per week of group sessions. It is offered at the MSPC as an ‘outreach’ of the CUBIT.” 
        
       
      
    29 As part of his application on 11 October 2004, the Applicant was required to answer a number of questions: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. Answer the following questions re: your sexual offending. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          * Briefly described what happened? She asked me if I want sex for money but I refyse  
          [sic] 
          . 
           
           
          * Whom has been affected? Me and my faimley  
          [sic] 
          . 
           
           
          * Who or what is responsible for sexual offending? There was no sexual offending. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        2. What are your reasons for wanting to participate in the CUBIT/CORE/Custodial Maintenance Programme? 
        
       
       
        
        I respect the courtroom find me guilty that way. 
        
       
       
        
        3. What issues/problems do you think you need to address?  
        
       
       
        
        I have no issues. 
        
       
       
        
        4. What do you think you’ll gain from treatment? 
        
       
       
        
        I don’t no  
        [sic] 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        5. What treatment programs have you completed? For what kind of problems? 
        
       
       
        
        None.” 
        
       
      
    30 On 6 December 2004, Mr David Bright, Therapeutic Manager, CUBIT, Metropolitan Special Programs Centre, informed the Applicant that his application for admission to a programme had been refused (Exhibit 1, page 124): 
     
      
       
        
        “Re: Your Referral and Application for the CUBIT/CORE programmes 
        . 
         
         
        Your referral and application for treatment has been reviewed by the Sex Offender Programme staff. 
         
         
        At this stage, you have been found unsuitable for institutional treatment programmes for sexual offenders for the following reasons: 
         
         
        To be found suitable for the CUBIT/CORE programme you need to acknowledge some of the behaviours that you have been convicted of (ie, the sexual convictions). It is apparent from your response to Part C of the referral package as well as from discussions with the psychologist who completed the referral, that you are actively denying the sexual offences for which you have been convicted. 
         
         
        The CUBIT/CORE programme is designed to help offenders work intensively on changing the thinking, attitudes and feelings which led to their offending behaviour. If you change your mind and decide to take responsibility for your sexual offending behaviour then you can be re-referred to CUBIT/CORE for treatment via the Case Management Team.” 
        
       
       
      Applicant’s Parole Refusal in 2005 
       
      
    31 On 15 July 2005, the Parole Board (as the SPA then was) formed a preliminary determination that the Applicant ought be refused parole. On 27 October 2005, a hearing took place before the SPA (with his Honour Judge Christie QC presiding) at which the question of the Applicant’s release on parole was further considered. The Applicant was represented at the hearing by Ms Voncina, solicitor. 
     
      
    32 Prior to the hearing on 27 October 2005, the Applicant’s solicitor had provided to the SPA a report of Dr Christopher Lennings, Psychologist, dated 2 July 2005 concerning the Applicant. In that report, Dr Lennings stated that he undertook “a comprehensive risk assessment (using more than the Static-99) and my assessment of his dynamic risk factors supports the view he is a low risk offender” (Exhibit 1, page 14). Dr Lennings observed that the Applicant “denies the offence, even when it seems contra-intuitive for him to do so, given such denial is likely to extend his time in gaol” (Exhibit 1, page 14). Dr Lennings concluded his report with the following statement (Exhibit 1, page 15): 
     
      
       
        
        “My own view, expressed in my report, is that Mr Lee shows low levels of criminogenic needs and low levels of risk factors for sexual recidivism. I have no way of knowing whether treatment would have lessened his risk of recidivism, but the reality is he has a low risk of recidivism in any case.” 
        
       
      
    33 In a further report also dated 2 July 2005, Dr Lennings said (Exhibit 1, page 22): 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Lee continues to assert his innocence. After being imprisoned, Mr Lee did apply to enter Cubit on the recommendations, as I understand it, of a psychologist in gaol. However, he was rejected from Cubit because he continues to assert his innocence. He told me that although he believes he is not guilty, nonetheless, he respects the judgment of the court and that is the reason why he applied for the Cubit program. Whilst I note that the literature suggests denial, in and of itself, is not necessarily that something that should prevent someone from benefiting from treatment, the philosophy of the program at Long Bay is to exercise an exclusion where a person does not admit their offence. 
        
       
       
        
        It should also be noted that there is a distinction in literature between those people who refuse treatment, on the basis that they do not believe it is necessary for them, and those people who are refused treatment simply because they fail to meet the ideological perspectives of the program. Generally speaking, the literature indicates that there is a beneficial impact from treatment. Treatment effectiveness is still a contentious area, with some researchers suggesting that there is little impact for treatment and others arguing that there is, nonetheless, the larger studies have indicated that there is a beneficial effect for treatment and that, conversely, those people who have failed treatment (that is, initiated treatment but for some reason or another have not been able to proceed with it), have a somewhat worse aspect.” 
        
       
      
    34 Dr Lennings provided a detailed risk assessment with respect to the Applicant (Exhibit 1, pages 24-25). The application of Static-99 placed the Applicant in the medium-to-low risk group. Dr Lennings concluded that the Applicant appeared to have very few dynamic risk factors (Exhibit 1, page 25). Dr Lennings concluded (Exhibit 1, page 25A): 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Lee is a young man of low cognitive function who shows high levels of sociability but also a considerable degree of naivety. He appears to be very pro-social; he appears to experience a considerable degree of distress as a result of his incarceration and still continues to assert his innocence. He reveals minimum risk factors for recidivism and in fact he would appear to have a low risk of recidivism. He appears to have an excellent rehabilitation prognosis, with good levels of psychosocial stability, opportunities for stable accommodation, stable relationship and stable employment. 
        
       
       
        
        It appears to me that Mr Lee would be a good risk for release, on parole, should that opportunity arise.” 
        
       
      
    35 The Applicant gave evidence at the SPA hearing on 27 October 2005. Dr Lennings was called to give evidence at the hearing. He confirmed his aggregate risk assessment that the Applicant was in a low-risk category (Exhibit A, Tab 3, page 6). In the course of his evidence, the Chairperson asked Dr Lennings (page 7.13): 
     
      
       
        
        ““CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. Q. Dr, you realise, I imagine, that the Board proceeds on the basis that this inmate’s denied his offences as false? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I understand that. I also recognise the necessity to clear that, which I did, I think in one of the opening paragraphs of my report.” 
        
       
      
    36 Ms Reidler, Probation and Parole Officer, gave evidence at the SPA hearing on 27 October 2005. The Chairperson rejected a number of questions asked by Ms Voncina upon the basis that Ms Reidler was not a psychologist and was not qualified to answer questions concerning the risk of re-offending (page 11) nor was she “entitled to make an assessment of risk other than a reliance upon his failure to do the CUBIT program” (page 12.1). 
     
      
    37 After submissions from Ms Voncina, and following a short adjournment, the Chairperson indicated briefly that the SPA had considered the evidence of Dr Lennings and the contents of the reports and that parole was refused for the reasons stated on 15 July 2005. The matter was stood over for further consideration of the Applicant’s possible release to parole to 21 July 2006.  
     
      
       
      The Applicant’s 2006 Parole Hearing 
       
      
    38 A pre-release report was made to the SPA by Janiece Gallpen, Probation and Parole Officer, on 22 June 2006 (Exhibit A, Tab 5). In that report, Ms Gallpen stated (page 2): 
     
      
       
        
        “There has been no change in Mr Lee’s attitude towards his offence. He is therefore not suitable for the CUBIT program. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Lee completed a Relaxation and Stress Management program in April 2005, Understanding Sexual Offending in September 2005 and Anger Management in January 2006. It is noted these programs are educational rather than therapeutic.” 
        
       
      
    39 Ms Gallpen’s report addressed the Applicant’s risk of re-offending in the following way (page 3): 
     
      
       
        
        “RISK OF RE-OFFENDING 
        
       
       
        
        Administration of Instruments 
        
       
       
        
        In accordance with LSIR, a standardised risk/needs assessment instrument, Mr Lee is assessed as being within the low category of re-offending. 
        
       
       
        
        The Static 99 instrument places Mr Thomas’  
        [sic] 
         risk of sexual/violent recidivism in the medium to low range. 
        
       
       
        
        According to Service policy Mr Lee will be supervised at a medium to high level.” 
        
       
      
    40 Ms Gallpen concluded her report with the following summary and recommendations (page 3): 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Lee continues to receive positive reports regarding his behaviour in custody. However, his denial regarding his offence remains of concern and he has failed to access Sex Offender Treatment programs in custody. Although Mr Lee has recently expressed a willingness to participate in community based individual therapy, the therapist indicated to this Service that such intervention would be pointless while he remains in denial. Additionally, custodial based treatment would be more intensive and this continues to be considered the most appropriate course of action for Mr Lee. Therefore, release to parole is not recommended.” 
        
       
      
    41 By letter dated 14 July 2006, the Applicant’s solicitor provided to the SPA two further psychological reports concerning the Applicant - a report of Terry Smith, Clinical Psychologist, dated 24 April 2006 and a report of Jenny Howell, Consulting Psychologist, dated 10 July 2006. The Applicant’s solicitor requested that the SPA take into account the reports of Dr Lennings, Mr Smith and Ms Howell in determining whether to grant parole to the Applicant. 
     
      
    42 In his report, Mr Smith adopted the following approach (Exhibit A, Tab 8, page 6): 
     
      
       
        
        “For the purpose of this report, it is assumed that the facts to which Mr Lee was found guilty are correct. Any comments made in this report about his account of his offending behaviour are made only when they have ramifications in terms of his acceptance of treatment and risk assessment. 
         
         
        The account of Mr Lee of the matters leading up to his plea of guilt  
        [sic]  
        and subsequent incarceration was consistent with the information as recounted in the Judge's Summation and the reports produced by the Probation and Parole officers and Mr Lennings, Clinical Psychologist. The documented position as it has eventuated is that he continues not to accept responsibility for his offending and that he has not participated in a Sex Offender rehabilitation programme. Thus, the Board has not received information about any change within this man and therefore cannot discern his ability to adapt to normal community life with a reduced likelihood of re-offending. 
         
         
        In summary, Mr Lee was found guilty of one moment of sexual sadism where he used an object, most probably a copper pipe or a piece of plastic conduit used by electricians, without any lubrication and inserted it into the vagina of the victim. The account is that he did not attempt sexual intercourse nor did he assault the victim in other ways. The bodily harm suffered by the victim relates to injuries sustained from the sexual assault by the object.” 
        
       
      
    43 Mr Smith moved to the issue of risk assessment of the Applicant (pages 7-9): 
     
      
       
        
        “The Risk Assessment of Mr Lee is a bit of a conundrum. On the one hand, he continues to deny responsibility and his refusal to accept that he is a ‘sex offender’ ordinarily might be cause for concern. In fact, the Risk Assessment using the STATIC-99 elevated his categorisation from the ‘low' to ‘low-medium' range because of this fact. 
         
          
         
        The other measure of ‘static variables' (i.e. characteristics that in and of themselves are unlikely to change in response to treatment) was a clinical interview focusing on personality constellation factors associated with intense psychological distress and antisocial behaviour. However, when a formal measure of personality is used and when a very lengthy history of stable and highly prosocial behaviour are considered, then another picture seems to emerge. Mr Lee's history of danger to the community pertains to one moment of sexual sadism that is completely at odds with his normal patterns of his living. Evidence as to his ‘normal patterns' of behaviour was presented to the Sentencing Hearing and factors that generally co-exist with such sadistic behaviour, inclusive of rage, impulse control problems, contempt of others for one reason or another, feelings of superiority/domination, distortions of sexual desire/ performance/attitude, distorted attitudes to the rights of others (inclusive of creed, race, minority groups), the torture of animals etc were strongly denied as ever having been aspects in his character. It would be impossible to hide such attributes from those around because of the elevated intensity of these impulses/attitudes and they would shape, colour and control behavioural patterns. So, in terms of ‘static' risk factors, the empirical evidence would suggest that this one moment of offending was extremely out of character and not consistent with ‘static factors' associated with recidivism. 
         
         
        Prior to considering ‘dynamic’ variables, the problematic issue is  
        [sic]  
        this case is understanding the motivation of the offender. In short the evidence is that he committed an incident of sexual assault in a callous and heinous way. It was accepted that his functioning was not impaired by alcohol or any other substance. His demeanour was reported as reasonable and this would rule out issues such as a ‘Brief Psychotic Episode', ‘temporary amnesia', dissociation or a fugue state. Thus, this man has perpetrated a momentary act of sexual sadism that was completely out of character in his functioning. 
         
         
        This being the case, then perhaps an answer to this question might lie in the ‘dynamic variables' leading up to his offending. The ‘dynamic variables' (i.e. those variables that can be moderated by treatment or supervision) are assessed using a structured clinical interview. Mr Lee appears to have very few Dynamic Risk Factors. He denied any sexual deviation such as fetishes, paraphilias and he has never used brothels or prostitutes. He does not appear to have a high libido and masturbates infrequently. He has stable accommodation and employment. He had good support systems and there was not any evidence of mental health issues. He does not have any history of significant criminality in his background. There is not a history of escalation of sexual offences (i.e. lack of offending whilst on bail). Whilst the victim alleged considerable violence by him there appears to be no other issue with violence in his life. He does not have antisocial peers nor does he endorse anti-social values. He has realistic future plans and is open to the prospect of treatment. It would seem that the only possible risk factor is his denial. Denial itself has never been shown to have any significant relationship to recidivism and alone this factor needs to be considered with caution. On the whole, the risk assessment of this man reveals a person of quite low risk of recidivism. 
         
         
        Mr Lee was prepared to participate in the sex offender programme because he viewed it as a requirement to demonstrate his much reduced potential for re-offending. He is openly prepared to continue in some form of psychotherapy should he be released on parole. He gained significant benefit from the time with Mr Lennings."" 
          
        
       
      
    44 In her report, Ms Howell observed (Exhibit A, Tab 9, pages 5-6): 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Lee applied to participate in the CUBIT program run at Long Bay. He was initially accepted but subsequently rejected from the program because of his denial that he sexually assaulted the victim. It should be stated that while Mr Lee does deny the offence he expresses  
        [sic]  
        respects the judgement of the court. Mr Lee stated that he believes he could benefit from a treatment program looking at his behaviour, the choices he made and the values he demonstrated. 
         
          
         
        I endorse Dr Lennings comment that denial has never been shown in the research literature to have any significant relationship to recidivism. It should not therefore be considered a risk factor for Mr Lee.” 
        
       
      
    45 Ms Howell provided the following analysis of static and dynamic risk factors concerning the Applicant (pages 6-7): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Static-99 
         
         
        The Static-99 (Hansen and Thornton, 1999) is an actuarial measure based on empirical factors found to be associated with sexual and violent recidivism. These factors include past sentencing dates (sexual and non sexual convictions), history of violence, and stability of relationships, an individual's age, and the nature of the sexual offence. The scores obtained on the Static-99 in consideration of sexual offences, which result in some form of criminal intervention or official sanction, are translated into risk categories determined by the authors of the instrument. The categories are low, medium-low, medium-high, and high. A classification of low cannot necessarily be interpreted, that the risk of reoffending is at the lowest possible level. Using the Static-99 it is not possible to designate someone with a previous conviction as no risk. 
         
         
        Mr Lee's score falls into the medium-low category. This is based on a score of three; the victim was a stranger, was unrelated and Mr Lee had never lived in an intimate relationship for a period of two years or more. A risk rating of medium-low places Mr Lee in a group where approximately 19% of individuals will reoffend over a fifteen year period. That is not to say that Mr Lee has a nineteen percent chance of re-offending, rather it indicates that the  
        [sic]  
        within the group the offence rate was approximately one in five. 
         
         
        Dynamic Risk Factors (Sex Offender Need Assessment Rating, SONAR 
        ) 
         
         
        The sex offender need assessment rating SONAR (Hansen and Harris, 2000) gives an estimate of the dynamic factors known to be associated with sexual recidivism. The items are divided into five relatively stable factors: intimacy deficits, negative social influences, attitudes tolerant of sexual offending, sexual self regulation, general self regulation, as well as four more acute factors: substance abuse, negative mood, anger and victim access. 
         
         
        Mr Lee does not score highly on the dynamic factors known to be associated with sexual recidivism. At the time of the offence he was in a stable intimate relationship. There is no history of serious criminal behaviour in his background, he does not appear to have anti social peers or endorse anti social attitudes. Mr Lee in fact appears to endorse very pro social attitudes and exhibits no behaviour supportive of sexual abuse. There is no evidence that Mr Lee demonstrated an escalation of sexual or violent behaviour. Mr Lee has always had stable employment and accommodation, most recently buying his own home and living with his parents. He enjoys positive family and social support and there is no evidence of mental health or substance abuse issues in his history. 
         
         
        Mr Lee indicated that he was willing to attend treatment although his denials have meant that he has been unable to access the CUBIT program while in prison. He stated that he remains willing to complete a community based program and both Dr Lennings and I are willing to see Mr Lee if he is granted parole.” 
        
       
      
    46 Ms Howell concluded her report as follows (page 7): 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Lee is a twenty-seven year old man who appeared co-operative with the interview process, demonstrating logical and coherent thought processes. While he continues to assert his innocence, he demonstrates an awareness of the impact on the direct victim as well as his family members. Mr Lee presents as a low risk for sexual and violent recidivism, however, has indicated a willingness to attend psychotherapy in relation to his behaviour with an accredited psychologist.  
         
         
        He does not have a history of mental health concerns, drug and alcohol problems, or antisocial behaviour. There is no evidence to suggest that Mr Lee is a violent man, has anti social peers or endorses anti social attitudes; in fact, Mr Lee appears to hold strongly developed pro-social attitudes and values. 
         
         
        He has been described as a model prisoner who has negotiated his time in prison without incident and holds a work position of responsibility. Mr Lee has developed realistic plans for the future and has good psychosocial support. 
         
         
        In my opinion Mr Lee demonstrates excellent prospects for rehabilitation. If he were granted parole it would allow for ongoing monitoring of his attitudes, behaviour and progress in the community.” 
        
       
      
    47 At a meeting on 21 July 2006, the SPA expressed its intention to refuse parole to the Applicant. In a notice directed to the Applicant, the SPA indicated that his case would be further considered at a hearing on 1 September 2006 at which the SPA would give particular consideration to his “need to address offending behaviour (sex offending)” (Exhibit 2, page 8). 
     
      
    48 On 2 August 2006, the Applicant lodged an application under s.155 CAS Act in this Court.  
     
      
    49 A supplementary pre-release report dated 18 August 2006 was prepared by Simon West, Probation and Parole Officer (Exhibit A, Tab 4). Mr West’s report supplemented the report of Ms Gallpen dated 22 June 2006. Mr West’s report contained no adverse comment with respect to the Applicant but noted (page 1): 
     
      
       
        
        “He continues to deny guilt and therefore remains ineligible for CUBIT.” 
        
       
      
    50 Mr West’s summary and recommendations, which were supported by Michele Jordan, Unit Leader/Manager, Long Bay Parole Unit, were in the following terms (page 2): 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Lee continues to deny his guilt and for this reason he remains illegible for Sex Offender Treatment programs in custody. An intensive program of this nature remains the most appropriate means of addressing his offending behaviour. There appear to be no significant changes in the inmate’s circumstances since Ms Gallpen’s report was submitted to the Authority on 22 June 2006 and consequently release to parole is not recommended.” 
        
       
      
    51 The SPA hearing scheduled for 1 September 2006 in fact proceeded on 22 September 2006. Mr Williams, solicitor, appeared for the Applicant. His Honour Judge Christie QC again presided as Chairperson of the SPA together with five members. 
     
      
    52 The Applicant gave evidence at the SPA hearing on 22 September 2006 (Exhibit A, Tab 3, pages 2-6). He told the SPA that he had consented to a referral for a custodial sex-offender’s programme and remained happy to undertake such treatment (page 4). The Applicant was asked by his solicitor about psychological examinations which had been undertaken on his behalf (pages 4-5): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Now you've seen a number of psychologists both within the prison system and also those that have been arranged by your legal representatives, is that correct? 
         
        A. That's right. 
         
         
        Q. You understand that Ms Howe  
        [sic] 
        , a clinical psychologist and your doctor, Chris Lennings, are prepared to provide treatment to you in the community if you are released to parole. Do you understand that? 
         
        A. Yes, I am happy to do that. 
         
         
        Q. You want that treatment, yes?  
         
        A. Yes, I would like that treatment. 
         
         
        Q. Do you think you would benefit from that form of treatment? 
         
        A. Yes, I would benefit from that treatment. 
         
         
        Q. How do you say you might benefit from that treatment? 
         
        A. I believe I will get new skills to avoid getting into any trouble in the future and also I will be able to discuss any problems that I might have in life with Ms Howe. 
         
         
        Q. You understand that parole is a form of conditional liberty, don't you? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. You understand that if you are released to parole, in effect, you will still be serving a sentence but in the community. Do you understand that? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. You understand that parole is a privilege not a right?  
         
        A. That's correct.” 
        
       
      
    53 The Applicant’s solicitor called Ms Howell to give evidence (pages 7-11). Ms Howell confirmed that she was prepared to undertake treatment of the Applicant in the community on a one-to-one basis and that, in her opinion, he would benefit from it (page 7.35). Ms Howell disagreed with the statement attributed to her in Ms Gallpen’s report of 22 June 2006 that she had indicated that community intervention would be pointless whilst the Applicant remains in denial. Ms Howell observed (T8.14): 
     
      
       
        
        “The current research is showing us that for those people who attend, participate and complete treatment there’s no difference in the outcome of reoffending risk between those who enter treatment admitting their offences and those who enter a treatment denying their offences, and that’s the research that’s coming from Canada currently.” 
        
       
       
      Ms Howell explained that the Canadian research emanated from Government programmes run in the Canadian federal prison system, in which Carl Hanson is the leading researcher. Mr Hanson is the author of the Static-99 risk-assessment instrument and Ms Howell had undertaken training with Mr Hanson in Canada (page 8). Ms Howell stated that Mr Hanson was the co-author of the SONAR instrument, a dynamic risk-assessment instrument (pages 8-9). 
       
      
    54 Ms Howell was asked concerning her psychological assessment of the Applicant (T9.7): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You did a full psychological assessment of Mr Lee?  
         
        A. Yes, I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. On the basis of that assessment, taking into account both the static factors and the dynamic factors, what is your opinion in relation to the risk of Mr Lee reoffending? 
         
        A. I believe Mr Lee's risk of future reoffending to be low. Mr Lee has very good social, pro-social attitudes, pro-social skills, he is a man who's had ongoing employment, he's had stable life experiences, he's been in a stable relationship, he's had stable family relationships, positive relationships. These are the factors that - he doesn't have any of the risk factors that are associated more acutely with recidivism. 
         
         
        Q. Just in relation to any different  
        [sic]  
        between group therapy and the treatment that you're proposing, one on one therapy, are you aware of any research in that regard? 
         
        A. I work as a private practitioner so all of my work is individual work. There has been a long held belief that group work is the best form of treatment but there's some controversy around that, there is no definitive research that says that group therapy produces better outcomes in terms of treatment outcomes. The reality is that group treatment is most cost effective and most easily provided in institutional settings and I think that that has a lot to do with why it's provided in institutional settings. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That's to some extent, an economy of scale issue, you believe?  
         
        A. It is an economy of scale issue, yes.” 
        
       
      
    55 The Applicant’s solicitor asked Ms Howell about the relevance of denial to treatment (page 10.41): 
     
      
       
        
        “WILLIAMS: Q. Do you believe it's pointless to treat people who are in denial? 
         
        A. No, I don't, and the research is showing us that it is a treatment issue, it - look, it's harder to treat people who deny the whole offence because it's often - you need to build a relationship that allows you to at least get to some aspects of it. In Mr Lee's case, there are parts of the offence that Mr Lee is quite open about, having made bad decisions, inappropriate decisions, and that's a starting point for treatment. 
         
         
        Q. Is it your position that the remarks that have been drawn to your attention by one of the members of the Authority in Ms Galpin's  
        [sic]  
        report accurately reflect your position? 
         
        A. No, they don't reflect my position at all. 
         
         
        Q. Do you believe there's been some misunderstanding between your self and Ms Galpin  
        [sic]  
        in that regard? 
         
        A. Yes, because we have had discussions and certainly we have had tense discussions around denial but, as I say, most of the people that are referred to me come with some elements of denial.” 
        
       
      
    56 Mr West gave evidence at the SPA hearing (pages 12-13). He was asked by an SPA member (not the Chairperson) (page 12.24): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Mr West, you’ve read Dr Lennings report? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Mr Smith’s report? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’re an experienced parole officer, you say that custodial based treatments are a preferred option? 
         
        A. Is the preferred option, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why? 
         
        A. Well because it’s more intensive in my opinion. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes, but medium/low risk persons? 
         
        A. I would still say that it would be preferable if he could go through some treatment process before his release. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why is the treatment process in gaol preferable to that on the outside offered by either a practitioner or by the department? 
         
        A. Well I suppose because it ..  
        [not transcribable] 
         .. the person to deal with issues before they’re back in the community and I think there’s some value in that occurring. I think the difficulty is that once a persons  
        [sic] 
         is released there’s a possibility of not cooperating with the treatment process because they’re then out and about and there’s no need to really make fundamental changes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But people assessed as low risk are able to do forensic psychology services treatment in the community? 
         
        A. Yes, they are.” 
          
        
       
      
    57 The Applicant’s solicitor asked Mr West the following questions (page 13.11): 
     
      
       
        
        “WILLIAMS: Q. Mr West, as an experience  
        [sic] 
         probation officer are you aware of the criteria for the custodial-based sex offender programs? 
         
        A. I am, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And I think as has been alluded to, it is not considered appropriate for an offender who is assessed as low risk to undertake a custodial-based program, is that correct. It’s part of the criteria? 
         
        A. To be honest I couldn't answer that absolutely. I don’t believe that Mr Lee has been excluded for that reason, he was excluded because he was in denial and ... not transcribable) .. having read the document in relation to his case it’s the reason that he was not admitted to the CUBIT program. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But certainly on a Static 99 assessment you’re aware that he’s assessed as medium/low risk, correct? 
         
        A. Medium/low, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’ve read the reports of Dr Lennings, you’ve indicated that, Ms Howe, Mr Smith. Do you accept their opinion that when you take into account other factors, in particular, dynamic factors, he is low risk? 
         
        A. Well I accept that he’s been assessed as medium to low risk, I can’t go very much farther than that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’re not a psychologist or psychiatrist, I take it? 
         
        A. No, I’m not. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You would defer to the opinions of the expert clinicians in that regard? 
         
        A. I accept that they’ve made an assessment but I can’t say anything more than that they’ve made an assessment, I’ve read their assessments. Their assessments seem competent, I don’t …  
        [not transcribable] 
         .. that.” 
        
       
      
    58 After submissions from the Applicant’s solicitor, the SPA members retired for a short time to consider their decision. Upon resumption, the Chairperson said (page 15.30): 
     
      
       
        
        “CHAIRPERSON: Mr Lee, the Authority have considered the contents of the numerous reports contained within your parole authority file, we’ve considered the submission made on your behalf and the evidence you’ve given here today. We have considered the competing views insofar as they are competing, from the professional persons who have provided various reports. We’ve obviously considered in depth the evidence given here this morning and we have obviously considered the contents of all the Probation and Parole reports. 
        
       
       
        
        Having considered all of those matters, the Authority retains concerns as to the possible treatment of yourself in the community as distinct from the custodial setting and the Authority has reached the view that parole ought be refused for the reasons that were stated on 21 July 2006. That reason being, the single reason, that there was a need for you to address your offending behaviour involving the sexual offending. That would normally lead to your eligibility to be again considered for parole would again arise in September 2007 and for that purpose you would normally be considered for parole about 60 days beforehand, in July of 2007. 
        
       
       
        
        The Authority, however, are of the view that the Authority’s determination and consideration of this particularly troublesome situation would be assisted with further information concerning available treatment and supervisions in the community and in reaching that decision the Authority relies upon section 219A of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulations which deal with the circumstances constituting manifest injustice. The Authority on this particular occasion invokes sub section (f) of those particular regulations. So the Authority is of the view that this is a situation where the Parole Authority has refused to grant parole because information on material reasonably required by the Authority to consider whether the offender should be released on parole is not presently available due to circumstances beyond your control and that information or material we feel may subsequently become available certainly before the anniversary of your non parole period in September of next year. 
        
       
       
        
        Consequently, the formal order of the Authority will be that parole is refused for the reason stated, 21 July 2006, but the matter is stood over for parole consideration to 2 February 2007. As I say, in standing it over to that date the Parole Authority invokes the section I have already quoted, 219A, sub section (f). The Authority in the meantime will seek a probation and parole report regarding the available treatment and supervisions of yourself in the community should you be released including a structured post release plan. Mr Lee, your possible release to parole will obviously be considered by the Authority at a private meeting on 2 February 2007. You will not be required to attend that meeting and the outcome of that meeting will be made known to you shortly thereafter. 
        
       
       
        
        INMATE: Excuse me, your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        CHAIRPERSON: Q. Yes, Mr Lee, what is it? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Your Honour, I accept that the Board has refused my parole but I just want to say one thing to the members, to you and to the members. If you would give me an opportunity? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It just depends what it is you want to say, sir? 
        
       
       
        
        A. If ..  
        [not transcribable] 
         .. Attorney General’s report  
        [sic - should read Auditor General’s report]  
        dated May 2006, page 27 state, “Department of Correction Service does not have program for people pleading not guilty, only pleading their innocence, and in that classification ..

And many people say to me, use the system, tell them that you’re guilty even if you’re not guilty and do the program and go home but I choose to tell the court the truth and by saying that I end up refusing parole by you guys. 
        
       
       
        
        CHAIRPERSON: We understand your feelings. If you knock on the door of the studio now they will let you out of the studio.” 
        
       
       
      Relevance to the Grant or Refusal of Parole of a Sex Offender’s Denial of Guilt and Rejection of Entry into a Custodial-Treatment Programme 
       
      
    59 Until the Applicant was convicted by the jury, he was presumed innocent of each of the three crimes with which he was charged. He was convicted of one offence and acquitted on the other two counts. Where guilt is established to the criminal standard, public policy suggests that so long as the conviction stands, the facts necessarily established ought to be regarded as proved for the purpose of any civil proceedings: Zaidi v Health Care Complaints Commission (1998) 44 NSWLR 82 at 86E-F. This is all the more so with respect to parole decisions, where the civil standard applies (s.135(1) CAS Act) and where the decision to be made arises out of the criminal proceedings which have resulted in conviction. The decision to grant or refuse parole arises from the sentencing decision made after conviction.  
     
      
    60 At the sentencing stage, a person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to plead not guilty, and defend himself or herself, without thereby attracting the risk of the imposition of a penalty more serious than would otherwise have been imposed: Siganto v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 656 at 663 [22]. 
     
      
    61 In determining whether parole ought be granted under s.135 CAS Act, the SPA is not determining whether an offender should be punished or further punished for his or her offence. It is the sentencing court which has imposed punishment having regard, inter alia, to the purposes of sentencing in s.3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. See DCU at [12]-[14] extracted at paragraph 15 of this judgment. 
     
      
    62 In DCU, I recounted (at [47]-[50]) a number of propositions which are relevant to the question of parole where an offender denies his or her guilt: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Firstly 
        , the parole authority starts from the premise that the offender is guilty. It is not for the parole authority to seek to go behind the conviction in some way or to examine the trial process to assess the strength of the Crown case or to review the correctness of the verdict:  
        Mott v Queensland Community Corrections Board 
         (1995) 2 QdR 261 at 269-270 (Fitzgerald P);  
        R v Secretary of State for Home Department; Ex parte Lillycrop 
         [1996] EWHC Admin 281 at paragraph 15;  
        R v Secretary of State for Home Department; Ex parte Hepworth 
         [1997] EWHC Admin 324 at paragraphs 45-46. 
        
       
       
        
        Secondly 
        , it would be erroneous to refuse parole  
        solely 
         because of a denial of guilt by the offender and a refusal or inability to undertake a custodial treatment program:  
        Mott 
         at 271, 275;  
        Lillycrop 
         at paragraphs 12, 18;  
        Hepworth 
         at paragraphs 45, 47;  
        Walker v Corrective Services Commission (Qld) 
         (1999) 104 A Crim R 127 at 134 [16] (refusal of remissions);  
        Varney v Parole Board 
         (WA) (2000) 23 WAR 187 at 205 [57], 209 [79] (Ipp J). 
        
       
       
        
        In  
        Varney 
        , Malcolm CJ (at 190 [3]) and Ipp J (at 204-205 [55]-[56]) observed that there might be many reasons why a prisoner would not accept his guilt. These include an unwillingness to accept that he had lied in the past, an unwillingness to confront loss of face in accepting what has previously been denied and the possibility that the prisoner had been wrongly convicted. In  
        Galli v NSW State Parole Authority 
         [2006] NSWSC 206, Adams J observed at paragraph 18 that there are a number of reasons why people do not admit their offences and amongst the strongest of those reasons is shame.  
        
       
       
        
        Thirdly 
        , although a decision to refuse parole based solely upon the offender’s denial of guilt and refusal or inability to enter a rehabilitation program would be erroneous, these matters remain relevant to the decision whether to grant or refuse parole:  
        Mott 
         at 269-270 (Fitzgerald P), 271-272 (Davies JA), 275-276 (McPherson JA);  
        Varney 
         at 208 [71] (Ipp J).” 
        
       
      
    63 At [51]-[53] in DCU, I recounted statements in a number of authorities as to the way in which a sex offender’s denial of guilt, and consequent unsuitability for participation in a sex-offender’s programme, was relevant to a parole decision. A parole authority is entitled to take into account that a prisoner’s successful completion of a sex offender’s programme, denied to him by his denial, would have been a factor in his favour, but that the absence of this factor is relevant to a parole determination: Mott v Queensland Community Corrections Board (1995) 2 QdR 261 at 271. A prisoner’s denial of guilt has been said to be relevant to a parole decision, in that it denies him the opportunity of participating in a programme, successful completion of which may well have enhanced his case for parole: Mott at 272. A prisoner’s refusal to acknowledge guilt may be regarded, in some circumstances, as a relevant consideration in assessing an application for parole. It may be a factor relevant to the process of rehabilitation - an offender who has come to terms with his guilt, and is genuinely remorseful about it, would ordinarily be a more suitable candidate for parole than one who refuses to do so: Mott at 275-276. A parole authority is entitled to have regard to a prisoner’s denial of guilt, and non-participation in a sex-offender’s treatment programme, as being factors tending to render him unsuitable for parole: Varney v Parole Board (WA) (2000) 23 WAR 187 at 208. 
     
      
    64 In DCU, I said (at [66]-[67]): 
     
      
       
        
        “During the course of the hearing, I raised with counsel the fact that a similar issue has been considered in a different statutory context and for a different purpose. Where a medical practitioner has been deregistered for professional misconduct involving sexual misconduct with patients which was denied by the practitioner, the question of the practitioner’s approach to the misconduct is relevant if an application is made for re-registration at a later time. The function being undertaken by the Medical Tribunal in this respect is primarily for the protection of the public:  
        Health Care Complaints Commission v Litchfield 
         (1997) 41 NSWLR 630 at 637. A medical practitioner who has been deregistered because of proven misconduct is not required to confess before he is reinstated. However, continuing vigorous challenge to clearly established guilt may be indicative of continuing unfitness:  
        Zaidi v Health Care Complaints Commission 
         (1998) 44 NSWLR 82 at 100. 
         
         
        The  
        Zaidi 
         principle is broadly consistent with the approach taken in parole cases in other jurisdictions referred to above. An offender’s continuing denial of guilt ought not operate as an automatic disqualifying factor with respect to parole. Nevertheless, it is relevant to the parole decision. Likewise, a refusal to apply for entry to a custodial sex offender’s program is relevant to the parole decision. It is necessary, however, that the SPA consider all the circumstances of the case, including these features, in determining whether parole will be granted or refused.” 
        
       
       
      Encouraging Offenders to Admit Guilt and Acknowledge Wrongdoing 
       
       
      Some General Observations 
       
      
    65 It has been observed that there may be many reasons why a person pleads guilty to a criminal charge in the first place. In Meissner v The Queen (1994-1995) 184 CLR 132, Dawson J said at 157: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is true that a person may plead guilty upon grounds which extend beyond that person's belief in his guilt. He may do so for all manner of reasons: for example, to avoid worry, inconvenience or expense; to avoid publicity; to protect his family or friends; or in the hope of obtaining a more lenient sentence than he would if convicted after a plea of not guilty. The entry of a plea of guilty upon grounds such as these nevertheless constitutes an admission of all the elements of the offence and a conviction entered upon the basis of such a plea will not be set aside on appeal unless it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.” 
        
       
       
      See also  
      Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions  
      (2005) 155 A Crim R 37 at 45-46.  
       
      
    66 For the same pragmatic motives referred to by Dawson J in Meissner, a convicted offender may admit guilt, or reduce his level of denial, with respect to a sex offence for the practical purpose of entering a programme to obtain parole release. No doubt, those to whom the responsibility is given to assess prisoners in the custodial setting, and to make parole decisions under the CAS Act, will be alive to considerations of this type. 
     
      
    67 In Suresh v The Queen (1998) 72 ALJR 769, Kirby J criticised the approach whereby an offender would be denied parole because of refusal of entry to a sex-offender’s treatment programme resulting from denial of guilt. Kirby J said at 781 [61]: 
     
      
       
        
        “At least where appellate proceedings are outstanding, it may be hoped that some means will be found to relieve prisoners of the obligation to make such an admission, assuming it is indeed required and, if it is, that it is lawful. Enforced admissions of guilt, as the effective price of liberty, are not normally a feature of criminal justice in Australia. Whilst an acknowledgment of wrongdoing and the undertaking of such courses may be useful in particular cases, the extraction of admissions by the prospect of early release from custody will often lack integrity and may affront the dignity of the conscience even of a convicted person

    68 In McCallum v Parole Board, Smart AJ (Hidden and Greg James JJ agreeing) said at [30]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It would be undesirable for an offender, in order to obtain parole, to follow the counselling course and appear to be doing what the counsellor or other specialist deems necessary when not in truth ascribing to it and believing it to be unnecessary. That would compromise any integrity which remains in the offender.” 
        
       
      
    69 Research in the field has pointed to the role of therapeutic jurisprudence with respect to corrections-based sex-offender treatment programmes: D Lievore, “Recidivism of Sexual Assault Offenders: Rates, Risk Factors and Treatment Efficacy”, Australian Institute of Criminology, 2004. Lievore points to the fact that the law can have both therapeutic and unintended anti-therapeutic consequences (at 75): 
     
      
       
        
        “On the one hand, legal procedures may facilitate rehabilitation through effective interventions and may mitigate harsh sanctions, such as prolonged incarceration, through justifying extended community supervision. On the other hand, the law may contribute to psychological dysfunction. For example, labelling of convicted sex offenders can become self-fulfilling prophecies as offenders come to see themselves as unable to change or to take responsibility for their actions. In addition, sex offender treatment that is mandated by a parole board may be anti-therapeutic because it becomes part of the punishment and because denial of choice can produce dissonance, conflict and ambivalence. Alternatively, treatment may be undertaken to accrue favourable parole outcomes. In both cases offenders may simply satisfy the requirements of the program without going through real change (Birgden & Vincent 2000; Glaser 2003).” 
        
       
      
    70 In the course of an overview of sex-offender treatment programmes throughout Australia, Lievore observed (at 80-81): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Voluntary Participation 
         
         
        Participation in sex offender treatment programs is open to all eligible offenders. Treatment is voluntary in most jurisdictions and requires the prisoner’s informed consent. Parole boards in some jurisdictions can insist on treatment, although informed consent is still desirable. Refusal to participate is taken into consideration when determining parole, and release authorities take a favourable view of program completion. While this coercive approach conflicts with the motivational approach of therapeutic staff and may have an anti-therapeutic effect, the harm inflicted by sexual assault is considered to justify mandated intervention. In reality, many prisoners participate for the extrinsic motivation of obtaining parole, so the criterion of voluntariness is often not met. While it is assumed that offenders are likely to be more receptive to interventions when they participate through choice, group therapy aims to increase the offender’s intrinsic motivation to stay in the program and avoid relapse. One meta-analysis found little difference in recidivism rates between prisoners undergoing mandated (10 per cent) and voluntary (12 per cent) treatment (Birgden & Vincent 2000). 
         
         
        Eligibility Criteria 
         
         
        To be accepted into a program offenders must have a recent history of behavioural stability. Prisoners are usually excluded if they deny the offence, have psychiatric diagnoses or below-functional intelligence, although Western Australia provides programs for intellectually disabled offenders. Inmates may be dismissed from programs if they fail to acknowledge and take responsibility for the offending behaviour, breach group confidentiality, or display aggressive or violent behaviour towards staff or other offenders. Participation is scheduled just prior to the end of the sentence to ensure maximum therapeutic effects on release, but the remaining sentence length must be sufficient to allow completion of the program.” 
        
       
       
      The Applicant’s Denial of Guilt 
       
      
    71 The evidence before the SPA in this case points to the Applicant’s denial of guilt as being the essential stumbling block to a grant of parole. As was made clear at the SPA hearing on 22 September 2006, all other aspects concerning the Applicant were favourable to a grant of parole. The one area which led to refusal of parole was his failure to undertake a custodial sex-offender’s programme which, in turn, was the product of his continuing denial of guilt with respect to the offence of which he was convicted. 
     
      
    72 The Applicant submitted, with some justification, that his case could be distinguished from DCU. In DCU, the Applicant was a repeat sex offender who refused to apply for entry to a custodial sex-offender’s programme. The present Applicant was sentenced for a single serious sex offence and was willing to undertake a custodial sex-offender’s programme. His denial, or level of denial, was such that he was refused admission to the custodial programme. 73 It is apparent that the SPA adopted the approach, at least up to 22 September 2006, that it was not prepared to grant the Applicant parole without him undertaking a custodial sex-offender’s programme. To do this, it is a prerequisite that the Applicant admit his guilt or, at least, demonstrate a less-active or less-adamant denial.  
     
      
    74 During the course of submissions by counsel for the SPA at the present hearing, I observed that there appeared to be a significant level of subjectivity in an assessment by relevant custodial personnel involving classification of persons who demonstrate an active, categorical or strong denial (leading to refusal of entry to a programme) or a lesser form of denial (which may possibly leave the door open to entry to a programme).  
     
      
    75 As Dr Lennings observed in his report, the position adopted by the Applicant is contra-intuitive. If the Applicant, in some way, reduces the level of his denial to a point where he is accepted into the custodial sex-offender’s programme, the pathway to release on parole may be open to him. This, of course, represents a form of inducement to a sex offender to acknowledge guilt or reduce the level of denial, even if that view is not genuinely held by the offender.  
     
      
    76 The evidence before the SPA, at its July and September 2006 meetings concerning the present Applicant, included a significant body of reputable psychological evidence, including oral evidence, explaining the process of risk assessment and the use of static and dynamic factors. That evidence also extended to the relevance of denial of guilt to risk assessment. Of course, the SPA would be well aware of the criteria for admission into custodial sex-offender programmes. On the evidence before the SPA concerning this Applicant, it appears that there is debate in the psychological community concerning the relevance of denial to risk assessment. It appears that the SPA has adopted the approach that treatment in the custodial setting was most important and, as a result, denial of guilt (of a particular level) was an important consideration given that it barred a prisoner from admission to a custodial treatment programme. 
     
      
    77 At the hearing before me, counsel for the SPA indicated that there were significant resource issues involved. Custodial sex-offender programmes, including CUBIT and CORE, involve group-counselling sessions. It was indicated that the involvement of a prisoner or prisoners who denied guilt would undermine the group-counselling process. It was indicated further, that resources within the prison system could not extend to the provision of one-on-one counselling of the type which may be appropriate to a sex offender who denied guilt. In effect, the type of treatment or counselling which Dr Lennings or Ms Howell could provide in the community was not available in the prison setting for resource reasons. I was informed that this approach contributed to the criteria for admission to the CUBIT and CORE programmes. 
     
      
    78 On the present application, the Applicant relied upon the Auditor General’s report by way of a performance audit of prisoner rehabilitation within the Department of Corrective Services (May 2006) (Exhibit 1, page 46). This appears to be the report to which the Applicant made mention at the end of the SPA hearing on 22 September 2006. In that report, the Auditor General stated (Exhibit 1, page 73 - page 27 of report): 
     
      
       
        
        “The department has projects under way to improve access to programs. For example, it will be developing a program for sex offenders who deny any wrongdoing.” 
        
       
      
    79 Accordingly, it appears that the issues involved in Galli, DCU and the present case may, at some time in the future, be remedied by the availability of any appropriate custodial programme for sex offenders who deny guilt. Such a programme, however, does not exist at present. 
     
      
    80 In DCU, I acknowledged (at [68]) that it was understandable that the SPA would regard a custodial treatment programme as being the primary method of assessing sex offenders in the interests of reducing the risk of re-offending and promoting rehabilitation, and that a refusal by an offender to apply to enter such a programme is a factor which the SPA is able to take into account. I acknowledged also (at [74]) the breadth of factors which the SPA may take into account under s.135 CAS Act. Following a reference to the second reading speech with respect to the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Amendment (Parole) Bill 2004 (at [75]), I observed (at [76]) that the observations of the Minister in that second reading speech tended to confirm the relevance of factors such as an offender’s willingness to undertake a custodial sex-offender’s programme to the exercise of the SPA’s statutory functions. 
     
      
    81 The present Applicant has been willing to undertake a custodial sex-offender’s programme since he applied for entry to such a programme on 11 October 2004. Because he was “actively denying” the sexual offence for which he had been convicted, he was refused entry to such a programme on 6 December 2004. 
     
      
       
      The Applicant’s s.155 Grounds 
       
      
    82 The Applicant has sought to bring himself within s.155(1) CAS Act in a number of ways. To succeed in the present application, it is necessary for the Applicant to demonstrate that the decision of the SPA was made on the basis of false, misleading or irrelevant information. The submissions made by the Applicant in this respect include the following: 
     
      
       
      (a) a denial of guilt for the crime for which he was convicted is a false basis for the SPA’s determination not to release him on parole; 
       
       
      (b) the Applicant’s inability to complete a custodial sex-offenders programme due to his denial of guilt involves reliance by the SPA upon false, misleading or irrelevant information; 
       
       
      (c) the report of Ms Gallpen on 22 June 2006 referred to a risk assessment concerning a  
      “Mr Thomas” 
       and that this is not the Applicant - this involves reliance upon false, misleading or irrelevant information; 
       
       
      (d) the risk assessment of the Applicant upon which Ms Gallpen, Mr West and the SPA relied is confusing with, in some places, an indication of a  
      “low” 
       risk assessment and, in other places, a  
      “low to medium” 
       risk assessment - the requirement to undertake a custodial treatment programme does not apply to low-risk inmates - the SPA has relied upon false, misleading or irrelevant information in this respect; 
       
       
      (e) the SPA failed to have regard, or proper regard, to the substantial body of expert psychological evidence before it, in documentary and oral form, pointing to the limited relevance of denial of guilt to risk assessment - such an approach was said to involve reliance upon false, misleading or irrelevant information; 
       
       
      (f) the SPA failed to have regard, or proper regard, to the substantial body of expert psychological evidence from Dr Lennings, Ms Howell and Mr Smith indicating a satisfactory proposal for post-release treatment and counselling in the community in a manner which adequately addressed the risk of re-offending. 
       
      
    83 The material relied upon by the Applicant, and the arguments advanced by him, pointed ultimately to one or other of the arguments listed above in support of his claim for intervention by the Court under s.155 CAS Act. Of course, these grounds and submissions are overlapping. I will approach these matters as the Applicant’s grounds for relief.  
     
      
    84 In approaching the Applicant’s grounds, it is necessary, once again, to keep in mind the limited nature of the Court’s function under s.155 CAS Act. 85 With respect to Ground (a), I am not satisfied that the SPA has taken into account false, misleading or irrelevant information in having regard to the Applicant’s denial of guilt in considering whether to grant parole. It is clear that denial of guilt is capable of being relevant, directly or indirectly, to the assessment of the grant of parole: Mott; Varney; DCU. It is not clear to me that Adams J in Galli expressed a contrary view. If, however, that view is open on his Honour’s judgment I would, with respect, disagree with it. It appears that his Honour’s attention was not drawn to cases such as Mott and Varney. 
     
      
    86 It is apparent from the evidence before the SPA in this case that there is a dispute, and perhaps a sharp dispute, between psychologists concerning the significance of denial of guilt to risk assessment. I am not satisfied, however, that the Applicant has demonstrated a basis for a direction under s.155 CAS Act with respect to the manner in which the SPA had regard to his denial of guilt in its decision to refuse parole. 
     
      
    87 With respect to Ground (b), I am not satisfied that the SPA’s reliance upon the Applicant’s inability (because of his denial) to undertake a custodial sex-offender’s programme involved reliance by the SPA upon false, misleading or irrelevant information. The SPA was aware of the controversy concerning the significance to risk assessment of denial, and thus to its impact upon treatment, by way of the body of evidence before it including the reports (and oral evidence) of Dr Lennings, Ms Howell and Mr Smith. At least one member of the SPA asked questions of Ms Howell at the hearing on 22 September 2006 concerning issues related to this topic. It is for the SPA to exercise its statutory function under s.135(1) CAS Act, and to have regard to the broad range of factors relevant to that decision set out in s.135(2) and s.135A CAS Act.  
     
      
    88 As will be apparent from cases in other jurisdictions, including Queensland, Western Australia and the United Kingdom, the issues raised in this case, and in Galli and DCU, are not confined to this State.  
     
      
    89 With respect to Ground (c), it is correct that the report of Ms Gallpen of 22 June 2006 referred to a risk assessment of a “Mr Thomas”. No explanation has been proffered for this reference in the report, which otherwise relates to the Applicant. What is clear, however, is that no issue was taken concerning this matter at the SPA hearing on 22 September 2006 at which the Applicant was legally represented. It seems clear that all the participants at that hearing, including members of the SPA, the Applicant, his solicitor and the witnesses called, approached the matter upon the basis that the reference to “Mr Thomas” in this report was a typographical error and that the statement made by Ms Gallpen related to the Applicant. 
     
      
    90 Although it might be said that this unexplained reference to “Mr Thomas” in the report concerning the Applicant may have a tendency to confuse or mislead, it seems clear that no one, including the SPA, was misled by this reference. I am not satisfied that this ground demonstrates that the SPA took into account false, misleading or irrelevant information in the parole decision concerning the Applicant. 
     
      
    91 With respect to Ground (d), it seems clear, on all the material before the SPA, that the Applicant was considered to be a medium-to-low risk of re-offending. 
     
      
    92 As I understand it, CUBIT is aimed at offenders assessed as having medium-high or high-risk needs whilst CORE is aimed at offenders who fall in the medium-low range. It should be borne in mind that the various assessments of the Applicant by custodial personnel placed him no higher than the medium-low range of risk of re-offending. Upon the basis of the departmental criteria, it appears that the Applicant would be an appropriate candidate for CORE, and not CUBIT. It is not at all clear, on the material which was before the SPA, that this distinction was borne in mind. The pre-release report of Ms Gallpen, and the supplementary pre-release report of Mr West speak of the Applicant’s ineligibility for entry into the CUBIT programme. No reference is made to CORE. Prima facie, given his risk assessment, the Applicant would not be expected to enter CUBIT. It was the CORE programme which appeared to be appropriate, given his medium-low risk assessment. 
     
      
    93 The difficulty for the Applicant is that, according to Mr Bright’s assessment of 6 December 2004, the Applicant was unsuitable for entry into either the CUBIT or the CORE programmes because he was “actively denying” his offence. Taking a broader approach, it might be said that the SPA required the Applicant to undertake a custodial sex-offender’s programme (either CUBIT or CORE), but that the Applicant was rejected for both given his “active denial” of the offence. 
     
      
    94 Given the serious consequences that flow from the process of risk assessment and rejection of an application for entry to a custodial sex-offender’s programme, it might be thought that a level of clarity and precision is to be expected in the assessment process. The serious consequences flowing from this process include the prospects that an offender will not be released at all on parole and will be required to serve his entire sentence. It is evident that this has serious consequences for the offender. However, there are potential serious consequences for the general community as well. A prisoner who is detained for his entire sentence without participation in a custodial sex-offender’s programme will be released, without supervision, into the community at the completion of the sentence. The absence of an adequate period of supervision may limit the ability of an offender to integrate back into society: McCallum v Parole Board at [31]. The Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006, for good reason, is confined in its operation and will not apply to most offenders serving sentences for sex offences: Attorney General for NSW v Gallagher [2006] NSWSC 340 at [20]ff. Further, there is the financial cost to the community of extended full-time detention of prisoners until the completion of their entire sentences. 
     
      
    95 In making these observations, I am not expressing a view as to the desirability or otherwise of these consequences. The point of these observations is that the consequences for the offender and the community are such that an element of accuracy, clarity and precision in the assessment process is more than highly desirable. The SPA is required to consider whether it is satisfied that the release of an offender on parole is appropriate in the public interest: s.135(1) CAS Act. The various factors to which I have referred are capable of bearing upon the “public interest” in this context.  
     
      
    96 That said, I am not satisfied that the Applicant has established in this case that the SPA has acted upon false, misleading or irrelevant information with respect to his risk assessment. 
     
      
    97 With respect to Ground (e), it is clear that the SPA had a significant body of evidence before it with respect to the relevance of denial of guilt to risk assessment of sex offenders. It was for the SPA to form its own conclusions with respect to that and other issues which bear upon the decision, in the public interest, whether the Applicant should be released to parole under s.135(1) CAS Act. I am not satisfied that the Applicant has established that the SPA acted on false, misleading or irrelevant information in this respect. 
     
      
    98 With respect to Ground (f), this argument essentially goes to the weight which the SPA gave to evidence adduced by the Applicant in support of his claim for a grant of parole. As I have mentioned above, it is clear that the function of this Court under s.155 CAS Act does not extend to a merits review, rehearing or assessment of the weight which the SPA gave, or should have given, to particular factors and evidence. I am not satisfied that the Applicant has demonstrated that the SPA acted upon false, misleading or irrelevant information in this respect. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    99 I have given careful consideration to the arguments advanced by the Applicant in this case. His position is different to that of DCU in that he is not a repeat sex offender, and he has not refused to apply for entry to a custodial sex-offender’s programme. He applied for entry to a custodial sex-offender’s programme, but his application for entry was refused. 
     
      
    100 Following the orders made on 22 September 2006, the SPA will again consider the Applicant’s case in February 2007. It is, of course, a matter for the SPA to determine whether the Applicant ought be granted parole. It is the obligation of the SPA to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, in exercising its statutory function under ss.135 and 135A CAS Act.  
     
      
    101 In DCU, I rejected an argument (at [72]-[76]) that, by reference to Green v Daniels (1977) 51 ALJR 463, the SPA acted on false or misleading information by acting on a so-called blanket policy to refuse parole to sex offenders who had not undertaken the CUBIT programme. The refusal or inability of an offender to undertake such a programme, as a result of denial of guilt, is relevant to a parole decision in the sense explained in Mott and Varney. Taking this factor into account does not give rise to the SPA acting on false or misleading information for the purpose of s.155 CAS Act. Nevertheless, the decision-making function with respect to parole is not intended by the CAS Act to be an inflexible and dogmatic process. The SPA is required to exercise its statutory function by reference to the multitude of factors that bear upon the particular offender and his offence or offences: DCU at [67], [76]. 
     
      
    102 Before concluding this judgment, I must observe that there was a substantial body of expert psychological evidence before the SPA relating to this Applicant. The reports were prepared by reputable and experienced psychologists who had undertaken detailed assessments of the Applicant. The assessments had been undertaken upon the premise that the Applicant had committed the serious offence of which he was convicted. It is apparent that the SPA gave close consideration to the body of evidence before it on 22 September 2006. No doubt, it was for this reason that the Chairperson observed that, after “consideration of this particularly troublesome situation”, the provisions in s.137B CAS Act and clause 219A(1)(f) CAS Regulation ought be engaged to bring the Applicant’s case back before the SPA, at an earlier time than usual, in February 2007. It seems clear that there is substantial material which the SPA may take into account, in the exercise of its undoubted discretion to consider a grant of parole to this Applicant, in February 2007. 
     
      
    103 The Applicant has not established an entitlement to a direction under s.155 CAS Act. The application is dismissed.

    3 On 5 December 2005 the applicant pleaded guilty to the offence that he did assault a named victim (“A”), and at the time of the assault, he did commit an act of indecency upon her, in circumstances of aggravation, namely, she then being a person under the age of 16 years, namely, 13 years of age, contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 s 61M(1). The maximum penalty for such an offence is 7 years imprisonment. A standard non parole period of 5 years is applicable to the offence. 
     
      
    4 On 24 May 2006 the applicant was sentenced for that offence in the District Court to imprisonment for a non parole period of 9 months commencing on 24 May 2006 and expiring on 23 February 2007, with the overall term of imprisonment being 2 years and 9 months, 2 weeks and 4 days commencing on 24 May 2006 and expiring on 13 March 2009. 
     
      
    5 The applicant has sought leave to appeal against that sentence pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s 5(1)(c). The grounds of appeal are: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) The sentencing Judge erred in using inappropriate comparable cases to determine the range of sentence; 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The sentencing Judge erred in regarding herself as bound to impose a sentence of imprisonment; 
        
       
       
        
        (3) In all the circumstances the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
        
       
      
    6 The facts of the offence, as recounted by the sentencing Judge in her Remarks on Sentence were: 
     
      
       
        
        The victim, A, has known the offender through their mutual involvement with swimming since she was around 7 years old. 
        
       
       
        
        When A first started school swimming, the offender was a senior student swimming in the senior squad. A swam in the juniors at that time. 
        
       
       
        
        In January 2002, after leaving school, the offender obtained a position as a swimming coach at a swimming club. In January of the following year the offender was involved in coaching A, and he continued as her coach until around July 2003. A was one of twenty or so children aged between 8 and 14 who were trained by the offender. 
        
       
       
        
        On a day in May or June 2003, A was on the internet chatting on line with the offender. He made a number of suggestive comments to her in his messages. 
        
       
       
        
        The next day A attended swimming training where the offender was coaching her. A’s mother asked the offender to take A home after training. And so when training finished, the offender and A went to the offender’s car. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender drove off, but did not take A home immediately. He stopped at the carpark near a railway station, telling A he wanted to chat with her. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender then leaned towards the passenger seat from the driver’s seat, and kissed A on the mouth, inserting his tongue into her mouth, She pulled away, and asked him what he was doing. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender told A to relax, and began to touch her with his hand. The victim said “no”, but the offender continued. He moved his hand inside the victim’s jeans, and then underneath her underpants. He began to touch her genitals. When A again asked him what he was doing, he again told her to relax, that he was exploring. The offender took hold of A’s hand and placed it on his groin area. The offender continued to touch A’s genitals for some moments before stopping and removing his hand from underneath her clothing. 
        
       
       
        
        A told the offender she needed to go home and he said he would take her home. The offender then drove her to her home. As she was getting out of the car, he told her not to tell anyone, saying that if she did “things won’t work out”. A told the offender that he was her swimming coach and she didn’t want things to work out. 
        
       
       
        
        At the time of the incident A was aged just 13, and the offender was 19 years old. In late August 2003 A told her mother … what had happened and police were notified. 
        
       
       
      Ground One – The sentencing Judge erred in using inappropriate comparable cases to determine the range of sentence. 
       
      
    7 Her Honour in the course of her Remarks on Sentence reviewed 6 recent cases which her Honour’s researches had revealed. As the first 2 cases predated the commencement of the standard non parole period regime her Honour concluded they offered little or no guidance. The essence of the remaining 4 cases, as distilled by her Honour, was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) 70 year old gymnastics coach touched breasts of 13 year old girl and patted her buttocks on outside of clothing – guilty plea – 12 months imprisonment partially suspended; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) 44 year old male placed hands on outside of 13 year old girl’s clothing in area of her breasts and vagina, attempted to kiss her, prior similar offence – 4 years and 3 months imprisonment, non parole period 2 years and 9 months; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) 67 year old male exposed penis, forced 12 year old girl onto bed demanding she have sex with him – girl escaped – 5 years 2 months imprisonment, non parole period 3 years and then there was a reduction of the non parole period from the original sentence; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) natural father, whilst intoxicated, placed hand on vagina of his naked 9 year old daughter – plea of guilty – 3 years imprisonment non parole period 1 year 6 months. 
        
       
      
    8 The applicant submitted: 
     
      
       
        
        To establish a range that precluded a non custodial sentence by reference to these cases was to ignore the very considerable distinctions between them and the present case. Most importantly to regard them as comparable was to ignore the relatively narrow gap between the ages of the applicant and the complainant. 
        
       
      
    9 The applicant’s submissions assumed that her Honour by reference to those cases alone established a range that precluded a non custodial sentence.  
     
      
    10 Her Honour’s reference to the cases was immediately preceded by the following remarks: 
     
      
       
        
        Counsel on behalf of the offender submits that other than a custodial sentence is appropriate. The Crown says that a non custodial option is within range. I do not agree. The judicial commission statistics are of little assistance, a review of recent cases is of more assistance. 
        
       
      
    11 The reference to the cases was immediately followed by: 
     
      
       
        
        I have given consideration to all of those cases to which I have referred, and I have given consideration to the sentencing options available to me. I have also given consideration to the submissions made on behalf of the offender, and by the Crown. However, only a sentence of full time imprisonment will satisfy the requirements of general and specific deterrence. Had the matter proceeded to trial, I would have imposed a head sentence of 3 years and 6 months. 
        
       
      
    12 The matter is not completely clear but, in my opinion, the context is such as to lead me to conclude the consideration of the “comparable cases” was but one of the factors taken into account by her Honour in determining that a custodial sentence was appropriate in this case. Her Honour, in considering the matter, was mindful of the age difference as she specifically stated in her Remarks on Sentence that the applicant’s age lessened the objective seriousness of the offence and reduced what would otherwise have been a mid range offence into one at the lower end of mid range. In my opinion the applicant has failed to demonstrate error on this ground. 
     
      
       
      Ground Two - The sentencing Judge erred in regarding herself as bound to impose a sentence of imprisonment. 
       
      
    13 Her Honour, in her Remarks on Sentence, stated: 
     
      
       
        
        The absence of a prior criminal record, and the fact that an offence occurs spontaneously are often features of cases of sexual assault upon children by adults. A sentencing decision which does not involve a period of full time custody because of the existence of these factors, either individually or collectively, will stand for nothing. 
        
       
      
    14 The applicant in his written submissions argued: 
     
      
       
        
        It is difficult to interpret this statement as other than a proposition that in all cases of sexual assault by adults upon children a custodial sentence must be imposed. The statement ignores the vast range of circumstances – relative ages, degrees of “grooming” or pre mediation – that may be disclosed by the facts of an individual case. 
        
       
      
    15 Her Honour’s statement however, even when read in isolation, does no more than indicate that the absence of a prior criminal record and the fact the offence was spontaneous do not alone provide a reason why a full time custodial sentence should not be imposed. Her Honour explained why in the balance of that paragraph in that: 
     
      
       
        
        The fact that a person is of otherwise good character enables them to gain the position where they can gain exposure to children, and be in a position of authority over them. That is not to say that I find this offender was such a person. I refer to the principle because in a case such as this, prior good character carries very little weight. There is a much greater need for emphasis to be given to general deterrence in the sentencing exercise. 
        
       
      
    16 That her Honour was not advancing a proposition that in all cases of sexual assault by adults upon children a custodial sentence must be imposed is apparent when regard is had to her Honour’s comments elsewhere in the Remarks on Sentence where she refers to the state of the law prior to the implementation of the standard non parole regime as one in which this Court had declined to lay down any requirement that a custodial sentence should ordinarily be imposed in relation to the charge of indecent assault. Her Honour then referred to the standard non parole period regime as being the clearest indication that the Court should regard these offences as being objectively very serious but she did not conclude that the effect of that regime was to make a custodial sentence mandatory in all cases of sexual assault by adults upon children. As her Honour observed, the standard non parole period was not binding where the offender had pleaded guilty. I would not uphold this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground Three - In all the circumstances the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    17 In R v Allpass 72 A Crim R 561 at 563 the Court held: 
     
      
       
        
        A sentencing Judge, in determining what punishment to impose upon an individual who has broken the law, will often need to take into account a complex combination of facts and circumstances. The Judge must never lose sight of, or fail to give due weight to, the objective seriousness of the offence. On the other hand, the subjective characteristics of the offender will usually be of relevance, and sometimes of great relevance, in determining the appropriate punishment for the conduct in question. 
        
       
      
    18 As to the objective seriousness of the offence her Honour found: 
     
      
       
        
        This is not a situation where there was a brief touching of a young girl on the outside of her clothing, it was an unwelcome advance over quite some time, with many warnings to him that what he was doing was wrong. … He saw an opportunity and seized upon it to sexually assault this young girl. A young girl who looked up to him as her swimming coach, … at a time she had been entrusted into his care by her mother to deliver her home safely. … he knew full well what he did was wrong, and he knew full well if his actions were discovered, he would find himself in the very position he is in today, facing sentence for committing a very serious offence. … He is one of those offenders who having committed an offence, goes about his daily life not expecting his victim to come forward and complain, confident that he has been successful in his threat over her not to tell. Confident that his good character will stand him in good stead, oblivious to the harm he may have caused to his victim, either in the short or long term. Confident that the complainant will be too embarrassed, afraid or inhibited by feelings of guilt to complain. ,,, The offence for which he now faces sentence is one which clearly demonstrates a loss of control over his impulses. There can be no other explanation for his offending other than for his own gratification. It certainly cannot be attributed to a clouding of the mind by drugs or alcohol. 
        
       
      
    19 It may be added that A was born on 26 February 1990 and was thus at a very important developmental stage of her life. At that age a difference of 6 years between victim and offender is significant. However, in the absence of evidence, her Honour was unable to find that the emotional harm suffered was substantial. 
     
      
    20 As to subjective characteristics the applicant gave evidence at the sentencing hearing. In addition, a probation and parole service Pre Sentence Report and a psychologist’s report were tendered on his behalf. Evidence was also given by a family friend who spoke highly of him. Her Honour found: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) The applicant was born on 29 December 1983. He completed his Higher School Certificate and commenced a Bachelor of Science degree at University, but left after completing 12 months at the end of 2002.  
        
       
       
        
        (b) He was employed as a swimming coach. He had been a competitive swimmer himself since 13. He had volunteered at the Pan Pacific Swimming Championships and the Sydney Olympics. He is currently employed in the family engineering business. It was apparently his dream to become an Air Force pilot. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) He did not suffer from any psychological, pathological or personality disorder and could give no satisfactory explanation for his behaviour. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) He had no criminal record at the time of this offence but on 18 October 2004 he was fined for maliciously destroying or damaging property. 
        
       
       
        
        (e) He had demonstrated some remorse and contrition.  
        
       
       
        
        (f) The offence had not been planned.  
        
       
       
        
        (g) His prospects of rehabilitation were good and that he was unlikely to re-offend.  
        
       
       
        
        (h) His age lessened the objective seriousness of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        (i) As a result of the plea of guilty on the first day of the trial the applicant was entitled to a discount of 20 percent. 
        
       
      
    21 Her Honour took, as her starting point, a head sentence of 3 years and 6 months which she discounted by 20% to allow for the plea of guilty. She found special circumstances and significantly varied the statutory non parole period. In doing so she took into account the applicant’s youth, his prospects for rehabilitation, the fact that this is the first time he will find himself in custody and no doubt his time will be spent on protection. Her Honour fixed a non parole period of 9 months. 22 The applicant contended: 
     
      
       
        
        In terms of objective circumstances more weight should have been given to the relative ages of the applicant and the complainant, to the spontaneous nature of the offence and to the fact that it occurred in a location where the sexual activity was unlikely to have developed beyond what occurred. While it was open to find that there was a breach of trust and authority the circumstances here are a world away from the case of a mature and significantly older adult in the family, employment or school situation who breaches that trust. It was open to the sentencing Court to have imposed a non custodial sentence. Such a sentence would have been an appropriate disposition of the matter. 
        
       
      
    23 In Markarian v R (2005) 215 ALR 213 the High Court held at [27]: 
     
      
       
        
        The judgment is a discretionary judgment and, as the bases for appellate review revealed, what is required is that the sentencer must take into account all relevant considerations (and only relevant considerations) in forming the conclusion reached … As has now been pointed out more than once, there is no single correct sentence. And Judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies. 
        
       
      
    24 Her Honour took into account each of the subjective and mitigating factors. She gave such matters the weight which she considered appropriate. She closely considered whether a non custodial sentence was appropriate and concluded it was not. She found the applicant’s age lessened the objective seriousness of the offence and that had he been older she would have found it to be a mid range offence. 
     
      
    25 In my opinion the offence was serious in its nature and it was open to her Honour to impose a full time custodial sentence. It is not open to this Court to interfere with that decision.  
     
      
    26 How a particular sentence is to be quantified according to correct principle will always come down, ultimately, to that process of “instinctive synthesis” of which the relevant authorities speak: Markarian v R (2005) 215 ALR 213. In my opinion, that process, when applied to the given facts of the present case, suggests that the starting point taken by her Honour, of 3 years and 6 months discounted by 20%, yields a head sentence that is very severe. I have given anxious consideration to the question whether that head sentence can fairly be accepted as falling within the relevant range of sentence properly open to her Honour. I have concluded, but not without hesitation, that it can, albeit the sentence is, in my opinion, at the upper and outer limit of that range. 
     
      
    27 Even had I come to the contrary conclusion, the applicant would have faced great difficulty in challenging the non-parole period set by her Honour. The discounted head sentence set by her Honour would have entailed, absent a finding of special circumstances, a non-parole period in the order of 2 years. The finding of special circumstances by her Honour resulted in the setting of a non-parole period of about one-third of that term. I do not see any margin of possible adjustment of the discounted head sentence that would justify a reduction in a non-parole period of 9 months. 
     
      
    28 This is a Court of error. It does not interfere with the sentence imposed merely because it would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing Judge exercised his or her discretion. It interferes only if it be shown that the sentencing Judge was in error, and then only if it forms a positive opinion that some other, less severe, sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed – R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [79], Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s 6(3). 
     
      
    29 In my opinion error has not been established nor has it been established that some sentence, less severe, is warranted in law and should have been passed. Whilst I would grant leave to appeal I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    30 I propose the following orders:

      SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 27 March 2004, Michael Heatley (whom I shall refer to as the offender) beat and kicked to death a fellow inmate Craig Anthony Behr (the deceased). The attack occurred in a cell at Long Bay Prison Hospital. 
     
      
    2 The prisoner pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment. The psychiatric evidence disclosed an underlying chronic psychotic disorder, which, on the balance of probabilities, impaired the offender’s ability to control his urge to kill the deceased at the time of the offence. The Crown accepted the plea to the alternative charge of manslaughter in full satisfaction of the indictment for murder. 
     
      
    3 Manslaughter carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 The offender pleaded guilty, as well, to a charge of robbery with a dangerous weapon. This charge related to events, quite unconnected to the killing of the deceased. These events occurred on 15 March 2002. The offender, armed with a shortened firearm, held up employees at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and escaped with $18,705.00, the property of the bank. 
     
      
    5 This offence also carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    6 It will be convenient first to deal with the detail of the circumstances relating to the bank robbery. There are agreed facts and they are as follows. 
     
      
       
      Agreed Facts of Robbery 
       
      
    7 About 9.30am on Friday the 15th of March 2002 the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, located on the corner of Liverpool and Castlereagh Streets, Sydney, opened for trading. Approximately 8 people were standing outside the building waiting for the bank to open. In that group was the offender.  
     
      
    8 When the doors were unlocked and opened by a staff member of the bank, the offender pushed past another customer and walked towards the middle of the counter area of the bank. He approached a bank employee, Nina Vukasinovic, whilst holding a shortened firearm and said “I want all your money now”. The offender turned and faced the waiting customers and said to get back. The offender shouted “This is a fucking robbery”. Vukasinovic ran from the teller area towards the back of the bank.9 The offender said “Hurry up” a number of times. Another employee of the bank, Concettino Auditore, walked over to where the offender was standing in an attempt to see what the offender wanted. At this stage Auditore was unaware of the situation. A clear dividing screen separated the two. As Auditore got closer to the offender, Auditore entered the teller slot in front of the offender and picked up a plastic bag that the offender had placed on the counter area of the bank. Auditore saw the offender holding and pointing a shortened sawn off firearm at him. The offender told Auditore to take the bag and said “Hurry up and get me some money”.10 Auditore started to take money from the tellers’ drawer and place it in the plastic bag that the offender had placed on the counter. While doing this Auditore heard the offender say “Hurry up you have 30 seconds and don’t fuck me around”. While Auditore filled the bag the offender instructed the other customers to get along a sidewall while pointing the firearm in their direction. He then stated that if anyone did anything stupid, he would fire the gun.11 Once Auditore had finished removing the money from the drawer, the offender demanded more money from underneath the counter. This was money that was on hand and was contained in the ‘Under Counter Unit’ or UCU, a lockable cabinet that contains a substantial amount of currency. Auditore attempted to open the UCU belonging to the teller slot he was standing in, however it failed to open.12 Auditore walked over to his allocated teller slot and attempted to open that UCU, at which point the offender said “You’ve got 10 seconds” while pointing the firearm at Auditore.13 Auditore requested someone to help him load money into the plastic bag. Another Bank employee, James Rachelle, loaded money in the bag and during this process the accused said: “Hurry up, you’ve got 20 seconds, if you don’t fucken move, I’ll jump the counter and turn this place into a hostage situation, I am not kidding”. Rachelle and Auditore finished loading money into the plastic bag. The offender reached through the screen and took the plastic bag full on money and said “Thank you”.14 The offender left the bank and walked west along Liverpool Street. Numerous Police attended the surrounding area, but failed to locate the accused.15 During the robbery the Banks’ security alarm had been activated together with a number of security cameras. These photographs captured a number of images. These images clearly depict the offender in possession of a shortened firearm and holding a plastic bag during the robbery.16 A detailed check of money stolen from the Commonwealth Bank totalled, as I have said, $18,705 in Australian currency.17 On Wednesday 16 July 2003 Detective Inspector Jacob of the State Crime Command Homicide Squad met with the offender and during that conversation the offender disclosed to Detective Inspector Jacob that he was responsible for the robbery at the Commonwealth Bank on the 15 March 2002.18 On Wednesday 21 January 2004 the offender was formally interviewed by Robbery and Serious Crime Squad Detectives. During that interview the offender made full admissions to the robbery at the Commonwealth Bank. The offender also adopted the conversation he had with Detective Inspector Jacob on the 16 July 2003. The offender stated that he used the money to live. He stated that he went on a trip to Victoria and Queensland and purchased clothing. He added that the money lasted about 9 days and he did not use it to purchase drugs or alcohol.19 During the commission of the offence a number of bank employees and members of the public suffered from shock and consequently have been traumatised by that fact that a firearm was pointed at them. 
     
      
       
      Commentary 
       
      
    20 It will be seen immediately that this was a bad robbery. The criminality involved was at a significant level. The offence involved the threatened use of violence and the actual use of a dangerous weapon, namely a shortened 22-calibre rifle. There were aggravating features: the victims, as bank tellers going about their daily tasks, were in a vulnerable position. The offence involved more than one victim and was, to a degree, a planned offence. As the agreed facts indicate, a number of bank employees and members of the public suffered from shock as a consequence of the frightening experience they encountered on the day of the robbery. 
     
      
    21 The offender has a reasonably extensive criminal history although the only matters that are particularly relevant for this offence relate to earlier charges he faced in January 2001 and November 2002. On 29 January 2001, the offender, facing a charge of robbery with a dangerous weapon, was found not guilty at trial by reason of mental illness by Shillington DCJ. The offender was referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. On 12 November 2002, the offender, again charged with robbery with a dangerous weapon, was, once again found not guilty at trial by reason of mental illness. The Judge in this trial was Tupman DCJ. It is the fact, of course, that these findings are not, strictly speaking, part of the offender’s criminal record. They do however, have a limited relevance. 
     
      
    22 I should, at the outset, make it clear that while I have regard to the offender’s criminal antecedents, I do not do so to impose punishment upon the offender in relation to any of those earlier matters. I take them into account, but only for the limited purpose of noting that the instant offence is not an uncharacteristic aberration. Rather it shows in this area, an attitude of continuing disobedience of the law. The mental illness findings, on the two occasions in the District Court, have some impact, however, on the present sentencing process. I shall of course, have more to say about the offender’s mental status when I come to consider the manslaughter charge. As will become apparent, the offender has suffered from an underlying chronic psychotic disorder for many years and, although this did not appear to impact on the commission of the Commonwealth Bank robbery on 15 March 2002, there is a possibility that the offender’s persistent mental condition was, in general terms, operative at the time. 
     
      
    23 The offender is entitled to a mitigation of the penalty to be imposed for the robbery by reason of the fact that on 30 October 2006, he pleaded guilty to the charge. It is relevant to note that the offender first made voluntary admissions as to his involvement in relation to the offence on 16 July 2003. This was during a conversation with Detective Inspector Jacob. During his evidence in the present proceedings, the offender expressed remorse for the distress he had caused the victims of the robbery and other persons in the vicinity at the time. 
     
      
    24 In relation to the plea, there is no doubt that the offender is entitled to a discount for the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty. The history of the matter is this: the trial was to be heard in the District Court but, by arrangement with the Chief Justice, the present indictment was presented in the Supreme Court so that the manslaughter plea and the robbery could be dealt with at the one time. Although the offender had admitted his involvement in the robbery at a much earlier point of time, the plea was not in fact entered until last month. For this reason, a discount for the plea at the lower end of the range (10-25%) is appropriate. The fact however, that the offender had made a voluntary disclosure of his involvement in this serious offence entitles him to “a significant added element of leniency” in accordance with the principles set out in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 at 604. It seems that the police would not have discovered the offender’s involvement in the crime, had it not been for his voluntary admissions. 
     
      
    25 A combination of the plea and the assistance to the authorities, in the way I have indicated, does entitle the offender, overall, to a reasonably significant discount in relation to the sentence to be imposed. It needs to be borne in mind, however, that the ultimate discount should not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence. 
     
      
    26 I shall return to a consideration of the appropriate penalty to be imposed and its place in the structure of the overall sentence to be imposed when I have dealt with the details surrounding the manslaughter plea. I turn to consider that matter now. 
     
      
       
       
       
      The death of Craig Behr 
       
      
    27 The following are the agreed facts on sentence:  
     
      
    28 About 10.30am on Saturday 27 March 2004 the deceased, was moved to cell 20 of Long Bay Prison Hospital to be in the company of another inmate. The deceased was placed in cell 20 with the offender. 29 The deceased and the offender had previously shared a cell together with no problems. 
     
      
    30 About 11.45am the lunchtime ‘lockdown’ occurred and all inmates were returned to their cells. The deceased was locked into cell 20 with the offender. There were no other inmates in the cell. 
     
      
    31 The adjoining cell, containing inmate Johannes Schmidt, was separated by an interconnecting door. There is a space under this door, which allowed Schmidt to see into cell 20 containing the offender and the deceased. 
     
      
    32 About 12.15pm a number of inmates heard screaming coming from cell 20. Schmidt heard what he believed sounded like a body hitting the floor of the cell and the sound of a bed banging. Schmidt attempted to raise the alarm on the Emergency Cell Call System at about 12.15pm. At about 12.21pm Schmidt attempted to raise the alarm for a second time. There was no response to either call.  
     
      
    33 At about 12.28pm Schmidt heard what he believed to be the sound of a body being moved.  
     
      
    34 At 12.35pm Corrective Services Officers Keith Smith and Brian Corlis received a call regarding an emergency in cell 20. Smith and Corlis immediately attended cell 20 and opened the door. The Officers observed the offender standing in front of the deceased.  
     
      
    35 The offender said “Get me out, get me out. I’ve got to get out of here.” 
     
      
    36 The offender attempted to push past the two officers. The officers saw the deceased lying on the floor of the cell with blood and vomit around his head. 
     
      
    37 The offender was removed from cell 20 and placed in an adjoining cell. The Officers attempted to revive the deceased but were unsuccessful. 
     
      
    38 Police were contacted and attended the Long Bay Prison Hospital a short time later. 
     
      
    39 The offender had blood on his hands, legs, clothing and shoes. 
     
      
       
      The offender was conveyed to Maroubra Police Station where he was interviewed but declined to say anything. After the interview the offender was returned to the dock where he said to Detective Sergeant Davies “ 
      Sorry about the interview but I didn’t want to say anything in front of him 
      .” When asked who he meant the offender said “ 
      The guard 
      .”  
       
      
    40 He then said: - 
     
      
       
        
        “I didn’t want to kill him man, I didn’t even know him. I’m not schizo but I do have a mental problem. I’m homicidal, I’ve told them that for days. Then they tell me this morning that they’re putting this guy with me and I begged them not to but they said they were going to. I told them I’ll kill him but they just said ‘you’re full of shit’. So about 11.30 they put us together and by 12.30 he’s dead. I didn’t want to do it, I know he’s got a mum and dad and his mum is probably crying now. I know what it’s like to lose someone, I lost my dad.”  
        
       
      
    41 The offender was asked what the deceased had done to provoke him and he replied “Nothing.” He was then asked how he had killed the deceased and the offender responded “I kicked him to death.” 
     
      
    42 On Sunday 28 March 2004 Dr Paul Botterill performed a post mortem on the deceased. Dr Botterill found that the deceased could have died from a blow to the head or from asphyxiation caused by vomit in his airways. 
     
      
    43 On Thursday 1 April 2004 the offender was interviewed at Maroubra Police Station. He stated that after he and the deceased had lunch he punched and kicked the deceased and then stood at the back of the cell. The offender said that he saw the deceased lying on the floor with blood and vomit on his face. He said that he activated the emergency alarm so that he could get out of the cell. 
     
      
    44 During the interview the offender adopted the conversation with Detective Sergeant Davies in the dock at Maroubra Police Station on the 27 March 2004.  
     
      
       
      Commentary 
       
      
    45 Apart from the agreed facts, there are four additional areas where factual findings and assessments need to be made. First, it is necessary to resolve and clarify, so far as it is possible, the precise nature of the offender’s mental state at the time of the death of the deceased. Secondly, it is necessary to assess the current and future dangerousness of the offender, that is, his potential to pose a threat to society in terms of possible harm to others, whether in custody or at large in the community. Third, there is a need to resolve the suggestion in the offender’s evidence that he was subject to a sexual threat or advance by the deceased immediately prior to the killing. Finally, it will be necessary to make some general findings and recommendations concerning the apparent systemic failure of the Corrective Services Department in relation to the circumstances surrounding the death of the deceased. 
     
      
       
       
      The offender’s mental state 
       
      
    46 Dr Stephen Allnutt has provided a comprehensive and thorough report dated 26 October 2006. This contains a complete analysis of all of the clinical and psychiatric documentation relevant to the offender. It covers a period between approximately 1996 and the present time. It is a highly complex and, in some respects, confusing history. Fortunately, I am spared from the need to detail this history because of the general agreement between Dr Allnutt and Dr Bruce Westmore who has examined the offender from the perspective of the defence side.  
     
      
    47 The history, however, is illuminating because it focuses initially on the offender’s mental condition between 1999 and 2002. It was during this period he was, on two occasions, found not guilty at trial by reason of mental illness. Paranoid behaviour, on the part of the offender, was reported, by his family as early as 1995. It appears that he had a troubled childhood and was brought up by his grandparents. He had, in fact, been born in Wollongong but was brought up in Sydney until he turned nine. He then moved to Tasmania. He manifested juvenile delinquent behaviour in his teens and was in trouble with police from about the age of 15. He was made a ward of the state in February 1992 when he was before the Devonport Children’s Court in relation to an assault charge. As an adult, he came before the Devonport Court of Petty Sessions on a number of occasions in 1994, 1998 and 1999. He had an early history of substance abuse, and a diagnosis of possible ADHD, in childhood had been made. It seems that he excessively used both cannabis and dexamphetamine over a number of years and that the ingestion of these drugs may have been a significant factor in the onset of his later mental illness. 
     
      
    48 Early clinical examinations during 1999 and 2000 suggested that the offender was suffering acutely from paranoid schizophrenia, although later clinical assessment suggested this was not necessarily the situation. A brief extract from the clinical history during this early period will give the flavour of the situation, without descending into too much detail: - 
     
      
       
        
        “In a report dated 10 March 2000, Dr Wilcox noted that she at the time was caring for the defendant at Long Bay Hospital; her assessment was for the purpose of providing a report on his mental state at the time that robbery offences had occurred in December 1999. She noted that he came from a difficult childhood; his father was in custody throughout his childhood; his father was shot dead in 1994 and his uncle was serving a life sentence for his father’s death; his learning was affected due to numerous moves; he had limited support in childhood; he described himself as a loner; throughout his teens he smoked marijuana regularly; he had used alcohol as self medication to quieten voices; he reported several years of paranoia; he believed that people were following him and trying to kill him…in Tasmania he was sniffing his father’s ashes; he believed he was being taken over by his father’s spirit; he said he imagined the voices were there to determine his daily activities and he would ask the voice whether he should do something; he had heard his father’s voice telling him he had to commit the crimes while out one night…Dr Wilcox concluded that the offender suffered from paranoid schizophrenia.” 
        
       
      
    49 The history records that on 16 May 2001 he was assessed for transfer to Kenmore Hospital, pending a determination by the Mental Health Review Tribunal. The offender went AWOL from Kenmore at the end of January 2002. During this time, he discontinued any medication, abused amphetamines, and lived and slept “rough”. He committed the Commonwealth Bank robbery on 15 March 2002, and at least one other serious offence at about the same time. 
     
      
    50 The offender was back in custody by the end of March 2002. He was admitted to D Ward, the acute psychiatric section of the prison. He was placed on anti-psychotic medicine and again diagnosed with schizophrenia, although, later in the year, this diagnosis was doubted. Generally, throughout this time he was, as he has been for a considerable period, a forensic patient. On occasions, he was assessed as exhibiting psychotic symptoms, but on other occasions there was no evidence of psychotic symptoms. The anti-psychotic medication fluctuated with the offender increasing his complaints that the medication was affecting him adversely. It was apparent, at least to some of the clinicians who reviewed him, that he had fabricated or elaborated symptoms at some stage in the past. But it was generally believed that some type of psychotic disorder, or at least a serious personality disorder, was present. 
     
      
    51 The history records that, a few days prior to the death of the deceased he was interviewed by Ms Matsuo, a psychologist. She formed the view that the accused’s risk of harm to others was high; and that he should be placed in a cell “one out”. Ms Matsuo gave evidence during the sentence hearing and said that at times during this interview, he appeared to be extremely serious in relation to his homicidal urges. But at other times was quite “flippant” or “glib” in relation to the subject. Overall, the history records, Ms Matsuo was very concerned about the manifestation of these homicidal urges. He had asked her that he be kept away from other prisoners. He also told her that he had previously got away with pleading “not guilty” by reason of mental illness and that he had feigned symptoms of psychosis. The medical notes indicate that the offender had ceased taking Flupenthixal in December 2003 as this had been causing him to experience movement disorders. In April 2004, he was commenced on Olanzapine, which, for a time, appeared to help his mental condition.  
     
      
    52 By May 2004, Dr Wilcox now concluded that his psychotic symptoms had occurred in the context of an extreme Anti-social Personality Disorder with some borderline traits and illicit substance abuse, chiefly cannabis and amphetamines. But she now felt that he had never demonstrated a comprehensive picture of schizophrenia. On 31 May 2004, the offender told the Registrar that he did not want to be a forensic patient; and that the truth now was that he did not have schizophrenia. He had always “made up” the symptoms and he now wanted to come off his medication to prove that he was not medically ill. He also wanted to be moved out of D Ward. In August 2004, the offender told Dr Wilcox that if he had been on medication he would not have “committed the offence” in which he killed the deceased. This was because he said the medication kept him calmer and caused his judgment to be better. He also said the reason why he committed the alleged offence was because he believed the victim was a sexual offender and he detested inmates who had committed paedophilia or crimes against the elderly. It appears that, throughout the remainder of the year, at times the offender demanded medication and insisted that it was helpful to him. At other times, he was abusive and threatened staff. He suggested that the medication was causing significant problems to him. Throughout the whole time, there were however intermittent outbursts of aggression and paranoid behaviour. 
     
      
    53 Dr Westmore reported in December 2004 as to the condition of the offender. It was his recommendation that there should be a trial of discontinuation of the medication as it appeared possible that it was having a significant adverse affect on the offender’s mental condition. 
     
      
    54 On 14 March 2005, Dr Wilcox noted the offender had given yet another version of events surrounding the death of the deceased. He claimed that he had been smoking cannabis about the time of the alleged offence; he was feeling paranoid. Immediately prior to the offence, however, he was feeling really good and he just snapped and assaulted the victim before buzzing for the prison officer. He did not feel remorse but recognised that “you are not allowed to do those things, not allowed to break the law”. He told her “It is not my fault, I have a mental illness, I believed that people were trying to give me AIDS”. 
     
      
    55 Dr Allnutt completed one of his earlier reports in March 2005 after an interview with the offender. Mr Heatley told him that he had, in the past, suffered a psychotic disorder; but did not believe that he was manifesting symptoms of a mental illness at the time that he was interviewed by Dr Allnut. During the middle of 2005, the offender’s behaviour became more reclusive and aggressive. He was complaining about a conspiracy of doctors working together to torture him and make him go up to “the top gaol”. In early November 2005, Dr Nielsen formed a tentative view that the offender was unfit to stand trial and that he had an acute exacerbation of his schizophrenia. On the other hand, in a report of 21 November 2005, Dr Allnutt concluded that the accused had a tendency to report mental illness symptoms in an exaggerated form, or to report their evidence for secondary gain. Dr Allnutt considered that this did not necessarily exclude the existence of an underlying psychiatric disorder such as schizophrenia. At the time, however, Dr Allnutt agreed that the offender should be regarded as unfit to stand trial.  
     
      
    56 By the middle of 2006, the general view of those doctors who had interviewed the offender in that period of time was that he was by now fit to stand trial. Dr Westmore interviewed the offender during the sentencing hearing in October 2006 and concluded once more that the offender remained fit for trial. 
     
      
    57 On 4 October 2006, Dr Allnutt had an interview with the offender. For the first time, on this occasion, the offender introduced the notion that he had been the subject of a sexual advance made to him by the deceased on the day of the killing. He also told Dr Allnutt that, on the Sunday prior to the offence, he had smoked cannabis. This had led him to believe that the person in his cell was going to beat him to death while he was asleep. He said that, on the following day, he felt terrible; he felt awful but he never thought about his cellmate. Dr Allnutt returned to Long Bay Hospital on 11 October 2006 and re-interviewed the offender. At the outset, Dr Allnutt was told by the offender that he had been lying to clinicians and also to Dr Allnutt. He said that Justice Health and the Department of Corrective Services were condoning “a shameful situation”, that being the “Craig Behr tragedy”. He said that what they were doing was preventing anyone from doing anything about it. All they had done, he said, was “to lock him in segregation , they didn’t want to release him”. 
     
      
    58 It was at this point in the interview that the offender repeated, in effect, remarks he had made to Danielle Matsuo, namely that he had “uncontrollable impulses of aggression” and that he felt “as though he was likely to attack someone”. He denied that this was related in anyway to his not having contact with his son or his girlfriend. He said that he had simply killed the victim but he couldn’t remember what had happened exactly. Dr Allnutt immediately pointed out that the offender had given a version of sexual advances having been made to him only a few days earlier. Dr Allnutt asked him why he was lying. The offender said “I don’t know, you tell me”. On this occasion, the offender said “I attacked him, he didn’t do anything to warrant the attack”. The offender specifically denied there had been a sexual advance. He said “I just decided to kill him”. 
     
      
    59 This relatively brief analysis of a very long and complicated history given by Dr Allnutt leads me directly to the doctor’s final opinion. In his evidence (as appears in his written report) Dr Allnutt made three points. First, in the present matter, little reliance can be placed upon the offender’s own reporting of his symptoms and conditions. In that sense, he is quite unreliable. Secondly, an objective analysis of the plethora of information contained throughout the history of clinical reports and notes, although difficult to analyse conclusively, tends to demonstrate that the offender does have, in all probability, an underlying chronic psychotic disorder. The problem is not whether he has such a disorder; but rather when does he experience symptoms of the disorder? That, in Dr Allnutt’s opinion, is anyone’s guess. For example, the offender might experience symptoms and not report them because he has a secondary goal in mind; at other times he might not experience symptoms but feel that it is in his interests to report them as such; and at other times he may be telling the truth. 
     
      
    60 Thirdly, there exists undoubted evidence of potential full psychiatric symptoms at the time of the killing. The better view, according to Dr Allnutt, is that there was a psychotic process, underlying his feelings, of a homicidal nature. This chronic psychotic disorder is compounded by a manifest personality disorder, which is driven by elements of paranoia, egocentricity and anti-social irritability and aggression. In addition, the offender lacked real insight into his own problems and does not collaborate well with his doctors and nurses. For the same reason, he is not as reliable as a historian of his symptoms and does not accept treatment adequately at all times. 
     
      
    61 As I have said earlier, there is no real disagreement between this opinion of Dr Allnutt and that of Dr Bruce Westmore in this regard. Dr Westmore has seen the offender on a number of occasions and has provided approximately 12 reports, over many years, in relation to him. Dr Westmore’s view is that the offender suffers from a chronic mental health problem and that, on the balance of probabilities, he was mentally ill at the time the killing occurred. Both doctors agreed that the nub of the substantial impairment affecting the offender at the relevant time was an impairment of his ability to control his urges and actions on the occasion he took the life of his fellow inmate. Both accepted that he had some ability to understand the nature and quality of his actions and, in particular, that they were wrong. This was particularly evidenced by the fact that he had been concerned to report the homicidal urges to Ms Matsuo several days before the killing occurred and by his request to be kept away from others. 
     
      
    62 It is perhaps unnecessary for me to state, but it should be recorded, that this analysis of the psychiatric evidence amply justified and explained the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions to accept the offender’s plea of manslaughter in full satisfaction of the indictment on the charge of murder. The offender is plainly a very disturbed young man, one whose personality and psychiatric problems are of the most complex kind. None of the psychiatrists have found it easy to diagnose, in absolute terms the full range of his psychiatric problems. All agree that the predominant flavour or theme of his presentation, and his thought content, is that of a paranoid and persecuted man. Dr Allnutt was prepared to concede that the offender is an unusual patient and, perhaps, a unique patient. Nobody seems to know precisely what is wrong with him; nobody seems to know when he is telling the truth or when he is not; and nobody seems to know exactly what to do with him in relation to his treatment and the possibility of future recovery. Against that background, it must be said, that a significant tragic factor in this case, tragic for the deceased, his family, and, for that matter, the offender himself, is that the Corrective Services Department permitted the deceased to be placed in the cell of a man who was in the implacable grip of an urge to kill someone. I shall return to this subject a little later. 
     
      
       
      Future dangerousness 
       
      
    63 Dr Allnutt had a firm view that, based on the risk factors manifested by the offender, the only reasonable conclusion at this stage is he should be regarded as falling into a group of offenders with mental illness who have high risk of future aggression. This conclusion is compounded by his repeated failure to collaborate with doctors and nurses; and his failure, on occasions, to accept the need for treatment and medication. Dr Allnutt was, however, prepared to qualify this statement to the extent that this was his prediction “at least in the short to medium term”. He felt that one could not predict any further into the future because there was the possibility, once the court case is over that the offender will accept treatment, will collaborate with his psychiatrists and engage in a proper rehabilitation program. If all that were to happen, the risk he poses to others might be then attenuated. In the short to medium term, however, he should remain within the status of a forensic patient. 
     
      
    64 Dr Westmore was, in some senses, a little more optimistic. He thought that this year the offender had improved in relation to his mental condition. He did however say that, if one were to “scratch the surface”, the offender became “quite agitated” and manifested persecutory thoughts. But he was able to say that he did see a degree of improvement during the current year. As to future risk, Dr Westmore thought that the offender’s behavioural potential was “really unknown”. He will require frequent psychiatric review and his future can only be determined on a day-by-day, week-by-week basis. He agreed entirely with Dr Allnutt that, in the short to medium term, the offender is at high risk of aggression towards other people. Therein, of course, lies his dangerousness, a factor which plainly makes the present sentencing exercise a difficult and challenging one. 
     
      
    65 Both psychiatrists were critical of the conditions in which the offender is held. Of course, the reality of psychiatric hospital incarceration is one thing; and the views of psychiatrists as to optimum, or even a better range of conditions is quite another. The reality of government resources and community needs probably means that there is, comparatively speaking, little in the way of spare funds to go towards prison improvements, particularly in the psychiatric area. But it must be said that segregation in a small cell without facilities, or at least very limited facilities; and with little or no recreation, all continuing over many months and years, is hardly a recipe for rehabilitation, reform and improvement in mental health. The offender can be extremely unpleasant towards people and I have no doubt he has been unpleasant, aggressive and offensive on occasions to clinicians and prison officers during the last 30 months. This is hardly helped by the fact that he has little insight into his own behaviour and tends to blame others for the situation in which he finds himself. 
     
      
    66 Were, however, this offender simply to disappear into the grim maw of the hospital psychiatric prison system with little hope of rescue, with little hope of proper treatment and reform, simply because he is a difficult person, this would be a very sad condemnation of our prison system. For this reason, I propose to make some recommendations at the end of this sentencing process as to the future treatment and placement of the offender. 
     
      
       
      The Offender’s version of the events in the cell 
       
      
    67 I am unable to accept the offender’s assertions that he was the subject of a sexual advance, and perhaps a sexual assault, by the deceased on the day of the killing. There are a number of reasons. First, this version of events appears to have been publicly stated for the first time by the offender during his meeting with Dr Allnutt on 4 October 2006. The offender, however, then withdrew the version entirely during his next meeting with Dr Allnutt on 11 October 2006. On 27 October 2006, when the deceased’s mother read to the Court her Victim Impact Statement, the offender interrupted the reading in a violent and aggressive manner. During his outburst, he asserted once more that there had been a sexual advance made to him by the deceased. On 30 October 2006, the offender apologised for his outburst but, it is to be noted, he did not withdraw the allegation of a sexual advance. 
     
      
    68 Secondly, Dr Westmore interviewed the offender on a number of occasions in 2004 and 2005. During a number of these meetings, Dr Westmore pressed the offender to explain what had happened in his cell on the day the deceased has died. During one of those interviews, on 27 July 2005, Dr Westmore thought that the offender was much less agitated and much less paranoid than he had been when Dr Westmore had interviewed him in June 2005. Dr Westmore asked the offender exactly why he had attacked the other prisoner. The offender replied: - 
     
      
       
        
        “I get this feeling inside me, it get’s inside me. It happens in gaol. I just can’t be around people and if I am around people, it can only be a small number. I can’t go into a small area of space with other people it get’s me inside the chest. I get anxious and paranoid”. 
        
       
      
    69 During the same interview he reiterated that he had told the psychologist, Ms Matsuo, that he wanted to be “one out”. He repeated that he had told her he couldn’t be around other people, that he felt he was homicidal and that he didn’t want to be near anyone. 
     
      
    70 During an earlier meeting on 4 May 2005, the offender had told Dr Westmore that he did not believe he was psychotic at the time of the killing. He did not think he was paranoid. He said the only problem he had was his aggression and his anger. On this occasion, he told Dr Westmore he had not argued with the victim nor had the man upset him in any way. He said: - 
     
      
       
        
        “I’ve never killed anyone before but that feeling, it wouldn’t go, it was like uncontrollable rage”. 
        
       
      
    71 I consider that it is of some significance that the offender, who obviously trusted Dr Westmore, spoke openly, or at least apparently openly, to him about the killing on these occasions. There was no suggestion of any sexual advance as the basis for the offender’s violent physical actions towards the deceased. 
     
      
    72 Thirdly, as the agreed facts indicate, the offender specifically told Detective Sergeant Davies, on the day of the killing, that the deceased had done nothing to provoke him. Fourthly, although the offender gave evidence before me and repeated that he had been the subject of the sexual advance by the deceased on the day in question, I did not accept his evidence as reliable.  
     
      
    73 During the course of a difficult, courageous but effective cross-examination, the Crown Prosecutor pointed out to the offender that, had he been the subject of a sexual advance in his cell, he would have been able to repel such an approach easily without resort to physical violence. This point was, I consider, not lost on the offender himself during the time he gave his evidence. 
     
      
    74 Finally, and most significantly, it must be accepted that the offender is not a reliable historian of events in any sense of the word. I am unable to place any reliance upon the version he gave because he has given so many versions and they are by no means consistent one with the other. This is not to say that the offender does not, at least at the moment, truly believe that he may have been approached sexually. Nor is it to say that he may not have persuaded himself over the years that this was a justification for his own actions. My position, as the tribunal of fact, is that I can place little reliance upon the accuracy or reliability of the evidence given before me by the offender. 
     
      
    75 In the same way, the offender said that he did not intend to kill the deceased. I am unable to accept this evidence essentially for the same reasons. It seems to me that the offender well knew the nature of the homicidal urges he was experiencing. It was for that very reason that he asked to be placed “one out”. True it is that his mental illness impaired his ability to control those homicidal urges. But I think he recognised their nature and understood the wrongfulness he felt compelled to carry out. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time he attacked the deceased, although he was suffering from a substantial impairment of mind that impacted upon his ability to control himself, he did intend, by punching and kicking the deceased, to bring an end to his life. And, of course, that is what he precisely achieved. 
     
      
       
      The placement of the deceased in the offender’s cell – systemic failure by the Department of Corrective Services 
       
      
    76 The next matter I need to address in these remarks on sentence relates to the fact that prison officers placed the deceased in a cell with the offender in circumstances where that action was likely to be, and indeed proved to be, extremely dangerous for the deceased. A great deal of time was taken up, during the sentence hearing, in the cross-examination of Corrective Services Officers, and other persons, relating to the ascertainment of the real circumstances that led to the deceased’s placement in the cell on 27 March 2004. 
     
      
    77 Although a considerable amount of time was devoted to the cross-examination of these witnesses, I have come to the conclusion that I should not express any final opinion as to who was precisely responsible for the failure that resulted in a situation where the deceased was left at the mercy of the offender, while he was in such a dangerous homicidal mood. The reasons for my decision to refrain from such a determination are these: first, I do not think it is appropriate that the sentencing court make findings of this nature. This is because the Court is not equipped to conduct an appropriate and thorough investigation into all of the surrounding circumstances. Indeed, although I have heard the cross-examination of a number of witnesses, sentencing procedures are, by their nature, not conducive to the elucidation of all necessary material to enable a proper finding to be made. In this regard, the Crown Prosecutor, quite properly in my view, did not seek to examine-in-chief the Corrective Services Officers called at the request of the defence but simply made them available for cross-examination, after the tender of their statements. It was not the role of the experienced Crown Prosecutor to do so; and she correctly did not allow herself to be diverted from her proper task in the sentencing process. 
     
      
    78 Secondly, I consider that the discovery of the truth of the matter, and the placement of blame, is best elucidated either by an independent inquiry or by the resumption of the Inquest which I understand commenced on 25 February 2005 but terminated on that day. (It did so, as I understand it as a consequence of the pending criminal proceedings). A Coronial Inquiry would be far better placed to investigate this matter than a Court whose principal task is to punish the offender. Thirdly, I do not consider that the circumstances that led to the unfortunate placement of Mr Behr in the offender’s cell on 27 March 2004 are, strictly speaking, relevant to my task as the sentencing judge. Those circumstances, of course, are part of the narrative history of the events leading up to the death of the deceased and they are relevant in that general sense. They are, however, not especially significant in relation to the difficult task of sentencing the present offender for the crime of manslaughter. 
     
      
    79 In making these remarks, I do not wish to appear insensitive to the situation of the deceased’s family. Nor do I wish to appear insensitive to the public interest involved in the broader community’s concern in connection with the future prevention of similar events in the prison system. Each of these matters of private and public interest are legitimate concerns. They are important concerns. But, as I hope it will be understood, they are likely to be a distraction from the task I have to perform, that is to impose an appropriate sentence upon the offender, having regard to the complex variety of established principles of sentencing practice. 
     
      
    80 Although I do not propose to make any definitive or determinative findings in relation to who was precisely at fault in the placement of Mr Behr in the offender’s cell, I would like to make some brief comments about this aspect of the matter. The first relates to the evidence itself. Without descending into detail, it may be said there are two broad strands of evidence relating to the circumstances of Mr Behr’s placement in Cell 20 on 27 March 2004. The first strand commences with the plainly truthful and reliable evidence of Danielle Matsuo, the forensic psychologist who interviewed the offender on 24 March 2004. After she had completed her interview, she spoke to Officer Too and told him that Mr Heatley was not a risk to himself, but was a risk to others. She also prepared a report for Assistant Superintendent Martin; it was Mr Martin who had asked Ms Matsuo to interview the offender. The report prepared by Ms Matsuo (Exhibit 2) makes it quite clear that she had formed the view that “Mr Heatley’s risk of harm to others is currently assessed as high”. Her report concluded that, if the offender were placed “two out” or was made to mix with other inmates in the yard, it was highly likely he would hurt someone. He had stated that “he had been experiencing homicidal urges for the past 18 months”. Ms Matsuo recommended, primarily for the staff and other inmates, that the offender be managed in the ICMU.  
     
      
    81 The next morning Ms Matsuo spoke to Mr Martin. She understood that he would shortly be given her report. A little time later, Mr Martin said he read the report. Later that day there was a meeting at the clinic. This was attended by the mental health nurse, Colman Driscoll, where Mr Heatley’s position was discussed. At that time, Mr Heatley was classified as “green dot”. This meant that he had to be “two out”, that is, he must have a cellmate. Mr Martin said that it was agreed that the “green dot” status should be altered; and that Mr Heatley should be classified as “normal cell placement” but “one out”. He was to remain locked in his cell until he was moved from the centre. Mr Martin then wrote on the bottom of Ms Matsuo’s report “Noted RIT terminated, “two out” terminated; to be locked in landing cell “one out” until moved from centre”. 
     
      
    82 According to Mr Martin, the paper work was then completed and he took the documentation with him to 13 Wing. He spoke to Officer Too and told him that Mr Heatley’s RIT had been terminated; that his “two out” cell placement had been terminated and that he was to be kept locked in, “one out” on the middle landing until he could be moved from the centre. According to Mr Martin, Officer Too was instructed to let other officers know about the changed situation. Mr Martin said he placed the new paper work, together with the relevant notification, in the Case Manager’s tray for filing into Mr Heatley’s case file. The documents were clipped together and Ms Matsuo’s report (with the notations on it) was placed on top. Mr Martin said he assumed these documents were placed into the Heatley case file but he himself had no further conversations with anyone else on the subject. He was not at the prison on the day when Mr Behr met his death. 
     
      
    83 Mr Martin informed Ms Matsuo on 25 March 2004 that he had Mr Heatley locked in a “one out” cell in 13 Wing. 
     
      
    84 Correctional Officer David Ulph gave evidence before me. He was a relatively inexperienced Corrective Services Officer at the time. It was his evidence, however, that a couple days prior to his going on annual leave, he was instructed by Officer Too to take Mr Heatley and his gear up to the middle landing; he was to make sure that Mr Heatley was “one out” and that he was to stay locked in until the Area Manager had seen him. Mr Ulph said he carried out these instructions. He also said a cell card was placed on the outside of Cell 20 identifying that it was Mr Heatley inside the cell. He himself placed a notification on the whiteboard on the middle landing that Mr Heatley was to be “one out”. He said he distinctively remembered putting “a big asterisk” on the whiteboard and notification to this effect. Mr Ulph also said that he entered the instruction into the landing log, and later produced a copy of it (the log, I might add, is rather ambiguous but it is capable of giving the meaning that Mr Ulph described). He also claimed to have placed a notification of the instruction on a plastic sticker in the muster book. 
     
      
    85 In short, Mr Ulph said that he did everything that he could possibly do with the information he had been given to make sure these instructions were drawn to the attention of other officers. He simply could not explain how it happened that a second person was placed in the cell on the relevant day. He was on leave on that day. 
     
      
    86 The second broad strand of evidence derives from the evidence of Assistant Superintendent Plumb and Prison Officer Keith Smith. The former, at the relevant time, was a senior correctional officer. Both officers are still currently employed with Corrective Services. Both these men were on duty on 27 March 2004. It was, in fact, the decision of Mr Plumb that Mr Behr should be placed in the cell with the offender. Officer Smith said that he and Officer Plumb went down to the Area Manager’s office to find out why the offender was locked in. They could find no reason why the deceased should not be moved in to the offender’s cell. Each denied that the Matsuo document and the notation by Mr Martin (Exhibit 2) were on the Heatley file. They could not recall seeing the instructions on the landing whiteboard nor in the Area Manager’s log or diary. There was nothing about the Heatley situation mentioned at the morning briefing on 27 March when Mr Smith started work. There was nothing on the cell door, nor was there anything in the muster book to indicate that the offender was to be kept “one out”. Mr Walsh, the Area Manager at the time, was not in the prison or, at least, not in the vicinity at the time, or during the morning, prior to the attack on the deceased. Mr Plumb, in particular, insisted that any notifications he saw indicated that the offender was normal cell placement and there were no instructions that he should be kept “one out”. 
     
      
    87 The logical connection between these two broad strands of evidence was Officer Too. His evidence however, was entirely unsatisfactory. It was impossible to know precisely what it was he was saying. At one time, he seemed to be agreeing that there were instructions that the offender was to be kept “one out”; and other times, he appeared to insist the offender was in a normal cell placement situation with no restriction on a second inmate being introduced into his cell. 
     
      
    88 In addition to the complexities of the above situation, there was a second major area of concern. This related to the apparent lengthy delay in answering the call for assistance to Cell 20. The agreed facts indicated that the offender himself buzzed through and that, relatively shortly after, Corrective Services Officers attended Cell 20. There was however a statement tendered before the Court from the inmate in the next cell. This was a man named Schmidt. According to his statement, he had, during a period of about 20 minutes, attempted to buzz through to the gate to get somebody to attend. This was because he had become aware that there had been some type of violent assault in the cell next to him. His statement indicated that one of his calls, at least, had been disconnected without being answered. The position was further complicated by the fact that an inmate named Xuereb had, over many hours, been abusing the “knock-up” system by constantly ringing the buzzer and infuriating officers at the gate where the calls were taken. This had been going on, as I say, over many hours prior to the attack on the deceased. 
     
      
    89 Mr Schmidt was unavailable to give oral evidence at the sentence hearing as he now lives overseas. I could not therefore, form any concluded view about the validity of this second major area of complaint. It is a potentially important area of complaint, however, particularly having regard to the fact that the post-mortem examination on the deceased indicated that he may well have choked to death on food debris, as he had apparently vomited after the physical assault upon him. Clearly, in such a context, a lengthy delay in attending to assist the stricken man could have a tragic consequence for him, as is indeed it may well have done. 
     
      
    90 I have said enough in this brief summary of the facts and evidence placed before me to indicate that I am satisfied that the placement of Mr Behr in the offender’s cell occurred as a consequence of both systemic and individual failures on the part of some prison officers to adhere to proper practices and procedures. Had those practices and procedures been followed, the prisoner would have remained “one out” and Mr Behr would not have died. It is clear to me that there is a significant likelihood that one group or other of the witnesses who gave evidence before me has not told the truth or is deliberately holding back information. Where the real and ultimate responsibility lies, I shall not, for the reasons I have earlier given, determine. 
     
      
    91 The entire situation, however, calls for an urgent need to resume the Inquest or to conduct a separate Inquiry. I would recommend this be done and that both the deceased’s family and the offender be entitled to be represented at such a further Inquiry. The reason for that is obvious. There has been an internal Inquiry, as I understand it, by the Department of Corrective Services but that has been, as such Inquiries often are, inconclusive. It is not surprising that is the situation. Such Inquiries are, by their nature, on occasions quite unsatisfactory and inconclusive. An independent and free ranging Inquiry is called for to answer the questions that the family of the deceased and the public legitimately ask to be answered; to explain why it was that a fellow inmate was placed in the offender’s cell in circumstances where he had made it only too plain that he was in the grip of homicidal urges. The overall protection of the community and the need for the efficient operation of the prison system call out for, and demand, such an independent inquiry. I would hope that this recommendation falls upon receptive ears, even though its consequences may be unpleasant for some individuals, and perhaps for the Department of Corrective Services itself, at least in the short term. 
     
      
       
      The sentence to be imposed 
       
      
    92 What sentences are to be imposed for each of the offences? Let me first consider the robbery of the bank with a dangerous weapon. 
     
      
    93 The agreed facts demonstrate that this was a serious robbery which involved a high degree of criminality. The language and the actions of the offender were particularly violent and his threats would have terrified the bank tellers and members of the public in the vicinity. It appears the money taken from the Commonwealth Bank was never recovered. 
     
      
    94 The offender is entitled to a discount for the utilitarian value of his plea. I do not, however, regard it as a plea at the earliest opportunity. A discount at the low end of the 10 to 25% range is appropriate (R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383). As I understand the timing of the plea the robbery offence was listed for hearing in the District Court to be heard as a contested trial towards the end of November 2006. While it is true the offender first disclosed the offence in July 2003 and formally admitted it during an interview in January 2004, the plea was not entered until 30 October 2006. It is fair to assume that, between mid-2003 and October 2006, the offender and his legal representatives had not finally made up their minds as to whether the robbery charge would be resisted on the basis of a claim for mental illness. The defence was entitled to take that stance, particularly having regard to the unusual history of both matters. Nevertheless, the chronology and sequence of events disentitles the offender from a discount other than at the low end of the range I have identified. 
     
      
    95 On the other hand, as I have said, the offender is clearly entitled to a reasonably generous discount arising from the fact that he voluntarily disclosed the commission of the offence to the authorities in circumstances where it may well be that his involvement would not have been discovered (R v Ellis). 
     
      
    96 In all the circumstances, I propose to allow a discount of 25% to recognise the plea and the relevant disclosure made to the authorities. 
     
      
    97 There were, of course, a number of aggravating factors in relation to this offence and I have earlier identified those. I repeat that I do not take the record of previous convictions into account other than to note that the offender does not come before the Court as a first offender. The acquittals in relation to the earlier robberies, predicated as they were on a mental illness defence, mean that those robberies can be noted only in a limited way, and for the limited purpose, of establishing that, in the present context, Mr Heatley is not in truth, in this area, a first offender; and that he has resorted to bank robbery on other occasions when his financial situation required it. His previous criminal history and his involvement, particularly in armed robberies, is also relevant, to a limited degree, on the issue as to whether he may be considered to pose a danger to the community upon release, although his violence and aggression in the present bank robbery pale into insignificance in comparison to the level of violence shown in the manslaughter offence which I shall shortly discuss. 
     
      
    98 The nature of the robbery offence, and the aggravating matters, tend to indicate that a sentence should be imposed that has a substantial component of general deterrence. On the other hand, it is impossible to put to one side altogether the history of the offender’s mental illness. This matter must diminish or at least reduce, the suitability of the offender as a vehicle for general deterrence. There is a need, however, to insist upon a sentence which reflects an element of personal deterrence in the area of armed robbery. 
     
      
    99 The offender has expressed remorse for the offence and, if he can be accepted, has suggested that he now appreciates that the presentation of a dangerous weapon to other people in connection with a robbery or threatened robbery is an action that legitimately causes considerable fear and distress to the people involved. 
     
      
    100 The sentence to be imposed should reflect, in general terms, the purposes for which a Court may impose a sentence as set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It should also reflect and take into account the aggravating and mitigating factors mentioned in s 21A of the legislation. 
     
      
    101 The method of structuring sentences has been altered by the legislature for offences committed during and after February 2003. The consequence is that, in the general run of things, an offence such as the present would need to be structured by the setting of a total term and then for the establishment of a non-parole period within that term. For offences committed after February 2003, the legislature has reverted to earlier sentencing practice in requiring the Court to first impose a non-parole period and then set the balance of the term of the sentence. As I say, this change in sentencing structure does not apply to the present matter as the offence was committed prior to February 2003. 
     
      
    102 I have decided that, because the offender comes for sentence in relation to the more serious charge of manslaughter as well, and because questions of accumulation will and do inevitably arise, a fixed term of imprisonment should be imposed for the present offence. I propose to impose, after discount, a sentence of four years fixed term of imprisonment for this offence and to backdate it to 27 March 2004. The term is intended to be the equivalent of the appropriate non-parole period that would have been applicable if other than a fixed term had been imposed. 
     
      
    103 Strictly speaking, this back dating process is brought about by the situation, as is agreed between the parties, that the offender, although remaining a forensic patient at the time, might notionally be regarded as having been held in custody in relation to the manslaughter charge from that day onwards. By contrast, although the offender was formally interviewed in relation to the robbery in January 2004, it does not appear that the offender was held in custody (or even in notional custody) as from that date in connection with the robbery offence.  
     
      
    104 From a practical point of view, it is, in my opinion, a more satisfactory method of structuring the sentence by placing the fixed term sentence below or beneath the sentence for manslaughter and then later to consider questions of accumulation or concurrence. In addition, the manslaughter sentence is for a more serious crime and will involve the selection of a non-parole period and a balance of term. It is for those reasons that I will first impose the fixed term sentence and backdate it to the agreed date for commencement of the overall sentence, namely 27 March 2004. 
     
      
    105 I turn now to consider the sentence to be imposed for the manslaughter offence. The principal difference between the parties in relation to this offence focused upon the level of criminality involved in the killing. The Crown submitted that the level was high. In this regard, the Crown submitted that, although sentences for manslaughter vary widely, there is authority to suggest that cases in which the partial offence of substantial impairment have been invoked warrant higher sentences than other categories. References were made to the comment by Hunt CJ at CL in Regina v Carlson (unreported NSWSC 16 October 1995): - 
     
      
       
        
         “There are…identifiable patterns of sentencing for different categories of manslaughter. Where an offence involves an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm, the range remains wide, but its upper limit is a high one – more so for diminished responsibility cases than for provocation cases. In an diminished responsibility category, the sentences fall at the upper end of range”. 
        
       
      
    106 I am not satisfied, however, that the observations of Hunt CJ at CL carry with them the meaning attributed to them by the Crown. Rather, I think his Honour was discussing patterns of sentencing for different categories of manslaughter. The decision, however, is not accompanied by the sentencing statistics that his Honour had in mind and is therefore of limited value. In any event, I do not think it can be said that one type of manslaughter warrants a higher sentence than another in any useful general manner. Each case must depend upon its own circumstances. 
     
      
    107 Secondly, the Crown argued that the offender’s capacity to understand events, and his ability to judge whether his actions were right or wrong were not impaired by his mental illness. The Crown submitted that the impairment impinged upon his capacity to control his homicidal urges. For that reason, it was submitted that the impairment, although substantial, was not as serious, for the purposes of gauging the level of culpability, as other types of impairment.  
     
      
    108 In general terms, I accept this submission. It is necessary to add that the substantial impairment suffered by the offender has already been taken into account in relation to reducing the offence from murder to manslaughter. It is not inappropriate, however, to have regard to the nature of that impairment when assessing the criminality of the manslaughter offence itself. It is necessary to take special care not to “double count” the impact of the substantial impairment. But, as I have said, it is not inappropriate in a particular case, to examine the mental illness or disorder for the further purpose I have mentioned. 
     
      
    109 Mr Terracini SC, who appeared with Mr Newton for the offender, argued that the manslaughter fell in the mid range. He submitted that there was nothing remarkable about the circumstances of the killing. Indeed, the report by Dr Botterill (Exhibit “F”) had stated: - 
     
      
       
        
        “Although less severe than most lethal head injuries, it is most likely that the head injury has resulted in impaired consciousness, vomiting and inhalation of food debris, in turn leading to brain hypoxia and death”. 
        
       
      
    110 The points made by Mr Terracini were first, that the injuries noted on the body of the deceased were not of the most severe kind. Secondly, it was possible that death occurred as a result of hypoxia, consequent upon the beating. 
     
      
    111 The parties were in agreement as to the legal principles that are applicable to the difficult sentencing exercise that often arises in a situation where mental illness is involved. Those principles are well expressed by Gleeson CJ in R v Engert (1996) 84 A Crim R 67 at p 68. His Honour said: - 
     
      
       
        
        “The principles to be applied in sentencing are in turn developed by reference to the purposes of criminal punishment. Those purposes were said by the High Court in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476 as follows: ‘protection of society, deterrence of the offender and others who might be tempted to offender, retribution and reform’… In a given case, facts which point in one direction in relation to one of the considerations to be taken into account may point in a different direction in relation to some other consideration. 
        
       
       
        
        For example, in the case of a particular offender, an aspect of the case which might mean that deterrence of others is of lesser importance, might, at the same time increase the importance of the deterrence of the offender”. 
        
       
      
    112 There are three ways in which mental illness may be relevant in sentencing so as to moderate the sentence otherwise to be imposed. First, where mental illness contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced. Secondly, mental illness may render the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and moderate that consideration which would otherwise be of significance. Thirdly, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person.  
     
      
       
      R v Hemsley 
       [2004] NSWCCA 228 at (33-36) per Sperling J;  
      R v Wicks 
       [2005] NSWCCA 213 at (24-26) and (33-34);  
      R v Pham 
       [2005] NSWCCA 314 at (27-35) and  
      R v Hughes 
       [2005] NSWCCA 117 at (24-29). See also  
      R v Israel 
       [2002] NSWCCA 255 at (23) per Spigelman CJ. 
       
      
    113 On the other hand, there is a countervailing consideration, namely the need in cases involving mental illness, to evaluate the danger which the offender presents to the community. This entails consideration of the need for special deterrence. As the majority said in Veen (No 2) at 476: - 
     
      
       
        
        “A mental abnormality which makes an offender a danger to society when he is at large but which diminishes his moral culpability for a particular crime is a factor which has two countervailing effects: one which tends towards a longer custodial sentence, the other towards a shorter.” 
        
       
      
    114 As Gleeson CJ said in R v Engert at 68: - 
     
      
       
        
        “In the case of a particular offender, an aspect of the case which might mean the deterrence of others is of lesser importance, might, at the same time, mean that the protection of society is of greater importance. …In a particular case, a feature which lessens what might otherwise be the importance of general deterrence might, at the same time, increase the importance of deterrence of the offender.” 
        
       
      
    115 These principles have particular significance in the case of the present offender. There can be no doubt that an assessment of the level of criminal culpability in the crime here requires a recognition that the offender, as a consequence of his psychotic disorder, and his personality difficulties, found it difficult to control his homicidal urges when they were upon him. The recognition of this aspect requires the moderation of the level of criminal culpability in the present case. That moderation is, however, offset to a degree by the fact that the offender recognised the wrongfulness of his actions and, indeed, recognised the dangerousness of the urge to kill.  
     
      
    116 At the same time, the very condition that diminished the offender’s capacity for self control plainly increases the need for protection of the public, including those persons with whom the offender is likely to come into contact during his time in custody or perhaps, upon release. 
     
      
    117 It needs, however, to be carefully kept in mind that the principle of proportionality must be applied. The sentence to be imposed should not increase or extend beyond that is which is proportionate to the crime (Veen No 2) at 472, 473). 
     
      
    118 In the present case there is agreement between the medical experts. This points to the fact that the offender must, at least for the short to medium term, be regarded as dangerous to others. Neither expert was prepared to predict any further into the future. There was general agreement between them, however, that with frequent psychiatric review and treatment, there remains the possibility that the offender’s condition will improve and that his present dangerousness will be reduced. 
     
      
    119 My assessment of the criminal culpability involved in the present offence is that it was of a reasonably high order. It is true that no weapons were used in the attack. It is true that the injuries sustained by the deceased were not as lethal as in other beatings. It is easy to imagine a more horrific manslaughter than the present one. But nevertheless, the assault on the deceased was clearly a violent and brutal one. He was quickly rendered unconscious after receiving a number of blows and kicks. The offender was, and is, capable of a level of high aggression. It would have been a terrifying experience for the deceased to be set upon in this manner. There was nowhere for him to escape and nowhere for him to hide. There was no real opportunity to get help. The offender knew what he was doing was wrong. The psychotic condition impaired his ability to control his urges, but it did not substantially impair his understanding that what he was doing was very wrong indeed. 
     
      
    120 The other matter at issue in relation to the manslaughter charge is the value of the offender’s plea. The background to this is somewhat complicated. I do not propose to detail the background. It is sufficient to note that, on a number of occasions, the offender pleaded guilty to the charge of murder but afterwards was given leave to withdraw the plea. For example, on 22 September 2006, I gave leave to the offender to withdraw a plea of guilty which had been entered before Barr J on 7 July 2006. A similar situation arose in 2005. 
     
      
    121 The bottom line, if I may be exercised for using that inelegant expression, is that the offender did not plead guilty to manslaughter until 26 October 2006. I infer that it was shortly prior to that day that agreement was reached between the medical experts and instructions obtained from the Director of Public Prosecutions to accept the manslaughter plea. 
     
      
    122 It is clear that the plea entitled the offender to a discount for its utilitarian value (R v Thomson & Houlton). While it is true that the offender has never denied causing the death of the deceased, and while it is true that he has pleaded guilty to murder on several occasions but later been permitted to withdraw the plea, the plain fact of the matter is that the plea of manslaughter was negotiated and then given at the outset of the trial for the murder charge against the offender. In those circumstances, the plea can only qualify for a discount at the lower end of the range. In my view, the discount should be no greater than 10%. 
     
      
    123 I regret to say that I can, at this stage detect very little remorse or contrition on the part of the offender in relation to the killing of Craig Behr. At this stage, the offender has little insight into his actions and, once again, he is not a reliable reporter of his own thought patterns. For example, he stated, during his evidence, that he was not a violent person. In addition, he rather suggested the blame for the killing of the deceased lay with the deceased himself or with the prison authorities who permitted the deceased to be placed in the cell. An absence of remorse cannot be used in any way to punish the offender. That is particularly the case in the present matter where his mental illness and his difficult personality conspired to rob him, to some degree, of an ability to have meaningful insight into his own actions. The absence of remorse, however, means that the offender is not entitled to any discount on that basis. 
     
      
    124 Before coming to the actual sentence to be imposed, I should here recall that Mrs Behr read a Victim Impact Statement to the Court during the sentencing hearing. This was a sad and moving document. The Court extends to Mrs Behr and her family its sympathy and trusts that the opportunity to make those grieving statements will bring some degree of consolation to the family in respect of the death of their loved one. In accordance with established principles, I do not propose to take those matters into account in increasing the sentence to be imposed upon the offender. 
     
      
       
      The sentence to be imposed 
       
      
    125 What sentence then should be imposed on the offender for the manslaughter? 
     
      
    126 A principle of general of importance is the recognition that the offence of manslaughter is a particularly serious one, since it involves the taking of a human life, the protection of which is the primary objective of the criminal justice system (Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402; R v McDonald (NSWCCA 12 December 1995); R v Woodland [2001] NSWSC 416 per Wood CJ at CL). 
     
      
    127 I have taken into account the pattern of statistics referred to by counsel during addresses. I have also had regard to the very thorough chart of the manslaughter cases, dealing with substantial impairment, prepared by Mr Terracini. While I have had regard to this material, it is necessary to bear in mind that, in the case of manslaughter especially, neither a consideration of statistical information nor an examination of results in other decided cases illuminates, in any decisive manner the decision to be reached in a particular case. Sentences for manslaughter vary greatly because of variations in the circumstances of the individual instances of the offence (R v McGuire (NSWCCA unreported 30 August 1995); R v Troja (NSWCCA unreported 15 July 1991); R v Bloomfield (1998) 44 NSWLR 34 at 738-739; R v Woodland at 416; R v Montgomery [2004] 151 A Crim R 376 at [5] per Spigelman CJ; R v Trevenna [2004] 149 A Crim R 505 at [98-101]. 
     
      
    128 A sentence that appropriately reflects the application of the conflicting and differing principles I have earlier identified, and which recognises the seriousness of the taking of a human life is, after discount for plea, a term of imprisonment for 14 years. In my opinion, the sentences for the two offences should be cumulative, one upon the other. The offences were completely unconnected and represent entirely separate bouts of criminal conduct. 
     
      
    129 The offender, however, is entitled to the recognition of special circumstances. There are two reasons for this. The first is the cumulative structure of the two sentences. The second relates to his mental illness. In my opinion, the offender should be encouraged to co-operate with his clinicians and medical specialists. He should be encouraged to be frank and truthful in his dealings with them, and to take medication and other treatment, if prescribed. A principal reason for the finding of special circumstances is the need for the offender to be encouraged to realise that his co-operation, in the process of medical rehabilitation, may yield him the prospect of earlier conditional release than would otherwise have been the case. 
     
      
    130 For the manslaughter offence, I propose to impose a non-parole period of eight years with a balance of term for a further period of six years. The sentence is to commence at the end of the fixed four-year term to be imposed for the robbery. I should stress that, whether the offender will in fact be released to parole in March 2016, will very much depend on two things: first, his own behaviour and conduct, including his efforts to genuinely co-operate with doctors and clinical staff. Secondly, his own mental state at the relevant time and, in particular, whether he has been shown to be able to control his dangerous and aggressive instincts. Those matters will fall to be decided by the medical staff and the parole authorities. 
     
      
    131 I recommend that the following steps should be taken in connection with the offender’s status. 
     
      
       
      1. He should remain for the time being as a forensic patient. 
       
       
      2. His status, as a segregated patient, should be carefully and frequently monitored. In the short term, regular risk assessments should be undertaken, preferably on a daily basis, and the results should be clearly communicated to staff. 
       
       
      3. He should agree to undertake weekly-supervised urine drug screening to ensure he has abstained from substance use. Later, these may be altered to monthly tests. 
       
       
      4. He should be treated, but only if thought necessary, with anti-psychotic medication. 
       
       
      5. Subject to prison protocol and procedures, and to issues of resources and availability, the offender should be provided with at least a minimum of recreational and personal facilities, including physical recreation and reading materials. 
       
       
      6. He should receive, throughout his time in custody, intensive psycho-education with regard to his offending, substance abuse and mental illness. 
       
       
      7. Subject to improvement in his mental condition and behavioural traits, he should, in the medium term, be considered for removal to a secure hospital with a therapeutic model, such as Morisset hospital. 
       
      
    132 Michael Alan Heatley, for the offence of robbery with a dangerous weapon, I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment for four years. The sentence is to be backdated to commence on 27 March 2004 and is to expire on 26 March 2008. 
     
      
    133 For the offence of manslaughter, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of eight years and a balance of term of six years. This sentence is to commence on 27 March 2008 and the non-parole period is to expire on 26 March 2016. That date is the date on which you will be eligible to be released on parole. The balance of the term will expire on 26 March 2022.

      2005/2014 REGINA v M.B. No. 2 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The Court has sentenced M.B., the offender, to a term of imprisonment for the offence of murder. The sentence is comprised of a non-parole period of 16 years 6 months and a balance of term of 5 years and 6 months. The Court made an order directing that he serve his sentence until aged 21 years as a juvenile offender. 
     
      
    2 The Crown has made an application that the Court makes an order under s 11(4B) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. That subsection permits a court, when sentencing a person who is of, or above, the age of 16 years for a serious children’s indictable offence, to make an order authorising the publication or broadcasting of the person’s name. Unless the Court grants that authorisation, it is an offence for the name of the offender to be published. However s 11(4C) provides that a court cannot make such an order unless it is satisfied: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (a) that the making of such an order is in the interests of justice, and  
         
        (b) that the prejudice to the person arising from the publication or broadcasting of the person’s name in accordance with such an order does not outweigh those interests. 
         
        
       
      The burden of proving that the court should make an order is upon the Crown. 
       
      
    3 I have some difficulty in ascertaining what factors might be relevant to the making of a finding that it is in the interests of justice to identify to the public in general the name of a juvenile who committed an offence for which the court has imposed sentence, even where the offence is one as serious as murder. Clearly the general rule found in the legislation that the name of a juvenile offender should not be published is designed to assist the person’s rehabilitation and reintegration into the community. It is generally held to be important that a juvenile offender should not be stigmatised by reason of some offence committed when the person is likely to be immature and less responsible for criminal misconduct than is an adult. There may not be the same need to protect the public against an offender who is a juvenile. 
     
      
    4 However for the purposes of the section, the interests of justice must go beyond a consideration of the welfare of the particular juvenile and outweigh any prejudice that might be occasioned to the particular person by the making of the order authorising publication. It might not be difficult to understand where the interests of justice lie where the identification of the offender might assist in the further investigation of the particular crime for which sentence has been imposed, especially where the crime being investigated is very serious. But there is no suggestion of that being the case here. The interests of justice must, therefore, be advanced by the public being informed of the identity of the offender as an end in itself, either because the public has an overriding interest in knowing the identity of the offender or because the identification of the offender will in someway advance the purposes of punishment for which sentence is being passed in accordance with s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    5 In the present case the Crown has not suggested that the offender presents such a risk to public safety that his identification is in the interests of the community. The offence, as brutal as it was, is not of that character. There is little prospect of his re-offending in that way again simply because of the maturity he will gain by the effluxion of time while he is in custody. In any event the offender will be in custody for such a period of time that it is unlikely that current public fears, if there were any, would continue until his release. 
     
      
    6 Although the deceased’s family clearly have an interest in the punishment of the offender, I fail to see how their interests are advanced or vindicated by the identification of the offender by name. In any event, the Crown did not suggest that the making of the order would be in the interests of justice for any reason connected with the deceased or his family and friends. 
     
      
    7 The Crown did argue that general deterrence would be less effective if the offender was not identified. I do not understand that submission with respect. Surely the deterrent effect of the sentence, if there is any, is reflected in the fact that a juvenile offender of no prior criminal convictions must serve over 16 years in prison for a spur of the moment act of senseless violence. I cannot see how the deterrent effect of that sentence is increased because the identity of the offender is made known. It might be different if the offender had a certain fame or notoriety within the community at the time of offending. In such a case it might be significant that the community was made aware that such a person could not escape appropriate punishment simply by reason of his or her status in the community. But that is not this case. 
     
      
    8 The Crown relies upon the fact that there are persons in the community who are aware of his identity, such as those associated with him in the football club, or at school, or even at his church. But it does not seem to me to be relevant that there is a small section of the community that is aware of the offender’s identity. Nor does that fact seem to me to be particularly remarkable. Young persons often have more involvement in community activities, such as school and sports clubs, than adults so that there is often more awareness in the community of what a juvenile does or what happens to the juvenile amongst the circle of persons that knew him or knew of him. 
     
      
    9 The Crown submitted that it was preferable that the identity of the offender be made known formally than continuing the situation where persons in the community, who are aware of it, might publish it either intentionally or by accident. I think it is highly unlikely in the extreme that the sentencing of the offender is going to make the publication of his identity more likely by those who are already aware of it. But in any case, it is hardly in the interests of justice to publish the name of the offender because there may have been, or may be in the future, breaches of the law by those who are aware of his identity. After the publicity of the trial in the media, where it was made clear that the identity of the accused person could not be revealed, it would be difficult for someone who was aware of the name of the offender to argue that he or she did not know it could not be published. 
     
      
    10 It seems to me that one effect of the publication of an offender’s name, and perhaps the principal one in the vast majority of cases, is to shame the offender in the eyes of the community. I am aware of some suggestion having been made that denouncing the offender, rather than the crime committed, may have some benefit in terms of restorative justice. This argument is based, so far as I understand it, on an assertion that the community is unwilling to accept the contrition of an offender without an element of antecedent shaming. The Crown did not argue in the present case that it was in the interests of justice to publicly shame the offender and thus I have received no assistance on this question from argument or evidence. Therefore, I need not consider this as a relevant matter in determining the application. 
     
      
    11 It may be, as the Crown argued, that in the present case, by reason of the lengthy period in custody that the offender must serve before being released into the community, there would be little actual prejudice to him by his public identification. The Crown submitted that there was less risk of the offender being stigmatised than might otherwise be the case because he would most likely return to PNG, either voluntarily or involuntarily, once he is released. I cannot take into account such a possibility. The Court does not generally have regard to possible executive action, such as deportation of an offender, because it is an uncertain event. In any event the Court has to be satisfied that the interests of justice outweigh any prejudice to the offender. An order under the section cannot be justified on the basis that there will be no prejudice caused to the offender even though the Court cannot discern how the making of the order will advance the interests of justice. 
     
      
    12 I accept that the commission of the offence had wide media reporting within the Newcastle area. The trial also received significant media attention. But these facts do not indicate to my mind that the interests of justice require that the offender be identified. The public interest will no doubt be short lived and much of it satisfied by knowledge that a juvenile was charged, convicted and sentenced for the crime. I doubt that there is a legitimate public interest in knowing the name of the juvenile or what he looked like. In any event the court has to reach a positive satisfaction that it is in the interests of justice that the offender’s name be published. I am not able to reach such a conclusion. 
     
      
    13 The application is refused.

      FRIDAY 10 NOVEMBER 2006 
       
       
      2005/2014 REGINA v M.B. 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, a juvenile, was convicted by a jury of the charge of murdering the deceased, Zane McCready, at Mayfield on 6 July 2005. It now falls to the Court to sentence him for that crime. The maximum penalty for the offence is life imprisonment and there is a standard non-parole period prescribed under s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act of 20 years. 
     
      
    2 It is not difficult to identify the facts that must have been found by the jury having regard to the issues raised before them. The substantial question ventilated at the trial was whether the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the offender who caused the death of the deceased. By their verdict it is clear that they were so satisfied. The full circumstances in which the deceased came to be killed were not revealed to the jury nor are they before me. This is because some of the Crown witnesses did not tell the whole truth about the circumstances in which they confronted the deceased and his friend or how the deceased was injured before his death. However I have sufficient of the relevant facts to be able to sentence the offender for his crime. 
     
      
    3 On the date of his death the deceased was a resident of Mayfield and a member of the Australian Air Force. He was aged 20 years. On 7 July last year he and a long-standing friend, Joe Stevenson, who was at the time resident in Victoria, decided to go out and get drunk together in Mayfield. Because they were intending to consume alcohol, the two decided to walk between the various establishments they intended to visit. 
     
      
    4 At the same time the offender and a number of young persons from a local football team, the Cheetahs, met together in a shed at the back of a house in Waratah Street, Mayfield for the purposes of a house warming. About a dozen young men aged between 15 and 17 years arrived at the premises some bringing alcohol. At about 10.30 pm the group moved into Waratah Street because it was getting too crowded and noisy. They headed in a dispersed group towards a park at the corner of Waratah and Hanbury Streets. 
     
      
    5 As the first members of the group reached the park, the deceased and Mr Stevenson were walking down Hanbury Street in the direction of Waratah railway station toward the Ex-Servicemen’s Club. They were both intoxicated as they had been drinking beer with spirit chasers at a hotel a short distance away. They were in high spirits as they walked along the footpath on the opposite side of the road from the park. However something about their behaviour attracted the attention of some of the young men who were in the close vicinity. I am unable to say what it was that occurred between them but it resulted in some of the group, including the offender, running into Hanbury Street to confront the deceased and Mr Stevenson. A short time later, someone yelled out the word “Cheetahs” and others of the group joined those who were at this stage challenging the deceased and his friend. 
     
      
    6 Once again I do not know what immediately transpired but I have no doubt that the aggressors were the offender and his group and that they were surrounding the other two in a threatening manner. Although some of the young men from Waratah Street suggested in evidence that they were not close to what was happening, I have little doubt that all but two of the persons who had been in the shed were in the group confronting the deceased and Mr Stevenson. Obviously feeling himself and the deceased threatened, Mr Stevenson withdrew two shot glasses that he had in his pocket, having taken them from the hotel where he and the deceased had been drinking. He held them out towards those near him and told them to “Fuck off”. However, he never seriously tried to injure any one in the group. 
     
      
    7 At about this time the deceased and the offender began fighting. Although I am not sure of the exact order of events, I have no doubt that it was the offender who was the first to be physically violent. I do not know what it was that provoked this attack. The accused did not give evidence at the trial nor did he participate in an interview with police. He refused to discuss the matter with those preparing the juvenile justice report except to deny that he was responsible, alleging that he had been “set up”. Therefore, there has never been an account given by him of the events leading up to the death of the deceased. 
     
      
    8 While Mr Stevenson was engaged with the other youths, one of whom punched him in the face fracturing his jaw, the deceased and the offender were involved in what could be described as fisticuffs. On the evidence before me there was some pushing and shoving between them, punches thrown on both sides and at some stage one or other was on the ground. As might be expected the descriptions of what was happening between the offender and the deceased were somewhat confused. However, it seems that the deceased generally got the better of the encounter although there was no real risk of either of them inflicting any serious injury on the other. 
     
      
    9 I have already noted that the whole of the circumstances leading up to the death of the deceased is not before the Court because some of the Crown witnesses withheld information both from the police and when giving evidence at the trial. Some of them must have been positively untruthful because on no account did the deceased ever receive any injuries apart from those inflicted upon him by the offender. On the evidence of these witnesses only two other persons laid hands upon the deceased. One was a member of the group who admitted to having punched the deceased at some stage during a lull in his fight with the offender. The other was another of the group who pushed him at about the same time. Yet it is clear that the deceased was at some stage struck twice to the head with a bike chain that had been seen earlier in the possession of the offender. Further the deceased received a large amount of bruising to one leg near the buttocks and this was consistent with him having been stamped upon. Yet all the witnesses denied ever having seen such injuries inflicted. 
     
      
    10 There were, however, a number of witnesses who gave evidence of the attack upon the deceased that caused his fatal injuries. At some stage the fight between the deceased and the offender moved across the road to be directly outside the Ex Servicemen’s Club. At the same time Mr Stevenson and the group around him moved into the middle of the road towards the club. The fight between the offender and the deceased appeared to come to an end, with the deceased apparently victorious because he approached some members of the group standing nearby. It was then that he was struck in the face by one of the youths and the deceased moved back as a result. Meanwhile the offender had run to where one of his group was standing with a bottle in his hand. He grabbed the bottle, bent down to break it on the road and then ran at the deceased striking him with the broken bottle in the neck. The blow was downward in a stabbing motion and with such force that it chipped one of the deceased’s bones in his face. It severed his throat and he bled to death while his friend tried vainly to administer aid to him to stem the loss of blood. 
     
      
    11 As soon as the offender had struck the deceased, he and his group fled from the scene back towards Waratah Street and the park. The offender shortly after met up with two of the group in a laneway at the far end of the park. There he said, “I got him”. Eventually a number of the group, including the offender, returned to the shed where they had earlier been drinking. At this time it was seen that the offender had a badly cut hand. There was some consternation about the events and the offender was crying. Two of the youths attempted to clean up the wound, stop the bleeding and make sure that there was no glass in it. At some stage the offender said, “I didn’t mean to do it. I hope he doesn’t die”. 
     
      
    12 Eventually the group split up. The mother of one of the youths picked up her son, another of the group and the offender and drove them to her home. There her husband saw the offender’s wound and tended to it. The offender told him that he had cut his hand scooping up a bottle that had been dropped by one of the youths. The next morning police went to the Waratah Street premises where a number of the group were sleeping and commenced their investigations.  
     
      
    13 The Crown case against the offender was in my view overwhelming. Not only were there eyewitnesses from the group of youths who implicated the offender in the stabbing of the deceased, but there was also a witness in the club who saw a person, whom the jury could only reasonably have found to be the offender, strike the deceased in the throat. There was evidence of admissions by the offender to members of his group after he fled from Hanbury Street. Further there was a very strong circumstantial case based upon DNA and scene of crime evidence. As I have indicated, the offender gave no account to the police or the jury of his involvement in the events surrounding the attack upon the deceased in answer to the case presented against him. 
     
      
    14 The offender is a young man born on 26 June 1989. He was aged 16 at the time of the offence. He was born in Papua New Guinea and has three siblings, two younger who reside with their parents in the Newcastle area and one older brother who is in PNG. The offender’s father describes his family as being within the middle to upper class in PNG. He is a person of some status and authority in his homeland. The family first came to Newcastle in 2000, when the offender was aged 11 years, so that his father could pursue a course of study. They returned to PNG in 2002 but returned again to Australia in 2004. The father saw their time in Australia as a good opportunity for the children to further their education. He hopes that eventually the family might obtain Australian citizenship. They are presently in Australia on visas that are valid until the end of this year. 
     
      
    15 The offender’s upbringing was uneventful and he has a strong supportive extended family in PNG. He has been described as an average student with no behavioural problems although he was suspended in Year 7 for fighting. He says that this was a response to racial taunts. He has continued his education while in custody and attained his Year 10 certificate. He appears motivated to continue with studies and self-improvement courses. A large number of certificates and reports were tendered on his behalf. His behaviour while in custody has been good. 
     
      
    16 A psychiatric report indicates that he has a stable mental state with no evidence of any disorders. He has been coping in custody and is supported by his parents. He has been attending psychological counselling on a weekly basis and has participated in AA meetings. Psychological testing did not display any anti-social attitudes or matters of concern. 
     
      
    17 A number of testimonials relating to the offender and his family were placed before the Court. Most of them were prepared for the Children’s Court in respect of a bail application but I am prepared to accept that what is said is still applicable. They speak of the high regard in which persons in the community both here and in PNG hold the offender and his family. The offender wrote a letter to the Court. It should be noted that material in such a letter could be given little weight when the writer does not give evidence. However, apart from acknowledging the effect of the death of the deceased upon the deceased’s family and containing an expression of sympathy for them, the letter is little more than an assertion of his innocence and the guilt of others who are still at liberty. 
     
      
    18 The family has a strong religious background. The offender’s father gave evidence before the Court, as did the pastor of the church that the family attends. It seems that when they first came to the Newcastle area the whole family regularly attended services and the offender was a participant in a children’s programme organised by the church. At that time he was considered by the pastor to have been a “very well behaved young man”. When the family returned to Australia on the second occasion, the family attended the same church but not the offender. It seems that he formed a strong relationship with a group of friends who were not part of the congregation but were members of the rugby league team for which he played. At the age of 15 the offender began drinking alcohol because of this association notwithstanding that he was encouraged not to do so by his father. He also started to go out at night with these friends. His father was concerned about this behaviour but considered that it was for the offender to decide what he did with his life. 
     
      
    19 Since the commission of the offence and his incarceration the offender has conceded to the pastor that he “strayed away from his values” at the time of the offending. He has, however, expressed a recommitment to his church and his faith. He has encouraged his younger brother to remain associated with the church notwithstanding that he is playing with a local rugby league team. The offender’s parents remain committed to him and visit him every week. 
     
      
    20 The offender has no prior criminal record. However, there is evidence before me of other acts of violence by the offender to young persons apparently when he was in a rage about some perceived wrongdoing committed by them against him. One of those allegations is that the offender broke a bottle and chased a youth who was trying to escape him on a bicycle. Some of the persons named in these incidents as associates of the offender were members of the Cheetah club and present at the time of the deceased’s death. I have not heard from the persons who made the statements containing these allegations but on its face the material appears to me to be credible. I am not prepared to find that he was of good character so far as his use of violence is concerned. I am not prepared to find that the present offence was totally out of character for the offender at that time. I do accept, however, that his behaviour was to some extent a result of the company he was then keeping and that he had, in his words “moved away from the values” that had been instilled in him by his parents and through the church. This was aberrant behaviour that, for whatever reason, arose because of his involvement with members of the Cheetah Rugby League Club. 
     
      
    21 Insofar as the offender has now broken with those associates and re-established connections with his family and church I believe that it is conduct that is unlikely to reoccur. But it is still a matter of concern that the offender could, for some reason that I do not fully understand, act with such violence as he displayed to the deceased. I do accept that there was an element of peer group pressures arising from his involvement with the other youths and I do not believe that the offender was the only person responsible for all the injuries suffered by the deceased. It may well be the case that the fatal injuries were inflicted because the offender lost face in the presence of his companions by being bested by the deceased. 
     
      
    22 On this night the offender was part of a group who believed that in some way they were acting from a sense of solidarity as a team of sportsmen as they answered to the call of “Cheetahs”. In reality they were nothing better than a gang of young thugs most of whom were under the influence of alcohol. There is nothing to suggest that in any way either the deceased or Mr Stevenson incited or provoked the confrontation that occurred or the resulting violence other than they were probably somewhat noisy, as they unfortunately happened to pass the group. As is not unusual, the group pretended to have some justification for taking umbrage at the behaviour of the two men. There was some suggestion that the two had requested or demanded beer or that they had disturbed the mother of one of the group by making too much noise. The simple fact is that the group wanted to pick a fight. I have no doubt that the deceased and Mr Stevenson simply wanted to be left alone to further enjoy their night together. 
     
      
    23 This Court should make it perfectly clear that every member of that group should be thoroughly ashamed of his conduct and appalled at the outcome of their loutish behaviour. They disgraced themselves and the football team for whom they played. Although only the offender was charged and stood trial, all the persons who went into Hanbury Street are to some degree morally responsible for the death of the deceased. It should be of considerable concern to this community that supposedly worthwhile young men, members of a local football team, under the legal drinking age can be out at night in a group consuming alcohol in a public place and acting aggressively to some perfectly innocent citizens who they happen to come across. Unfortunately this type of behaviour is not uncommon and the sentence imposed upon the offender must to a significant degree denounce public violence by drunken youths and act as a deterrent to others who might think it appropriate to act in a similar way. 
     
      
    24 As this is an offence to which a standard non-parole period applies, it is necessary to determine where in the range of seriousness the offence committed by the offender falls taking into account those matters in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that affect the objective seriousness of the offence. The Crown submitted that the Court should find that it was at least in the mid-range of seriousness although conceding that the injury was not inflicted with an intent to kill. In Apps v R [2006] NSWCCA 290 it was held that the standard non-parole was to apply to an offence of the middle range of seriousness across the spectrum of offences giving rise to a conviction for murder, the state of mind being merely one of the relevant considerations in determining the objective seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    25 The offence is a serious example of homicide notwithstanding the Crown’s concession. The offender must at least have intended to inflict grievous bodily harm of a very severe kind. He might not have intended to strike the deceased in the throat, but he armed himself with what was a very dangerous weapon and struck at the deceased with a forceful blow in the direction of his torso. The consequences of such a blow could have only been very serious injury indeed and the offender must have intended this result when he deliberately broke the bottle. This was an unprovoked attack on an unarmed person. The offender was one of the first persons into Hanbury Street, he was the first to use violence and, whatever else may have occurred, I have no doubt that the offender was the instigator and the principal in the attack upon the deceased. 
     
      
    26 I accept that the offence was not planned and, therefore, it is not in the most serious category of killing. However, there are aggravating factors present. Although the offender was not going about in public armed, he did obtain a very dangerous weapon intending to attack the deceased when the deceased was unprepared and unable to defend himself. It was an act that was as cowardly as it was brutal. The offence was in company, and it was committed in circumstances giving rise to a considerable affront to public order in general and to the ordinary members of the public who were lawfully in the vicinity of the club. 
     
      
    27 I know nothing of the offender’s mental state at the time except what is disclosed from his actions. There is no evidence that he was intoxicated to any significant degree. There is nothing in the psychological or psychiatric reports that is relevant in the determination of the objective seriousness of the offence. The offence was not an aberration at the time although, as I have indicated, he was behaving around this period in a way that was contrary to the values that had been instilled in him by his family and church because of his association with the persons from the football club. 
     
      
    28 In my opinion the offence falls within the midrange of objective seriousness and, therefore, prima facie the standard non-parole period applies except so far as it should be varied by reason of subjective factors and the presence or otherwise of special circumstances. Clearly the most significant factor is the offender’s age both at the time of the commission of the offence and now at the time of sentencing. Section 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act applies but there is little in the stated principles that has particular significance in the sentencing task before me so serious is the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced.29 Generally when sentencing a person of the offender’s age a court gives predominance to rehabilitation so far as it can do so consistently with the other purposes of punishment. General deterrence may play a lesser role because of the need to encourage and assist the young offender. But where the offence is one that arises from conduct frequently committed by young persons and is of grave seriousness, general deterrence may have to be appropriately reflected in the sentence. I have already indicated my opinion that general deterrence is important in dealing with offences of public violence committed by groups of young males. Further the use of bottles or glasses to inflict serious injuries on other persons in places where alcohol is being consumed is itself all too common. Therefore the court should clearly denounce such conduct and seek to deter it by the imposition of severe sentences where the injuries inflicted are grave. 
     
      
    30 There is positive evidence of the rehabilitation of the offender by his commitment to return to the church and readopt his family’s values. He has been working positively in custody to address personal issues and continue his education. It is of concern that he refuses to acknowledge his guilt. Even though there is evidence of compassion for the deceased’s family, there is no evidence of contrition or remorse for any of his conduct. It may simply be the fact that he cannot bring himself to accept what he has done. Yet this is not a case where there is any need for specific deterrence to play a significant role in determining the appropriate sentence. I have indicated that, although he has no criminal record, I am not prepared to accept that at the time of the offence he was of good character so far as his use of violence is concerned. 
     
      
    31 It is clear that the offence is so serious and in light of the standard non-parole period that a very lengthy sentence must be imposed upon the offender notwithstanding his youth and prospects for rehabilitation. He will not be released from custody until he is middle aged. However, it seems to me that I should depart from the standard non-parole period in this case by reason of the offender’s youth and to pay more regard to his rehabilitation than I might have done had he been an adult. Further, it seems to me that I should take into account, that although he was not of good character at the time of the offence because of his other acts of violence, that this was a period of his life in which he was under peer pressure that is not likely to reoccur so that he is unlikely to offend again. 
     
      
    32 This is a case where special circumstances should be found by reason of the offender’s age and in order to promote his rehabilitation. However, I must keep in mind the standard non-parole period as a guidepost to the appropriate sentence. I cannot reduce the non-parole period by factors personal to the offender such that it does not truly reflect the objective seriousness of the offending or bear a proper relationship with the standard non-parole period fixed by Parliament for the offence of murder, even where the offence is committed by a juvenile. I think that it is fair to note that the non-parole period is longer than I would have imposed but for the standard non-parole period provisions. 
     
      
    33 I have received a victim impact statement that was read aloud by the Crown Prosecutor. It should be understood that I have not used the contents of that statement to increase the sentence that I believe is otherwise appropriate. However, I appreciate the terrible consequences for the family of the deceased as a result of the loss of his life in such brutal and wholly unnecessary circumstances. They have the Court’s sympathy. 
     
      
    34 Before I pronounce the sentence, I should indicate that a question has arisen as to whether the Court should order that any part of the offender’s sentence should be served as a juvenile offender pursuant to s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. By reason of s 19(2) the offender shall not be eligible to serve his sentence as a juvenile offender after he has attained the age of 21 years. Section 19(3) relevantly provides that a person who is sentenced to imprisonment in respect of a serious children’s indictable offence is not eligible to serve a sentence of imprisonment as a juvenile offender after the person has attained the age of 18 years, unless the sentencing court is satisfied that there are special circumstances justifying detention of the person as a juvenile offender after that age. 
     
      
    35 The offence of murder is a serious children’s indictable offence and, therefore, unless the Court is satisfied that there are special circumstances the offender cannot remain as a juvenile offender once he has attained the age of 18 years on 27 June next. Section 11(4) provides that in determining whether there are special circumstances for the purposes of subsection (3), the court may have regard to the degree of vulnerability of the person, the availability of appropriate services or programs at the place the person will serve the sentence of imprisonment, and any other matter that the court thinks fit. 
     
      
    36 There is nothing in the reports to show that the offender is particularly vulnerable: he is a fit, strong young man without any personality defects or disorders. As I have already indicated, he has been behaving himself well in the juvenile detention centre and has been participating in educational and personal development courses. It is in the need for the offender to maintain the relationships he has forged with counsellors and others that seems to me to amount to special circumstances in the present case particularly in light of the very lengthy term of imprisonment he must serve before he can be released. The next few years are important for him developmentally. He needs the time to secure a reasonable education and some goals that will assist him throughout his period of custody and later life. He is not a threat to any person at the centre, either staff or other inmates. 
     
      
    37 The offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 15 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 6 years and 6 months. The sentence is to commence from 8 July 2005 and the non-parole period expires on 7 January 2021, the date upon which the offender is eligible to be released to parole. 
     
      
    38 I direct that the offender serve that part of his sentence until he turns 21 years of age as a juvenile offender. 
     
      
    39 For those who do not understand that, it means that, in effect, the offender cannot be released to parole until 7 January 2021, thereafter he will serve a term of 6 years and 6 months on parole. 
     
      
    40 The Crown made an application that I make an order authorising the publication or broadcasting of the offender’s name. That application is refused and I publish my reasons.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Thanh Hung Hoang, appears today for sentence in relation to an offence that he committed on 10 July 2006, contrary to s 307.2 Criminal Code Act 1995. The offence that he committed was importing a marketable quantity of border controlled drug and the particulars of that offence are that he did import a substance, namely heroin, and the quantity imported being a marketable quantity, namely 86.4 grams, was contrary to s 307.2(1) Criminal Code (Cth). The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for twenty five years or a fine of $550,000, or both. A marketable quantity of heroin is two grams, a commercial quantity is 1.5 kilograms.2 The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 10 July 2006 and the sentences that I foreshadowed will date from that date.3 The facts in relation to the matter are set out in a statement of facts which I shall briefly summarise. Before I deal with the facts as stated, however, in the facts sheets, as it is described, in my view it is important in this matter to deal with some aspects of the background of the offender, as they inform the circumstances of the commission of the offence. As I understand the matter the offender, who was born on 29 August 1980, was born in Vietnam. He came to this country in 2002 with his mother and his then step-father. His mother and father separated in the mid 1990s and his mother remarried in about 1997 or 1998. It was the wish of his step-father that the family migrate to Australia. The offender was in a relationship, or at least had a romantic attachment to a young woman in Vietnam and was unhappy about coming to this country, but did so at the request of his mother. He had lived in Australia off and on for a period of approximately four years before his arrest in relation to this matter. According to the statement of facts the offender at the time of his arrest was an Australian citizen and it is revealed in the fact sheet that between 22 December 2003 and the present he had travelled to and from Vietnam on eight occasions. I will deal with those circumstances later.4 It was thus the case that the offender on 10 July 2006 was returning from Vietnam having departed for Vietnam from Sydney on 5 June 2006. He filled in the relevant forms that are required on entry to Australia and ticked the inbound passenger card in the box marked “No” for the question asking him if he had brought in illicit drugs to this country. He was spoken to by a Customs Officer and asked a number of questions about the purposes of his trips, mobile phones he had in his possession, and other matters. The details of that conversation conducted in English, apparently, are set out in the statement of facts.5 The offender at the time of coming to the Customs checkout, so to speak, and at the time of the questioning, was carrying a rolled up blanket, inside a clear wrapped package. The item was subject to xray examination and it appeared that inside the blanket was a rolled up jacket containing packets of an unknown substance. Subsequently it was discovered that there were four packets of what ultimately was found to be white powder containing heroin, within the white jacket. 6 The offender was subsequently subjected to a frisk search and nothing further was found. Australian Federal police officers were notified, the offender was spoken to at the airport but declined to participate in a formal recorded interview, and was searched again, and then was taken to Mascot Police Station, which is an establishment run by the New South Wales Police Service, to be charged in relation to the white powder substance that was found inside the jacket. He was told at the police station that he was going to be subject of strip search. He sought in an inadequate way to resist that search complaining of being cold, and other matters, but clearly his reluctance to be strip searched, putting aside matters of modesty, was governed by the fact that he had hidden within his underpants (he was wearing two pairs of underpants at the time) further packages of white substance which subsequently were found to contain heroin. In fact three such packages were secreted, as I understand it, sandwiched between the first and second pair of underpants; the packages consisted of what appeared to be condoms filled with a quantity of compressed white powder. The Australian Federal Police of course were notified and the various packages were ultimately the subject of analysis; four plastic packets removed from the offender’s jacket were found to have a combined gross weight of 66.5 grams, the three packages found in his underwear were found to have a combined gross weight of 143.1 grams, giving a total gross weight of 209.6 grams. The average purity of the heroin located within the powder was approximately 39.5 per cent, and the total weight of pure heroin was 86.4 grams. The street value of the heroin is estimated at between $72,000 and $216,000, I assume depending upon price fluctuations and of course the extent to which the heroin is cut, or broken down. It is thought that, depending upon the purity, the amount of heroin in his possession varied between just over 1000 and just over 3000 “street deals”. The wholesale value of the heroin seizure was $42,315 calculated on the figure of $10,000 per ounce for heroin of this quality in New South Wales in March 2006. 7 The offender at the time of the commission of this offence had no prior criminal convictions. In respect of his background, other than the outline that I have given before, whilst in Australia the offender has undertaken some work as a waiter and also done welding work, working, as I understand it, as a contract worker having learnt the trade of welding from his father. He has apparently had periods of unemployment and of course there are the various trips to Vietnam, to which I made reference, which have obviously interrupted the opportunity for the offender to work in Australia. There is no evidence before me whilst in Victoria that the offender was engaged in any employment, although that is possible. 8 With regard to the various trips to Vietnam, I note that he first went back to Vietnam as I understand it in late December 2003, returning on 22 February 2004. There was another trip for approximately a month in later 2004, a trip of approximately a month in early 2005, and then a trip to Vietnam where he stayed in Vietnam for two months in April, June 2005, and a later trip of approximately three months between September and December 2005. Apparently he came back to Sydney on 4 December 2005 and returned five days later to Vietnam and remained in Vietnam for approximately three months before returning to Australia. He made a trip to Vietnam between April and May of 2006 and ultimately the trip that led to his arrest on 10 June 2006, which involved a stay of just over one month in Vietnam.9 The evidence available to me reveals that the offender had been, whilst in Australia, a heroin user, smoking heroin, and paying up to seventy dollars per day for heroin that he used. In the period of time that he was in Australia he lived largely with his mother, although apparently there was some disruption between the mother and the step-father. At one stage the mother and step-father, from what I understood of the material available to me, separated. This left the offender with family members in accommodation in Marrickville where the offender’s family first moved when they settled in Australia. The evidence before me reveals that at the time of his arrest in relation to the current matter the offender had debts with financial institutions totalling in excess of $20,000. The offender in his evidence before me also had significant debts that were owed to members of his family from whom he had borrowed money for, amongst other reasons, travel costs to Vietnam. Of course, the number of visits in that three year period that I have outlined before his arrest, raised suspicions about his conduct in so far as those suspicions might inform his role in this particular offence. 10 There is, it should be fairly said however, no evidence of a prior importation of heroin. Ultimately when one considers aspects relating to his family connections in Vietnam, his home-sickness for Vietnam having come to Australia at a relatively mature age, twenty two, and the presence of his now wife in Vietnam, these matters provide to my mind reasonable explanations for his travel that do not necessarily reflect upon the circumstances of the commission of this offence.11 In evidence he stated that when he left Australia to travel to Vietnam in early June 2006 he had no intention of bringing heroin or other prohibited drugs back to Australia. He states that he was approached by a man to bring the heroin back into the country during his last visit. He gave evidence of the fact that whilst in Australia he smoked heroin, in Vietnam he did not use heroin out of deference to his partner, but that on this last visit to Vietnam he started smoking heroin, or using heroin and it was in these circumstances that he was introduced to the man, Bac, as he is named in the papers, who the offender claims recruited him for the importation of heroin into the country.12 It is quite clear when one examines it that the offender gave some unsatisfactory answers relating to his personal finances, but on any view of it, bearing in mind the facts of the matter regarding his personal finances are difficult to ascertain, he clearly was significantly in debt at the time of his arrest. This, to my mind of course, raised the issue of whether this in itself provided sufficient motivation, in addition to any need for heroin, for him to principally arrange the importation of the heroin found in his possession, in other words, to organise to bring heroin into the country so that he himself could sell it to distributors or other persons, to obtain the profit from the importation. He was unable to tell the Court, or refused to tell the Court, the cost of heroin in Vietnam. I found this evidence scarcely believable, given such matters as the natural inquisitiveness one might have thought to compare the cost for him of heroin in Australia to that of purchasing heroin and acquiring it in Vietnam. One might have thought he would have had a natural inquisitiveness as to what benefits were to be derived, given his knowledge of the cost of heroin in Australia, by importing heroin from Vietnam. Although there is no evidence on this particular matter one would have thought as a matter of commonsense that there are substantial profits for those who bring heroin from Vietnam and other places in south-east Asia into Australia. One would have expected for a range of reasons that the cost of the drug in Vietnam, for example, would be considerably less than in Australia where the market is much more appealing. Of course the country of origin of these drugs is much closer, of course, to the place of manufacture. Even on the offender’s version that he was to be paid $11,000 for bringing the drug into the country. It is clear that there is a significantly greater value for heroin in Australia than in Vietnam. This is to my mind self evident. One would expect that for those who were to profit from this importation if the offender was telling the truth about what he was to receive, the profit for them would be much greater than what he was to be paid.13 The Crown’s position is that he was a principal in his own right and it submitted on the evidence that the offender has failed to discharge the obligation upon him on the balance of probabilities to establish that he was relevantly, to use a phrase, “a courier”, assuming that such a classification serves any purpose for sentencing purposes.14 There are, as I have said, some unsatisfactory aspects of the offender’s evidence turning upon his financing of the trips to Vietnam. However, bearing in mind there is no evidence of him previously being involved in the importation of heroin, the evidence ultimately reveals the simple fact that the offender was in dire financial difficulty, and this provided a motivation for his involvement. He believed that being paid for this importation would alleviate at least some of his financial woes. He also said he was a regular user of heroin and he thought that the might be able to get access to some of the heroin he brought into the country, although I doubt very much, given its great value, that this would have been so. Eleven thousand dollars, to my mind, would have been on the basis of his own version, sufficient benefit for him for his role. The sporadic use of the drug by the offender, both in Australia and in Vietnam reveals to me that whilst the offender may have had some dependence on heroin from time to time it could not reasonably be concluded that he was addicted to it. 15 The report of Dr Gilandos, the psychologist who examined the offender does provide some insight, however, into his account of sporadic use of heroin. It would appear, both having regard to the evidence of the offender in his affidavit and orally before me, and in the history he gave Dr Gilandos, that the offender felt some isolation in Australia, given the fact that he had grown up in Vietnam and was most unhappy whilst here and felt particularly isolated being separated from a young woman with whom he was romantically involved and who he later married in late 2005 in Vietnam. It seems to me that this feeling of isolation may have provided some reason for him to turn to the use of heroin to relieve his despondency or anxiety; his claim that he did not use heroin in Vietnam except on the last occasion he was there, may be supported by the fact that whilst in Vietnam he would appear to have been more settled in a psychological or emotional sense, and thus less tempted to use heroin to assuage his feelings of sadness or depression. The offender further claimed that one of his reasons for agreeing to bring the heroin into the country was because of some fear of harm that might be caused to family members, particularly his wife in Vietnam, or other members of his family. This claim of the offender I do not accept, and I have taken into account the rejection of this claim in my assessment of the offender’s credibility generally, and the offender’s description of his role in this matter. 16 The facts of the matter are, as revealed in the account given to Dr Gilandos, that the offender became involved in this matter, whatever be his role, because he was desperate for money and perhaps because he yielded to temptation, to use his words. 17 Taking into account all the evidence and all that has been put very skilfully by the learned Crown Prosecutor and Mr Ozon for the offender, taking into account of course the reservations I have about some aspects of the evidence of the offender, I have concluded ultimately that whilst clearly the offender was the importer of the drugs I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender did so at the behest of others for personal profit. If this is to mark him as a courier, so be it, but I think the reality is that the offender has established a role as I have described it in my own words. Whilst his significant debt to family members and financial institutions was a powerful motivation for him to conceive a plan to bring heroin in for himself, to sell to others, bearing in mind I am unable to determine precisely what the heroin would have cost in Vietnam, bearing in mind there is no evidence that the offender had the financial means to acquire the heroin for the importation, bearing in mind that I doubt very much that the offender would have been able to acquire this heroin in Vietnam on credit, particularly given the risks of detection and the inability of the offender to repay any debt in Vietnam if detected, it seems, taking into account the offender’s own version of events, that the offender undertook this task in circumstances where it was ultimately financed by other persons. I note also that should he have been detected, there was an inability of persons in Vietnam, to whom he may have been in debt if he had purchased the heroin on credit, to enforce the debt whilst he was in Australia. 18 I have also taken into account in the scheme of things that given the wholesale cost of the heroin, the claimed fee for which he was prepared to perform this task is not an absurdly low fee or one which is not commensurate with the cost of such a service, particularly bearing in mind some evidence in other cases about these matters, some of which have been referred to me.19 Of course I have also considered the possibility that the offender was simply partners with a number of people, or at least one other person in this importation. However this conclusion if it was to be reached would be a matter of filling voids in the evidence with speculation, which is of course a highly undesirable process in fact finding in any situation and particularly in sentencing.20 In relation to this particular matter as the Crown has properly pointed out I am required to have regard to matters set out in Part 1B Crimes Act 1914, particularly ss 16A Crimes Act. I note, of course, what’s been said about that provision in a number of authorities including those authorities cited by the Crown in the written submissions. I am required under Commonwealth law to impose a sentence which is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the case. I am required to take into account the matters that are set out in s16A(2) that are relevant and known to the Court. As to the nature and circumstances of the offence, the matter described in s 16A(2)(a) I have set out earlier the facts of the case and the nature and circumstances of the offence. In reaching the conclusions I have I have taken into account what has been said about this matter in Regina v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270, and I have also noted what has been said on a number of occasions by the Court of Criminal Appeal relating to persons who are performing the role of the offender, not receiving any particular leniency for their role short of being a principal. Because, as has been pointed out, without people such as this offender prepared to take these risks the trade in narcotics would not exist. I have taken into account what the Crown has said about the matter.21 In relation to the matter there are no other offences to be taken into account, nor does the offence form part of a course of conduct such as a series of criminal acts of a same or similar character. There is no relevant victim, nor fortunately was there any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence because of the fine action of the Australian Customs Service in detecting the offender. It must be fairly said, however, about the offender that when one examines the detail of the conversations set out in the statement of facts, the offender clearly was a person under suspicion given the fact that the Customs Service would have known before or at the time of his entry into Australia that he had made a large number of trips to Vietnam, which of itself, would have aroused reasonable concerns in all the circumstances. 22 In relation to the matter the offender has expressed regret for his involvement in the offence, but one feels in reality such contrition has as has been expressed is more arising out of the fact that he was detected, rather than a deep concern for his conduct. That having been said I do note his expression of contrition in this Court and I also note what has been said to Dr Gilandos about his regret for his involvement in the matter. The offender in speaking to the Probation and Parole Service in relation to the matter gave some conflicting accounts, although to be fair, one such interview occurred in circumstances where he did not have the benefit of an interpreter. Such contrition as is evident is a relatively minor matter in this sentencing exercise.23 In respect of the plea of guilty I note the fact that there is a plea of guilty. I note what has been said about the role of the plea of guilty in sentencing, particularly under Commonwealth law and I note, of course, what the High Court has said about this aspect of the matter in the two authorities cited by the Crown of Siganto v Regina (1998) 194 CLR 656, and of course Cameron v Regina (2002) 1987 ALR 65. Although, from memory, as I have noted the extracts in the Crown’s submissions, Cameron was a decision from the West Australian Court of Criminal Appeal in respect of matters arising under West Australian law. I accept, for the purposes of sentencing, that the plea does itself represent some evidence of remorse and acceptance of responsibility by the offender and a willingness by the offender to facilitate the course of justice, bearing in mind the plea of guilty was entered at the first reasonable opportunity. 24 In relation to the issue of the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty I note what the Crown has said about this matter. In New South Wales the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, identifies a range of discount that may be given as a discrete discount to recognise the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty. I note of course that Markarian v Regina, decided in May of 2005, criticised discrete discounts for particular aspects of sentencing and promoted the concept of instinctive synthesis. However, as I understand the matter, it does not in its terms prohibit recognition of a discrete discount for cooperation, for example, both past and future, nor for a discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty. There is a body of authority of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal subsequent to Thomson and Houlton and of course the decision of Sharma decided in 2002, that it is proper, or appropriate, or within legitimate sentencing discretion, to recognise a discrete discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty in Commonwealth sentencing. In fact I note in passing that at least one of the comparative sentences raised by the Crown in its very helpful written submissions involved an exercise where the Court of Criminal Appeal in dealing with a matter for sentencing under Commonwealth law, recognised a discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty.25 Be that as it may, I do not propose to specifically identify a fixed discount, but in the context of the decision of Thomson and Houlton, bearing in mind the plea of guilty was entered on 30 August 2006 which is a month and twenty days after his arrest, and the fact that the Crown accepts that the plea was entered at the first reasonable opportunity, the offender is entitled to recognition to the full extent of the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty in this particular case.26 I note the offender’s lack of cooperation with the law enforcement agencies at the time of his apprehension, but that is a matter that does not aggravate the criminality in this particular matter. I note I must give full effect to the deterrent effect of the sentence, particularly for crimes of this type, to discourage both this offender and others from committing like offences, and of course these matters are well enshrined in early decisions of superior courts. I also need to ensure the offender is adequately punished for this offence. 27 With regard to his character, antecedents, age, means, physical and mental condition, I have already noted he did not have prior criminal convictions, and certain aspects of his background. Dr Gilandos undertook psychological testing of him and recorded some history related to his health. The offender, although twenty six years of age, is, to quote the report of Dr Gilandos “a young man with some problematic health difficulties. He has a range of medical complaints and they include, significantly, what appear to be severe respiratory problems”. I am informed in fact at the present time the offender is in some form of isolation not for his own protection as such, but because of a belief or a fear that he may suffer from some illness such as tuberculosis. 28 I note in relation to his current circumstances that he is receiving 25 milligrams methadone and has been receiving methadone since being taken into custody, consistent with the history of drug usage, prior to the commission of this offence. He has claimed to Dr Gilandos, although he did not expressly claim it to me, that he is fearful whilst in custody, and presented to Dr Gilandos in a distressed state on one occasion, although somewhat more composed when in the presence of a female interpreter on a later occasion. It should be fairly said, for the record, that the offender is of quite slight build, he is not tall and apparently he weighs fifty five kilograms. He is a person who appears much younger than his stated years. If I had been asked to estimate his age when he came into the dock I would have said somewhere around sixteen or seventeen years of age. I mean him no disrespect, but Dr Gilandos suggested he is “effeminate in appearance” and I would concur with that assessment. As I said, the offender is not in any protective custody, however there can be no doubt that through the course of his time in custody the offender by reason of his physical appearance, his physical dimensions and his health, will be vulnerable whilst in custody in a range of ways. There is no suggestion that he is a violent man. He is a person Dr Gilandos describes as “passive” in nature and there is nothing in his background to suggest otherwise. Dr Gilandos’ assessment of the matter, confining the matter to issues within the doctor’s professional skills, is that the offender is a person within the average scale of intelligence, is functionally illiterate in English, although he apparently does speak some English, was assessed on the Beck Depression inventory to be “severely depressed” although in part this would be reactive to his current circumstances, and under the Beck Anxiety inventory is said to be moderately anxious at the present time.29 Doctor Gilandos, who, I must say, is a very experienced clinical psychologist and not just a psychologist who specialises in forensic reports, formed the view that the prisoner, in accordance with DSMIV criteria suffers from what he describes as chronic adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. There is in the history and from the evidence of the prisoner some support for the proposition the prisoner is a person who has suffered at least some anxiety and some depressive reaction to his circumstances in Australia being dislocated from his native culture. I do not believe that the depressed mood observed by the doctor is solely reactive to his current custodial situation.30 Aside from of course the commission of this offence, there is no evidence of anti-social personality disorder. The psychologist claimed that the offence is “best understood as the prisoner’s maladaptive attempt to treat his depression by heroin compounded by debt due to this drug habit”. This analysis is not something with which I can entirely agree although the background of drug use and his financial circumstances were relevant to bringing him into the plan to commit this offence.31 It is important to bear in mind in assessing is prospects of rehabilitation and also assessing his past character, that his use of heroin in the past apparently was not funded by criminal activities, other than of course this particular activity. 32 I note the assessment of Dr Gilandos that the prisoner is a dependant individual and I can accept that he is a person who may be easily swayed and even intimidated by others. The doctor expressed a conclusion that the offence was motivated more by psychiatric rather than criminal factors. With that assessment I cannot agree. However, I accept the need for care to be taken in the future treatment of the prisoner and the treatment plan proposed by Dr Gilandos involves a number of matters that need to address including drug usage and dependency matters, psychological or psychiatric matters as well as matters relating to literacy and education as well as re-establishing family support.33 In that regard I note the evidence of his mother who expresses shock and surprise at his involvement in this offence. Her evidence supports the prisoner’s claims of connection with Vietnam through his wife and other family members. I accept that his mother and the prisoner’s family will continue to support the prisoner and there will be that support available to him when he is released from custody.34 There is some history that the prisoner has the capacity to undertake employment with the skills that he has acquired in the past although his work history in Australia has been dislocated considerably by as many trips back to Vietnam. The prisoner is said by Dr Gilandos to have some insight at least into the circumstances in which he committed the offence with which I am concerned and I trust that is so.35 In relation to this matter I regard the prospects of the rehabilitation of the prisoner as positive, if he is given appropriate professional support and guidance. There is nobody who is dependant upon him other than, I suppose emotionally, his wife in Vietnam. But there is little she can do about the situation from that distance and whether she is able to come to Australia now that he has been convicted of this matter is very much a moot point.36 In sentencing the prisoner I note of course that I am required to impose a term of imprisonment only if I am satisfied there are no other sentences appropriate in all the circumstances and clearly that is the case here. I propose to impose a head sentence of greater than three years thus I will fix a non-parole period. With regard to the non-parole period I note what has been said about the general range of non-parole period by relationship to the head sentence in cases such as Bernier cited in the Crown’s written submissions. The fixing of a non-parole period is of course very much a discretionary exercise and involves consideration of a range of matters discussed in many cases. In this particular case I believe the prisoner needs an extended period of time to adjust to community living. I also bear in mind the need for the prisoner to have professional assistance in a range of areas, many of which are identified by Dr Gilandos. 37 In fixing the appropriate sentence and also to some extent the non-parole period I note the fact that the prisoner’s circumstances of custody will be difficult by reason of his physical appearance. Of course I am not concluding as a fact that he is in any danger, nor have the Corrective Services officials, much better qualified than I in these circumstances, thought that he is in any particular danger at the present time. However, for a young man of his background, of his appearance, with his physical qualities, prison will be a daunting and intimidating and difficult experience for him and I trust that the sentence I impose will have the effect of deterring him from future breach of Australian law.38 I have been provided with some statistics, most of them pre-repeal, in fact all of them pre-repeal s 16G Crimes Act. I have also been given a range of what I call comparative sentences by the Crown with three particular judgments provided and in a table prepared by the Public Defenders submitted by counsel for the accused. I have taken into account the range of sentences that appear to be available for offences of this type. Of course no two cases are exactly the same. Subjective circumstances and other matters personal to an offender will vary from case to case and the objective facts will vary of course from case to case. 39 As the Crown properly pointed out sentencing is not reduced to some mathematical precision based upon the weight of the drug. To use my words, we do not have as yet a Hammurabi Code that fixes a particular sentence for a particular quantity of drug imported into the country. But the range of sentences imposed by superior courts to this and the guidance provided in a range of cases including of course the guideline judgment of Wong and Leung, which was struck down by the High Court, provides some assistance in ensuring that an appropriate sentence falls within legitimate sentencing discretion. Naturally of course I factor into my consideration that sentences imposed before early 2003 had available to them a reduction available under s 16G which is no longer available and of course in that regard I note a number of decisions dealing with the appropriate approach to sentencing for Commonwealth matters post repeal of s16G. I need only cite the very helpful judgment of Howie J and R v Studenikin (2004) 60 NSWLR, particular at paragraphs 68-72 and of course the judgment of Chief Judge at Common Law in R v Mas Ravadavia (2004) 61 NSWLR 63.40 I have noted, as is obvious from my remarks both directly and indirectly, the submissions of the parties which have been most helpful. The Crown’s written submissions were, as usual, excellent and I am very grateful for the assistance they have provided.41 In the end obviously as I have said a term of imprisonment must be imposed and the term of imprisonment will be as I have foreshadowed. 42 In relation to the offence to which you have pleaded guilty you are convicted. In respect of that particular offence you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 6 years which is to commence on 10 July 2006 and will expire on 9 July 2012. In respect of that sentence I have determined that there be a non-parole period of 3 years and 4 months. That sentence will likewise commence on 10 July 2006 and will expire on 9 November 2009. In fixing that sentence of course I have had regard to s 19AB Crimes Act 1914. Whether you are released to parole will be a matter for the parole authorities. You will need to be of good behaviour whilst in custody for that to occur although there is no suggestion that you are a security or other problem for the authorities. When you are released to parole if you commit offences whilst on parole you may have your parole revoked and may be committed back to custody. I will ask that your warrant be marked with a recommendation that the Corrective Services officials take all reasonable steps to ensure your safety whilst in custody. 43 Do you understand the sentence that I have imposed Mr Hoang?44 OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.45 HIS HONOUR: You understand that you will be eligible for release to parole on 9 November 2009?46 OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: In my opinion, pursuant to the Court’s power under r77 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, there being no express rule dealing with the question of identifying separate issues, this Court should make an order in the form of order 2 in the application dated 31 October 2006, namely an order that the questions of the standing of the Applicant and the competency of the application dated 7 August 2006 be heard and determined separately and in advance of all other issues in the proceeding. 
     
      
    2 It is not appropriate at this stage to determine the question of the admissibility of expert evidence. There are two reasons for that. One is that if we were to launch into that matter then this bench would be part heard and it is by no means clear when the particular members of this bench could be reconstituted. Secondly, there actually have been no submissions before the Court in writing about the issue of admissibility. It does pose some difficult questions about expert evidence and there are no submissions seeking to justify the admissibility of Professor Finlay’s report, to which the report of Dr Chapel is a reply. 
     
      
    3 Accordingly, I believe that the preliminary questions should be limited to the jurisdictional and standing issues that have been raised in the submissions. 
     
      
    4 BASTEN JA: I agree. 
     
      
    5 HISLOP J: I agree.

    1 BEAZLEY JA: Michael Lenard and Michael Fail were each found guilty by a jury of one count of ‘Demand Money with Menaces’ pursuant to s 99(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (the Crimes Act) and one count of ‘Do an Act with Intent to Influence Witness’ contrary to s 323(a) of the Crimes Act. The offence under s 99(1) carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. The offence under s 323(a) of the Crimes Act carries a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment.  
     
      
    2 In respect of the ‘Influence Witness’ offence, the trial judge, his Honour Hulme DCJ, sentenced Fail to a term of imprisonment of 18 months to commence on 3 February 2005 and to expire on 2 August 2006, with a balance of term of six months to commence on 3 August 2006 and to expire on 2 February 2007. In respect of the ‘Demand Money with Menaces’ offence, his Honour sentenced Fail to a term of imprisonment of one year and three months, to commence on 3 August 2005 and to expire on 2 November 2006, with the balance of term of one year and nine months to commence on 3 November 2006 and to expire 2 August 2008. His Honour thus imposed an effective sentence of three years and six months, with a non-parole period of one year nine months. 
     
      
    3 In respect of the ‘Influence Witness’ offence, Lenard was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one year and five months, to commence on 8 July 2005 and to expire on 7 December 2006, with the balance of term of six months to commence on 8 December 2006 and to expire on 7 June 2007. In respect of the ‘Demand Money with Menaces’ offence, Lenard was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one year and two months, to commence on 8 December 2005 and to expire on 7 February 2007, with the balance of term of one year and seven months, to commence on 8 February 2007 and to expire on 7 September 2008. The sentence imposed constituted an effective period of sentence of three years two months and a non-parole period of one year seven months. Lenard’s sentence in respect of the ‘Influence Witness’ offence commenced three months after the date of his arrest on 8 April 2005, as it was made totally cumulative upon a period of imprisonment of three months imposed on 29 April 2005 at Liverpool Local Court, for the offence of ‘Drive whilst Disqualified’.  
     
      
    4 The Crown appeals against sentence on the basis that the sentences imposed on each offender in respect of each offence were manifestly inadequate.  
     
      
       
      Circumstances of the offence 
       
      
    5 On 9 December 2004, Mr Christopher Carroll was the victim of a home invasion in which he was assaulted and property including a computer was stolen. The offenders involved in the home invasion were Christopher Whyte and Patrick Crouch. Shortly after the commission of the home invasion offence, Crouch heard that the police were looking for his vehicle and he went to Lenard for help. Crouch is Lenard’s uncle. Crouch was arrested on 30 December 2004 and was refused bail. Shortly thereafter, on 5 January 2005, Carroll received an email and a letter, which his Honour described as “the beginning of an extortion campaign that was organised and carried out by the offenders Lenard and Fail”.  
     
      
    6 The extortion campaign involved eight telephone calls, two letters and two emails, in which money of up to $200,000 was demanded from Carroll in exchange for the return of his computer that had been stolen by Crouch and Whyte. In the initial letter, Carroll was threatened that if he did not comply with the directions given in it, his computer would be released to the authorities. The underlying basis of the threat to release the computer to the authorities was a belief that it contained child pornography.  
     
      
    7 In addition to the demands for money and the threats relating to the release of the computer to the authorities, demands were also made that Carroll change his police statement regarding the home invasion, so as to exculpate Crouch.  
     
      
    8 His Honour found that Lenard made three of the eight telephone calls to Carroll. Whyte made one telephone call, and another person, Sateki Tuipulotu, made two. His Honour found that Whyte and Tuipulotu made the calls at the behest of Fail. There was no finding by his Honour as to who made the other two telephone calls. His Honour found that Fail sent the second of the two letters, in which a demand for payment of $20,000 was made, payment being demanded in the week the letter was sent, with an ongoing payment schedule for the remaining $180,000, as well as demands that his Honour described as being designed “to achieve the objective of securing the release of Crouch from prison”.  
     
      
    9 The ‘campaign’ was attempted to be carried though to effective completion when an arrangement was made with Carroll for a meeting at a somewhat remote location on 3 February 2005, at which the computer would be handed over to him in exchange for $20,000. Fail and Lenard had arranged for Tuipulotu to effect the handover. Fail and Lenard went with Tuipulotu to the arranged location, remaining out of sight during the proposed handover. The three men were arrested that day.  
     
      
    10 His Honour characterised the commission of the offences as involving “quite a deal of planning, cunning and guile”. His Honour observed that, although “the one series of activities made up the two offences, they had quite different objectives and the harm caused or intended was directed at different entities”. It was agreed by the Crown and counsel for the respondents that his Honour’s last-mentioned reference was intended to draw a distinction between the fact that Carroll was the victim of the ‘Demand Money’ offence and that the affected entity of the ‘Interfere with Witness’ offence was the criminal justice system itself. 
     
      
    11 In sentencing the respondents, his Honour considered that Lenard and Fail should be treated as equally culpable for both offences. His Honour had regard to the subjective features of each, observing that whilst they were different, they were of broadly similar significance, save that he considered that Lenard had shown remorse sufficient to be reflected in a “slight difference in the sentences imposed”. His Honour also recognised that general deterrence was an important consideration in respect of these particular offences.  
     
      
    12 The Crown has appealed on the basis that each of the individual sentences is manifestly inadequate and fails to reflect the objective criminality of the offences. In particular, it was submitted that his Honour erred in three respects: firstly, failing to properly assess the objective seriousness of the offences and giving that factor inadequate weight; secondly, giving undue weight to the subjective circumstances of each respondent; and thirdly, structuring the sentences so that the combined sentences and non-parole periods resulted in a departure from the statutory ratio such that the period in custody was equivalent to only half of the total term. 
     
      
    13 Before considering these specific grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to refer briefly to the principles that govern a Crown appeal and which are relevant to this case. First, error must be shown: R v Tait (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388; Wong and Leung v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584; [2001] HCA 64 at [58] and [109]. It is not sufficient for the appellate Court to consider that some different sentence should be imposed. Secondly, double jeopardy applies, in the sense that a person once convicted and sentenced is, by reason of a Crown appeal, required to be subjected to the sentencing process a second time: R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561; Wong and Leung v The Queen at [110]. Thirdly, and it follows from the preceding principle, the sentence which an appellate court is entitled to impose as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal will generally be less than that which would have been imposed by the sentencing court: R v Holder and Johnston [1983] 3 NSWLR 245 at 269; and will generally be towards the lower end of the available range of sentence: Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321; [2000] HCA 54 at [62]. Finally, as a matter of general principle, even if error is found, an appellate court may only re-sentence if some other sentence is warranted in law: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW); R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704; [2001] NSWCCA 534 at [79].  
     
      
    14 The Crown accepted that there was no apparent error in his Honour’s expression of sentencing principle. However, it was submitted that the sentences imposed were so inadequate that his Honour must have failed adequately to take into account the objective seriousness of the offences, or minimised the objective seriousness having regard to the subjective features.  
     
      
    15 Emphasis was placed upon the fact that the offence of ‘Influence Witness’ was a serious offence, threatening the integrity of the criminal justice system and thus calling for condign punishment. Further, the offence was committed in circumstances where each of the respondents knew of the home invasion and it took the form of demands on Carroll to change his police statement over a period of one month. It was submitted that the circumstances of the offence were aggravated by the fact that it was carried out in conjunction with the extortion campaign that was being waged upon Carroll for the return of his computer. In relation to the ‘Demand Money with Menaces’ offence, it was pointed out that it involved a number of threats over a period of time in circumstances where the victim was already vulnerable.  
     
      
    16 The Crown also submitted that there should have been a greater degree of accumulation of sentences, in accordance with the totality principles referred to by the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610; [1998] HCA 57 and Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616; [2004] HCA 15. It was submitted that the extent of the accumulation was insufficient, so that the overall effect of the sentences imposed was to fail to impose a sentence that reflected the totality of the criminality of each respondent. It was submitted that the offences were each of a distinct character and had a different purpose and that there was not such commonality of the elements of the offences as to justify the degree of concurrency allowed by his Honour.  
     
      
    17 The Crown relied upon the statement by this Court in R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354 per Gleeson CJ, Lee CJ at CL and Hunt J that:  
     
      
       
        
        “… there ought to be a reasonable proportionality between a sentence and the circumstances of the crime, and we consider that it is always important in seeking to determine the sentence appropriate to a particular crime to have regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively, for without this assessment the other factors requiring consideration in order to arrive at the proper sentence to be imposed cannot properly be given their place … The relative importance of the objective facts and subjective features of a case will vary … Even so, there is sometimes a risk that attention to persuasive subjective considerations may cause inadequate weight to be given to the objective circumstances of the case …” 
        
       
      
    18 It was submitted on behalf of each of the respondents that there was no error in the approach taken by the sentencing judge. In particular, it was submitted that his Honour assessed the objective seriousness of the offences, describing them as “quite serious” and making a finding, to which I have already referred, that the offences involved “planning, cunning and guile”. Further, his Honour took into account general deterrence, particularly in relation to the offence of ‘Influence Witness’ because of the “strong community interest in maintaining the integrity of the criminal justice system”. His Honour took into account the relevant aggravating factors and had appropriately dealt with the relevant subjective circumstances of each. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    19 In my opinion, this is not a case where there is any obvious error of principle discernible in his Honour’s remarks on sentence. Indeed, his Honour took into account all the matters that were relevant to these particular offences, the circumstances of their commission and the subjective circumstances of the individual respondents. Nonetheless, I am of the opinion that the sentences imposed are manifestly inadequate. It does not matter, in my opinion, whether this is so for the reasons advanced by the Crown although I am inclined to think there may have been error on each basis. Whatever the basis of the error, the result is one that cannot be sustained. The sentences imposed are appealably inadequate.  
     
      
    20 Both offences are objectively serious offences. The offence of ‘Influence Witness’ is a direct affront to the criminal justice system. The circumstances in which the offence was committed displayed a high degree of criminality. The offence of ‘Demand Money with Menaces’ involved a concerted campaign over a period of time, which the victim, Carroll, found most frightening. Indeed, as his Honour found, he felt “a lot of fear and terror”. Carroll understood one of the messages that he received as involving a direct threat to his life.  
     
      
    21 Because I am of the opinion that the sentences are manifestly inadequate, it follows that the Court is entitled to re-sentence. As I have already stated, the Court may only do so if some other sentence is warranted in law: see above at [13]. In determining whether any other sentence is warranted in law, the Court must have regard to the principles governing Crown appeals, to which I have already referred. Bearing those principles in mind, I am of the opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law.  
     
      
    22 In considering the sentences which I consider ought to be imposed, two further considerations need to be discussed. The first relates to the acceptance by the trial judge that Lenard had demonstrated remorse and that that should be reflected in a modest difference in the sentences. It was submitted by the Crown that the circumstances surrounding the expression of remorse were not such as should have been taken into account by the trial judge. In this regard, Lenard, on sentence, had tendered a letter written to the Court in which he accepted that the jury’s verdict was correct.  
     
      
    23 In R v McGourty [2002] NSWCCA 335, Wood CJ at CL said: 
     
      
       
        
        “24 So far as I can see, there was no factual basis for the finding made by his Honour beyond a self-serving and untested statement made by the respondent to a psychologist. Recently this Court has criticised the practice of placing material of this kind before sentencing judges, in an attempt to minimise the objective seriousness of a crime otherwise apparent on the face of a record:  
        Regina v Qutami 
         [2001] NSWCCA 353, at paras 58 and 59 per Smart AJ, and at para 79 per Spigelman CJ).  
         
         
        25 I whole heartedly agree with the criticism offered in that case. If an offender appearing for sentence wishes to place evidence before the court which is designed to minimise his/her criminality, then it should be done directly and in a form which can be tested.” 
        
       
       
      See also  
      R v Qutami 
       (2001) 127 A Crim R 369; [2001] NSWCCA 353. 
       
      
    24 In R v Elfar [2003] NSWCCA 358 at [25], the Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The matters of principle stated in  
        R v McGourty 
         and  
        R v Qutami  
        are plainly important. They require emphatic endorsement by this court. Indeed it needs also to be further emphasised that this principle extends not only to statements in psychological reports, but also to statements by offenders in pre-sentence reports – ( 
        R v Palu 
         per Howie J with whom Levine J and Heydon J agreed (2002) 134 A Crim R 174 at 185). In addition, the current practice of tendering a note or letter from an offender in sentencing proceedings attracts the same admonishment. Considerable caution should be exercised in reliance upon such exculpatory material where there is a matter in dispute and where no evidence is given by an offender or other direct evidence is not placed before the court. The essential reason for treating the material in that way is precisely because it remains untested. Indeed, where the Crown has either objected to the tender of this type of material or has made it clear, either at the time of tender or when submissions are made, little or no weight should be placed upon the material, that the sentencing court would be entitled to treat the material as being of little or no weight. Indeed, in an appropriate case, it ought to do so.” 
        
       
      
    25 However, so far as is known, Crown counsel appearing at trial did not object to the tender of the letter, nor was his Honour’s attention drawn to R v Elfar. In those circumstances, it is my opinion that, this being a Crown appeal, the Court should not interfere with that aspect of the sentencing process so that the sentence which this Court imposes ought to make a like allowance to that made by his Honour. Having said that, his Honour considered he had made an adjustment of two months. In fact, the adjustment was three months. I suspect this difference was due to a mathematical error. I propose that an adjustment of two months be maintained as indicated by his Honour in his remarks. 
     
      
    26 The second matter to which particular reference needs to be made is in respect of his Honour’s finding of special circumstances. His Honour found that there were special circumstances in this case for altering the usual ratio of parole to non-parole periods. His Honour observed that both were “mature men” who were being sentenced to imprisonment for the first time (other than the short period of imprisonment imposed on Lenard in respect of a ‘drive whilst disqualified’ offence). His Honour also took into account the fact of accumulation as relevant to special circumstances. Although I consider a ratio of 50 per cent was generous, it is not a proportion with which I would interfere on a Crown appeal. 27 I should make one further comment. The non-parole period imposed by his Honour in respect of Fail expires on 2 November 2006. Fail has thus served the whole of his non-parole period, save for a couple of days and is undoubtedly looking forward to his release. I consider that this is a relevant matter to be taken into account in the exercise of the Court’s discretion. Nonetheless, I remain of the view that the sentences imposed by the trial judge were so inadequate that the Court should re-sentence the respondents. It must also be said that Lenard, whose release is not so imminent, must also be looking forward to his release in a relatively short period of time. I have taken this factor into account in deciding the sentences that I consider this Court ought to impose. 28 Subject to the matters to which I have specifically referred, no challenge was made to the matters his Honour took into account as being relevant to sentence. Because of the expedition with which this judgment has been prepared, I do not propose to set those matters out again. Rather, they should be taken as relevant to the sentencing in this matter and they have been taken into account on the re-sentence on the same basis as considered by his Honour. 
     
      
    29 I would propose the following orders and sentences: 
     
      
       
      In Appeal No.  
      CCA 2006/2168  
      being the appeal in the matter of  
      Michael Lenard 
      : 
       
       
      1. Appeal allowed; 
       
      2. Quash the sentences imposed by the trial judge; 
       
      3. In lieu sentence the respondent Michael Lenard: 
       
       
        
        On count 3, being the offence of ‘Influence Witness’ contrary to s 323(a) of the  
        Crimes Act 
         1900 (NSW), the respondent Michael Lenard is sentenced to imprisonment for a non parole period of one year six months to commence on 8 July 2005 and to expire on 7 January 2007 with a balance of term of one year and six months to commence on 8 January 2007 and to expire on 7 July 2008. 
        
       
       
        
        On count 2, being the offence of ‘Demand Money with Menaces’ contrary to s 99(1) of the  
        Crimes Act 
         1900 (NSW), the respondent Michael Lenard is sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of one year seven months to commence on 8 January 2006 and to expire on 7 August 2007 together with a balance of term of two years five months to commence on 8 August 2007 and to expire on 7 January 2010. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      The practical effect of these sentences is to impose an effective sentence of four years six months to commence on 8 July 2005 and to expire on 7 January 2010 and an effective non-parole period of two years one month to commence on 8 July 2005 and to expire on 2 August 2007.

      2. Quash the sentences imposed by the trial judge; 
       
      3. In lieu sentence the respondent Michael Fail as follows:  
       
       
        
        On count 3, being the offence of ‘Influence Witness’ contrary to s 323(a) of the  
        Crimes Act 
         1900 (NSW), the respondent Michael Fail is sentenced to imprisonment for a non parole period of one year six months to commence on 3 February 2005 and to expire on 2 August 2006 with a balance of term of one year six months to commence on 3 August 2006 and to expire on 2 February 2008. 
        
       
       
        
        On count 2, being the offence of ‘Demand Money with Menaces’ contrary to s 99(1) of the  
        Crimes Act 
         1900 (NSW), the respondent Michael Fail is sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of one year nine months to commence on 3 August 2005 and to expire on 2 May 2007 together with a balance of term of two years three months to commence on 3 May 2007 and to expire on 2 August 2009. 
        
       
       
      The practical effect of these sentences is to impose an effective sentence of four years six months to commence on 3 February 2005 and to expire on 2 August 2009 and an effective non-parole period of two years three months to commence on 3 February 2005 and to expire on 2 May 2007.

      12764/2006 HEALEY v COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION (No. 2) 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 22 August 2006, the Court as presently constituted determined an appeal by Gregory Harrison Healey against a judgment of a Magistrate, His Honour Lulham LCM, given on 17 May 2006. The judgment of 22 August 2006 (Healey v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] NSWSC 853) granted the appeal, quashed the orders made and remitted the original application to the Local Court to be dealt with in accordance with law. I reserved to the parties any application they wish to make on the question of costs. This judgment deals with costs. 
     
      
    2 The plaintiff, by written submissions, sought costs of and incidental to the proceedings in this Court subsequent to the handing down of the August judgment. 
     
      
    3 I do not intend to summarise the August judgment. It is sufficient for my purposes to note that the appeal was successful on grounds not directly raised by the plaintiff, being that the Magistrate excluded from his exercise of discretion a relevant matter and thereby erred in law and vitiated the discretion exercised. 
     
      
    4 The defendant opposes the award of costs and does so on the basis of the discretion of the Court and also on the basis of the jurisdiction of the Court. The jurisdictional argument relies upon the judgment of the High Court in Solomons v District Court of New South Wales (2002) 211 CLR 119. That judgment, confirming a judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court, determined that the provisions of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cwth) do not render applicable the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (NSW) to a trial and acquittal in a New South Wales state court on an indictment charging offences under law of the Commonwealth.  
     
      
    5 The prosecution of the plaintiff in the Local Court by the defendant, which prosecution was continuing at the time of the appeal, was, of course, not a trial on indictment and, as yet, there has been no acquittal or otherwise. The costs that are being sought are the costs of the appeal under the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001.  
     
      
    6 There are a number of distinguishing features between the entitlement to costs on such an appeal and the right of a trial judge to order costs on trial and acquittal. Apart from the more subtle distinctions, costs of an appeal of this kind are dealt with, at least in part, by s 98 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (previously s 76 of the Supreme Court Act) and by s 70 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001; they are not dealt with by the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967. 
     
      
    7 Interesting as the jurisdictional issue is, it is unnecessary for me to determine it. As the defendant in this proceeding points out, and as is stated above, the appeal succeeded on a point that was not raised in the court below or on appeal in this Court. The learned Magistrate allowed an amendment by the Commissioner of a highly technical nature. The Commissioner had inadvertently misspelt the name of the defendant. The Magistrate did so under the provisions of s 15C of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cwth). The plaintiff argued in the appeal proceedings that s 15C was inapplicable. I rejected that argument. However, as earlier indicated, I took the view that the Magistrate was too narrow in determining the matters that could be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion reposed in the Local Court.  
     
      
    8 In remitting the matter back to the Local Court, I made it clear that the Magistrate was able to take into account certain matters and, once he did, may come to the same view as originally taken. These are matters of discretion in areas of practice and procedure. 
     
      
    9 Given the nature of the matter and the fact that the plaintiff succeeded on a ground not argued in the court below or on appeal, it is within the discretion of this Court that any order for costs would not necessarily follow the event: Whitehouse Properties Pty Ltd v Bond Brewing (NSW) Ltd (1992) 28 NSWLR 17 at 24; Wickstead v Browne (1992) 30 NSWLR 1 at 19. 
     
      
    10 In the exercise of the discretion of the Court, I order that each party pay its or his own costs of and incidental to the proceedings, including the costs associated with this dispute on costs. Otherwise, the proceedings are dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HANDLEY JA: I agree with Hodgson JA. 
     
      
    2 HODGSON JA: On 28 July 2004, each of the appellants was convicted by Mr. C. Longley, Magistrate, upon a charge of affray under s.93C of the Crimes Act 1900; and each of them was fined $1,500.00.  
     
      
    3 The appellants appealed to the Supreme Court pursuant to s.52(1) of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal & Review) Act 2001, which provides for appeals as of right on grounds involving questions of law. On 25 August 2005, Johnson J dismissed their appeal.  
     
      
    4 The appellants then applied for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal, and their application was heard on the basis that, if leave was granted, the appeal would be determined without further argument. At the conclusion of oral argument, the Court granted leave to appeal. 
     
      
       
      CIRCUMSTANCES 
      
    5 In the early hours of Monday 18 November 2002, the three appellants, who are brothers, together with a Mr. Bensley and three women, attended the Lagoon Bar at the Star City Casino. The charges on which the appellants were convicted arose out of an incident on that occasion involving security officers of the casino, in particular Messrs. Wood, Webb, Bannister, Bracamonte, Heaney and Ogston. The prosecution case was based on oral evidence from a number of witnesses, including the security officers, and a compilation video of the incident. The appellants did not give evidence.  
     
      
    6 The prosecution evidence was to the following effect. Mr. Webb assessed one of the appellants as being intoxicated, and directed him to leave the premises. The two other appellants objected to this, and they screamed at him and racially abused him. Mr. Webb then directed them all to leave, and two of the appellants then further abused him and invited him outside to fight. As the appellants were moving towards the door, one of them said to Mr. Bracamonte “ well move me”, and Mr. Bracamonte pushed him towards the door. Mr. Bracamonte was then pushed hard from behind by another of the appellants, punches were then thrown at him, he was tackled from behind into some tables and chairs, put in a headlock and bitten in the back of the head, and punched and kicked to the head. He was left with bruising of the face, a fractured jaw leading to the removal of two wisdom teeth, scarring on the inside and outside of his mouth, a bite injury to the back of his head and a laceration over his left eye. There was a general fracas involving the three appellants and security officers that lasted about one and a half minutes. Mr. Ogston observed Mr. Bracamonte and one of the appellants hitting a table and land on a stage, with the man landing on top of Mr. Bracamonte. Mr. Ogston tried to pull the person off, but as he did so, he was himself grabbed from behind around his throat. He was not able to breathe and started to lose consciousness. He received scratches around his neck and a black eye. There was also evidence of injuries to Mr. Bannister and Mr. Heaney. 
     
      
    7 The first appellant was charged with maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on Mr. Bracamonte, assault occasioning actual bodily harm on Mr. Bracamonte, assault on Mr. Wood, and affray. The second appellant was charged with maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on Mr. Bracamonte, assault occasioning actual bodily harm on Mr. Bannister, assault occasioning actual bodily harm on Mr. Heaney, and affray. The third appellant was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm on Mr. Ogston, and affray. 
     
      
       
      MAGISTRATE’S DECISION 
      
    8 The Magistrate was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of any of the accused on any of the charges other than affray, because he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the identification of which of the appellants did which of the relevant acts. He gave the following reasons for his findings of guilty on the charge of affray: 
     
      
       
        
        The three defendants are charged, and were charged initially, with the charge of affray, which comes under s.93C of the Crimes Act. And it is not a particularly lengthy section, but a person who uses or threatens unlawful violence towards another and whose conduct is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety is guilty of an affray. If two or more persons uses or threatens the unlawful violence it is the conduct of them taken together that must be considered for the purposes of subsection 1. For the purposes of this section a threat cannot be made by the use of words alone. No person of reasonable firmness need actually be, or be likely to be, present at the scene, and lastly the affray may be committed in private as well as in public places. Well it seems if that termination does not apply, well – that is whether it is or isn’t in a public place, but for the purposes of the exercise I suppose, it certainly is a public place. 
         
         
        Now firstly in my view there are two or more persons, there are three, in fact there were four. I am dealing with three. And it is their conduct in my view taken collectively which, if viewed in that collective circumstance, would be conduct which would be considered for the purposes of s.93C(1). 
         
         
        One aspect of, of course the submission made by Mr Bellanto in relation to his respective clients, is that they are each of good character. And of course as a matter of law I am required to take that into account in assessing whether they are persons who would be likely to commit this offence. They are each young persons, and from a criminal history point of view, are persons of good character. 
         
         
        Now this event, and I will use that term again, started it is fair to say in my view somewhat innocently, inoffensively, that is the detection of one of the young males, which I believe to be Vincenzo, coming in contact with a security door. He is then, as is required it seems, by the Casino in implementing the Liquor Act Provisions conducted a responsible service of alcohol assessment. They did so, and did so most properly. 
         
         
        Shortly before that assessment took place, and dare I say after the assessment took place by Mr Webb, it was the involvement of three others who then took it upon themselves to question the decision that had been made. Now true it is the video indicates visual only and not audio, but it is very apparent to me in seeing and viewing it, I think I can say repeatedly, that there was significant disquiet from the men in black. And I am using those terms, because at this stage of the proceedings [sic] did not know who they were, apart from the fact that there were three members of the one family. And it is clear that they were not pleased with the decision that had been made. But it seems with the ongoing conversation that whilst reluctant they certainly appeared to accept it. 
         
         
        All of the security which happened to be at that stage Mr Bracamonte, Mr Webb and Mr Wood, having accepted their indication that they were going to leave, moving back in to the Lagoon Bar, and it is obvious that there was a conscious effort on behalf of at least one of the security officers to make sure that they were heading in the right direction, so to speak. Now what flowed from that was an indignation from one of the men in black regarding the speed with which they were required in my view to leave. That indignation resulted in the behaviour of one of them in pushing, for reasons that are not obvious to me, the security officer in the back, and it was a most violent act in my view in those circumstances, unnecessary. So then, as a result of that, the security officer turns around and with more good luck than good management ducks a punch from one of the men in black. So then there is what happens over a very short period of time is an involvement by these three officers, the three men in black, towards Mr Webb and Mr Bracamonte. 
         
         
        Now it has been urged upon me that there has to be a degree of common purpose. I do not see why that needs to be, in my view, an element of this offence. But even if it was it seems to me that the actions of one precipitated the actions of others. Now it was my determination that the identification of particular persons involved in particular acts could not be proved to the requisite standard. It was urged or submitted to me that there was no evidence of implication beyond reasonable doubt. There certainly was evidence that it was not in my view sufficient to satisfy the elements of those individual charges. 
         
         
        The evidence, which is on the tape, and which has been given in evidence by Mr Bracamonte, Mr Webb, is that he, Mr Bracamonte, was kicked, he was punched, unlawful acts. True it is on the available evidence I could not be satisfied to the requisite standard of the individual charge of grievous bodily harm. There was evidence that both pictorially and in a group situation, where Mr Bracamonte had received a bite. There was evidence in relation to Mr Bannister. He enters because he sees what is happening, and he drags off a person, who then in attempting to get out of that hold, uses his hands on the eyes of Mr Bannister. 
         
         
        A male grabs Mr Ogston, puts him in a choke hold. The result from that is that efforts are undertaken by security to release that hold. The result of that is a person, a man in black comes in and starts punching Mr Heaney. 
         
         
        Now it has been urged upon me that amongst other things that the security officers could not be described as persons of reasonable firmness, because that is their job, they are there, and should not be the yard stick, which was the submission that was made. But provisions of the Statute provide that persons do not have to be of reasonable firmness, but he might have to be present. Now it has also been urged upon me that these officers – I withdraw that, these three persons did not apply their minds to the situation at hand. Well on the available evidence to me that is exactly what they did. They applied their minds to the situation. It has also been urged that they were reactive. To me, that is a concerted effort on behalf of the defendants to deflect the blame. Right from minute one they blame them. True it is and I accept this submission that the event was shut down relatively quickly. It has been urged upon me that these two people who were having a stickybeak could be used I suppose whilst .. (not transcribable) .. were not used as a yardstick but certainly they would not be in fear of their safety. It is true to say that most of the actual events of aggression towards the security officers had passed. 
         
         
        It seems to me on the available evidence, whilst I could not be satisfied in the discrete offences as to who acted against any specific officer, in my view I do not have to find that. It is their actions which in my view are unlawful and when taken together, a person, if they were there, in my view would have a significant fear for his or her safety and in my view the evidence which has been given both orally and by way of video evidence does not show to me that these persons were acting in self-defence. I FIND EACH OF THE OFFENCES PROVED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT. 
        
       
       
      PRIMARY JUDGE’S DECISION 
      
    9 The appeal to the Supreme Court raised a number of grounds, including the ground that the Magistrate erred in law when imposing an onus on the appellants in his consideration of the issue of self-defence. The primary judge set out the statutory provisions concerning self-defence, referred to some authorities including R v. Nguyen (1995) 36 NSWLR 397, and continued: 
     
      
       
        
        98 It will be recalled that the Plaintiffs did not give evidence in the present proceedings. Nor did they participate in interviews or give statements to investigating police. Accordingly, there was no version from them before the Court concerning their actions and their state of mind at the time of the relevant incident. Acting Sergeant Buttrose gave evidence that, in general conversation after the incident, one of the men  
        “and I couldn’t tell you which one, was saying they 
         [the security officers] 
         started it” 
         (Transcript, 20 July 2004, T35.35).  
         
         
        99 Mr Bellanto QC submitted that self defence was raised by his cross-examination of Mr Bracamonte (Transcript 22 July 2004, T68.42):  
         
          
          “Q. And thereafter what occurred was really a series of acts where these various men were either defending themselves from violence from you or your colleagues or defending each other, helping each other? 
           
           
          A. That could be a possibility, yes. We get that all the time but. Of course when there’s a group there [sic] always going to be always involved because they don’t want their friend getting asked to leave. Nobody’s intoxicated when we asked them to leave they were all straight, that’s the thing.” 
          
         
        100 Reliance was also placed upon the later cross-examination of Mr Bracamonte (Transcript, 22 July 2004, T89.19):  
         
          
           
            
            “Q. Would you say the way this incident developed was really a sequence of events one man going to the aid of another? 
             
            A. In what way? 
             
             
            Q. Security personnel were going to the aid of security personnel? 
             
            A. Yeah and – yeah each one. 
             
             
            Q. And the men in black were going to the aid of men in black? 
             
            A. Yeah. 
             
             
            Q. In the course of people going to the aid of each other that’s how the whole thing sort of started and how it developed? 
             
            A. No, it already started before everyone arrived. 
             
             
            Q. It really started I suggest in a physical sense when you applied directional movement didn’t it? 
             
            A. No, necessarily, no. 
             
             
            Q. Do you agree with that? 
             
            A. Yeah. 
             
             
            Q. That’s how it really started? 
             
            A. Yeah. But it also started too because their behaviour as well.” 
             
            
           
          
         
        101 The Plaintiffs relied upon the cross-examination of Mr Ogston to the following effect (Transcript, 23 July 2004, T17.6):  
         
          
          “Q. From what you could see it was a case of including the security people and the men in black, it was really a case of those present going to the aid of another. Do you agree with that? Do you understand what I’m saying? The whole thing escalated by one person going to the aid of another person, another person going to the aid of the person who was going to the aid of the first persona [sic] and it was like a chain reaction? 
           
          A. Yeah. 
           
          Q. Do you agree with that? 
           
          A. Yes I do.” 
           
          
         
        102 Mr Bellanto QC relied upon evidence that one or more of the security officers had used  
        “directional force” 
         or  
        “directional movement”  
        towards one of the  
        “men in black” 
         and that this evidence was relevant to the self-defence issue. He complained that the learned Magistrate had not addressed the  
        “directional force” 
         issue in his judgment. His Honour did advert to this part of the evidence in his finding that  
        “it is obvious that there was a conscious effort on behalf of at least one of the security officers to make sure that they were heading in the right direction, so to speak” 
        . Mr Bellanto QC complains that this finding did not have regard in an appropriate way to what he submitted was the significance of the  
        “directional force” 
         evidence in the case.  
         
         
        103 Mr Bellanto QC submitted that the evidence raised self defence, including the defence of others being the other  
        “men in black” 
        . In these circumstances, the Plaintiffs submitted that self defence was raised and was not negatived beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution. Further, it was submitted that the learned Magistrate had misdirected himself on the question of self defence so as to constitute an error in law.  
         
         
        104 Mr Lakatos submitted that there was no evidence in the proceedings which gave rise to a consideration of self defence. The assertion was advanced in cross-examination of witnesses but not acceded to by those witnesses. The tenor of the evidence of the security officers so cross-examined was that they had been set upon by the Plaintiffs. The Defendant submitted that this was far removed from any legitimate issue of self defence.  
         
         
        105 Mr Lakatos submitted that the evidence, as it stood, gave no support to the proposition that the Plaintiffs had the belief set out in s.418(2)  
        Crimes Act 1900 
        . Absent such material, the prosecution bore no onus of proof at all.  
         
         
        106 Further, Mr Lakatos submitted that his Honour’s concluding comments indicated clearly that this was his view of the evidence. His Honour concluded that  
        “the evidence which has been given both orally and by way of video evidence does not show to me that these persons were acting in self-defence”.  
        It was submitted that self defence had not been raised on the evidence and that the learned Magistrate did not fall into error of law with respect to this question.  
         
         
        107 As cases such as  
        Honeysett  
        and  
        Nguyen 
         make clear, self defence may apply to a charge of affray. However, the issue must be raised in the case. This may occur more readily where a limited number of persons are involved in the fight and, perhaps, self defence is raised by way of explanation or otherwise with respect to the actions of one or more persons. That is not the present case.  
         
         
        108 In considering this ground, I have had regard to the entirety of the evidence, including the video tape. I accept the Defendant’s submissions with respect to this ground. The evidence did not raise self defence in this case. The cross-examination did not adduce evidence which was capable of raising self defence for the purpose of s.418(2) of the Act. I have considered whether the compilation video tape depicts actions which may have raised self defence in the case. In my view, the tape does not contain material which raises self defence. The evidence in this case points to the three Plaintiffs, in the words of Priestley JA in  
        Nguyen 
        , being persons who wanted to fight. In such circumstances, self defence does not arise. 
         
         
        109 I do not consider that the Plaintiffs’ submissions referring to  
        “directional force” 
         demonstrate any error in law on the learned Magistrate’s behalf. Properly understood, this evidence related to the touching of one of the  
        “men in black” 
         to point him in a particular direction. The contact in question is depicted in the video tape. Although this contact formed part of a sequence of events leading to aggressive conduct on the part of the three Plaintiffs it did not, in my view, raise self defence with respect to the aggressive conduct of the Plaintiffs which followed.  
         
         
        110 Although my finding with respect to this ground does not depend upon evidence of injuries sustained during the incident, it is not entirely irrelevant to observe that Mr Bracamonte received a broken jaw and facial bruising and was hospitalised for four days (Transcript, 22 July 2004, T60, 62), Mr Ogston received scratches around his neck and a black eye (Transcript, 23 July 2004, T7.50), Mr Heaney received a cut lip and a cut to the forehead (Transcript, 23 July 2004, T34.6) and Mr Bannister sustained blurred vision and bloodshot eyes as a result of fingers being dug into his eyes (Transcript, 23 July 2004, T53-54). Apart from the reference to Mr Bensley’s shoulder (see paragraph 81 above), there was no evidence that any of the Plaintiffs had sustained injury. In cross-examination of Constable Qui, Mr Bellanto QC asked (Transcript, 20 July 2004, T55.34):  
         
          
          “Q. You notice any of these boys in black in torn clothing? 
           
          A. No I did not. 
           
           
          Q. Did you notice any marks on their body, their lip for example, cut lips, things like that? 
           
          A. No I did not.” 
          
         
         
        111 In my view, the evidence in this case did not raise self defence. No error of law has been demonstrated. I reject Ground 4. 
        
       
       
      GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
      
    10 The appellants appeal to this Court on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        1. His Honour erred in law in finding and holding that the evidence did not raise self-defence on the part of the Appellants within the meaning of ss.418-419 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). 
         
         
        2. His Honour erred in law in finding and holding that the Appellants were unable to raise self-defence in the circumstances of the case. 
        
       
       
      STATUTORY PROVISIONS 
      
    11 This appeal involves the following provisions of the Crimes Act 1900.  
     
      
    12 First, s.93C concerning the crime of affray: 
     
      
       
        
        93C Affray 
         
        (1) A person who uses or threatens unlawful violence towards another and whose conduct is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety is guilty of affray and liable to imprisonment for 5 years. 
         
        (2) If 2 or more persons use or threaten the unlawful violence, it is the conduct of them taken together that must be considered for the purposes of subsection (1). 
         
        (3) For the purposes of this section, a threat cannot be made by the use of words alone. 
         
        (4) No person of reasonable firmness need actually be, or be likely to be, present at the scene. 
         
        (5) Affray may be committed in private as well as in public places. 
        
       
      
    13 Next, ss.418, 419 and 422, concerning self-defence: 
     
      
       
        
        418 Self-defence - when available 
         
        (1) A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if the person carries out the conduct constituting the offence in self-defence. 
         
        (2) A person carries out conduct in self-defence if and only if the person believes the conduct is necessary:  
         
          
          (a) to defend himself or herself or another person, or 
           
          (b) to prevent or terminate the unlawful deprivation of his or her liberty or the liberty of another person, or 
           
          (c) to protect property from unlawful taking, destruction, damage or interference, or 
           
          (d) to prevent criminal trespass to any land or premises or to remove a person committing any such criminal trespass, 
           
          and the conduct is a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them. 
          
         
         
        419 Self-defence - onus of proof 
         
        In any criminal proceedings in which the application of this Division is raised, the prosecution has the onus of proving, beyond reasonable doubt, that the person did not carry out the conduct in self-defence. 
         
         
        422 Self-defence - response to lawful conduct 
         
        This Division is not excluded merely because:  
         
        (a) the conduct to which the person responds is lawful, or 
         
        (b) the other person carrying out the conduct to which the person responds is not criminally responsible for it. 
        
       
       
      SUBMISSIONS 
      
    14 Mr. Jackson QC for the appellant submitted that plainly this was not a case of premeditated attack by the appellants, and that there was clear evidence of each of the appellants going to the aid of each other either to prevent themselves being deprived of their liberty or to prevent others being deprived of their liberty, or to defend themselves or to defend the others, within s.418(1)(a) and (b); and that this was supported by the evidence referred to by the primary judge, particularly the evidence of Mr. Ogston in par.[101] of the primary judge’s judgment. Self-defence is not excluded merely because the conduct to which an accused is responding is lawful: see s.422.  
     
      
    15 He submitted that, if there was evidence raising self-defence in relation to just one of the accused, then, because of the identification problem which resulted in dismissal of the other charges, this would be sufficient to raise self-defence in relation to all of them.  
     
      
    16 Mr. Jackson submitted that all that was needed to raise self-defence was evidence capable of raising a reasonable doubt in the mind of a jury: Zecevic v. Director of Public Prosecutions (1987) 162 CLR 645 at 665; Douglas v. R [2005] NSWCCA 419 at [84]-[100]; R v. Duncan [2006] QCA 46 at [2], [11], [31]-[34]. Accordingly, the primary judge was in error in finding that the evidence did not raise self-defence.  
     
      
    17 To the extent that the primary judge relied on the words of Priestley JA in Nguyen at 412 to the effect that self-defence did not arise in the case of a person who wanted a fight, Mr. Jackson submitted that this was an error because these words concerned the common law position, whereas here the question was whether the statutory words applied, and in relation to those words the concept of “wanting to fight” had no application; and in any event, he submitted, the Magistrate had not made findings of fact to the effect that each of the appellants wanted to fight.  
     
      
    18 Mr. Jackson submitted that the Magistrate was in error in the way he dealt with self-defence. If what he said was interpreted as meaning that the evidence was insufficient to raise the issue of self-defence for consideration, he was in error for the same reasons as the primary judge; and if this was interpreted as a finding that the defence was not made out, he was in error in reversing the onus of proof.  
     
      
       
      DECISION 
      
    19 In my opinion, the following principles are applicable in this case.  
     
      
       
      (1) By reason of the onus of proof provided by s.419, all that is needed to raise self-defence is evidence capable of supporting a reasonable doubt in the mind of the tribunal of fact as to whether the prosecution has excluded self-defence. Thus, in relation to s.418(1)(a), there needs to be evidence capable of indicating a reasonable possibility of a belief by the accused that the conduct constituting the offence was necessary to defend himself or herself or others, and of a perception of circumstances such that the accused’s response was reasonable. However, the evidence must be capable of doing this as a matter of legitimate reasoning and not mere speculation: to that extent, I agree with  
      R v. Imadonmwonyi 
       [2004] VSC 361 at [21] and  
      R v. Mekic 
       [2004] SASC 44 at [5]. 
       
       
      (2) It is not essential that there be evidence from the accused as to the accused’s beliefs and perceptions: evidence of circumstances from which inferences may be drawn as to the accused’s relevant beliefs and perceptions may be sufficient. However, if the accused does not give evidence of his or her beliefs and perceptions, then generally, in the absence of other evidence suggesting the contrary, inferences have to be drawn on the basis of what beliefs and perceptions a person in the position of the accused could reasonably hold in the circumstances.  
       
       
      (3) The defence may succeed even though the conduct to which the accused responds is lawful (s.422); but if this conduct is lawful, then this is relevant to whether the accused could have believed it was conduct in respect of which defence was necessary, or which threatened an unlawful deprivation of liberty; and relevant also to whether the accused’s conduct could have been a reasonable response in the circumstances as the accused perceived them. 
       
       
      (4) A finding that an accused “wanted to fight” does not of itself exclude self-defence; but is relevant to whether the accused could have believed his or her conduct to be necessary for defence or to prevent unlawful deprivation of liberty. Furthermore, if a person believes that any risk of harm can be dealt with by withdrawing, then generally that belief would be inconsistent with a belief that conduct of the nature of an assault was necessary for defence. The following discussion by Wilson, Dawson and Toohey JJ in  
      Zecevic 
       at 663-4 is relevant: 
       
        
         
          
          Where an accused person raising a plea of self-defence was the original aggressor and induced or provoked the assault against which he claims the right to defend himself, it will be for the jury to consider whether the original aggression had ceased so as to have enabled the accused to form a belief, upon reasonable grounds, that his actions were necessary in self-defence. For this purpose, it will be relevant to consider the extent to which the accused declined further conflict and quit the use of force or retreated from it, these being matters which may bear upon the nature of the occasion and the use which the accused made of it. Indeed, even in circumstances in which the accused was not the original aggressor, retreat in the face of a threat of violence before resort to force may be relevant to the belief of the accused or the reasonableness of the grounds upon which the accused based his belief. There is, however, no longer any rule that the accused must have retreated as far as possible before attempting to defend himself. It is a circumstance to be considered with all the others in determining whether the accused believed upon reasonable grounds that what he did was necessary in self-defence:  
          Reg. v. Howe,  
          per Dixon C.J. (1958) 100 CLR at 462-4;  
          Viro v The Queen,  
          per Gibbs J. (1978) 141 CLR at 115-6. 
           
           
          … 
           
           
          The whole of the surrounding circumstances are to be taken into account and where an accused person has created the situation in which force might lawfully be applied to apprehend him or cause him to desist - where, e.g., he is engaged in criminal behaviour of a violent kind - then the only reasonable view of his resistance to that force will be that he is acting, not in self-defence, but as an aggressor in pursuit of his original design. A person may not create a continuing situation of emergency and provoke a lawful attack upon himself and yet claim upon reasonable grounds the right to defend himself against that attack. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        This discussion was directed to self-defence at common law, not under s.418; but similar reasoning applies in relation to s.418.  
        
       
       
      (5) However, in this case, because of the identification problems, if self-defence is raised in relation to any one of the appellants, it is raised in relation to all of them; and if self-defence is not excluded beyond reasonable doubt in relation to any one of the appellants, it is not excluded in relation to all of them.  
       
      
    20 There was no evidence from the appellants as to their beliefs or perceptions; so the question is, what inferences could be drawn as to their possible beliefs and perceptions from objective circumstances of which there was evidence in this case. In my opinion, the following factors are relevant: 
     
      
       
      (1) All of the appellants were lawfully requested to leave, and thereafter the security officers could lawfully use reasonable force to bring this about.  
       
       
      (2) There is no evidence of conduct of any of the security officers, prior to the fracas, going beyond conduct directed at causing the appellants to leave: in particular, there was no evidence of any attack on the appellants, or any of them, which could be seen as involving any risk of harm to the appellants or any of them. 
       
       
      (3) Even if the initial push by one of the security officers was not strictly necessary to cause the appellants to leave, and even if it constituted a technical assault, it was not such as could give rise to a belief that could be reasonably held that the person pushed was being attacked or was in any risk of harm or in any need of defence by himself or others: plainly, all he was being required to do was to leave the premises as he was lawfully obliged to do.  
       
       
      (4) The violent push and attempted blows against this security officer that followed immediately from at least one appellant could not reasonably have been believed to be necessary in defence of any of the appellants.  
       
       
      (5) There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the resort to violence by the other appellants was preceded by any actions by security officers that were, or appeared to be, other than to promote the departure of the appellants and/or to defend themselves or others. So far as the evidence went, the actions of security officers were not such as could give rise to a belief that could be reasonably held that any of the appellants were in need of defence by himself or others; that is, that any appellant had to do any more than stop fighting in order to eliminate any risk of harm against which defence was necessary. That this was so is confirmed by the circumstance that none of the appellants was observed to have received any significant injury, while one of the security guards received very serious injuries and others of them received significant injuries. 
       
      
    21 In those circumstances, in my opinion the evidence relied on by Mr. Jackson was not sufficient to raise self-defence.  
     
      
    22 The assertion by one of the appellants to a police officer that the security officers “started it” could not, in the circumstances of this case, suggest a belief that the security officers “started it” in any sense relevant to self-defence: all the evidence was to the effect that violence was initiated by one of the appellants, in circumstances where there was no risk of harm being visited upon any of the appellants. A belief that the security officers started it, in the sense that they or one of them did something that could make defence of oneself or others necessary, could not be inferred as something reasonably possible in the objective circumstances; so in the absence of evidence from the appellants, there was no evidentiary basis for a view that such a belief was reasonably possible.  
     
      
    23 The evidence about the incident being a series of events in which each of the appellants was going to the aid of other appellants similarly does not raise self-defence, where the objective circumstances were such that a person in the position of any of the appellants could not reasonably believe that violent action was necessary as a matter of defence to prevent harm being done to any of the appellants or to prevent unlawful deprivation of liberty: on the evidence, all the security officers were doing, prior to the resort to violence by all the appellants, was initially to seek the lawful removal of the appellants from the premises, and thereafter to defend themselves or others. And once all the appellants had resorted to violence, they were all guilty of affray. 
     
      
    24 In the circumstances of this case, for the appellants to have an evidentiary basis for a reasonable doubt about their beliefs as to what was necessary, and as to their perceptions of circumstances in which their responses may have been reasonable, some evidence would have been required from them as to their actual beliefs and perceptions. In the absence of such evidence, the defence of self-defence generally depends upon what beliefs and perceptions of persons in the position of the accused persons may reasonably have had, having regard to objective circumstances of which there was evidence; and for the reasons I have given, the objective circumstances of which there was evidence in this case did not support a reasonable possibility of the existence of relevant beliefs and/or perceptions. 
     
      
    25 For those reasons, in my opinion the primary judge was correct in holding that the evidence did not raise self-defence; and similarly, no relevant error is shown in the decision of the Magistrate. 
     
      
    26 For those reasons, in my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs. 
     
      
    27 IPP JA: I agree with Hodgson JA.

    SENTENCEINTRODUCTION: 1 The prisoner, Tanya Rankin, appears today for sentence having pleaded guilty to thirteen charges of an indictment presented on 27 September 2006. Eleven of the counts on the indictment allege that she aided and abetted an offence of “make false instrument” with intent that another person would use it to induce another person to accept the instrument as genuine and to act to the prejudice of another.2 These offences were committed between late November and 20 December 2001. They are brought pursuant to s 300(1) Crimes Act 1900 and carry a maximum penalty each of ten years imprisonment. The false instruments were made either by Michael English or Trevor Brown who are referred to below.3 The remaining two charges allege the prisoner was an accessory before the fact to using false instruments in that the prisoner aided Neville Stumer to relevantly use the instruments described contrary to s 300(2) Crimes Act 1900 on 6 and 28 May 2002. The maximum penalty for these offences is ten years imprisonment. The charges set out in the indictment are annexure A to these remarks on sentence.4 I am also required to take into account on a Form 1, two offences of aiding and abetting the making of a false instrument, the false instruments being Powers of Attorney created on 26 November 2001 and 3 December 2001. The relationship of these matters with the matters on the indictment is explained in the facts below.5 The first matter on the Form 1 relates to Count 1. The second matter relates to Counts 2 and 3. All these matters relate to the one loan transaction. That is the matters on the Form 1. Given the range of matters the subject of plea and the context in which the From 1 matters are committed, the Form 1 matters do not significantly increase the level of criminality of the prisoner or the objective seriousness of the relevant principal offence, that is Count 1. Certainly not in the way for example that Trevor Brown’s 80 offences on a Form 1 to which I will refer later could properly be regarded as significantly enhancing the criminality reflected in the relevant principal offence to those matters. A number of co-accused persons have previously been sentenced in this Court or in the Court of Criminal Appeal.6 The trial of the prisoner was listed to commence on 25 September 2006. She was to be tried with Gerd Ziehmer and Wayne Sultan. She pleaded guilty after a delay occasioned by a co-accused seeking an adjournment because he was unrepresented and/or to pursue his application for a separate trial. I accept that the matter involving this prisoner had been prepared for trial but it also had been prepared for trial for the co-accused whose matters were eventually adjourned for various reasons including the fact that this prisoner had indicated a willingness to cooperate with the authorities. I note the discussions regarding possible cooperation by the prisoner with the police and the prosecution were at relevant times in train. The prisoner had been charged on 22 March 2005, approximately two years after she had left Queensland to work in Western Australia where she now lives. There is no suggestion of flight, there is no claim for compensation.OBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES: 7 The fraudulent scheme, of which the prisoner’s conduct reflected in the charges form part, involved money lending on short term at high interest rates. The money advanced was secured on property. Neville Stumer was a Queensland mortgage broker and his wife Jacqueline Stumer, who both await trial, operated a scheme whereby investors would lend money to alleged borrowers using property as security for their investment. The security was falsely or fraudulently made available. Trevor Brown was a Queensland solicitor. Wayne Sultan was a de-registered solicitor from Queensland and Dean Alcorn was a Sydney solicitor who assisted in creating false documents and conducting transactions in New South Wales.8 The Crown case was that Ziehmer, Rankin and Michael and Grace English also assisted the Stumers in the running of this scheme. There were twenty loans in all which involved fraudulent conduct of various types to obtain funds from investors. Tanya Rankin was employed as Trevor Brown’s secretary for a period of two and a half years from 1998 until 2000 in two Brisbane law firms. She continued working as a legal secretary at a firm of solicitors called “Martells” in Brisbane until November 2001 after Brown had left that firm in about 2000. She was highly regarded and efficient, propping Brown up as it would appear as he suffered from depression and alcohol related problems. Whilst working at Martells, the prisoner met Ziehmer and Stumer. She became aware that Stumer was starting up a loan business and was depositing funds into Martells’ Trust Account. In October 2001, Ziehmer asked Ms Rankin to leave Martells and work for him. She left that firm in late November 2001 and went to work for him and worked for him until approximately as I understand it from her statement to police, mid-2002, perhaps slightly later. During this time, Brown was recruited to provide professional assistance as was Alcorn. The criminal conduct alleged against this accused relates to four separate loan transactions. The first did not result in any loan being completed. Transactions 2, 3, and 4 involved loans which obtained the sum of 1.3 million dollars for the architects of the fraudulent scheme. The criminal conduct occurred between late November 2001 and May 2002.9 The agreed facts in respect of the offences to which the prisoner pleaded guilty are: 
     
      
      1. Strike Force 'Whitney' was established to investigate allegations of a loan scheme involving the creation and registration of fraudulent Land Titles and Loan documents in respect of properties, on behalf of investors, in order to secure their apparent loans to various property owners. 
      
     
     
      
      2. ALCORN acted for investors and prepared the required documentation in NSW in accordance with instructions from Neville STUMER, BROWN, or SULTAN. ALCORN emailed the documentation initially to SULTAN at Whitehead Payne Solicitors, Burleigh Heads, Qld and in later transactions to Jacqueline STUMER in Joyner, QLD. Gerd ZIEHMER or Neville STUMER would then arrange for Michael and Grace ENGLISH to forge the signature of various persons on the loan documents. Trevor BROWN, a solicitor who was acting for the purported borrowers or Leanne ZIEHMER, a Commissioner for Declarations in Queensland, would witness the forged the signatures certifying that the documents were signed in their presence. After this process Neville STUMER and Wayne SULTAN would take the fraudulently executed documentation to settlement, which would take place in NSW. 
      
     
     
      
      3. For a property to be used as security in NSW, the Certificate of Title (CT) must be presented to the Land and Property and Information Office to enable the registration of the particular dealing. A common feature in this ‘scheme’ was the absence of Title Certificates in respect of the properties offered as security. The same explanation was given in respect of each matter, by way of a fraudulent statutory declaration, stating that the Certificates were destroyed in cyclone ‘Winifred’. It was further claimed that all the property owners were related and the Certificates were held together in premises located at 35 Mourilyan Road, Boogan. Investigations reveal there was no such address in existence and that not all property owners were related. 
      
     
     
      
      4. The scheme initially centred on properties owned in NSW by the FRIEL and MAHER families. Manus Michael Francis FRIEL, born 22/08/1922 (deceased 17.03.04) who prior to his death lived on and ran a sugar cane farm in Innisfail, QLD, his brother Kevin Patrick FRIEL, born 25/10/1930, who lives and works as a teacher in Sydney, and Christopher MAHER, 75 old, who is a brother in law of the above. 
      
     
     
      
      5. The Principle Company involved in the scheme was Direct Money Corporation Pty Limited (DMC). The company commenced operations in January 2002. The co-accused, Jacqueline STUMER, was the sole director. Her husband, Neville STUMER was the Chief Executive Officer. Trevor BROWN was employed as the in-house Solicitor from the 1 April 2002. The company was placed into Liquidation in January 2003. The Liquidators confirm the company did not conduct any legitimate business.  
      
     
     
      
      6. A comprehensive portfolio of the ENGLISH and FRIEL family’s property interests was prepared by Neville STUMER in the name of Direct Money Corporation to add credence and induce investors into the scheme. The family members of the English/Friel clan state they do not have any knowledge of and have no association with, ALCORN, STUMER, BROWN, SULTAN or the Direct Money Corporation. 
      
     
     
      
      7. The scheme commenced when Neville STUMER befriended Michael and Grace ENGLISH following a contact made in response to STUMER’S advertisement in a Brisbane Newspaper. Michael and Grace ENGLISH were seeking a loan to alleviate the financial problems they were experiencing at the time. Through this association STUMER discovered the extended family of Michael ENGLISH had substantial property holdings in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. 
      
     
     
      
      8. Some time after the initial meeting Grace ENGLISH contacted Neville STUMER and told him that Mary ENGLISH, her mother in law owned properties in Sydney that could be used as security to assist them to raise finance.  
      
     
     
      
      9. Neville STUMER told Grace ENGLISH that in order to use the properties as security it was first necessary to obtain council rate notices in relation to the properties. Grace ENGLISH contacted Mary ENGLISH, explained the situation to her and requested rate notices for the Sydney properties. Mary ENGLISH contacted her brother Kevin FRIEL who resides in Sydney and asked him to send her the relevant rate notices. After receiving some legal advice FRIEL contacted Mary ENGLISH and requested the rate notices be returned to him. The original notices were eventually returned to Kevin FRIEL.  
      
     
     
      
      10. STUMER contacted Gerd ZIEHMER and enquired if he knew a lawyer with a current practicing certificate who could assist with the loan documentation. ZIEHMER spoke to Tanya RANKIN. RANKIN contacted Trevor BROWN, who previously worked as a solicitor at Martells and was now attached to a firm of Lawyers named Irish Hughes and Bentley and asked him to sign a number of documents as a personal favour. 
      
     
     
      
      11. Tanya RANKIN worked as Trevor BROWN’s personal secretary from January 1998 through to September 2000. Rankin and BROWN’s working relationship commenced at Watling Roche Lawyers, Brisbane. In June 2000, BROWN moved to Martells Lawyers, at which time he made arrangements for RANKIN to be employed there as his private secretary. BROWN’s employment with Martells was terminated in September 2000 but RANKIN continued her employment with Martells until November 2001. 
      
     
     
      
      Loan 1 
      
     
     
      
      Counts 1-6 
       (a loan not completed) 
      
     
     
      
      12. In late November 2001 Tanya RANKIN contacted BROWN and spoke to him about having some legal documents witnessed. It was agreed RANKIN would attend BROWN’S office at Irish Hughes and Bentley, Solicitors to discuss the matter further. RANKIN attended the office and handed BROWN a number of documents in relation to a loan application. BROWN perused the documents and observed that they had already been signed by the proposed borrowers, of whom he had no knowledge of. BROWN spoke to RANKIN about the documents being pre-signed and informed her he could not witness the signatures as they had not been signed in his presence. BROWN states RANKIN was an experienced legal secretary and knew it was illegal for him to sign pre-signed documents. RANKIN informed BROWN the documents were for her new business and she would fetch her business partners so they could sign them in his presence. 
      
     
     
      
      13. About 15 minutes later RANKIN returned to BROWN’s office with Gerd ZIEHMER, Michael English, and Grace ENGLISH. RANKIN explained that ZIEHMER was her business partner and the ENGLISHS were the proposed borrowers. ZIEHMER told BROWN the ENGLISH family was looking to set up a private lending business. ZIEHMER further explained it was difficult getting all family members to attend a lawyer’s office to have their signatures witnessed and that was the reason RANKIN produced pre-signed documents. BROWN states he informed all persons he could not sign the documents unless he actually witnessed the documents being signed. 
      
     
     
      
      14. Later that day RANKIN again attended BROWN’s office. On this occasion she was with Gerd ZIEHMER, Michael ENGLISH, Grace ENGLISH and Neville STUMER. RANKIN informed BROWN that STUMER was a broker and an ENGLISH family friend who had previously assisted Michael and Grace ENGLISH in sorting out their financial problems. At this time the discussions within the group related to how they could get around having the documents witnessed without all the proposed signatories being present. At different stages the group broke into smaller groups and met in an interview room and spoke with Trevor BROWN. The whole group then reassembled and BROWN told the group he could prepare ‘Powers of Attorney’, which would resolve the difficulties with respect to the signing of the documents. The group agreed this would be a good idea in order to assist and expedite the process. Brown prepared two Powers of Attorney and gave them to Michael English in the presence Tanya Rankin, Gerd Ziehmer and Neville STUMER with specific instructions that they be signed by Kevin and Manus Friel. At some point during the meeting ZIEHMER told RANKIN that Mary English had Power of Attorney from Kevin and Manus Friel.  
      
     
     
      
      15. Some days later RANKIN, Gerd ZIEHMER, Neville STUMER and Michael and Grace ENGLISH returned to BROWN’s office at which time BROWN was given the two completed Powers of Attorney. One had a signature of K.P FRIEL and had been witnessed by a Commissioner for Declarations and dated 26 November 2001 and the other had a signature of M.M. FRIEL and had been witnessed by Leanne ZIEHMER and was also dated 26 November 2001.  
      
     
     
      
      16. Michael English forged the signature of Kevin and Manus Friel on these documents. Tanya Rankin aided, abetted and assisted Michael ENGLISH to make the said false instruments.  
      Counts 1 on the Indictment and the first item on the Form 1 
      
     
     
      
      17. RANKIN, Gerd ZIEHMER, Neville STUMER and Michael and Grace ENGLISH continued to attend the office of BROWN on a regular basis to discuss the signing of the documents and the setting up of the ENGLISH family business. BROWN eventually agreed to witness the documents with full knowledge that Michael ENGLISH was fraudulently signing the documents in names of his family members. He contacted RANKIN and asked her to come to the office. 
      
     
     
      
      18. Shortly after, RANKIN attended BROWN’s office with Gerd ZIEHMER, Neville STUMER, Michael and Grace ENGLISH. STUMER handed BROWN the documents to be witnessed, he perused the documents and saw they were the same documents RANKIN had previously asked him to sign. On this occasion BROWN witnessed the following documents that  
      relate to counts 2 and 3 on the Indictment and Form 1 Item 2 
      . 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        a. General Power of Attorney dated 3 December 2001 signed in the name of KP FRIEL and witnessed by BROWN.  
        (Count 2) 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        b. General Power of Attorney dated 3 December 2001 signed in the name of KP FRIEL and witnessed by BROWN.  
        (Form 1 Item 2) 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        c. Mortgage over property known as Folio Identifier 61/B/4247, dated 3 December 2001 signed in the name of MM FRIEL and witnessed by BROWN.  
        (Count 3) 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        d. Mortgage over properties known as Folio Identifier’s 1/222551 and 2/33457, dated 3 December 2001 signed in the name of KP FRIEL and MM FRIEL and witnessed by BROWN. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      19. BROWN prepared a further letter in the form of a disbursement authority stating funds were to be provided to J.U STUMER (Neville Stumer’s wife). Michael English states that he forged the names of the property owners on the above false instruments in the presence of Tanya Rankin, Neville Stumer and Gerd Ziehmer. It is the contention of the Crown that RANKIN was present aiding, abetting and assisting Michael English to make the above false instruments. 
      
     
     
      
      20. The evidence reveal Manus Friel, Kevin Friel and Mary English did not sign the above documents, did not apply for any finance, did not know STUMER or BROWN and did not authorise any monies to be paid to J.U. STUMER.  
      
     
     
      
      21. The above loan to be brokered through Clair SCARSELLA, a financial advisor on the Gold Coast. SCARSELLA told Grace and Michael ENGLISH she could obtain a loan of $400,000.00 using the two Sydney properties that the rate notices related to, as security. This loan did not proceed to settlement. 
      
     
     
      
      22. After BROWN witnessed the documents he told the group it would be necessary for the ENGLISH family to get the certificates of Title to enable the loan to proceed to settlement. Michael ENGLISH said it was not possible as the Deeds had been destroyed in a cyclone some years ago. BROWN advised the group the loan could not proceed without the Title certificate and it would be necessary to make an urgent application to gain fresh Title Certificates. BROWN then sought advice in regards to making an application for the fresh Title Deeds. Brown, in the presence of RANKIN, Gerd ZIEHMER, Michael and Grace ENGLISH, went into the New South Wales Land Titles office website and attempted to print out a blank application form for a New Certificate of Title, but found it was not possible to print a blank form unless the appropriate software was installed on the computer. BROWN sought instructions from another solicitor at Irish Hughes and Bentley and ended up handing the phone to RANKIN as she was more computer literate than him.  
      
     
     
      
      23. On the 5 December 2001 BROWN received information on a ‘Gold Ribbon Financial Services’ letter head about the names to be used in the lending scheme, the properties being used as security, information on the Titles and the relationship between the parties. The documents were signed by Gerd ZIEHMER. 
      
     
     
      
      24. On receipt of this information BROWN contacted Michael ENGLISH and requested that he attend Brown’s office to complete the loan applications. Michael English attended the offices of Irish Hughes and Bentley with Grace ENGLISH, Tanya RANKIN and Gerd ZIEHMER. When RANKIN arrived at the office she had in her possession a manila folder which contained approximately ten (10) printed property searches, for properties owned by Manus and Kevin FRIEL. BROWN spoke with Michael in the presence of Grace, RANKIN and ZIEHMER. Once BROWN had received instructions from Michael English, RANKIN handed BROWN two searches from the manila folder for properties referred to as Lot 2 DP33457 (2 Bennetts Grove Ave, Paddington) and Lot 1 DP 222551 (632 Old South Head Road, Rose Bay).  
      
     
     
      
      25. The brief of evidence contain both these searches and both have RANKIN’S writing on them. These searches had been done by RANKIN at the request of ZIEHMER. BROWN then instructed RANKIN to type two Statutory Declarations in relation to the applications for New Certificates of Title, one in the name of Mary ENGLISH and the other in the name of Manus FRIEL. When RANKIN finished typing the Statutory Declarations BROWN checked and edited them. BROWN then took Michael ENGLISH into an office where Michael ENGLISH signed the documents. Tanya RANKIN was aware that the documents she prepared were not in the name of Michael ENGLISH.  
      
     
     
      
      26. On the 6 December 2001 RANKIN, co-accused Gerd ZIEHMER, Neville STUMER and Michael and Grace ENGLISH attended BROWN’S office. They had in their possession a fresh set of pre-signed documents which needed witnessing. The fresh set of documents was required as the lenders demanded the loan proceed without guarantors. BROWN did not see a problem with the changes and witnessed the documents. He handed the documents to RANKIN and the group left the office. 
      
     
     
      
      27. Later that day BROWN received a telephone call from co-accused Gerd ZIEHMER. He requested BROWN to meet him and RANKIN at a service station midway between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. ZIEHMER informed him they required him to witness more documents to enable the loan to settle. BROWN met RANKIN and ZIEHMER at a service station. He then traveled to the Gold Coast with RANKIN and ZIEHMER to attend the settlement. However there were difficulties on the lenders side and the loan did not settle. 
      
     
     
      
      28. On the 11 December 2001, BROWN gave the accused RANKIN instructions to type: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        a. A letter, on Irish Hughes & Bentley letterhead, to the Waverley Council requesting that he be provided rates notices relating to properties owned by Manus FRIEL. Attached to this letter was an ‘authority’ purportedly signed by Manus and Kevin FRIEL authorising the Council to release the said notices to the Lawyers purportedly acting for them.  
        (Count 4) 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        b. Application for a New Certificate of Title for Volume 9771 folio 21  
        (Count 5) 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        c. Statutory Declaration dated 11 December 2001  
        (Count 6) 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      29. Michael ENGLISH has made an admission to signing the authority. Rankin was present aiding, abetting and assisting Michael English in making the said false instrument.  
      
     
     
      
      30. Sometime during the next two weeks BROWN gave instructions to RANKIN to type a further letter on letterhead of Irish Hughes & Bentley Solicitors, addressed to the New South Wales Lands Title Office enclosing several forged documents. 
      
     
     
      
      Loan 1 
      
     
     
      
      Counts 7 to 11 
      
     
     
      
      31. The details of this loan were as follows: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        1. Amount - $500,000.00 
         
        2. Date of Loan - 21 December 2001 
         
        3. Investor - BM Developments P/L 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      32. On the 20 December 2001, the accused, Tanya RANKIN co-accused Neville STUMER, Gerd ZIEHMER, and Michael and Grace ENGLISH attended BROWN’S office at Everton Park. Their purpose in attending the office was to have Michael ENGLISH sign documents to enable the loan to settle in Sydney on the 21 December 2001. On their arrival BROWN states he was having difficulties with the internet connection so a decision was made for the group to travel to the Irish, Hughes & Bentley Offices at Kangaroo Point, Qld. They arrived at the Kangaroo Point office about 7.00pm.  
      
     
     
      
      33. Neville STUMER had been in contact with co-accused ALCORN throughout the day, advising him of their progress in the preparation of the loan documentation. STUMER contacted ALCORN and advised him they were moving to the Kangaroo Point office, at which time ALCORN told STUMER he was going home to have dinner. He said he would return to his office at Marsdens Lawyers, Campbelltown, once he had been advised that documents had been prepared and faxed to him. 
      
     
     
      
      34. BROWN states once they arrived at the Kangaroo Point office he and the accused, Tanya RANKIN prepared the Land Titles Documents for the loan. He states the accused was typing the documents on the office computer whilst he gave her the necessary instructions. (Rankin is unsure of which Irish Hughes and Bentley office they used.) Once the documents were complete they were faxed, unsigned to ALCORN for his perusal. STUMER contacted ALCORN by telephone and informed him the documents had been faxed. ALCORN told Neville Stumer that he would return to the office and call through when he had checked them. 
      
     
     
      
      35. ALCORN contacted BROWN some time later that evening and stated he wanted some changes made to the documents. BROWN agreed to the changes. The accused, RANKIN again prepared the documents on the office computer as instructed by BROWN. RANKIN then assisted in the process of gathering the documents from the printer and laying them out in piles on the reception area desk in preparation for Michael ENGLISH to sign the documents. 
      
     
     
      
      36. Tanya RANKIN prepared the documents on Trevor Brown’s instructions. Brown then instructed Michael English to forge the signature of Manus Friel on the documents. After ENGLISH signed the documents Trevor Brown falsely signed the document certifying that the true property owner had signed the documents in his presence. The signed documents were then faxed to ALCORN just prior to midnight on 20 December 2001 and the originals given to STUMER who attended the settlement the next day. 
      
     
     
      
      37. Tanya RANKIN was present aiding, abetting and assisting Trevor Brown to make the following false instruments. 
      
     
     
      
      38.  
      The following false instruments form the substance of counts 7 to 11 of the indictment 
      . 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        a. Property Transfer Document Reference Number 8231356R.  
        (Count 7)

      39. Sometime towards the end of February 2002, STUMER informed BROWN that contrary to the original plan, RANKIN would not be employed as the secretary of Direct Money Corporation as Jacqueline STUMER did not get along with RANKIN. Gerd ZIEHMER informed BROWN that RANKIN was still going to be involved but would be working with him at Ziehmer Constructions. ZIEHMER told BROWN that RANKIN would do the necessary secretarial tasks required by Direct Money Corporation from his office and her wages would be equally shared by Ziehmer and STUMER.

    10 In sentencing this offender it is important to point out some important matters relevant to assessing the prisoner’s criminality. The alleged involvement of Stumer, Brown, the English couple and Ziehmer in the fraudulent scheme commenced before the prisoner became involved. If the Stumers could be characterised as the architects and principals of the scheme, Ziehmer could be characterised as an executive of the enterprise. Alcorn and Brown as professional advisers and Mr and Mrs English as providing, because of their knowledge of the affairs of their family and their willingness to forge documents or otherwise pass themselves off as members of the family, the “means” by which many of the frauds could be perpetrated. The prisoner by comparison performed effectively secretarial functions to facilitate some of the frauds but only a small proportion of them. Whilst she was not a naïve participant, she was clearly a functionary at the direction of others performing tasks that she must have known were illegal for reasons which are difficult to fathom. The Crown conceded that the prisoner did not obtain any financial benefit other than wages paid to her by Ziehmer amounting to approximately $500 per week nett which would have been an average salary at that time for a legal secretary. There is no evidence that the prisoner received expensive presents or gifts, trips or holidays or any commission from her involvement in these schemes. Whilst she was friendly with Ziehmer, there is no evidence of any romantic involvement between the two so far as the Crown is concerned.11 In perpetration of the scheme devised by the Stumers, thirty-five properties were used in twenty loans. Twelve properties were used in the initial eleven loans and final two loans involved in the scheme with loans totalling 7.97 million dollars. A further twenty-three properties were used in the scheme allowing another seven loans to proceed totalling 4.2 million dollars. I am informed by the Officer-in-Charge of the Fraud Squad that over seven million dollars of the loan proceeds remain outstanding. There is no suggestion that this prisoner has access to or is directly responsible for the loss of these outstanding moneys. The prisoner was thus involved in three of the twenty loans that were completed and one proposed loan that did not proceed.12 In relation to the first completed loan, the $500,000 advanced was repaid. In relation to the other two loans the sum of $800,000 was recovered from LawCover because the solicitor apparently was involved in the fraudulent scheme. Whilst the prisoner assisted in relation to those two loans, clearly the perpetration of the fraud was engineered and achieved by the involvement of the professional advisers at the direction of the principals and/or their executive Mr Ziehmer.13 In assessing the culpability of the prisoner vis a vis other participants in the fraud, the offender performed secretarial functions as I said and was involved in various discussions. However, documents prepared by her were prepared at the direction of others and her role was not vital to the success of the frauds in which she was involved. Stumer and Ziehmer gave directions, Brown and Alcorn as legal practitioners truly facilitated the frauds. The involvement of Mr and Mrs English was vital given their role in purporting to be persons who owned property which was security for the loans or identifying themselves with properties. They were involved from the beginning with Mr Stumer. 14 I am mindful of what the Crown has said about how the English couple have suffered significant consequences for their conduct. But without them, the frauds in which this prisoner was involved would not have been able to take place in their final form. In terms of the importance of the prisoner in the perpetration of the various frauds and in terms of the number of frauds in which the prisoner was involved, it is clear on the information available to this Court that the prisoner was the least important of those being involved in my view, notwithstanding that others were charged with different and different numbers of offences. Further, on the evidence available to me, the prisoner was the youngest of those involved. She was born in September 1978 and on my calculation thus was twenty-three years of age at the relevant time. Many of the other participants were, of course, considerably older than her.SUBJECTIVE MATTERS: 15 The accused has no criminal convictions either before her involvement in the scheme or subsequently. She is now twenty-eight years of age currently residing in the Karratha area of North Western Australia. She is employed as a contracts administrator by a firm engaged in arranging contracts for the Rio Tinto Mining Company. She has worked in this employment for three years with a contract to expire in October 2007 at which time she proposes to return to Brisbane. According to the Probation and Parole Service report she was born and raised in Brisbane and comes from a loving supportive family background. Her family is well regarded in Brisbane according to the enquiries of the Probation and Parole Service. Her mother is, or was, a school teacher, her father a data processing technician. Her parents provided evidence before the Court in affidavit form which is not challenged. The prisoner is the elder of two daughters and throughout her upbringing was an exemplary child, always using “her best endeavours in the performance of her employment duties so as to be considered to be a valuable member of any firm with which she was employed”. 16 Her mother indicated that in her employment “creating a good impression, meeting the demands of the job and completing her assigned tasks have always been paramount for Tanya”. Her parents believe that her involvement in these offences came from her “employment”, which on one view of the facts is correct. She did however become involved in these schemes immediately upon her employment commencing with Mr Ziehmer. On the other hand, given the evidence of her parents, there may be an element of truth that the prisoner became involved in this matter because of her “eagerness” to assist others to impress in her employment, or at least in part.17 Certainly apart from wages, as I have said there was no financial motive for her to be involved or other motive as existed for all the others who were involved. Mr and Mrs English became involved because of their financial circumstances and their eagerness to get out of debt. the prisoner’s parents stated that in their observation, the prisoner has learnt a valuable lesson from her involvement and the conduct here is entirely uncharacteristic. The prisoner was an above average student who after undertaking TAFE studies in business studies, office administration and related disciplines obtained employment upon graduation and has been regularly employed since. She is currently in a relationship with an employee of Rio Tinto and plans to marry. She is in good health with no alcohol problems and no drug issues. She is not a gambler nor was in the past. Her family and partner remain supportive. She has expressed sincere regret to her parents and others for her involvement and acknowledges that she has made “a big mistake” by being persuaded to involve herself in these activities.18 The picture of a person coming from a respectable family with a stable lifestyle is supported by the references produced by the prisoner from the family doctor of over twenty-five years and a family friend who like the offender’s mother is a school teacher of many years experience. The prisoner’s family doctor points to a period of treatment for depression in 1997 and 1998 expressing concern that a custodial sentence would be prejudicial to her mental health.19 An employment associate involved in Occupational Health and Safety consultancy work for Rio Tinto speaks highly of the prisoner’s ethics, accountability and responsibility in her work. He noted her remorse for her involvement in these matters and her desire to avoid offending in the future. Her supervisor at work regards her as a valuable member of the supervisor’s team, stating that the offender has always displayed a strong work ethic and has proven to be reliable, competent and always trustworthy. The prisoner in her affidavit, filed without objection from the Crown, states that her involvement in this offending behaviour had had a huge impact on her life. However she was “sincerely sorry” for her involvement in this matter and has learnt a “valuable lesson”, confidently stating that she would never re-offend in the future.20 The prisoner has spent approximately $40,000 of her savings in legal fees and travel costs with her family providing more funds for her legal fees. The stress of her involvement in this matter had significantly affected her health, her fiancé, and her family supportive of her. she has travelled from Western Australia on a number of occasions to appear in Court in New South Wales at considerable expense.COOPERATION: 21 The prisoner has provided a statement of eighty-one paragraphs, or thirty-nine pages, to the New South Wales Police to assist in the prosecution of Gerd Ziehmer and others awaiting trial. Her assistance has been analysed by the Officer-in-Charge of the Fraud Squad and whilst the assistance was not timely, she has revealed information about the role of Ziehmer which was not clearly known to police and her information “defines the intricate knowledge that Ziehmer had of the fraudulent loan scheme, his involvement in it and the benefits he received”. Her evidence “strengthens and to a large degree corroborates” evidence already available. Mr Ziehmer’s trial is listed to start on 13 November 2006. She has also provided police with valuable evidence regarding Neville Stumer and evidence to implicate Mr Sultan. The assessment of the Superintendent is that the additional information provided by her has “substantially strengthened” the Crown case against Stumer.22 The appropriate discounts for cooperation with law enforcement authorities are discussed in a range of cases including Regina v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243, Regina v Chu (NSWCCA - unreported - 16 October 1998), DPP v El Hani [2004] NSWCCA 162, Regina v A [2004] NSWCCA 292 amongst many other cases. In Regina v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92, the matter of calculating appropriate discounts for cooperation was revisited by Howie J, particularly at paras [3] - [5]. Putting aside the issue of whether Regina v Sukkar signals a reduction of the appropriate range of discount for cooperation, it has long been recognised that in fact there is no fixed tariff for calculating the appropriate discount, although as was recognised in Regina v Sukkar, calculating appropriate discounts should not lead to a sentence which is inadequate or inappropriate. There are many competing considerations whenever the person to be sentenced is to be in custody because of the circumstances of custody. On the other hand even people who do not go into custody receive substantial benefits.23 Noting the range of discounts and the circumstances in which those discounts should be applied as considered by the authorities, and of course noting the discounts which have been accorded in relation to co-accused to this offender, including that approved in Regina v Alcorn by the Court of Criminal Appeal, I am required, in my view, in this matter to calculate an appropriate discount for past assistance as well as a discount for future assistance. The observations of Howie J in Regina v Sukkar were made in the context of a case involving past assistance. Here the bulk of the benefit to law enforcement authorities will be for the future assistance the offender will provide in the prosecution of others. It is to be borne in mind here that ultimately conditions of custody do not, at least at this stage, arise for consideration. Because of the lack of timeliness of the cooperation I have assessed the past assistance of the accused as requiring a discount of ten percent. However the discount for future assistance, bearing in mind at this stage she will be required to give evidence in at least two separate trials and because her statement has greatly strengthened the Crown case, requires recognition by a discount of twenty percent upon the otherwise appropriate penalty. In fixing this discount I have regard to the terms of s 23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and the relevant provisions therein.DISCOUNT FOR THE PLEA OF GUILTY: 24 The plea of guilty was entered shortly after the date that the trial was fixed to commence. Whilst there is significant utilitarian value in the plea of guilty insofar that her plea means that substantial Court time and Crown and police resources will not be require to prove he guilt, the plea was entered late. On the other hand it would appear the meaningful discussions in relation to this matter did not commence until her current counsel fully apprised of instructions and the detail of the Crown brief had an opportunity to enter into discussions with the Crown.25 In the circumstances of the matter, in my view the appropriate discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty ought be ten percent in accordance with the range of discount available for this aspect of the matter set out in the guideline judgment of Regina v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. In Regina v A and other cases it was suggested that the fixing of discounts could be expressed, or may be better expressed as a combined discount (see paragraph 27) rather than compounding or accumulating them (see Regina v MP). Thus in respect of each sentence I calculate the appropriate discount all matters combined at an appropriate discount as forty percent upon the otherwise appropriate sentences.RELEVANT COMPARATIVE SENTENCES: 26 Brown, Alcorn and Michael and Grace English have been sentenced. Trevor Brown pleaded guilty at the Local Court and was sentenced in the District Court to fifteen counts of making a false instrument with intent to induce another person, the Registrar-General to accept the instrument as genuine and to do something he or she would not have done ie register a relevant instrument or issue a new certificate of title. These offences were brought pursuant to s 300(1) Crimes Act 1900 and carry a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. There were eighty further offences on a Form 1 of making a false instrument. In sentencing this offender on 2 November 2005, Judge Hulme SC of this Court calculated a twenty percent reduction for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty and a forty percent reduction for the prisoner’s cooperation with the authorities. The final sentence was in effect two years imprisonment with a non-parole period of eighteen months from a starting point of five years imprisonment in totality. As I understand the judgment, the offences to which the prisoner pleaded guilty related to four separate loans. Thirteen other loans were reflected in the matters on the Form 1. Brown’s involvement in fraudulent activity related therefore to seventeen loans compared to this prisoner’s involvement in three such loans and one attempted loan. Mr Brown suffered a bipolar disorder.27 Dean Alcorn pleaded guilty before Black J at Lismore District Court on indictment to six counts, two of making a false instrument and four counts of obtaining a corrupt benefit or a secret commission. Likewise on a Form 1, there were six offences, two of making false instruments and four of corrupt commissions. He was sentenced on 6 September 2005. There were secret commissions paid to him of $175,000. On appeal his total sentence as I understood it, was reduced to a non-parole period of two years with a balance of sentence of ten months bearing in mind there were concurrent and partially cumulative sentences. The aggravating factors for him were that he was a solicitor and he sought to mislead Government Departments. There were significant personal financial loss from profits of the firm of which he was a partner and he was required to repay significant sums of money. The starting point for sentencing him, in totality, was five years imprisonment with a twenty-five percent discount for the utilitarian benefit for the plea of guilty and a thirty-three percent discount for his assistance. His appeal was heard on 30 May 2006, with judgment on 10 July 2006 (see Regina v Alcorn [2006] NSWCCA 209).28 Michael English and Grace English were sentenced by Judge Black QC at Lismore on 18 November 2004. His remarks on sentence were relatively brief. There were no details in them as far as I can see as to the precise charges to which they pleaded, although I understood from the facts available in this matter in part that they were involved in forgery offences. Nor are there details of relevant calculations for discounts for assistance for their assistance to the prosecuting authorities or the utilitarian benefit of the pleas. Ultimately Mr English was sentenced to two years imprisonment suspended pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Mrs English was sentenced as I understood it, to twenty-one months imprisonment likewise suspended pursuant to s 12 of that Act. They pleaded guilty at the Local Court. The Crown informs me that they had suffered financial hardships as a consequence of their involvement in the offences. On the other hand as I understand, they sought to gain financially from their involvement in the commission of the offences, even if it was to overcome their debts. I have already made remarks about their role by comparison with this offender. Whilst they seem to be regarded as at the lower end of the range of criminality in the view of Black J, as represented by the various participants, their role was absolutely vital in a range of ways. Both in identifying property and being prepared to falsify documents. They were characterised by his Honour as “gullible” but he also noted that they were “attracted to making money with little or no effort”.SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES: 29 The bulk of the submissions came from the accused largely set out in very helpful written submissions prepared by her learned Counsel, Mr Latham, and supplemented by some oral submissions. Whilst the Crown does not seriously dispute Mr Latham’s analysis of the objective facts and whilst it agrees that a suspended term of imprisonment pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 it is within “legitimate sentencing discretion”, it submits that a full-time custodial sentence would also be appropriate in this matter. I regret to say with this latter submission, in the circumstances of this matter I do not agree, particularly having regard to the comparative roles of the various players who have been sentenced thus far, by regard to consideration of parity issue, and her subjective matters. Although I note the various offenders had different roles and were liable for different offences.30 It is submitted, having regard to the facts relevant to this offender, that the prisoner is generally regarded as no greater in culpability than Michael and Grace English by her counsel. Of course the question of parity of sentencing so far as proper comparison can be made, will always be relevant in sentencing. However one must be particularly cautious when comparing sentences for co-offenders who are liable for different offences or greater or lesser numbers of offences. Differing roles may warrant some disparity and of course some particular offenders may attract considerations that may not necessarily have as much weight for the offender at bar. For example in this matter, the offender was a legal secretary. Trevor Brown was a solicitor as well as Alcorn. Not only did those two persons have greater capacity by their training to give effect to the “fraudulent scheme” but their dishonest conduct was a serious breach of their responsibilities as legal practitioners, including their responsibilities to clients, partners, or employers and particularly Government organisations and Departments, such as the Registrar-General’s Department of New South Wales, which is very dependent upon the honesty of such persons. Whilst legal secretaries have responsibilities too, they are not as great as those bestowed upon their employers.31 It is not suggested in this matter that general deterrence has no role to play, but the sentencing of solicitors who conduct themselves dishonestly has always attracted a greater degree of regard to considerations of general deterrence for obvious reasons. 32 I have taken into account the relevant objective and subjective features articulated by Mr Latham, many of these matters have been dealt with above. I note the need for intuitive synthesis of all relevant factors in accordance with the decision of the Hight Court in Regina v Markarian (2005) 215 ALR 213, although discreet discounts may still be given for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty and cooperation. I also note the decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in the guideline judgment relating to Form 1 offences, reported at (2002) 56 NSWLR 146, and the observations made in that judgment about the relevance of Form 1 matters to the sentencing process concerning the principal offence. The placing of these two matters on a Form 1 in this matter does not lead to the ”artificiality” of sentencing that sometimes occurs when many more like offences are on a Form 1 than requiring sentence from pleas of guilty. Here the two matters on the Form 1 relate to one transaction, in respect of which the prisoner has pleaded to six counts on the indictment in any event.33 I note the submissions made about delay particularly the reference to Regina v Todd (1982) NSWLR 517 particularly at page 519. This was a matter of some significance in the appeal by Alcorn to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Here the delay has shown the capacity of the prisoner to proceed along the road to rehabilitation as evidenced by my findings in respect of her conduct since her arrest. The prisoner has been left in a state of uncertainty as well and the process has been very stressful for her and her family. There is no explanation for the two year delay in arresting and charging her, on the other hand much of the delay since has arisen out of committal proceedings and listing the matter for trial. Delay in this matter is not a mitigating factor per se but is relevant in several ways, particularly in assessing the prisoner’s rehabilitation and her ability to avoid offending in the future. 34 I have had regard to s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the various purposes of sentencing therein contained. This is a finely balanced matter when one takes into account all the relevant purposes particularly the need to punish the prisoner and to deter her and other from committing further offences as well as making her accountable for her conduct and denouncing that conduct. Yet at the same time promoting her rehabilitation will in the long term be for the benefit not only of her and her family but also the community. I have had regard to s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and the general way in which that provision is to be approached as discussed in cases such as Regina v Way, Regina v Pellew and others.35 Insofar as aggravating factors arise, noting that relevant aggravating and mitigating factors may not necessarily increase or otherwise affect the sentence, the matters that I properly regard as aggravating factors pursuant to s 21A(2), are as follows:36 The loss, particularly in relation to matters set out in Counts 12 and 13 was substantial as I have already outlined. Each offence was committed as part of a series of criminal acts all related in various ways and each offence was part of planned criminal activity. However, in fairness, the bulk of the planning was undertaken by others for reasons that are apparent from above.37 In relation to relevant mitigating factors, I accept the prisoner does not have any record of previous convictions, was a person of good character, is unlikely to re-offend, has excellent prospects of rehabilitation, by reason of her family support her recent progress, and a demonstrated capacity to avoid further offending, has pleaded guilty and has provided assistance to law enforcement officers as considered by s 23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Although these last two matters have been dealt with separately as I have indicated.38 The offender is to be sentenced for a number of offences, thus each offence has to be dealt with in accordance with the principles laid down in Regina v Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610 particularly at paragraph 45. In this particular matter, Counts 1 to 6 were grouped together in relation to one attempted loan, Counts 7 to 11 are in relation to a successful loan advanced which was repaid and Counts 12 and 13 relate to separate loans in circumstances which I have outlined above. Although the offences are close in time in reality (taking into account the matters on the Form 1) if one was imposing full-time custodial sentences there would have to be as occurred in Regina v Alcorn at least some partial accumulation. On the other hand, if each of the individual sentences I have to determine to impose is to be less than two years with the relevant discounts applied each sentence by itself is potentially capable of, in accordance with the proper approach in these matters, suspension pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.39 It seems before one can ultimately determine to suspend such sentences or consider that seriously is an option, one has to go through the exercise of determining what would otherwise be the appropriate sentence or sentences to be imposed if one properly applied Pearce principles, including considerations of accumulation, concurrency and of course totality. This must be done even if individual sentences to be imposed as here are less than two years imprisonment. As I suggested in the course of submissions and as the Crown has confirmed by its research, suspended sentences cannot be post-dated. Thus suspension of terms of imprisonment in reality, or least “notionally”, may not reflect the “totality” issues that arise (see Regina v Croaker [2004] NSWCCA 470 at para [22]. Regina v Tolley [2004] NSWCCA at para [26]). Ultimately in this matter I have determined that even with proper partial accumulation to give effect to “totality of the criminality” and the application of the relevant discounts the ultimate total sentence would not have exceeded two years imprisonment in any event.40 If I had calculated that the appropriate sentences in totality would have exceeded two years imprisonment, albeit that the individual sentences themselves were less than two years imprisonment, I would not have thought it proper to consider suspension of the individual sentences. The issue that was debated at some length in submissions ultimately becomes one of theory perhaps to be addressed at a later time in relation to another case where the notional accumulation or partial accumulation of sentence to give effect to totality would lead to sentences in excess of two yours imprisonment after proper regard to issues of parity as they arrive in other appropriate matters.CONCLUSION: 41 Noting s 5 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, it is appropriate that terms of imprisonment be imposed for all but one of the offences to which the prisoner has pleaded guilty. Noting the various matters pointed out by Howie J in Regina v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 and by Fitzgerald J A in Regina v JCE (2000) 120 ACR 18, I have determined that as each of the sentences of imprisonment to be imposed is less than two years, they should all be suspended primarily to promote the rehabilitation of the prisoner.42 In respect of Count 4, in order to allow the Court a longer time to monitor the prisoner’s progress than the terms of imprisonment suspended, I propose to convict her and place her on a bond to be of god behaviour for two years. I do not propose to fix non-parole periods. Although this matter is subject to the conclusion expressed in the decision of Regina v Tolley, I was advised yesterday by the Judicial Commission that a Bill read for the second time in the Legislative Assembly on 27 October 2006 proposes to abolish the practice of setting a non-parole period at the time of imposing sentences of imprisonment which are suspended. These orders will reflect the impending new legality. This case in any event with its potential for partial accumulation highlights the potential difficulty of fixing non-parole periods before revocation. Further, I must confess I have never understood how one could fix a non-parole period for a sentence at the time of suspension when the circumstances of potential revocation may impact upon whether a finding of special circumstances ought to be made pursuant to s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In any event that aspect of the matter is now to become academic.43 Just stand up please Ms Rankin.44 In relation to Count 1, taking into account the two matters on the Form 1, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one year four months suspended pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for the term of the sentence. I direct that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for the term of the sentence. Conditions applying during the term of the bond are as follows: 
     
      
      1. You are to appear before Court if called to do so at any time. 
      
     
     
      
      2. You are to be of good behaviour. 
      
     
     
      
      3. You are to advise the Registrar of the Criminal Listing Directorate of the New South Wales District Court at the Downing Centre of any change of residential address. I do not propose in your case to fix a condition that you require supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. At this point I believe that would be an undue burden upon the Probation and Parole Service. I do not believe there are any matters that the Probation and Parole Service need to address in supervision of you. 
      
    45 In relation to Counts 2 and 3 and 5 and 6, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of twelve months in each matter. I order the execution of that sentence be suspended for the term of the sentence in each case. I direct that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a god behaviour bond for the term of the sentence. Conditions applying during the term of the bond are of the same as I imposed in relation to Count 1.46 HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown, did I fix the term of imprisonment for Count 1? One year four months?47 BARR: One year four months your Honour.48 HIS HONOUR: In relation to Count 4 you are convicted. In respect to that matter pursuant to s 9 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I order that you enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of two years from today. Conditions applying during the term of that bond will be the same as for the other bonds that I have ordered.49 In relation to Counts 7 to 11, you are convicted. You are sentenced to fifteen months imprisonment in each case. I order that the execution of the sentence pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act be suspended for the term of the sentence. I direct that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for the term of the sentence on the conditions which I have already outlined.50 In respect of Counts 12 and 13, you are convicted. You are sentenced in each case to eighteen months imprisonment. Pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I order the execution of the sentence be suspended for the term of the sentence. I direct that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for the term of the sentence. Conditions applying during the term of the bond will be the same as I have ordered in respect of Count 1.51 HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown , are there any technical matters from you?52 BAR: No your Honour.53 HIS HONOUR: Any technical or factual matters from you Mr Latham?54 LATHAM: No your Honour.55 HIS HONOUR: Ms Rankin, the effect of the sentences I’ve imposed are as follows. Firstly in respect of all bar one matter, you are in effect sentenced to terms of imprisonment but they will be suspended providing you are of good behaviour. In other words, you do not commit any other criminal offences. I have fixed a good behaviour bond for two years in relation to Count 4 which was from memory the making of a false instrument to wit an authority for two years just to give it a little bit of extra time for the Court to be able to monitor your progress. I’m not fixing any supervision from the Probation and Parole Service. Amongst other things it will be complicated because you’ll be in Western Australia and possibly moving back to Queensland but at any event you do not have any of the classic issues that the Probation and Parole service is well skilled to address. No drug or alcohol or gambling issues and I think in the circumstances the slender resources of the various probation organisations across the Commonwealth of Australia would be better spent elsewhere. But you must understand of course that inherent in the sentences that I have imposed is a calculation of a twenty percent discount in anticipation of your future cooperation on the statement that you have given, do you understand that?56 OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.57 HIS HONOUR: And if you fail to cooperate with the authorities, it would be open to the Crown if it so desired, to appeal the orders that I make it may appeal the orders that I have made in any event, I don’t doubt that, but specifically if you fail to live up to your undertaking as I understand it to cooperate with the authorities and make yourself available to give evidence when called upon, then you run the risk that the matter could be taken to the Court of Criminal Appeal, that the sentences that I have imposed would be increased to the extent that I’ve accorded you a discount for future assistance and of course if you fail to do that and if that appeal was to be undertaken, if that appeal was successful then the issue of appropriate sentencing for you would become a fresh matter for someone else to consider. Probably not me and it could involve you having to serve a term of imprisonment. Do you understand that?58 OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.59 HIS HONOUR: Should it come to pass that some future situation arose that required consideration of the revocation of your section 12 bonds or some re-sentencing exercise, notwithstanding the fact that the Probation and Parole Service has at this stage little work for you to do, in all the circumstances of the matter noting that that would be your first term of imprisonment and other features of the case, I would have been prepared to make a finding of special circumstances. As I’ve explained I don’t propose to give effect to that at this particular point of time. Mr Crown if it’s convenient with you and you Mr Latham, I’ll permit your client to leave the dock on condition that she goes to level 3 with your solicitor to enter into the various bonds and Ms Rankin you must understand that you can’t leave this building until you enter into the various bonds that have been ordered otherwise I can issue a warrant for your arrest. You can leave the dock thanks very much thank you.

      L2001/03 Regina v Anthony Shane Potter  
       
       
      (Video Link to Junee Correctional Centre) 
       
       
      JUDGMENT (on application by Applicant that life sentence redetermination application be heard by way of audio-visual link) 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: This is an application pursuant to s.44(5) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in which the Applicant, Anthony Shane Potter, seeks an order determining a specified term and a non-parole period with respect to a sentence of life imprisonment imposed by Hunt J in the Supreme Court of New South Wales at Sydney on 14 October 1988, following his plea of guilty to murder.  
     
      
    2 On 11 August 2006, the application was fixed for hearing today. At that time, the Applicant was represented by Mr Hutchins of the Prisoners’ Legal Service. For reasons that are not clear, an order was issued under s.77 Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 requiring the production of the Applicant at this Court on 1 December 2006, and not 3 November 2006. The Applicant was then, and remains, a prisoner detained at the Junee Correctional Centre. 
     
      
    3 When I was informed of this state of affairs yesterday, arrangements were made for the application, in the first instance, to proceed by way of video link. The Applicant has appeared today by audio-visual link. He is not represented. He has indicated that he does not wish to be represented on the application and that he wishes the application to proceed today. 
     
      
    4 The Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act 1998 permits a range of criminal proceedings to be heard by audio-visual link. The Applicant falls within the definition of “accused detainee” in s.3 of that Act, and the present application for redetermination of a life sentence falls within the definition of “relevant criminal proceeding” in the same section. As the Applicant is presently detained in prison in the State of New South Wales, s.5BB of the Act has application.  
     
      
    5 By that provision, unless the Court otherwise directs, the present hearing cannot proceed, unless the Applicant appears physically before the Court: s.5BB(1). However, s.5BB(1) does not apply if the parties to the proceedings consent to the Applicant appearing before the Court by audio-visual link from any place within New South Wales: s.5BB(2).  
     
      
    6 The Applicant indicated his consent to the matter proceeding today by audio-visual link. The Crown expressed reservations, given the issues raised on the application, about the matter proceeding by audio-visual link with the Applicant unrepresented, but indicated initially that it would consent to that process if the Applicant wished to proceed today. 
     
      
    7 Following some discussion between the Crown, the Applicant and myself, it became apparent that the Applicant proposed to give evidence on the application. That would, of course, involve cross-examination of the Applicant by the Crown Prosecutor. The difficulties experienced in cross-examining a person by means of audio-visual link are well known: Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Rich (2004) 49 ASCR 578 at 585-586.  
     
      
    8 After discussion with respect to the practicalities of the matter proceeding by audio-visual link, the Crown indicated that it did not consent to the matter proceeding in that way, and thus s.5BB(2) no longer has application.  
     
      
    9 The question remains one for the Court to consider whether a direction ought be given under s.5BB(1). Prima facie, in serious criminal proceedings such as this and consistent with the general law, the Applicant ought be present in Court when the case is heard. The present application is a form of sentencing proceeding where the general law expects, subject to rare exceptions (R v McHardie (1983) 2 NSWLR 733; R v Mokbel [2006] VSC 119 at [13]-[14]), that the prisoner be present.  
     
      
    10 Section 5BB(4) permits the Court to give a direction that the matter proceed by audio-visual link in the absence of consent of one or other of the parties, but only if it is satisfied that it is in the interests of the administration of justice for the Applicant to appear before the Court by audio-visual link. A number of factors are referred to in s.5BB(5) which bear upon the discretionary determination as to what may be in the interests of the administration of justice. Most of those factors appear to relate to the risk to the relevant prisoner, the risk to other prisoners, the risk of escape and matters of that sort. These factors do not appear presently relevant.  
     
      
    11 There are two factors which, it seems to me, militate against a direction that this matter proceed by audio-visual link. Firstly, the Applicant is unrepresented. This is an unusual situation on an application of this type. As the Crown has rightly observed, and as I have emphasised to the Applicant, the present application is one where the Crown not only opposes the application that he makes for the setting of a non-parole period and a determinate head sentence, but will seek an order that he not be allowed to make a further application under this section for a period of 10 years.  
     
      
    12 Further, there is a volume of documentary material upon which the Crown will rely on this application which has been provided to the Applicant only in recent times. This includes the Crown written submissions, statements, a psychiatric report and other material. The Applicant has informed me that he has not taken the opportunity of obtaining advice with respect to those documents from the Prisoners’ Legal Service. Accordingly, the Applicant’s unrepresented status on this application is a matter that bears upon the interests of the administration of justice. 
     
      
    13 Secondly, the Applicant proposes to give evidence on the application and cross-examination will occur. I have mentioned the practical difficulties which arise where cross-examination (especially on documents) is conducted by means of audio-visual link. Section 20E Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act 1998 recognises this difficulty and requires a process whereby documents may be put to the person who is being cross-examined in a remote place. 
     
      
    14 I am conscious that a number of persons have prepared themselves mentally and otherwise for the purpose of this application today. Those persons include the mother of the victim and other family members who have come to Court, no doubt in the hope that the matter might proceed to finality. I understand the pressures on them in preparing themselves mentally for a hearing such as this. There are, of course, persons who are here in the interests of the Applicant. They have no doubt undertaken the process of preparing themselves for what, on any view of it, will be a difficult hearing for those involved.  
     
      
    15 It seems to me, however, that it would not be in the interests of the administration of justice for this application to proceed by audio-visual link. It would, in my view, be almost inevitable that, even if the hearing is commenced, it will not be completed and will be adjourned so that the Applicant can be brought to Sydney. Accordingly, I do not propose to proceed with the matter by way of an audio-visual link hearing and I decline to give a direction under s.5BB(1) and (4) of the Act. 
     
      
    16 I propose to make orders that will see the matter listed for hearing four weeks from today on 1 December 2006 in Sydney. During that four-week period, the Applicant will have an opportunity to consider his position further. As the Crown has indicated (fairly and appropriately), it will be in the interests of the Applicant (and I think in the interests of the administration of justice), and it will assist the Court, if the Applicant is represented on this application. The Crown has indicated a willingness to make contact with the Prisoners’ Legal Service, at my request, to communicate that the matter has been adjourned from today until 1 December 2006 so that that Service may be in a position to provide advice to the Applicant concerning the application generally, including the documents which are now relied upon by the Crown and which will be tendered on 1 December 2006.  
     
      
    17 It is, of course, a matter for the Applicant to decide whether he wishes to be represented at the hearing before me. It is the almost invariable position on applications of this sort, where very serious issues are raised affecting a number of people, that there is representation by a Public Defender, and usually Senior Counsel, instructed by the Legal Aid Commission. Those practitioners have specialised skills with respect to applications of this sort. It remains a matter for the Applicant as to whether he will seek representation. I recommend to him that he give close consideration to this, and take advice in the period which will now be available before the hearing of the matter. 
     
      
    18 The application is adjourned for hearing before me at 10.00 am on Friday 1 December 2006. I note that an order under s.77 Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 was issued (on 26 October 2006) requiring the production of the Applicant at Court in Sydney on that date and at that time. That order is to remain in place and the Applicant is to be produced at Court in Sydney in accordance with that order, so that the hearing may proceed on that day. I note that the Crown will make contact with the Prisoners’ Legal Service with a view to communicating the matters to which I have referred in this judgment. I will take steps to have this judgment revised as soon as possible, so that it might also be made available to the Prisoners’ Legal Service, as it may assist with some background to the recommendation which I have made.

     GREG EVANS v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: On 14 July 2004 the appellant pleaded not guilty before his Honour Judge Woods and a jury to an Indictment containing the following counts: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         
        1. That he, between about 14 August 1985 and 23 May 2001, at Sydney and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales, did defraud the Commonwealth in that he obtained benefits in the name of Greg Evans to which he was not entitled as he was also in receipt of benefits in the name of Gregory Evangelatos. 
         
         
        2. That he, between about 24 May 2001 and 12 October 2001, at Sydney and elsewhere in the state of New South Wales did dishonestly cause a loss to another person which a Commonwealth entity, namely the Commonwealth Service Delivery Agency, in that he obtained a disability support pension in the name of Greg Evans to which he was not entitled as he was also in  
        receipt of a disability support pension in the name of Greg Evangelatos, knowing that such loss would occur. 
        
       
      
    2 The appellant was found guilty by the jury of both counts on 13 August 2004. On 20 September 2004 he was sentenced by the trial judge on the first count to a term of imprisonment of 28 months but to be released after serving a period of 12 months imprisonment upon condition that he enter into a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of 16 months after that date. On the second count he was sentenced to imprisonment for one month, such sentence to be served concurrently with the sentence on the first count. 
     
      
    3 The inclusion of Count 2 in the Indictment was brought about by the repeal of various provisions of the Crimes Act 1914, and their replacement by similar provisions in the Criminal Code. The actions of the appellant, which gave rise to the charges, were committed over a continuous period from 15 August 1985 to 12 October 2001. 
     
      
       
      The Crown case 
       
      
    4 The appellant was born in Greece on 15 May 1945 and migrated to Australia on 29 July 1954, at which time he was known as Gregoire Evangelatos. He subsequently adopted the name of ""Greg Evans"". 
     
      
    5 On or about the 10 November 1980, the appellant lodged a claim for, and was subsequently granted, a Supporting Parents Benefit with the Department of Social Security in the name of Gregory Evangelatos. Thereafter, he continued in receipt of various pensions, benefits and allowances in that name as follows:

    6 On about 20 June 1985, the appellant lodged a claim for, and was granted, a Sickness Benefit by the Department of Social Security in the name of Greg Evans. Thereafter, up until the time of his arrest on 9 October 2001, he continued in receipt of various pensions, benefits and allowances in that name as follows:

    7 The Crown case was that the appellant had no entitlement to any of the benefits, allowances or pensions paid in the name of Greg Evans as he was, at the same time, in receipt of payments in the name Gregory Evangelatos. He received payments under the name of Greg Evans for a period of 16 years and 4 months totalling $164,721.30. 
     
      
    8 On 12 October 2001, Federal Police agents executed a search warrant on the appellant's residence at 24 Ti-tree Avenue, Bogangar, in northern NSW. A large amount of documentation and correspondence relating to the persons Greg Evans and Gregory Evangelatos was seized pursuant to that warrant, including: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) An Australian Passport in the name of Greg Evans along with a Greek Passport in the name of Gregory Evangelatos; 
         
        (ii) Correspondence from the Centrelink in the names of Greg Evans and Gregory Evangelatos; 
         
        (iii) 13 pages of Westpac Classic Account 55-2639 in the names Gregory and Nafisah Evangelatos (being the account into which the Evangelatos pension was paid); 
         
        (iv) A Marriage Certificate in the names Gregory Evangelatos and Nafisah Wongso dated 20/12/86; 
         
        (v) A blue diary in the name of Greg Evans; 
         
        (vi) A prescription in the name of Gregory Evangelatos; 
         
        (vii) A Commonwealth Bank Statement in the name of Greg Evans (being a statement in relation to the account into which the Greg Evans pension was paid); 
         
        (viii) Copies of Applications for advanced payment made to Centrelink in the name Gregory Evangelatos; 
         
        (ix) Correspondence from Centrelink to Greg Evans; 
         
        (x) Documents relating to an account with the National Australia Bank into which payments were made in the name of Greg Evans; 
         
        (xi) Correspondence from Dr Paul Humphrey addressed to Dr Paul Ong regarding Gregory Evangelatos (Dr Ong having provided a medical report at the time of a Centrelink Review of the disability support pension made in the name of Gregory Evangelatos). 
        
       
      
    9 A principal issue at the trial was whether the Crown was able to establish that ""Greg Evans"" and ""Gregory Evangelatos"" were one and the same person. In the course of his closing address to the jury (at AB4/1005) counsel for the appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Ladies and gentlemen, as I understand the Crown case and I don't think there's any real problem with this in your mind, that the accused who's in the dock over there, Greg Evans, claimed and received benefits in the name of Greg Evans between 1985 and 2001. The accused concedes that and we don't take any issue in that point. The Crown alleges that this is the fraud, it's the Greg Evans claim which is between '85 and 2001 that the Crown alleges is the fraud. And the reason why the Crown makes that allegation is because during that period, that is between 1985 and 2001 the accused was in receipt of, had claimed and was in receipt of a benefit under the name of Gregory Evangelatos. So that's the dual claim. 
         
         
        Now as / understand the Crown case the accused was entitled to the benefit to Gregory Evangelatos. He's not entitled to the Greg Evans claim. Now and it's essentially the Gregory Evangelatos claim and benefits that we take issue with"". 
        
       
      
    10 Subsequently counsel for the appellant (at AB4/1006) said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Now he says, the accused, that form 1985 he obtained a benefit from Centrelink in the name, in his name, Greg Evans, that was his legal name at the time and he says that he was entitled to that. And he says the reason why he tells you that in his view he was entitled to that benefit is because from 1980 onwards he did not claim or receive any benefits in the name of Gregory Evangelatos"". 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        So the real issue I would suggest to you in this trial and that is as deciders of the facts because that's your task to decide the facts in this matter is whether or not the accused received a benefit from 1985 to 2001 under the name of Gregory Evangelatos, that / would suggest to you is the real issue in this trial"". 
        
       
      
    11 Counsel for the appellant then addressed the jury (at AB 4/1014) to the effect that it was in fact a group of Federal police officers who had made the original application for the payment of benefits in the name of Gregory Evangelatos, and that they controlled the operation of the bank account into which those benefits were paid at all times thereafter. His Honour summarized the defence case in this respect (at SU 17) as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The two identities, Evans, Evangelatos and his use of the Evangelatos account. On the Crown case he was receiving benefits in the name of Greg Evans but he was not entitled to because he was also receiving benefits in the name of Gregory Evangelatos. In the defence case, of course, he says that that account originated out of his original connections with police and their use of him as an agent of some kind"". 
        
       
      
    12 In support of its case that Greg Evans and Gregory Evangelatos were the one person, and in addition to the material seized pursuant to the warrant and set out in [10] above, the Crown relied upon the following evidence: 
     
     
      
       
        
        (i) surveillance evidence of the Appellant making a withdrawal of $685.00 on 27 September 2001 from an account with the Westpac Banking Corporation in the name of Gregory and Nafisah Evangelatos, that being the same account into which the pension in the name of Gregory Evangelatos was paid; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (ii) evidence from an officer of the Westpac Banking Corporation that on 26 July 1999, at the Bank's Murwillumbah Branch, the Appellant deposited a cheque made out to ""Greg Evans"" into an account in the name of Gregory. Evangelatos; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (iii) evidence that on an application for an Australian Passport made on 5 July 1995 in the name of Greg Evans, the Appellant stated that the name appearing on his Certificate of Citizenship was Gregoire Evangelatos; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (iv) evidence that on 20 March 1989 the Appellant lodged with the NSW Land Titles Office an instrument evidencing a change of name in respect of his son and in doing so, stated that his name was Greg Evans and that his son Adam Gregoire Evangelatos wished to abandon the use of that name and be known under the name of Adam Greg Evans; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (v) evidence that the birth of persons named Nicholas Evans and Nicholas Angelo Evangelatos, which were registered on 14 January 1986 and 24 January 1986, contained the following similarities:

    13 In addition, the Crown relied upon the evidence of a handwriting expert, Ms Michelle Novotny, who examined a selection of documents lodged with Centrelink under the names Greg Evans and Gregory Evangelatos. Whilst in some cases Ms Novotny was unable to reach any definitive conclusion as to authorship, she was able to state that in some instances it was likely that the relevant signatures were made by the one person. 
     
      
       
      The appeal against conviction 
       
      
    14 The Court was provided with a document headed “GROUND OF APPEALS” filed on 29 June 2006. It comprised 30 pages together with an annexure being a letter to the appellant from his solicitors dated 19 August 2004 in which he was advised that the jury’s decision in all the circumstances was unsafe. The letter then set out some 17 grounds of appeal, the last of which contained ten sub-grounds. Those so-called grounds of appeal were not in truth grounds of appeal but constituted reasons why, if accepted, it might be argued that the jury’s decision was unsafe.  
     
      
    15 However, it is clear that each of the 17 matters referred to by the solicitors were advanced to the jury by the appellant’s counsel at trial and formed part of the defence case. The trial judge confirmed as much in his summing up.  
     
      
    16 For example, Items 7 and 9 in the solicitor’s referred to a deficiency in Westpac’s documentation between 1980 and 1989, a matter which his Honour addressed in his summing up (at SU 13) in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The fact that there are no Westpac Bank statements available between 1980 and 1989 leaves an important gap covering a significant period in Count 1. In particular, such records could possibly have shown, or not shown, withdrawals while the accused was overseas in 1989. I repeat that there are real problems with the defence in the present case of increasing importance the further backwards in time one goes from 12 October 2001, the most recent date in the indictment.” 
        
       
      
    17 A further example was the assertion in Item 10 of the letter that there was no evidence before the court regarding identification of the appellant as the person who attended various offices of the Department of Social Security or Centrelink. In this respect his Honour noted in his summing up (at SU 13) that  
     
      
       
        
        “Furthermore, front counter public servants have not been called to give evidence about the various times the accused did, on the Crown case, attend at government offices to obtain benefits or fill in forms.” 
        
       
      
    18 Later in his summing up (at SU 34) the trial judge noted that the appellant’s counsel in his address had pointed out that  
     
      
       
        
        “the Crown has not brought forward anybody from behind the counter, so to speak, to say he is the man, this is the man we paid over money over the counter from the Commonwealth government to this man.” 
        
       
      
    19 Again, towards the end of his summing up his Honour (at SU 39) reminded the jury that the appellant’s counsel had 
     
      
       
        
        “put to you that it is significant that, in addition to the fact that the Crown has not presented anybody from the counter, the front counter, to say they handed money over to this fellow, the accused, they have not called anybody to explain what this Asian or Eurasian policewoman may have been doing. And he says to you that you would expect that, the Crown having the onus of proof, this would have been cleared up by clear evidence from the Crown.” 
        
       
      
    20 A reading of the “Ground of appeals” document prepared on behalf of the appellant (who is illiterate) reveals that the assertions contained in it are a repeat of the very matters upon which he gave evidence at the trial and/or in respect of which his counsel addressed the jury for the purpose of persuading them that there were many gaps and other faults in the Crown’s case.  
     
      
    21 Time and again in the document the appellant asserts that the Australian Federal Police intimidated him into signing documents against his will and that he had no knowledge of the contents of the documents he was required to sign as he was unable to either read or write.  
     
      
    22 Consistent with his evidence in chief before the jury, the document contains assertions that he was harassed by the police and forced to sign documents and that the Crown had failed to produce evidence particularly from employees of the Department of Social Security as well as from police officers which the jury should have expected to have been called. 
     
      
    23 A reading of the trial judge’s comprehensive summing up makes it more than apparent that he put before the jury in some detail the case which the appellant sought to make with respect to the matter, the subject of the charges. Thus his Honour directed the jury in these terms (at SU 26): 
     
      
       
        
        “The Indictment requires that he obtain benefits. It is not enough that there was an account in his name. If he did not obtain the benefit then the charge is not made out. 
        
       
       
        
        He has no difficulty with conceding to you that he was getting payments under the name of Greg Evans [to] which he was entitled but he disputes the Evangelatos connection. 
        
       
       
        
        He told you in his evidence that many of the document[s] which are before the Court as evidence were signed by him but were signed by him under police influence. Some signatures he denies, but where admits claims and other documents that he signed he tells you that there was a police involvement.” 
        
       
      
    24 Again, his Honour fairly put to the jury the appellant’s case when he directed them in the following terms (at SU 28): 
     
      
       
        
        “And it was the police who took him along to get the change of name, the deed poll, in Hindley Street, Adelaide and police took him to the bank and the police have, in effect, been operating the account ever since. And it may be, he being a fellow who cannot read, that various documents have been presented to the government authorities regarding pensions. Police have pressured him to do this. And that effectively, from 1982 or so until 2001 police were not only keeping contact with him, they were using him, you might think, as an informant in relation to the drug matter and that they had had the benefit of the account. He denied, you may remember, repeatedly denied connection with the addresses, the post box numbers and the various Balmain address[es] and so on. He said ‘I don’t – they weren’t my addresses’. 
        
       
       
        
        So you may think on the defence case, what has happened is, that police have used him as an agent for what he at the time regarded as honourable purposes and police have used him as a mechanism for supplementing their police income. That, on the defence case, that this is to be seen as (although you may think initially improbable) an example of the kinds of police corruption which have been revealed in the last ten or fifteen years, some extraordinary instances of police corruption. And on the defence case that is what has occurred here, that these police have pressured him and pushed him around. He has been going from place to place collecting a pension as Greg Evans.” 
        
       
      
    25 Again, towards the end of his summing up, the trial judge said (at SU 36): 
     
      
       
        
        “The inference which Mr O’Sullivan would no doubt advance is that there was some sort of peculiar, odd or corrupt police involvement in this matter, otherwise it would have been cleared up. He says you would reject Mr Morley’s evidence, he is retired, the evens are twenty years ago. He does say that there was a Eurasian female police officer. That is the police officer’s evidence and that is, of course, what the accused says.  
        
       
       
        
        …  
        
       
       
        
        The benefits claim was being used by police for their own private purposes and, for some reason or another, the matter just continued. 
        
       
       
        
        He just did what he was told. … The people using the account could have been anyone with personal details of the accused because, he points out, there is no clear evidence that, at least historically, proper identification was required from people when they went along to the Commonwealth pension department, under whichever name it went at that time.” 
        
       
      
    26 At the end of his summing up the trial judge asked the appellant’s counsel (in the absence of the jury) whether there were any further directions he should make and received a negative answer. In my opinion, one cannot fault his Honour’s summing up and there is nothing in the appellant’s material before this Court that makes any real attempt to do so. It seems to me that the very matters which the appellant relies on in his “Ground of appeals” document as constituting failings on the part of the prosecution were all dealt with in detail by the trial judge in his summing up and in a manner which, if anything, was favourable to the appellant. 
     
      
    27 Accordingly, subject to what follows, none of the so-called grounds referred to in the appellant’s document demonstrated any error on the part of the trial judge that would justify appellate intervention on the basis alleged by the appellant that he did not receive a fair trial. 
     
      
    28 Apart from the foregoing, the Crown’s written submissions identified the following issues as possibly arising out of the appellant’s “Ground of appeals” document as constituting true grounds of appeal. Relevantly, they are as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) The reliability of the handwriting expert’s evidence relied upon by the Crown; 
       
       
      (b) The disclosure by the appellant’s wife in the course of giving evidence that she had stood trial for similar offences and the failure of the trial judge to discharge the jury as a consequence of that reference; 
       
       
      (c) The failure of the trial judge to discharge the jury upon a request being made by one juror to “abstain” from the verdict; and 
       
       
      (d) The admissibility of materials seized during execution of the search warrant with respect to the appellant’s premises.  
       
      
    29 As to the first matter, the trial judge directed the jury at length on the reliability of the handwriting expert’s evidence. He made it clear to the jury that that evidence was not of itself a sufficient basis for a finding of guilty. He spent some three pages of his summing up (at SU 7-9) dealing with that evidence, emphasising to the jury the use to which they could put Ms Novotny’s evidence and referring in detail to its reliability.  
     
      
    30 In particular, he reminded the jury (at SU 18-20) that, inter alia, Ms Novotny was not definite in some of the conclusions she reached and that the evidence would not, if considered alone, be sufficient to base a finding of guilty. The appellant’s counsel took no issue concerning his Honour’s directions with respect to that evidence.  
     
      
    31 As to the second matter relating to the evidence given by the appellant’s wife in the defence case, in the course of cross-examination by the Crown she was asked whether she recognised documents contained in Exhibit BT to which she responded, “I was shown during my trial.” 
     
      
    32 An application was then made by the appellant’s counsel that the jury be discharged upon the basis that as a result of that answer, the jury would realise that she had been on trial on a previous occasion in circumstances relating to the present matter with the result that her credibility would be destroyed. 
     
      
    33 At the time that application was made (9 August 2004), the trial had been in progress for some weeks. His Honour rejected the application and observed that calling Mrs Evans was always going to be a matter of some difficulty and that it had been foreshadowed that it might be necessary for his Honour to caution her in front of the jury about incriminating herself if she answered certain questions asked of her in cross-examination. That in fact came to pass - she repeatedly availed herself of the right to silence during the course of the Crown’s cross-examination of her. 
     
      
    34 His Honour concluded that nothing had transpired in the circumstances that was going to prejudice the jury given the range of allegations put to Mrs Evans and her denials of signatures and other matters in circumstances where the Crown’s contention that she was in collusion with the appellant must have been apparent. 
     
      
    35 His Honour both on the first day of the trial as well as in his summing up, directed the jury in no uncertain terms that any proceedings involving Mrs Evans were entirely irrelevant to the case involving her husband. The direction was extensive, no objection was taken to it and the appellant’s counsel made no request was for any additional directions. 
     
      
    36 The third ground relates to the failure of the trial judge to discharge the jury following an application by one juror to “abstain” from the verdict. After the jurors had retired to consider their verdict, a note was received in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “One of the jurors would like to know if it is possible for her to abstain from the verdict. She is happy for the remaining jurors to deliver a verdict provided it is understood that this juror is not included in their number. The abstaining juror does not want to be the cause of a repeated court process. Thank you.” 
        
       
      
    37 His Honour expressed the view that the appropriate course was to firstly enquire whether further directions or clarification would assist the jury. The appellant’s counsel acquiesced in this course, indicating that he wished to keep all 12 jurors together. When asked whether further assistance was required, the foreperson informed his Honour that it was not.  
     
      
    38 Subsequently, the trial judge expressed further concern about the reference in the note to the abstaining juror “(not wanting) to be the cause of a repeated court process”. Having discussed the matter with counsel, his Honour concluded that he would direct the jury that they should “put out of their heads entirely any question of repeated court process”. The appellant’s counsel also acquiesced to that course. Consequently his Honour directed the jury in detail to that effect. No objection was taken. A reading of those directions (AB 5/1109-111) indicates that they were unexceptional.  
     
      
    39 There are references in the appellant’s “Ground of appeals” document and in the letter from his solicitors attached thereto, that the search of the appellant’s premises was illegal. Four witnesses gave evidence concerning the search. Although some of the witnesses were challenged in cross-examination, for example about the location of various items seized in the course of the search, no allegation or submission was made by the appellant’s counsel that the evidence arising out of the search (and which was admitted into evidence without objection) was illegally or improperly obtained. No basis is to be found in either the appellant’s solicitor’s letter or in his written submissions for the bare assertion of illegality, which is without any supporting evidence or reasoning.  
     
      
    40 There is one further matter which I should mention and which is raised in the appellant’s document. This was a complaint allied with the submission that the trial judge should have discharged the jury as a consequence of Mrs Evans’ answer that she had seen certain documents as they had been shown to her at her trial. The submission was that the jury should have been discharged as officers from the Department of Corrective Services had accompanied Mrs Evans into the courtroom and, therefore, the jury would have realised that she was in custody.  
     
      
    41 In my opinion, there is no basis upon which it could be properly asserted that in some way the jury were prejudiced by the fact that Mrs Evans was quite properly accompanied by officers from the Department of Corrective Services. The appellant’s counsel made no complaint that she was so accompanied, and no application to discharge the jury was made with respect thereto. In any event, as I have already noted, the primary judge’s view with which I concur was that the jury must have been well aware from the nature of Mrs Evans’ cross examination and her responses that she was alleged to have been part of the fraud alleged against the appellant. Furthermore, as I have already observed, the trial judge was at pains in his summing up (at SU 10-11) to instruct the jury not only with respect to her answer in cross-examination that she had been shown certain documents during her trial, but also that the appellant was not charged with any misconduct by his wife. 
     
      
    42 In my opinion, therefore, none of the so-called grounds of appeal advanced by the appellant has any substance. His complaints were, in effect, merely repetitive of the case he had made to the jury and which it had rejected. There is nothing in the appellant’s submissions which bear on either the manner in which the trial was conducted or on the trial judge’s summing up which are capable of supporting his contention that he did not obtain a fair trial. Accordingly, the appellant’s challenge to his conviction should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Appeal against sentence 
       
      
    43 A term of imprisonment of 12 months was imposed on the appellant by his Honour, after which he was released upon entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of 16 months, which will expire on 19 January 2007. 
     
      
    44 The appellant’s submissions with respect to his sentence are a repetition of his submissions with respect to his conviction. In essence, he submitted that he did not obtain a fair trial for reasons which are the same as those advanced to support the same proposition with respect to his conviction. None of those submissions were relevantly directed to any suggested error on the part of his Honour in his Remarks on Sentence.  
     
      
    45 Given that it is well established that absent very special circumstances, a custodial sentence is to be imposed upon those who defraud the Department of Social Services, it seems to me that an actual term of imprisonment of 12 months after which the appellant was to be released on a bond for a further 16 months was in all the circumstances, given the implications of the jury’s verdict of guilty, at the lower end of the range of custodial sentences which it was open to his Honour to impose in the proper exercise of his sentencing discretion.  
     
      
    46 In any event, absent demonstration of any error on his Honour’s part in imposing the sentence he did, the appellant’s challenge to that sentence is unsustainable.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    47 For the reasons set forth above, I would therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (a) Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
      (b) Grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal.

    JUDGMENTIntroduction1 On 9 October 2006, the date the trial of the accused was listed to commence, application was made by the accused to exclude evidence of: 
     
      
      i. the search conducted of the accused and his motor vehicle at about midday on 14 September 2005 at Parramatta, including evidence of finding alleged stolen items found in the vehicle or on the accused and, 
      
     
     
      
      ii. identification or recognition of the accused during the course of a surveillance operation conducted on the morning of 14 September 2005 prior to the accused’s arrest. 
      
    2 In relation to the application to exclude evidence of the results of the search, it was claimed that the police acted illegally, in that they purported to exercise powers to search the accused and his motor vehicle pursuant to s.357E Crimes Act (now repealed), when no such power was available and thus, pursuant to s.138 Evidence Act 1995, the evidence ought be excluded.3 The objection to the evidence of identification or recognition of the accused by surveillance officers was based essentially upon a failure to comply with the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act, particularly s.114 of that Act, as the accused was not previously known to the identifying witnesses.4 The objection to the evidence of identification or recognition fell away as the voir dire examination proceeded, it eventually being conceded by the accused that whilst s.114 Evidence Act applied, there were proper grounds in the circumstances for not conducting an identification parade. Given matters set out below an identification parade involving surveillance police would have been a farce. In the end it was conceded by Counsel for the accused that the relevant surveillance officers, rather than positively identifying the accused, could give evidence of the fact that they saw a person do certain things that they believed (based on the information available to them) either was the accused, or was the same person shown in a photograph of the accused circulated before the surveillance operation. There was some issue taken as to some evidence of recognition flowing from “fleeting glimpse” circumstances. However, as the evidence on the voir dire emerged, and as was conceded in submission by Counsel for the accused, the relevant surveillance officers had ample opportunity to familiarise themselves with the appearance of the accused from the photograph provided to them which is a good likeness. Further, there was a “continuous surveillance” of the person who looked like the accused from the time he left an address known to be associated with the accused until his arrest, he was a man of very distinctive features, the photograph circulated was a true likeness of the person seen on 14 September, the accused himself was photographed in the course of the claimed surveillance, the surveillance people were looking for the accused when observations were made and the accused was the person stopped at the end of the surveillance as proved by a DVD recording of that stop, detention, search and arrest. 5 The critical issue left for determination was the issue of whether the evidence of the searching of the accused, his car, and its consequences was admissible.Relevant Legislation and Legal Principles6 S.357E Crimes Act 1900 provided that: 
     
      
      “A member of the police force may stop, search and detain: 
      
     
     
      
      (a) any person whom he or she reasonably suspects of having or conveying anything stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained or anything used or intended to be used in the commission of an indictable offence or  
      
     
     
      
      (b) any vehicle in which he or she reasonably suspects there is anything stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained or anything used or intended to be used in the commission of an indictable offence.” 
      
    7 In R v Rondo [2001] NSWCCA 540, Justice Smart, for the Court held, on reviewing a number of authorities which elucidate the meaning of the words in s.357E “reasonably suspects” or “suspects”, that: 
     
      
      (a) A reasonable suspicion involves less than a reasonable belief but more than a possibility. There must be something which would create in the mind of a reasonable person an apprehension or fear of one of the state of affairs covered by s.357E. A reason to suspect that a fact exists is more than a reason to consider or look into the possibility of its existence. 
      
     
     
      
      (b) Reasonable suspicion is not arbitrary. Some factual basis for the suspicion must be shown. A suspicion may be based on hearsay material or materials which may be inadmissible in evidence. The materials must have probative value. 
      
     
     
      
      (c) What is important is the information in the mind of the police officer stopping the person or the vehicle or making the arrest at the time he did so. Having ascertained that information the question is whether that information afforded reasonable grounds for a suspicion which the police officer formed. In answering that question regard must be had to the source of the information and its content, seen in the light of the surrounding circumstances. [53] 
      
    (See also Streat v Blanco (NSWSC – 16 March 1998 – unreported) per Smart J.)The Facts of this Matter8 From the evidence available on the voir dire examination I conclude the following facts and related matters as established to the requisite standard to enable me to ultimately determine the legal issues. 
     
      
      1. The accused was a person known to the New South Wales Police, and particularly in the Eastwood Local Area Command as a person who had previously committed domestic breaking and entering and stealing offences. Inspector Wellfare was the Crime Manager at that Command and Constable Sleigh joined its Anti-Theft Squad on 14 September 2005 having worked in the Command for nearly 2 years beforehand. Sleigh is the officer in charge for the purposes of these proceedings. 
      
     
     
      
      2. The accused had a number of modus operandi relating to theft offences known to police, but particularly was known to Constable Sleigh to drive his motor vehicle to suburban streets, park the motor vehicle, attend upon vacant houses, remove property from the houses and return it the vehicle, before driving away. Alternatively he would drive his motor vehicle conveying a dog, park the motor vehicle in the suburban street, take the dog for a walk and during the course of this activity break into domestic dwellings, steal property and return it to his vehicle. 
      
     
     
      
      3. He had committed, or was suspected of having committed, breaking, entering and stealing offences within the Local Area Command in the year prior to 14 September 2005. In fact as at that date he was on bail in relation to three such offences involving alleged breaking, entering and stealing offences on domestic premises in north western Sydney. 
      
     
     
      
      4. As at the date of his arrest in relation to the current matters he had been the subject of many intelligence reports published within the Eastwood LAC identifying him as a person of interest in the investigation of domestic breaking and entering matters. In at least one such report it had been suggested that he might be “turned over”, or as I understand the expression, arbitrarily searched, to ascertain whether he had material within his possession that evidenced such offences. 
      
     
     
      
      5. On 7 September 2005 a surveillance operation was requested by Eastwood LAC officers, approved by the Crime Manager, Inspector Wellfare, in order to further investigate the accused’s activities and determine whether he had committed further offences. Inspector Wellfare believed the accused, based upon his criminal history and suspected activities, to be a career criminal who was still active in committing domestic breaking, entering and stealing offences. So did Constable Sleigh, although his knowledge of those matters was not as complete. 
      
     
     
      
      6. A surveillance operation was undertaken on 8 September 2005. A second surveillance operation was organised to be conducted on 14 September 2005. The Team Leader was Police Officer 1061 a Sergeant of Police in the State Surveillance Branch. A team of eleven surveillance officers was organised to conduct surveillance upon the accused on the 14 September 2005. All these police have suppressed identities under the  
      Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 
       2002. 
      
     
     
      
      7. At the time of the commencement of the surveillance just after 7.30 am on 14 September 2005 the surveillance police and Eastwood Local Area Command police knew: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        i. that the accused lived at or was associated with 74 Coral Tree Drive Carlingford, 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        ii. that he either owned or controlled several vehicles including a 1988 dark blue Ford Fairmont sedan, registration number, CQD 001, 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        iii. the details of his appearance and had possession of photographs of him, being a black and white photograph of him shown face on from the upper chest upwards. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      8. Prior to the surveillance commencing all the surveillance officers were provided with a photograph of the accused of the character previously described. From shortly before 10.00 am on 14 September the accused was the subject of either continuous surveillance commencing at 74 Coral Tree Drive or surveillance of such a character as to satisfy me that he, at the time of arrest at approximately midday in Parramatta, was the same person upon whom surveillance had commenced. The accused’s motor vehicle was followed from the accused’s address to Baulkham Hills and ultimately to Northmead. About 10.25 am he drove into Russell Street Northmead which was a dead end suburban street and he was observed to depart Russell Street at 11.16 am. Two separate surveillance officers saw him either carry, or place, items in the motor vehicle whilst it was parked in Russell Street having previously left the motor vehicle and disappearing from sight not carrying any such items that could be seen. Three surveillance officers saw the accused and his vehicle in Russell Street. Between about 8.30 am and 5.00 pm on this day 15 Russell Street was broken into and property was stolen. 
      
     
     
      
      9. A member of the surveillance team kept a contemporaneous log of observations of the various members of the surveillance team. The team leader, 1061, reported the progress of the surveillance to the Crime Manager at Eastwood LAC and then Constable Sleigh. 
      
     
     
      
      10. By about 11.00 am Constable Sleigh, who previously had known of the accused and the interest that Eastwood LAC held in him, was aware that the accused was regarded as a person of interest in domestic breaking and entering offences, had a history of commission of such offences, had the modus operandi earlier described, was the subject of a surveillance operation that day and that the surveillance operation was in place to make observations of conduct consistent with breaking, entering and stealing offences. The Crime Manager who had approved the request for the surveillance operation in the belief that the accused was a person of interest in relation to further breaking, entering and stealing offences, provided him with some background information about the accused which Constable Sleigh did not know about.  
      
     
     
      
      11. By 11.30 am, Constable Sleigh, with the assistance of plain clothes police assigned from other duties, was tasked with the responsibility of directing an operation to intercept the accused. This decision was made by Wellfare on the basis that given the accused’s background, his belief as to the accused’s recent activities and having regard to the information provided by ongoing commentary from 1061 at the team leader, he believed the accused had committed an offence whilst in Russell Street Northmead. Whilst nobody had actually seen the accused break into the premises, it was reasonable on the information provided by 1061 for Sleigh and Inspector Wellfare, to conclude that the accused’s observed activities in Russell Street were consistent with him having broken into domestic premises and placed property from any breaking and entering, or related offence, in his vehicle.  
      
     
     
      
      12. If they were not specifically advised of that conclusion by 1061, they were aware: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        i. the accused has stopped in a suburban street, 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        ii. he had left his vehicle for a period of time, 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        iii. he had placed property in his vehicle that had not been carried from it, 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        iv. there was no intelligence available to police that the accused had any prior connection with Russell Street Northmead, 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        v. the above activity was consistent with his known modus operandi. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      The conclusion was reasonably open that to them an offence had been committed given their prior knowledge of the accused and other background information. Some of this information may not have been admissible and was hearsay, but it still had probative value. 
      
     
     
      
      13. The accused drove to Parramatta, parking in Market Street, before being observed to visit Parramatta Police Station and other places. Whilst in Parramatta he was photographed, as was his vehicle. There is no doubt that the photographs taken in the period of time from approximately 11.25 am until 11.50 am show the accused. Having regard to all the circumstances I am satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused was the same person that police had followed from Coral Tree Drive to Parramatta. He was easily identified when observed by surveillance police, given his distinctive features. 
      
     
     
      
      His distinctive features include: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        i. a bald head fringed by grey hair,

      He was observed at relevant times wearing the same clothing. Descriptions of the clothing worn by the person under surveillance during the operation match the description of the clothing shown in the photographs of the accused taken after 11.30 am, as well as the video image of him taken at the time of his arrest around midday on the same day. 
      
     
     
      
      14. Whilst at Parramatta the accused was under some surveillance from Mr Sleigh whom I am satisfied was then directing operations concerning the interception of the accused. Inspector Wellfare had organised Highway Patrol Officers to assist because of the fear of a pursuit. Whilst the Highway Patrol Officers relevantly “stopped” the accused (see s.357E) they did so as agents for, and at the direction of, Constable Sleigh who at the time had operational responsibility for the interception. They had the power to “stop” the accused to administer a random breath test in any event. 
      
     
     
      
      15. When the accused was at Parramatta, Constable Sleigh and Inspector Wellfare, each had a reasonable suspicion, at the very least, that the accused had earlier committed an offence of breaking, entering and stealing and that property associated with that offence, or a similar offence such as entering a dwelling house to steal property etc, was in his possession, either on his person or in the motor vehicle over which he had had control since the surveillance had commenced. 
      
     
     
      
      16. Whilst it was Constable Sleigh who specifically directed the stopping, detention and searching of the accused, and was ultimately responsible for the execution of those matters, the operation was directed by Inspector Wellfare, allowing for his knowledge of the accused and the information available from surveillance, he had, in the terms contemplated in  
      Rondo 
      , a reasonable suspicion required to be established pursuant to s.357E. 
      
     
     
      
      17. The Highway Patrol officers, after they stopped the accused in his motor vehicle as he drove away from Parramatta, subjected him to a random breath test. The detention of the accused and the searching of the vehicle was supervised by Constable Sleigh, assisted by Constables Linsell and Mezzone, the Eastwood uniform police seconded at the request of Inspector Wellfare. 
      
     
     
      
      18. There is a film available of the “pursuit” of the accused (although there is no suggestion he sought to escape), the stopping of his vehicle, his detention and his arrest. The search is not completely filmed. This is because the camera within the Highway Patrol vehicle was moved to keep the accused under constant viewing and in order for that to occur the vehicle, was for some period of time, out of view. On the basis of the film and oral evidence there is absolutely no evidence of any impropriety in the stopping of the accused vehicle, his detention or the search of him or his vehicle. Whilst the sound recording is indistinct in some respects, there are contemporaneous statements made by the police and the accused recorded on the audio record, consistent with the police finding a number of the allegedly stolen items in the vehicle and bringing them to the attention of the accused. The accused either denied knowledge of the presence of relevant items in the motor vehicle or declined to comment. There is no evidence of any “loading” of the accused with stolen property at the scene of the interception. Property found within the motor vehicle is capable of being established as being the property of the two persons living at 15 Russell Street Northmead. 
      
     
     
      
      19. The ‘interception’ of the accused vehicle was not random or speculative. This exercise was not a “turning over” of the character suggested in a previous intelligence report published by Eastwood LAC in early 2005, as a means of detecting whether the accused had committed a crime. The combination of the intelligence published concerning the accused’s past activities, the criminal history of the accused, his known modus operandi and the conduct observed during the time he was under surveillance, reasonably provided a basis for the suspicion that was in the mind of Constable Sleigh, and for that matter Inspector Wellfare, before the operation to intercept the accused was executed. 
      
     
     
      
      20. The interception, detention and search was not conducted on the basis of mere “possibility” that the accused had in his possession, or there was contained within the motor vehicle controlled by the accused, “anything stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained” or “intended to be used in the commission of an indictable offence”. The state of mind of Sleigh and Wellfare was “more than a reason to consider or look into the possibility” that the accused may be carrying stolen property. 
      
     
     
      
      21. That later situation may have been the case had the accused been intercepted driving away from his home shortly after 10.00 am. Particularly if the only basis for the decision to stop, detain and search, was the intelligence available to Eastwood LAC police, encapsulated in the intelligence report which sought approval of a surveillance operation prepared on 7 September 2005 by Officer Corrigan, an officer of the Eastwood LAC. This was not a random stoppage on any view of it. Based upon the observations of surveillance police, there was a suspicion (at the very least), that was reasonable in all the circumstances, that the accused had in fact committed an offence of the type for which the surveillance had been ordered to detect. 
      
    9 In reaching these various conclusions, by reference to the matters that are to be considered in determining whether there has been compliance with s.357E, I have taken into account some conflict in the evidence, including conflict that exists between what surveillance officer 1061 says that he was told by other surveillance officers, what he says he told Inspector Wellfare and/or Constable Sleigh, what they say they understood they had been told by Officer 1061 and what Inspector Wellfare and Constable Sleigh recall of the sequence of events in recruiting other police and in the directions given to Constable Sleigh to conduct the “interception” operation. These purported inconsistencies may be explained by differing recollections of the same events after an extended period of time where no detailed contemporaneous record was kept of the various communications. In any event the differences between the various accounts are in essence not significantly inconsistent. I am satisfied 1061 was reporting to Eastwood police what he was told by other surveillance police. What 1061 reported could reasonably have been interpreted by Inspector Wellfare and/or Constable Sleigh to be the report of an actual offence committed or a body of circumstantial evidence supporting such a conclusion. Conclusion10 Having regard to the matters outlined above I find no breach of s.357E Crimes Act in the circumstances and manner in which the accused was stopped, detained and searched. There is no evidence of any impropriety in relation to this matter. There is no evidence of the accused being “loaded”, nor was any suggestion of this made in the course of the voir dire examination. Nor was there any suggestion made to surveillance officers that they were not truthful, reliable for that matter, in their evidence of the surveillance. Of course, it was not incumbent upon the accused in any way, shape or form, to make any such suggestion in relation to any of the evidence. The success or otherwise of the application to exclude the evidence, was not dependant upon the accused’s case being put to the relevant witnesses in that respect.11 The evidence objected to was relevant, it was thus admissible subject to any “discretion” available to exclude it. No suggestion was made that the evidence would be excluded pursuant to discretions available under s.137, or for the matter s.135 Evidence Act 1995. S.138 Evidence Act 1995 does not arise, because the evidence was not obtained improperly or in contravention of an Australian law or in consequence of any such illegality or impropriety. No issue arises therefore as to whether the Crown has established that the “desirability of admitting the evidence out weighs the undesirability of admitting the evidence that has been obtained in a way in which the evidence was obtained”.12 Although I need not consider s.138 at this point, having regard to the evidence on the voir dire as to the admissibility of this evidence and the issues raised, I would not have concluded in any event, if I had found that there was no reasonable suspicion relevantly existing, that either Constable Sleigh, his colleagues at the arrest site, or Inspector Wellfare, acted in bad faith in determining that an operation should be undertaken to intercept the accused, detain and search him or his vehicle on 14 September 2005.13 Therefore I conclude that, subject to those minor matters discussed in relation to the circumstances of the interview of the accused at the scene of his detention, the evidence of the search of the accused and vehicle over which he had control ought not be excluded.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Thomas Douglas Watkins, known as Doug Watkins, was employed as the financial controller for a successful family company, Tasman KB Pty Limited. That company conducted its timber wholesaling business with a head office in Sydney and other offices in Brisbane and Melbourne. Over a considerable period of time the offender took over two million dollars from the company. He now stands to be sentenced on 43 separate charges under section 176A of the Crimes Act. Each offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years. 2 The offender's crimes were relatively unsophisticated. He was not a signatory to any of the company's bank accounts, but he was permitted and indeed required to prepare cheques for signatures by one of the three signatories. On 43 separate occasions he presented a cheque to a particular signatory, David McAndrew. Each time the cheque was presented to Mr McAndrew for his signature, the payee line read ""Pay Westpac St Marys"". Mr McAndrew, no doubt influenced by his trust in the offender, believed that these were cheques which needed to be signed in order to effect a transfer from the company's Brisbane bank account to the company's Sydney bank account. The cheques were all drawn on the Brisbane account and the company had an account at the St Marys branch of the Westpac Bank, so Mr McAndrew signed the cheques. The offender had left a gap between the word ""Pay"" which is printed on the cheque and his handwritten entry ""Westpac St Marys"". Into each of those gaps the offender wrote the words ""T Watkins"", so that the payee line on the cheques now read ""Pay T Watkins Westpac St Marys"". He then deposited each of the 43 cheques into his own personal bank account at Westpac St Marys and spent the money gambling. 3 The offender pleaded not guilty to every one of the 43 separate charges. He maintained in evidence that the cheques contained the words ""T Watkins"" on them when Mr McAndrews signed them. He had different explanations as to why it was that, he as a person who was not a signatory to any of the company bank accounts, was paid large sums of money by the company. The explanations fitted into three broad categories, which given the wholesale rejection by the jury it is not necessary to further discuss. 4 This was a remarkably strong case. The accused gave evidence which revealed in a most obvious way that he was unable to explain the inexplicable. For a start, a forensic document examiner was able to determine that the words ""T Watkins"" were often written with different ink and thus a different pen to the words ""Westpac St Marys"". The accused's explanation for this was unconvincing in the extreme. The document examiner also noted that the gaps between the words in the payee line clearly suggested that the words ""T Watkins"" had been squashed in after the rest of the payee line had been written. 5 The accused could only provide unbelievable explanations for other aspects of his behaviour and he was not assisted by evidence called on his behalf either. His wife, from whom he is now separated, contradicted both him and herself as to important matters. 6 I want to make it quite clear the offender is not to be punished for having exercised his right to trial, nor for attempting to portray the head of the company as a shady and underhand gambler. He does not of course receive a discount for pleading guilty, nor can he suggest that he is remorseful for his conduct, but his sentence will not be increased beyond that which is appropriate. 7 Quite clearly each of these 43 offences represent a significant breach of trust. That is a matter which is implicitly an element of the offences, so is not a separate aggravating feature under section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In this case the breach of trust was significant given the offender's professional standing and his position within the company. I gather that the directors of Tasman AB Pty Limited were rather more concerned with timber wholesaling than they were with office administration, and it was for that reason that they relied on the offender to do his job properly and honestly. They were entitled to be able to trust him. 8 As they now know, they were not the first of the offender's employers to suffer a loss because of his dishonesty. In the early 1980s the offender committed a large number of offences of dishonesty against his then employer John Fairfax and Sons Limited. He committed 37 separate offences of larceny as a clerk, taking from that company the sum of $703,922.26. He was sentenced for those offences to a period of imprisonment for 4 years with a non parole period of 12 months. He is this not entitled to any leniency on the basis of his prior good character.9 The offender is now 67 years of age. He was born in the country, left school at 14 and completed the intermediate certificate. He subsequently completed accounting studies and in 1965 he completed a course which entitled him to be a company secretary. He has always worked in the accountancy and financial services field. He was married and separated from his first wife. He was left with the care of his 14 year old son and he brought him up alone. His second marriage ended when his wife passed away in 1991 and he married again in 1994. That marriage appears to be at an end. He is now separated from his third wife. No doubt his past incarceration, which I will shortly mention, is a factor in that separation. 10 The trial at which the offender was convicted of those 43 counts was not the first trial that he faced for these matters. He earlier faced trial before Woods QC DCJ for some 30 offences covering, in a broad sense, the same offences which he must now be sentenced. He was sentenced by Woods DCJ on each count to identical periods of imprisonment, they being of 5 years, consisting of a minimum term of 3 years and 9 months with an additional term of 1 year and 3 months. Mr Watkins appealed those convictions and was successful, but spent some time in custody as a result. 11 In those circumstances, the cases surrounding the approach a sentencing judge should take following a conviction after a successful conviction appeal were examined in submissions before me. I will summarise them very shortly by saying that there is a principle or rule that ordinarily a judge in my position should not impose a sentence which is longer than the sentence imposed by the first sentencing judge. The reasons for this were explained in R v Gilmore (1979) 1 A Crim R 416. It is in the interests of justice that people are able to challenge their convictions without fear of receiving a greater sentence on retrial and there must not be an appearance that there was an element of retribution, whereby the criminal justice system operates such that people get longer sentences after having convictions overturned on appeal. 12 However, as it is clear and accepted by Mr Martin, who appears on the behalf of the offender, that approach is not universally to be adopted. There are a number of circumstances here which have persuaded me to impose overall a longer sentence than that earlier imposed. 13 I have taken into account that, as I have mentioned earlier, he was sentenced the offender for fewer counts than the 43 for which I am to sentence him. The money involved in those counts was slightly less than the money involved in the present 43 counts. There was a Crown appeal on foot which the Court of Criminal Appeal did not deal with after deciding to quash the earlier convictions. Woods DCJ did not accumulate any of the sentences which he imposed. And finally, with the greatest of respect to his Honour, I consider that the overall sentence he determined was inadequate. I have to give expression to my own view, taking into account and giving great weight to what has happened earlier. My own view is that the overall sentence I will impose must necessarily be a longer one than that which his Honour imposed. 14 I mentioned the question of accumulation. These offences occurred over a long period of time, approaching 3 years. There is no suggestion that at any stage the offender was overcome with remorse and determined himself that he would cease his illegal activities. I am satisfied that were it not for employees of the company discovering a discrepancy in relation to one particular cheque concerning QBE Insurance, the offender's wrongdoing would have continued indefinitely. 15 There were 43 separate occasions when the offender committed a criminal offence and I am satisfied that it would be quite wrong in principle for him to receive a sentence for those 43 offences which is equivalent to what he would have got had he committed a single offence. I have, in conformity with the High Court requirements as outlined in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, determined the appropriate sentence for each offence and then turned my mind to issues of accumulation. As will be made clear at the end of these remarks on sentence, I divided the offences into the three broad categories I mentioned earlier, the first dealing with expense codings, the second with codings for Austral Softwoods, and the third which were coded as loans and for QBE Insurance.16 I mentioned earlier that the offender spent the money he took from Tasman KB Pty Limited gambling. This is not something that the offender himself admits. He claimed at trial that he was a successful gambler, but I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that was not the case. Indeed, Mr Martin's submissions proceeded on the basis that I would find that the offender had a problem with gambling which he himself would not recognise. I am satisfied that the money, $2,242,642.22, was simply gambled away. 17 The fact that a person is addicted to gambling, as the offender appears to be, is rarely a matter of significant mitigation. The offender had a choice. Once he had gambled away all his own money he could have stopped and sought counselling, but he chose to continue gambling with other people's money, knowing better than most the risks that this activity had to his continued liberty. He began to take money from Tasman KB Pty Limited so that he could gamble very much with his eyes open as to what would happen to him if he was detected. In those circumstances the fact that the offender was motivated by a gambling addiction is not a matter of significant mitigation at all.18 Mr Martin said that there were but two purposes of sending the offender to gaol. They were general deterrence and retribution. They are pretty good reasons to impose a significant sentence on the offender. Others in his position who find themselves able, through trickery, to take other people's money must know that if they do so and they are detected they will go to gaol for a significant period of time. The breach of trust which is implicit in each of these offences requires that the offender is harshly punished. The sentences must also recognise in a meaningful way just how wrong it is for someone to benefit through illegal use of someone else's money, especially when that person is placed, as the offender was, in a position of trust. 19 I am also satisfied, despite Mr Martin's submission, that there needs to be a component of personal deterrence in the present case. The offender should have learnt through his experiences in the early 1980s that if he acted dishonestly in a significant way he would be significantly punished as a result. He did not learn from his experience. The sentence I will shortly announce must act as a warning to him that if he finds himself in the position where he is able to take someone's money in the future, he will recognise the obvious result of doing so. 20 Although it seems clear that as a result of the offender's age and his convictions for these matters he is unlikely to be put in a position where he will have access to large sums of money, I am not at all convinced that he is beyond the realm of possibility that the offender will find himself in a position where he can take other people's money in the future. For that reason I have included in the sentence I will shortly announce a consideration of the need to personally deter this offender. 21 As I mentioned earlier in these remarks on sentence, the offender is now 67 years of age. He suffers from some medical problems as well, including high blood pressure, migraine headaches and attacks of gout. Although there are those medical issues, they are not such as to lead to a significant reduction in the custodial sentence that would otherwise be appropriate. 22 I have taken into account the offender's age and the fact that he will spend a significant part of his remaining years in custody. That is unfortunately a necessary consequence of the seriousness of his wrongdoing. However, I should say that were he a younger man he would have received a longer sentence. 23 Mr Martin asked that I find special circumstances. I will do so. They are primarily related to the offender's age. However, I am not going to adjust the ratio of non-parole period to head sentence as favourably to the offender as Mr Martin suggested. The effective non parole period I will shortly announce is the lowest I consider which reflects the abject gravity of the offender's conduct in all the circumstances of this case. 24 The sentences are as follows. For counts 1 to 7 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, I set a non parole period of 4 and a half years to commence on 28 July 2005. It will expire on 27 January 2010. I set a head sentence on those matters of 5 years. For counts 8 to 21 I set a non parole period of 3 and a half years to commence on 28 July 2006. It will also expire on 27 January 2010. I set a head sentence of 5 years. For counts 22 to 43 I set a non parole period of 2 and a half years, commencing 28 July 2007, and a head sentence for those matters of 5 years. Thus, the offender is eligible to be released to parole on 27 January 2010. The overall effect of my sentence is a head sentence of 7 years with a non parole period of 4 and a half years.

     DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS (CTH) v Salvatore Peter CASSANITI 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: On 30 September 2005 Mr Cassaniti (“the Appellant”) was found guilty by a jury on 22 charges under s 29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) of defrauding the Commonwealth and on one charge of attempting to defraud the Commonwealth. The offences were committed by him as the principal of an accountancy firm, Cassaniti and Associates. The charges related to payments on account of income tax, or refunds of tax purportedly paid. 
     
      
    2 On 2 December 2005 the Appellant was sentenced in the District Court to a period of five years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and nine months. The first of the sentences was to date from 30 September 2005 and involved a period of one year and seven months, expiring on 29 June 2008: Judgment on sentence, 2 December 2005, pp 1 and 49 (Norrish DCJ). 
     
      
    3 On 7 November 2005, after his conviction but before his sentence, the Appellant filed a “notice of intention to appeal”. Despite that prompt action, a notice of appeal with grounds was not filed until 9 August 2006. The following day, 10 August 2006, he applied for bail pending determination of the appeal. The appeals, together no doubt with such leave applications as are necessary in relation to the sentences, are to be heard by this Court on 7 December 2006.  
     
      
    4 On 22 September 2006, the bail application came before Hidden J, sitting as a judge in the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court. His Honour granted bail subject to a number of conditions as to residence, reporting to police, deposits of security and requirements that he not apply for a passport or travel document or approach any point of departure from the country. 
     
      
    5 The primary judge acknowledged that the Appellant needed to demonstrate “special or exceptional circumstances” justifying the grant of bail, in order to satisfy s 30AA of the Bail Act 1978 (NSW). He identified the relevant circumstances relied upon as: 
     
      
       
      (a) a deterioration in the Appellant’s mental health since his incarceration, and 
       
       
      (b) his involvement in a complex of civil litigation. 
       
       
      Grounds of review 
      
    6 The application for review of the bail determination is brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth), pursuant to a power conferred by s 48(1)(a)(iv) of the Bail Act. The power conferred by s 48 on identified individuals is a power to review a decision “pursuant to” Part 6, Division 2. The document entitled “Request for review” does not specify the section under which review is sought, although there is a reference to s 46 (presumably of the Bail Act) included at the head of the form. (According to the Bail Regulation, cl 22(1)(b), Form 11 may not be appropriate, but nothing turns on this.) Assuming this Court has a relevant power, the Court in this matter is exercising federal jurisdiction and the reference to “the Director of Public Prosecutions” in s 48 should be understood as including the Commonwealth Director: see Commonwealth DPP v Germakian [2006] NSWCA 275 at [43]. Other provisions of the Bail Act operate in federal jurisdiction pursuant to s 68(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth): see generally, Germakian at [42]-[44]. 
     
      
    7 The specific power of this Court to review a decision in relation to bail arises from a combination of ss 30, 46 and 47. It will be necessary to consider the terms of those provisions below. 
     
      
    8 The grounds upon which the Director seeks to review the decision of the primary judge were as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. By reason of the provisions of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
       1912 (NSW), Hidden J sitting as a single judge of the Court of Criminal Appeal had no power to grant bail under ss 30 and 30AA of the  
      Bail Act 
       1978 (NSW). 
       
       
      2. There were no valid appeals before Hidden J as leave was required to file the grounds of appeal and no such leave had been given; absent such leave there was no jurisdiction in the Court to grant bail. 
       
       
      3. Even assuming leave is granted to lodge the subject grounds of appeal, there is no power in the Court to grant bail in relation to those offences of which the offender was convicted and sentenced which are not the subject of an appeal. The subject grounds of appeal do not relate to counts 2, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24. 
       
       
      4. None of the material presented to Hidden J on behalf of the offender gave rise or gives rise to special or exceptional circumstances for the purposes of enabling bail to be granted. 
       
       
      Jurisdiction of single judge 
      
    9 The first ground challenges the jurisdiction of a single judge to grant bail in relation to an appeal to this Court, assuming one was extant. It refers to Hidden J sitting “as a single judge of the Court of Criminal Appeal”. The reasons for determination of the bail application, as published by his Honour, were headed in the Common Law Division. It is therefore necessary to consider both whether he was sitting in the Common Law Division or in the Court of Criminal Appeal and whether, on either view, he had power to grant bail. 
     
      
    10 The Court of Criminal Appeal is dealt with in Part 4, Division 5 of the Bail Act. That Division contains two sections, 30 and 30AA. Power is conferred by s 30 which relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        30 Power of Court of Criminal Appeal to grant bail 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The Court of Criminal Appeal may grant bail in accordance with this Act to any person accused of an offence if, in connection with the offence:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) an appeal is pending in the Court,  
           
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) the Court has directed a stay of execution of a conviction and the stay is in force … .  
          
         
        
       
      
    11 For the purposes of the Bail Act, appeal is defined to include an application for leave to appeal and “a proceeding by way of appeal”: s 4(1). Further, a reference to a person accused of an offence includes a person convicted of an offence: s 4(2)(a). 
     
      
    12 The first point raised by the Director is that the constitution of the Court for the purpose of exercising its powers is defined by the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). That Act relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        3 Constitution of court  
         
        (1) The Supreme Court shall for the purposes of this Act be the Court of Criminal Appeal, and the court shall be constituted by such three or more judges of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice may direct.  
         
        (2) More than one sitting of the court may be held at the same time.  
        
       
       
      The Director also relies upon s 22 of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
       which identifies the powers of the Court which may be exercised by a judge of the Court, but does not include determining an application for bail. The Director refers to  
      R v Burns  
      (1920) 20 SR (NSW) 351, for the proposition that the Court has no powers “except those conferred upon it by the [ 
      Criminal Appeal Act 
      ]”: at p 358 (Gordon J) (Pring J agreeing). 
       
      
    13 Put in these terms the submission is without substance. True it is that Gordon J in Burns made the statement he did, but it was in the context of a possible amendment by the Court of Criminal Appeal to an indictment, in order to apply the proviso in s 6 of the Act that there had been no substantial miscarriage of justice. It was not a pronouncement of principle in any general sense, nor should it be read as such. Other statutes can confer powers on this Court, a fact expressly recognised in relation to the Bail Act by s 29 of the Criminal Appeal Act, which provides that the Bail Act shall prevail to the extent of any inconsistency between that Act and the Criminal Appeal Act. Indeed, as the Director effectively concedes, it is s 30 of the Bail Act which confers power on this Court to grant bail. The term “Court of Criminal Appeal” is defined in s 4(1) of the Bail Act to include a judge of the Court. To the extent that all Supreme Court judges are judges of this Court, absent any indication to the contrary, the power conferred on this Court by s 30 can be exercised by a judge of the Court. Because the Criminal Appeal Act does not confer powers with respect to bail, the absence of any reference to the power to grant bail in s 22 of that Act does not give rise to any implication that a judge of the Court has no such power. 
     
      
    14 The strength of the Director’s argument must rely upon the fact that s 3(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides that the Court must be “constituted” by identified judges “as the Chief Justice may direct”. The argument must therefore be that, unless Hidden J was a member of the Court of Criminal Appeal as constituted on the day on which he granted bail (22 September 2006), he was not sitting as this Court and therefore could not exercise the power conferred on this Court by s 30 of the Bail Act. 
     
      
    15 That reasoning should be accepted. The reasons for judgment of 22 September 2006 indicate that his Honour was sitting in the Common Law Division. It is not uncommon for applicants for bail pending appeal to be dealt with in that jurisdiction. Indeed, in Regina v Antoun [2005] NSWCCA 270, in considering an application for bail pending an appeal to the High Court (special leave having been granted), this Court noted that such a course was indeed appropriate, given the administrative difficulties in constituting this Court, should any subsequent variation be required: at [5]. Similarly, in the matter of Regina v Potier [2005] NSWCCA 256 (publication of which has been restricted until earlier this month) it is clear that an application had been made to a single judge exercising the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, prior to the application to this Court: at [3]. The practice of constituting the bail judge as a judge of the Court of Criminal Appeal for the purpose of dealing with a bail application by an appellant is not known to this Court. It should be assumed that it did not happen in relation to Hidden J. 
     
      
    16 The Director further submitted that this was a fatal flaw in his Honour’s jurisdiction, because the clear inference to be drawn from the presence of s 30 of the Bail Act was that bail pending an appeal to this Court could only be dealt with by this Court. 
     
      
    17 This last submission is not persuasive. Part 4 of the Bail Act confers in separate Divisions powers on magistrates, the District Court, the Supreme Court, the Court of Criminal Appeal, and other courts. In some cases restrictions are imposed on the powers conferred: for example, s 27 imposes limitations on the power of a District Court judge. Division 4 confers power on the Supreme Court to grant bail, in terms which are not so limited. In Division 5, s 30 confers powers on this Court in the terms set out above. The limitation provided by s 30AA is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        30AA Limitation on power to grant bail  
        
       
       
        
        Notwithstanding anything in this Act, if:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) an appeal is pending in the Court of Criminal Appeal against: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) a conviction on indictment, or  
           
          (ii) a sentence passed on conviction on indictment, or  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (b) an appeal from the Court of Criminal Appeal is pending in the High Court in relation to an appeal referred to in paragraph (a), 
        
       
       
        
        bail shall not be granted by the Court of Criminal Appeal  
        or any other court 
         unless it is established that special or exceptional circumstances exist justifying the grant of bail. 
        
       
       
      The words emphasised reveal unequivocally that the power to grant bail in relation to an appeal pending in this Court is not restricted to this Court. The term “court” includes the Supreme Court and therefore includes a judge of the Supreme Court exercising power under s 28. There is nothing in Division 4 (containing ss 28 and 29) to preclude that exercise of power. Section 30AA is inconsistent with the inference sought to be drawn by the Director. 
       
      
    18 It follows that Hidden J had power to consider the application to grant bail albeit, as his Honour correctly noted, the power was constrained by the express terms of s 30AA. 
     
      
       
      No valid appeal on foot 
      
    19 The second ground of review asserted that no valid appeal was extant at the time the primary judge dealt with the application for bail. The reason for that was that the notice of intention to appeal having been lodged on 7 November 2005, the six month period during which the notice had effect expired on 6 May 2006: Criminal Appeal Rules, r 3A(1). A notice of appeal was required to be given either within the period of three months after conviction or sentence or within the six month period during which the notice of intention had effect: r 3B(1). As at the date on which bail was granted, neither of those periods had been extended and accordingly, the Director argued, the notice of appeal filed on 9 August 2006 was invalid, with the result that there was no appeal pending in this Court at the date on which his Honour granted bail. 
     
      
    20 Somewhat opportunistically, the Respondent sought to adopt that submission and rely upon s 47 of the Bail Act which provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        47 General limitation on power to review 
        
       
       
        
        A court may not pursuant to this Division review a decision in circumstances where, had the decision not been made, the court would be prohibited from making a decision in relation to the grant of bail. 
        
       
       
      In other words, there being no valid appeal pending at the present time, this Court would be unable to exercise its powers under s 30 to grant bail and would therefore not be entitled, under s 46(1), to review a decision made by the Court in relation to bail. 
       
      
    21 Once it is accepted that the primary judge exercised a power as a judge of the Supreme Court under s 28 of the Bail Act, the Director’s complaint falls away. The jurisdiction under s 28 is conferred in relation to “any person accused of any offence”. The term “a person accused of an offence” is defined to include a person charged with, convicted of or found guilty of an offence: s 4(2)(a). The power would extend to a person convicted but not yet sentenced, and, theoretically perhaps, to a person convicted and sentenced, whether or not an appeal had been lodged. The last conclusion may, however, be doubtful because s 4(2)(c) expressly extends the definition of a person accused of an offence to “a person in respect of whom an appeal … relating to an offence is pending”. But that doubt need not be resolved in this case. 
     
      
    22 Subject to one qualification, the Director accepts that this Court may extend the period for which a notice of intention to appeal has effect, whether before or after the expiry of the period: see r 3A(2). (It would appear that where a notice of intention to appeal has been given within time, there is no power to extend the period of three months after conviction, during which a notice of appeal may be given: cf r 3B(2).) However, an explanation has been given for the delay and the Director, subject to the qualification noted, did not oppose an extension of time within which to lodge a notice of appeal. The Appellant required an extension to avoid his appeal being dismissed because not validly lodged. 
     
      
    23 The qualification arose from the requirements of r 23C in relation to the documents which are to accompany a notice of appeal. These include a statement of the grounds of appeal, written submissions in support of the appeal, a certificate in relation to the availability of the transcript of the proceedings below and the exhibits at the trial and a statement nominating the legal representatives acting for the appellant. The written submissions, in support of the notice of appeal, were not lodged until 22 September 2006, being the date of the decision of Hidden J. Unless those documents “accompanied” the notice of appeal, the Director submitted the notice was a nullity. In fact it would have had effect “as a notice of intention to appeal” (r 23D) but would have been out of time and otiose. However, non-compliance with the rules will not prevent an appeal being prosecuted, but this Court may give appropriate directions, including alternative means of ensuring that the relevant materials are obtained: r 76. Further, this Court could grant leave to extend the period during which the notice of intention to appeal had effect, until after the date on which the last relevant documents were filed. 
     
      
    24 Section 10(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides that “an appeal against conviction or sentence is taken to be pending in the court if notice of intention to appeal … has been duly given to the court”: see s 10(2)(b), which operates for the purposes of any other Act or statutory instrument. Thus, for the purposes of the Bail Act, the existence of a notice of intention to appeal is sufficient to bring the Respondent within s 4(2)(c) of that Act and hence within the class of persons to whom the Supreme Court may grant bail under s 28. (It would also be sufficient to invoke the power of this Court under s 30.) This Court can extend the effect of the notice of intention, until 22 September 2006. Although that step may not be necessary, that will be done. 
     
      
    25 The qualification suggested by the Director therefore falls away and there is no obstacle to making an appropriate order extending time. The result is that Hidden J had power to grant bail pursuant to s 28 of the Bail Act. Ground 2 should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Limited appeal 
      
    26 Ground 3 asserts that the Appellant has not appealed in relation to numerous counts in the indictment, pursuant to which he will be serving unchallenged sentences which would nullify the effect of any grant of bail in respect of other matters. This contention was based on the proposition that, although the notice of appeal was unrestricted as to the convictions under challenge, the grounds affect only 6 convictions (being on counts 3, 4, 6, 7, 10 and 11) so that the grounds and the written submissions had no application to the numerous counts identified in ground 3 of the present bail application. 
     
      
    27 Without seeking to assess the strength of the challenge to the other grounds, the Respondent concedes that the specific challenges apply only to limited grounds directly, but notes that the written submissions assert that the reasoning complained of “in relation to particular counts would have jeopardised the Appellant’s prospects of receiving a fair trial generally”. Accordingly, he submits that the scope of the appeal is not limited as the Director suggests. 
     
      
    28 It is fair to say that the three grounds identified do go to specific counts and that the broader contamination effect is but lightly treated in the written submissions. Nevertheless, as a matter of jurisdiction, it should not be held that the notice of appeal, unlimited in its terms, did not go to all of the counts in relation to which a sentence of imprisonment was imposed. Accordingly, the third ground should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Power of this Court to carry out review 
      
    29 For reasons noted above, once an extension of time has been granted, it may well be that an application could have been made to this Court and that this Court does now have power, pursuant to s 30, to deal with an application for bail, with the result that s 47 would not preclude the Court exercising its power of review under s 46. However, there is another reason why the jurisdiction under s 46 cannot be invoked. That section, provides: 
     
      
       
        
        46 Power of Court of Criminal Appeal to review 
        
       
       
        
        (1) Subject to this Division, the Court of Criminal Appeal may review any decision made by the Court (however constituted) in relation to bail. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), a Judge of the Court of Criminal Appeal sitting alone may not under that subsection review a decision of the Court constituted by 3 or more Judges, unless the rules made under the  
        Supreme Court Act 1970  
        so provide.  
        
       
       
      It is clear from this section, especially if read as a whole, that the term “Court” refers to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Accordingly, this Court is not given power to review a decision of the Supreme Court: see  
      Potier  
      at [4]. It follows that it has no power to review the decision of Hidden J which, on the preferred view set out above, was made not as a member of this Court, but as a judge of the Supreme Court, in the Common Law Division. 
       
      
    30 On the basis that the Court might, after proper consideration, reach this conclusion, the Director was invited to rely upon the power of the Supreme Court to conduct a review of a decision of the Supreme Court, pursuant to s 45 of the Bail Act. It was pointed out that the members of this Court, being judges of the Supreme Court, could carry out that review in the latter capacity. The Director acceded to that suggestion. However, senior counsel for the Respondent, whilst acknowledging that he had come prepared to deal with the merit of the grant of bail, as identified in ground 4 proposed by the Director, objected to three members of the Supreme Court hearing the review under s 45(1). He did not, however, object to the presiding judge dealing with the review in his capacity as a member of the Supreme Court. The application for review should be considered by him in that capacity.  
     
      
       
      Orders 
      
    31 For the purposes of determining the application to this Court, it is sufficient for the Court to make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Pursuant to r 3A(2) of the Criminal Appeal Rules, the period during which the notice of intention to appeal filed by the Respondent on 7 November 2005 has effect is extended up to and including 22 September 2006. 
       
       
      (2) Pursuant to rule 76, the Court directs that such of the documents as should have accompanied the notice of appeal, but which have been filed subsequently, be accepted as properly filed on the date or dates on which they were filed. 
       
       
      (3) The Court being satisfied that it has no jurisdiction to conduct a review of the bail determination made by Hidden J on 22 September 2006, refers the review of that decision to Basten JA, to conduct the review under s 45 of the  
      Bail Act

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Barr J. As his Honour observes the trial judge rejected the tender of the many sexual images in the appellant’s computer confining the Crown to eliciting evidence of the one image relevant to count 5. This decision reflected a conclusion that evidence of the other images was so prejudicial that the trial would miscarry. 
     
      
    2 Accordingly, in circumstances where evidence of the existence of the many other images has been admitted in the erroneous belief that the appellant had raised his character, this Court is left with no alternative but to order a new trial. The appellant has not been fairly tried according to law. 
     
      
    3 BARR J: The appellant, to whom I shall refer as PGM, appeals against convictions entered up in the District Court and seeks leave to appeal against the resulting sentences. All the offences were said to have been sexual in nature and to have been committed between 1 October 2003 and 5 May 2004 on a child, whom I shall call C, at the appellant’s house in a suburb of Sydney. The counts may be summarised as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        Counts 1, 2 and 6: sexual intercourse with a person under the age of ten years;  
        
       
       
        
        Counts 4, 5 and 7: assault with an act of indecency on a person under the age of ten years. 
        
       
      
    4 Counts 1, 2 and 6 were laid under s66A Crimes Act, which provides for a maximum sentence of imprisonment for twenty-five years. The remaining counts were laid under s61M(2) Crimes Act, which provides for a maximum sentence of imprisonment for ten years.  
     
      
    5 The sentences were as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        Count 7: imprisonment for a fixed term of four years and six months commencing on 10 June 2005 and expiring on 9 December 2009; 
        
       
       
        
        Counts 4 and 5: imprisonment for a fixed term of five years commencing on 10 June 2006 and expiring on 9 June 2011; 
        
       
       
        
        Counts 1 and 2: imprisonment for a fixed term of ten years commencing on 10 June 2007 and expiring on 9 June 2017; and 
        
       
       
        
        Count 6: imprisonment for a non-parole period of fourteen years commencing on 10 June 2007 and expiring on 9 June 2021 with a balance of sentence of six years expiring on 9 June 2027.  
        
       
      
    6 The effective sentence was therefore a non-parole period of sixteen years and a balance of term, during which the appellant would be eligible for release on parole, of six years, twenty-two years altogether.  
     
      
    7 The complainant gave her evidence by videorecording, which was played to the jury. She lived with her parents and brothers and sisters in a house in the same street as the appellant. She used to visit the house from time to time. The first count was based upon a description she gave of events that took place after she went to the appellant’s house one afternoon. The appellant was there and asked her to help him with some gardening. The appellant’s wife was out shopping. They worked in the garden and then went inside the house. They watched a video of a popular musical show on videotape. The complainant was seated on the lounge. The appellant pulled down her pants and told her to open her legs. He licked her vagina and said that it felt really nice. The complainant pulled up her jeans and as she was leaving the house the appellant told her to keep it a secret. The appellant’s wife came home as she was leaving.  
     
      
    8 The second count was based upon the complainant’s account of a visit to the house on another afternoon. She knocked at the door and the appellant let her in. She played on the stairs. The appellant asked her if she would like to do some gardening and she said that she would. During that work she injured her foot and it bled. They went inside. She had ice cream. They went upstairs to the appellant’s bedroom and he laid her on the bed. He told her to open her legs. He pulled down her pants and sucked her vagina.  
     
      
    9 The fourth count concerned an occasion at the appellant’s house when the appellant put the complainant on the bed with her pants removed. He put cream on his penis and white stuff came squirting out. It hit her “thing”, which she explained was her vagina. On this evidence the Crown originally charged an attempt at sexual intercourse (the third count) but the jury were directed to acquit and the indecent assault charge remained.  
     
      
    10 The fifth count depended upon an occasion when the complainant and the appellant were in his computer room. On the screen was the image of a girl who looked about ten years old. She was naked and her legs were apart. The appellant said that it looked very nice. Things went on from there. The complainant was seated on a chair with her legs open and her pants down. The appellant moved his penis onto her vagina.  
     
      
    11 The sixth count was based on the complainant’s evidence that on an occasion she was seated somewhere in the appellant’s house. He pulled her legs open, pulled down her pants, put cream on his penis and placed his penis in her vagina.  
     
      
    12 The seventh count was based on an occasion when the appellant touched the complainant’s vagina with his hand, underneath her clothing.  
     
      
    13 It is convenient to deal first with the third and fourth grounds of appeal, which may be summarised as follows. The third ground complains that his Honour erred in admitting into evidence a description of a pornographic image found in or in association with the appellant’s computer. The fourth ground asserts that his Honour erred in finding that the appellant had raised good character and alternatively in exercising his discretion so as to permit the Crown to adduce evidence to rebut evidence of good character.  
     
      
    14 When they learned what the complainant was saying about having seen the image on the appellant’s computer police obtained and executed a search warrant at his house. Under the power of the warrant they seized the appellant’s computer and associated equipment. On examination the computer or compact discs associated with it or both proved capable of displaying pornographic images. This Court was told that there were between five hundred and one thousand such images. The Crown served on the defence a tendency notice under the provisions of s97 Evidence Act, referring to the material as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        Images of pornographic material taken from Apple Mac computer and CD ROMs and Zip disks – seized during search of … 
        
       
      
    15 In his judgment rejecting the tender his Honour discussed the images in these words -  
     
      
       
        
        I have, for the purpose of this application, viewed two CD ROMs which I have marked as exhibit C on the voir dire. More correctly I should say that I have viewed a large proportion of that material although not all of it. There are contained on the two CD ROMs which comprise exhibit C (which I am told contains the images which were taken from the hard drive of the computer and the CD ROMs which were in the study in the accused’s home) being images of prepubescent girls either alone or with other prepubescent children either performing sexual acts upon themselves or on the other children. There are also images of prepubescent girls involved in sexual acts with adult males and females. 
        
       
       
        
        There is also other material which can be described as images of adolescent and adult females involved in various sexual activities. The Crown contends that that material is also sought to be tendered under the tendency notice.  
        
       
       
        
        It is an understatement to say that the material that I viewed is deeply disturbing including, as it does, adult women and adult men involved in sexual activities with young prepubescent girls and boys. The sexual activities include penetration of a child’s vagina by the penis of an adult male or a prepubescent boy and the involvement of, as I say, adult women in these activities. There is also depicted, for example, on a video an adult male performing 
          
        cunnilingus on what appears to be a prepubescent girl.  
        
       
      
    16 His Honour drew attention to the complainant’s description of the image she had seen on the occasion giving rise to the fifth count and observed that there was “a large number” of images fitting her description but that, understandably, police had not asked the complainant to look at any image to see whether she could identify it. (She was only seven years old when spoken to by the police). Accordingly, it was impossible to point to any particular image as the one the complainant saw. His Honour continued -  
     
      
       
        
        In my view, in the circumstances of this case, and given those difficulties it would be appropriate for the Crown to lead evidence from a police officer involved in the seizure of the hard drive and the CD ROMs from the study at the accused’s home to give evidence that an image, and I emphasise  
        an 
         image, that is one image, was found on the hard drive or the CD ROMs found in the accused’s study matching the description of the girl described by the complainant.  
        
       
      
    17 In accordance with his Honour’s judgment, the Crown adduced this evidence from a police officer -  
     
      
       
        
        Q Now, following the obtaining of the hard drive and the CD ROMs from  
        (the accused’s) 
         study, was an image found on the hard drive or the CD ROMs in the accused’s study … of a ten year old girl, or apparently a ten year old girl, naked with her legs apart? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes.  
        
       
      
    18 That was the evidence said on appeal to have been erroneously admitted.  
     
      
    19 The appellant gave evidence and there was this exchange in cross-examination -  
     
      
       
        
        Q … prior to your arrest in May 2004 did you have on your computer an image of a naked ten year old girl with her legs apart, either on your computer or, alternatively, on one of your CD ROMs? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes sir.  
        
       
       
        
        Q And was there an occasion prior to your arrest when you were looking at that image? 
        
       
       
        
        A No sir. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q Have you ever looked at that image? 
        
       
       
        
        A I have seen that image sir, yes.  
        
       
       
        
        Q On one occasion or more than one occasion? 
        
       
       
        
        A One occasion sir. 
        
       
       
        
        Q When was that? 
        
       
       
        
        A When the CD ROM opened with an automatic response on the hard drive. 
        
       
       
        
        Q And since that occasion have you looked at it? 
        
       
       
        
        A No sir.  
        
       
       
        
        Q Why not? 
        
       
       
        
        A I don’t like that sort of image on my computer. 
        
       
       
        
        Q What do you mean by that answer? 
        
       
       
        
        A Exactly what I said sir, I think I was very clear, I don’t like that sort of image on my computer sir. 
        
       
      
    20 At the close of that day the Crown Prosecutor stated his intention to seek leave to cross-examine the appellant on the last two answers I have recorded. After some discussion about what the appellant had actually said, defence counsel said this -  
     
      
       
        
        I am sure it wasn’t an intentional  
        (response) 
        … 
        
       
      
    21 On the following day the Crown Prosecutor sought leave to cross-examine on the answers. There was this exchange -  
     
      
       
        
        I make my application really on two bases, one, that I should be entitled to cross-examine as to character because I say that by reason of his answers he’s raised the issue of character and suggested that he’s a person of good character and would regard this sort of thing as absolutely abhorrent. Secondly I say that in any event I should be entitled to cross-examine him as to credit, and the basis that I say that is this, that on the evidence, the jury must have the impression that there was an image on the computer, an image, and the accused has not really raised the issue of credit, but by his answers he has reason for -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Sorry you mean character? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Character, I’m sorry your Honour, but by his answers he has reinforced the proposition that there was a single image. What he’s really done is gone beyond the proposition that there was this image on the computer. He has suggested by his answers that this was an only image, only. It’s a subtle, but very important distinction. Your Honour allowed evidence of an image. Evidence of an image doesn’t of itself suggest that there was – that’s the only image, but the accused’s evidence goes way beyond that. He suggests that this was the only image of this nature on the computer.  
        
       
      
    22 A tape recording of the appellant’s evidence was played. Defence counsel took objection, saying this -  
     
      
       
        
        …my starting point … is… that the accused himself hasn’t raised his character, his good character in a particular kind. The evidence that was adduced by  
        (the appellant) 
         was a result of the questioning by the Crown.  
        
       
      
    23 During the discussion that followed there was this exchange -  
     
      
       
        
        DEFENCE COUNSEL: The question was “Why not,” which invited the answer -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well sorry when you say “Why not,” the question is in other words “Why not haven’t you seen it since the one time you say you saw it when you tried to delete it? Why haven’t you seen it?” 
        
       
       
        
        DEFENCE COUNSEL: That’s right, and it was clearly open on the interpretation of the person sitting in the witness box he was being asked “Why haven’t you seen it on more than one occasion,” and the only answer he could give, confronted with that interpretation of it, was a tendency answer. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        … was being led into the area by the Crown’s questions. He was trying to answer them as best as he could, but he certainly doesn’t have the skills of a lawyer to pick up the subtleties particularly the distinction between tendency and credit and what’s relevant in the circumstances. 
        
       
      
    24 Defence counsel asserted that the question which brought forth the answers upon which the Crown relied was designed to elicit the response which came forward and to undermine the judgment his Honour had given earlier in the trial of rejecting the tender of tendency evidence. 
     
      
    25 His Honour gave judgment, concluding that the intention of the appellant in responding to the two “why?” questions was -  
     
      
       
        
        To convey that he was in that particular respect a person of good character, that is that he would not look at such an image and that he is a person who would not look at such an image. 
        
       
      
    26 His Honour went on to consider the exercise of the discretion thus raised and decided to allow the Crown to put the questions it was proposing.  
     
      
    27 The Crown proceeded in accordance with leave granted and there were these questions and answers in further cross-examination -  
     
      
       
        
        Q The computer which you had purchased in perhaps April 2003 was downstairs? 
        
       
       
        
        A That’s correct in the study sir. 
        
       
       
        
        Q And that was the computer on which there was this image of this ten year old naked girl with her legs apart? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes sir.  
        
       
       
        
        Q And downstairs in that study there were also a number of CD ROMs weren’t there? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes sir. 
        
       
       
        
        Q And on one or more of those CD ROMs for instance there was an image of yourself on I think a motor bike? 
        
       
       
        
        A I wouldn’t know if there was more than one sir. 
        
       
       
        
        Q You don’t -- 
        
       
       
        
        A More than one image sir or more than one CD ROM? 
        
       
       
        
        Q Well I will make myself clear. Do you agree that there is an image on a CD ROM of you on a motor bike? 
        
       
       
        
        A I know on the hard drive there is sir but I’m not sure about the CD ROM. 
        
       
       
        
        Q You see on your computer there were a large number of images of prepubescent girls engaged in sexual activity with adult males weren’t there? 
        
       
       
        
        A That’s correct sir. 
        
       
       
        
        Q What do you understand to be a prepubescent girl?  
        
       
       
        
        A Someone before the age of ten years of age sir. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Have you any explanation as to how there came to be a large number of such images on your computer? 
        
       
       
        
        A I have sir. 
        
       
       
        
        Q What explanation have you? 
        
       
       
        
        A The operating system that was running on the Apple Mac, on the G4, was – been used as a server sir and the fact that there was no firewall or password on that computer allowed other people to access that computer without my knowledge, and either place or take down or remove from for their use images on that hard drive sir.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q You see you agree don’t you that these were not merely images of prepubescent girls, these images on your computer of such girls engaged in sexual activity with adult males? You agree with that don’t you? 
        
       
       
        
        A Sir I’ve not seen all the images on my computer that you’re relating to, so I cannot answer fully yes to that question. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Well how many of those images have you seen? 
        
       
       
        
        A Very few sir. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Well tell us the images you have seen? 
        
       
       
        
        A I have seen images of just the children ones, not the adult ones sir, just the children ones -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q You can take it from me that any question I ask you is restricted to this, images of prepubescent girls, of naked prepubescent girls engaged in sexual activity with adult males, do you understand what I am saying? 
         
         
        A Yes sir. 
        
       
       
        
        Q I am restricting my questions only to images of prepubescent girls, naked girls, engaged in activity with adult males? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes sir.  
        
       
       
        
        Q Now do you agree first of all that there are numerous such images on your computer? 
        
       
       
        
        A No sir. 
        
       
       
        
        Q On what basis do you give that last answer? 
        
       
       
        
        A I’ve seen no more than two images of what you have just described to me sir. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q … are you suggesting, you maybe able to answer this yes or no, that there are on your computer only two images of naked prepubescent girls engaged in sexual activity with adult males? 
        
       
       
        
        A No sir. 
        
       
       
        
        Q What do you mean by that? 
        
       
       
        
        A One of the images you asked me to describe, which the judge had asked me not to tell you about, had about five to six photographs of that particular incident and I can recall that clearly sir, because I reported that to the authorities in America, because I reckoned they could recognise the person’s face on that photograph, the male that was in that photograph. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q Well on your computer how many images approximately were there of adult males engaged in sexual activity with naked prepubescent girls? 
         
         
        A They’re the only two I can recall sir, that one series and there was another of a single one, I can’t recall the details of that one. There was only those two lots sir. 
         
         
        Q When you say two lots what do you mean by that? 
         
         
        A There was that one group of four or five and there was one on its own. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q And on that compact disk, in one of the folders, there were between 500 and 1,000 child pornographic images and/or videos weren’t there? 
         
         
        A I have no idea sir. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q Had you ever looked at that compact disk? 
        
       
       
        
        A Not to the best of my knowledge sir, no. 
        
       
       
        
        Q How did you come to acquire it? 
        
       
       
        
        A I didn’t acquire it sir. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Well it was in your house? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes sir. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Well can you explain how it was in your house? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes sir I can. I burnt a copy off my Fax program onto a blank CD ROM. 
        
       
       
        
        Q So do you say as at the time of your arrest you were quite unaware what was on that CD? 
        
       
       
        
        A I was sir, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q And it was only some time after your arrest that you became aware of what was on that CD? 
        
       
       
        
        A Mr Johnson did make me aware of it. To this day I still don’t know what’s on that CD ROM sir.  
        
       
       
        
        Q And are you shocked to think that you had, in your possession, a CD with between 500 and 1,000 child pornographic images, and/or videos? 
        
       
       
        
        A I’d be dismayed sir if that’s in fact true. 
        
       
      
    28 The Crown application made and granted was limited to the cross-examination of the appellant, though it was in law also an application to adduce evidence in reply. Even so, the Crown did not seek leave to call further evidence to prove the detailed contents of the records as put to and either denied or not admitted by the accused. The result was that although the jury knew exactly what the Crown was asserting, there was for the most part no evidence of it. 
     
      
    29 As to the third ground of appeal, counsel for the appellant submitted first that evidence of the existence of an image like that described by the complainant was irrelevant and therefore inadmissible. It was submitted that defence counsel ought to have objected to the tender. (Counsel went so far as to submit that the complainant’s evidence of what she saw ought to have been objected to, though I think that the submission was ultimately not pressed). 
     
      
    30 In my view it was permissible for the Crown to show that the appellant had available to him at a relevant time an image corresponding to that described by the complainant because it made it more probable in that respect that the complainant was telling the truth. So the conditions of s55 Evidence Act were met. In my view defence counsel’s acknowledgement that the evidence was admissible was rightly made.  
     
      
    31 In this Court it was submitted in the alternative that if admissible, the evidence of an available image on the computer brought with it such a risk of unfair prejudice that it ought to have been excluded. Counsel described it as of an obscene and abhorrent nature, a description with which I agree. Counsel asserted that since the possession of pornographic material was not the subject matter of any of the charges and since the evidence was by nature inflammatory, the need for a fair trial for the appellant required its rejection.  
     
      
    32 It must be said that the need for a fair trial is not one that attaches itself exclusively to accused persons. It would in my view have been quite unjust if the Crown had been prevented from adducing evidence independent of the complainant proving the existence or probable existence of something she claimed to have seen at the time of one of the offences and apparently associated with it. No doubt the image would have been accepted by the jury as obscene and abhorrent, even though it was not shown to them, though scarcely more so than the description of the primary acts the accused was said to have committed. The evidence was not inflammatory. It was highly probative. It brought with it no great risk of unfair prejudice. It was rightly admitted, and in a manner which gave proper protection to the accused upon his Honour’s insistence that the reference be to a single image and that no actual image be shown to the jury. I would reject the third ground of appeal.  
     
      
    33 As to the fourth ground, the question for this Court is whether, by the answers pointed to, the appellant intended to raise his good character.  
     
      
    34 Sections 110 and 112 of the Evidence Act are as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        110 Evidence about character of accused persons 
          
         
        (1) The hearsay rule, the opinion rule, the tendency rule and the credibility rule do not apply to evidence adduced by a defendant to prove (directly or by implication) that the defendant is, either generally or in a particular respect, a person of good character.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (2) If evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that a defendant is generally a person of good character has been admitted, the hearsay rule, the opinion rule, the tendency rule and the credibility rule do not apply to evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that the defendant is not generally a person of good character.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (3) If evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that a defendant is a person of good character in a particular respect has been admitted, the hearsay rule, the opinion rule, the tendency rule and the credibility rule do not apply to evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that the defendant is not a person of good character in that respect.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Note. 
         The Commonwealth Act includes an additional subsection relating to unsworn statements.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        112 Leave required to cross-examine about character of accused or co-accused 
          
         
        A defendant is not to be cross-examined about matters arising out of evidence of a kind referred to in this Part unless the court gives leave. 
         
        
       
      
    35 The raising of good character requires a conscious decision on the part of the accused. It has been held that such evidence must be intentionally and deliberately adduced for the purpose of raising character before the Crown may be granted leave to cross-examine: Gabriel v R (1997) 76 FCR 279. See also R v Bartle & Others [2003] NSWCCA 329. So good character is not raised, for example, where a witness volunteers the evidence: R v Redd [1923] 1 KB 104 at 106.  
     
      
    36 The field into which the Crown Prosecutor ventured when challenging the appellant’s evidence about the “image” was one which presented some difficulty. As the questioner and the witness knew, the jury had been told that there was at the time of search “an image” that could be derived from the computer and its equipment. As both also knew, although that statement was true, it was only part of the truth. There was, as his Honour said, a large number of images which fitted the relevant description. The Crown Prosecutor was asking about “an image” but could not be more precise. He must have meant the image the accused said that he had seen, but did not know which image that might have been. In responding to the questions, the appellant might have had in mind a particular image or might have been referring to any image matching the description given by the complainant or the Crown Prosecutor. The difficulty stemmed from the introductory questions -  
     
      
       
        
        Did you have on you computer  
        an image of a ten year old girl with her legs apart 
        ?  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Have you ever looked at  
        that image 
        ?  
        and  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Since that occasion have you ever looked at  
        it 
        ? 
        
       
      
    37 By the time he was asked these questions the appellant had been giving evidence for a whole day, almost exclusively in cross-examination. His answers had to be seen in context. The relevant part of each answer to the “why” question was the expression “that sort of image”. Did the appellant, by using that form of words, mean all images and any image answering the description, as his Honour took the appellant to mean, or did he mean the one image he said he had looked at which bore the description, which was “that sort of image”? His answers seem capable of bearing either meaning.  
     
      
    38 Secondly, the appellant was a witness sworn to tell the truth and obliged to answer the questions he was asked. If his answers were true, he could not properly be said to have given them deliberately, intending thereby to raise his good character. In giving judgment, his Honour observed that the appellant could have answered the questions in a way which would not suggest anything about his good character or whether he was the sort of person who would look at such an image or not, though his Honour did not postulate any answer. During the debate which followed the Crown’s application his Honour had asked counsel -  
     
      
       
        
        Well, why didn’t he just say “because I haven’t”. The answer could simply have been “why haven’t you look at that image?” “I haven’t”.  
        
       
      
    39 With respect, such an answer would have been tantamount to a refusal to answer. Although it seems possible that the appellant might have given a responsive and truthful answer which did not appear to raise good character, it is not immediately apparent what it might have been.  
     
      
    40 I do not think that his Honour was entitled to conclude that by his answers the appellant intended to say that he was not the sort of person who looked at images generally meeting the relevant description. What the appellant said, considered in context, seems as consistent with a narrower intention, namely that he did not look again at whatever image he had seen, meeting the description, because he did not like it on his computer.  
     
      
    41 I would in any event have upheld the appellant’s alternative submission that his Honour erred in exercising the discretion so as to permit the Crown in cross-examining to adduce evidence of the other images. There are two reasons for this. First, the evidence of a large number of images of adults having sexual relations with prepubescent girls was likely to overwhelm the jury and divert them from their task, notwithstanding strong directions about the way in which the evidence could be used. The evidence had the capacity to shock, even though it had no direct relevance to the matters in issue. As his Honour observed in rejecting the evidence when it was tendered as tendency evidence, its probative value was not significant and it brought with it a risk of high prejudice which exceeded that value.  
     
      
    42 In my view a miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the events that followed. I note that the Crown Prosecutor asked a large number of questions postulating the detail of the contents of the tapes which never actually became evidence because the appellant either denied or did not admit the postulated particulars. That was material the jury were not entitled to use, but it must have been highly prejudicial to the appellant because it must have been apparent that the Crown Prosecutor was asking his questions based upon firm instructions from somebody who had looked at the images. Although the jury were appropriately told about the limited use they could make of evidence of any image and of any lie they considered the accused had told about any image, they were not told that the only images they could find existed were those conceded by the appellant to have existed. On the contrary, his Honour referred in summing-up to the Crown’s cross-examination of the appellant about “a large number of such images being found on the computer and on a CD ROM” (SU15) and to “the evidence of the other images and on the evidence conceded by the accused that there were a large number of such similar images …” (SU19).  
     
      
    43 I would uphold the fourth ground of appeal.  
     
      
    44 The first ground of appeal asserts that the verdicts were unreasonable and unsupportable by the evidence. The question for this Court is whether on the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant: M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487.  
     
      
    45 The evidence of the appellant’s commission of the offences came solely from the complainant. The appellant took the oath and denied committing them. The first submission in this Court was that the complainant’s evidence was “entirely uncorroborated in respect of each of the matters constituting the essential elements of each offence”. Save for evidence adduced to prove the complainant’s age, that submission may be accepted. There was no evidence independent of the complainant that the appellant had carried out any act constituting any element of any of the offences. That is not to say that the complainant was without support, however, for her description of the image she saw on the computer was rendered powerful by independent evidence of the existence at the time of just such an image.  
     
      
    46 The complainant gave her evidence by videotape recorded soon after she made her complaint and, at trial, by remote closed circuit television. I have viewed the videotape and have read the transcript of her evidence before the jury. She appears to be an intelligent child able readily to understand what she is asked. Although there is a limit to the weight that can be placed on demeanour, I am satisfied that the complainant showed no outward sign of having been coached. She was questioned on the videotape for more than two hours. She was not led. She was alert and responsive. I detected an occasional reluctance in the first place to recount the details of the appellant’s several criminal acts – on one or two occasions she began by saying that nothing had happened – but once she began to recount them she was lucid. Her evidence was sufficient, if accepted, to prove the elements of the offences, other than her age. 
     
      
    47 Counsel for the appellant drew this Court’s attention to a great many features of the complainant’s evidence, so many in fact that I do not propose to mention them all. It was pointed out that the complainant knew the names of the sexual parts of men and women, that she had participated in classroom activities for directions about the sexual molestation of children and knew what the term “sexual abuse” meant. The implication was that the complainant knew enough to be able to fabricate her allegations. Then patent or apparent inconsistencies in her account were pointed to – her varying accounts of how many times a particular thing happened or precisely where and when, and exactly how particular things happened. For example, a distinction was made between her description of the appellant’s licking and sucking. Although she had been taught to tell her mother if she was sexually abused, she did not do so. It was pointed out that although on the videotape the complainant said only that the appellant’s penis tickled her, she said for the first time at trial, during cross-examination, that it hurt. Sketches that she drew during her interview were criticised for their anatomical inaccuracy. All these matters were said to be indicators of unreliability.  
     
      
    48 Counsel relied on three features in particular. The first was that whereas the complainant’s evidence was that the appellant had ejaculated onto a certain piece of furniture, the evidence was that swabs taken later on failed to reveal the presence of DNA. That circumstance was said to render “untenable” the complainant’s account of the ejaculation. This submission should be rejected. The negative result of a test made some indeterminable time, perhaps months, after the event seems unsurprising and equally consistent with the event’s having happened and not having happened.  
     
      
    49 The second of these features was medical evidence of the condition of the complainant’s hymen. Dr Johnson gave evidence. He had examined the complainant. There were these questions and answers -  
     
      
       
        
        Q And on the physical examination you noted the hymen was normal?  
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q And you noted that it was a crescentic hymen. What’s the significance of any of that? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yep. What we mean by that is that a hymen is not a perfect barrier. If you imagine a clock-face. Then it may be incomplete between say the 10 o’clock and the 2 o’clock position or the 9 o’clock and the 3 o’clock position, so it becomes a crescentic shape, that of a half-moon to an upside half-moon, so and that’s – that was indeed how the hymen looked with 
         (the complainant).  
        
       
       
        
        Q So what’s the significance of all that? 
        
       
       
        
        A That means it’s a normal looking hymen. I mean there’s many shapes that a hymen can take but the crescentic hymen as I’ve just got there is the most common description that you would find. Really what I suppose I am saying is that hymen’s vary in their shape and they vary in their elasticity according to age. As you enter puberty, the effects of oestrogen allow a hymen to become more elastic. But even in younger girls, particularly the age of seven, you would have increasing amounts of oestrogen, so the hymen becomes more elastic. So in essence, it means that you can’t just, just by looking at somebody, by inspecting that area, you can’t tell whether or not there’s been sexual contact or not or any sort of contact. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Is a normal hymen, in particular a crescentic hymen consistent with penetration? 
        
       
       
        
        A It can be, because after penetration, usually in the first seventy-two hours is the best time, the optimal time to perform an examination. You’d be looking for redness or laceration or even semen but after that time, these changes will have gone and very rarely you may see a scar but the hymen can just look as it always, the normal shape.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
    50 It seems to me that these findings, like the absence of DNA, were not inconsistent with penetration.  
     
      
    51 The third matter relied on is of more substance. During the videotaped interview the complainant was describing the appellant’s use of cream and there were these questions and answers –  
     
      
       
        
        Q933 Have you, how do you know that? Have you seen kids using that type of cream? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah.

        Q940 There. 
        
       
       
        
        A It, he’d put it, like um, there. 
        
       
       
        
        Q941 What part of the body’s that? 
        
       
       
        
        A Um, penis. 
        
       
       
        
        Q942 So --- 
        
       
       
        
        A He’d put it on his penis and it would squirt out on  
        (the appellant), 
         ‘cause he would, he wouldn’t know that this was happening. 
        
       
       
        
        Q943 Who? 
        
       
       
        
        A He would, he would come up to him and squirt it there. 
        
       
       
        
        Q944 And you’re, what part of the body is that? 
        
       
       
        
        A Um, the bum. 
        
       
       
        
        Q945 Right. 
        
       
       
        
        A So  
        (the appellant) 
         --- 
        
       
       
        
        Q946 So did you see this happen? 
        
       
       
        
        A Um, I was, I was in the um, kitchen and I just saw um, his son running along, like with his pants zipper, zipper down and I saw all this cream on, on

        Q951 O.K. So this boy died, did he?

    52 The complainant was cross-examined about the account she had given. It was common ground that the appellant’s son had died in 1999, when the complainant was two years old. There were these questions and answers –  
     
      
       
        
        Q You talked about, in the video, you talked about seeing a boy in 
         (the appellant’s)  
        home, is that right? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q And you said that the boy was 
         (the appellant’s)  
        son, is that right? 
        
       
       
        
        A I don’t know if he’s his son.  
        
       
       
        
        Q Well you said he was his son, is that right?  
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q And when did you see this take place 
         (complainant),  
        when did you see the boy? 
        
       
       
        
        A I don’t remember. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Was it last year? 
        
       
       
        
        A I don’t know. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Was it the year before? 
        
       
       
        
        A I don’t know. 
        
       
       
        
        Q You’d met this boy, had you? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Where did you meet him? 
        
       
       
        
        A In the house. 
        
       
       
        
        Q In  
        (the appellant)  
        and 
         (appellant’s wife’s)  
        house? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Did you know what his name was? 
        
       
       
        
        A No 
        
       
       
        
        Q How many times did you meet him? 
        
       
       
        
         Once. 
        
       
       
        
        Q How old was the boy? 
        
       
       
        
        I don’t remember. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Was he your age or older? 
        
       
       
        
        A I think he was older. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Was he with anybody else when you met him? 
        
       
       
        
        A Pardon me? 
        
       
       
        
        Q Was the boy with anybody else when you met him? 
        
       
       
        
        A No. 
        
       
       
        
        So he’s in 
         (the appellant’s)  
        and 
         (appellant’s wife’s)  
        house by himself? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q And the day that you met him was that the same day as you saw him in the kitchen with his pants off and cream on his bum or was it another day? 
        
       
       
        
        A I don’t remember. 
        
       
       
        
        Q You said you saw him with cream on his bottom or his bum and you were in the kitchen, is that right? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Were you supposed to be in the house that day? 
        
       
       
        
        A I don’t know. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Well think about it, that day that you were in the kitchen and you saw the boy with the cream on his bum did you come over from your house that day after school or some other time? 
        
       
       
        
        A After school. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Did you knock on the front door? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q And did 
         (the appellant) 
         let you in? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q And was  
        (complainant’s wife)  
        home? 
        
       
       
        
        A I don’t remember. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Was the boy there when you knocked on the door? 
          
        
       
       
        
        A (no verbal reply) 
        
       
       
        
        Q HIS HONOUR: Mr Johnston, perhaps the form of that question is causing the witness a problem. Don’t you mean did she see him when she first went in? 
        
       
       
        
        JOHNSTON: Yes, I will ask that question again. 
        
       
       
        
        Q 
         (Complainant),  
        I’ll ask you the question in a different way, okay? When you knocked on the door and you walked in did you see the boy inside the house? 
        
       
       
        
        A No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Did you see him at some later time in the house on that day? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Where was that? 
        
       
       
        
        A I don’t remember. 
        
       
       
        
        Q What do you remember about that date, 
         (complainant),  
        the day that you saw the boy at 
         (the appellant’s)  
        house? 
        
       
       
        
        A Not that much. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Tell us what little bit you do remember? 
        
       
       
        
        A (No verbal reply) 
        
       
       
        
        JOHNSTON: Your Honour, perhaps another question should be asked a bit more specific. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Mr Johnston, the question is, what do you remember about the boy? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: The boy on that day. 
        
       
       
        
        JOHNSTON: I’ll ask that question again if your Honour pleases. 
        
       
       
        
        Q 
         (Complainant),  
        tell us what you do remember about the boy on that day?  
        
       
       
        
        A (No verbal reply) 
        
       
       
        
        Q 
         (Complainant),  
        are you having difficulties answering my question? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Is that because you made it up about the boy? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Why did you make it up about the boy,  
        (complainant)? 
        
       
       
        
        A I don’t know.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
    53 It was submitted that on all the matters relied on, but particularly on this evidence, the jury were bound to entertain a reasonable doubt about the reliability of the complainant. It seems to me that defence counsel was entitled to make a strong submission about the consequences of the complainant’s evidence about the appellant’s son, which was very important for the jury’s assessment of the complainant. Obviously, it was a matter the jury had to consider very carefully. But there is no rule that a witness, even a child, who has admitted making up a story on one occasion must as a consequence be held unreliable when giving evidence about another. In giving consideration to the matter the jury were entitled to use the impression they had received of the complainant from all her evidence. One matter of crucial importance to their assessment was no doubt the support the complainant received from the evidence that just such a computer image as she described actually existed. The jury were entitled to reason that the complainant could not have known about the image unless the accused had shown it to her. Speculation aside, the only conclusion one could reasonably reach about that evidence was that the complainant must have been telling the truth about it, notwithstanding that she had told an untruth about the appellant’s son.  
     
      
    54 Moreover, the jury saw and heard the manner in which the complainant gave her evidence during cross-examination, an advantage this Court does not have. An assessment of the meaning of the last few answers I have extracted might well have depended in part in the way the answers were given. This Court has only the cold word on the page.  
     
      
    55 In my opinion it was open to the jury to be satisfied on the whole of the evidence that the complainant was giving a reliable version of what the appellant did on the several occasions the subject of the charges. It follows that they were entitled to be satisfied about the guilt of the appellant. This ground of appeal has not been made good.  
     
      
    56 In view of the conclusion I have reached about the fourth ground of appeal I can deal with the remaining ground, the second, in short form. The ground is as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        The appellant asserts that he instructed his lawyers that a significant part of the child’s evidence was capable of being discredited based on a physical impossibility to be able to ejaculate.  
        
       
      
    57 This ground was approached in two ways. First it was asserted that trial counsel, who did not appear on the appeal, incompetently failed to adduce evidence capable of raising a reasonable doubt about the capacity of the appellant to ejaculate. Reference was made to Nudd v The Queen (2006) 80 ALJR 614. In addition or alternatively, evidence was offered to this Court, partly to explain the events at trial and partly, I think, as allegedly fresh evidence.  
     
      
    58 It appears that the appellant’s wife instructed the appellant’s solicitor at trial that he was unable to ejaculate. This came as a surprise to the solicitor and counsel. Counsel took the view, wisely I think, that if the issue was to be raised there would need to be medical evidence to support the assertion. Accordingly, the solicitor wrote to an urologist, Dr Alexander, who wrote a report on 19 May 2005. In the report Dr Alexander said that he had seen the appellant in his rooms but had not examined him. He was expressing his opinion solely on what the appellant had told him, which was that he had been fully potent until 2002, when he had suffered a head injury in a motor vehicle accident. He had been in hospital for three days. His potency was “never the same” after the accident. He continued to have difficulty getting and maintaining an erection. When having sexual intercourse he would “on occasions lose his erection without orgasm”. He had been married for about three years and required considerable help from his wife to gain and maintain an erection. He did not know whether he ejaculated or not. His wife had told him that she suspected that he did not.  
     
      
    59 Dr Alexander expressed the view that if the appellant was telling the truth he had substantially reduced potency and that the cause might be related to a head injury or could be associated with depression. Dr Alexander found it difficult to comprehend the appellant’s statement that he did not know whether he ejaculated or not.  
     
      
    60 Defence counsel told the appellant that he was concerned that Dr Alexander’s report did not come up to the standard he had hoped. The report provided no support for the appellant’s assertion. Counsel advised the appellant that without medical evidence to support the assertion that he could not ejaculate there was a real risk that the appellant’s inability might be seen as psychological or psycho-sexual. The appellant would be left open to the suggestion that he could gain an erection and ejaculate in the presence of girls but not of grown women. Counsel’s advice was that it would be unwise to raise the issue without supporting expert evidence. The appellant accepted the advice.  
     
      
    61 In my view the advice tendered by defence counsel was both competent and sound. The complaint about counsel should be rejected.  
     
      
    62 I need not canvass the evidence put before this Court going to the question whether the appellant could maintain an erection or ejaculate except to say that there must be considerable doubt whether if used it would take the matter any further. Since I propose to order a fresh trial, it can be left to the appellant and his advisers to decide whether to rely on it. I would not have received it as fresh evidence on appeal, first because it is not fresh and secondly because it lacks the cogency necessary for admission.  
     
      
    63 This ground of appeal has not been made good.  
     
      
    64 I would make the following orders -  
     
      
       
        
        1. Allow the appeal and set aside the convictions; 
        
       
       
        
        2. Order a new trial. 
        
       
      
    65 BUDDIN J: I agree with Barr J.

          MARTIN KEAR 
          
         
        
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 30 August 2005 a magistrate dismissed a charge against the defendant alleging that he had in his possession child pornography in contravention of s 578B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (now repealed). The Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 59(2) of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 seeks to have the order of the magistrate set aside and asks the Court to grant relief in the nature of declarations that the magistrate erred in law in finding that the offence was not proved. 
     
      
    2 The facts can be stated very briefly because there was no dispute as to the circumstances in which the defendant came to have on the hard drive of his computer a number of pornographic images downloaded by him from an internet site called Allxboys. The defendant had, by the use of a credit card, paid for a subscription to visit the site on 13 April 2003. Thereafter he accessed the site on a number of occasions between 16 April 2003 and 11 May 2003 and viewed images displayed there. 
     
      
    3 On 8 September 2004 police executed a search warrant at the defendant’s unit and took possession of his computer. The defendant made admissions that he lived there alone and was the only person to have access to his computer. On one of the two hard drives contained in that computer the police found stored in the temporary Internet cache folder in excess of 5,000 thumbnail images and at least 247 larger images of child pornography. Police downloaded 50 of the larger images to a compact disc that was then submitted to the Office of Film and Literature Classification. The images were refused classification. 
     
      
    4 There was no dispute at the hearing that the computer belonged to the defendant or that he had visited the site and viewed images that would amount to child pornography under s 578B. The only issue was whether, when viewing those images, the defendant was in possession of child pornography in breach of that section. The question ventilated before the magistrate and before this Court was whether in viewing those images the defendant was in possession of a “film” that would, if classified, be classified RC (refused classification) within the provisions of the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 (CTH). 
     
      
    5 Section 578B of the Crimes Act relevantly provided as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        578B Possession of child pornography 
         
         
        (1) In this section: 
         
         
        child pornography 
         means a film, publication or computer game classified RC, or an unclassified film, publication or computer game that would, if classified, be classified RC, on the basis that it describes or depicts, in a way that is likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult, a person (whether or not engaged in sexual activity) who is a child under 16 or who looks like a child under 16. 
         
         
        Classification Board 
         means the Classification Board established under the Commonwealth Act. 
         
         
        classified 
         means classified under the Commonwealth Act. 
         
         
        Commonwealth Act 
         means the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 of the Commonwealth. 
         
         
        computer game 
        ,  
        film 
         and  
        publication 
         each have the same meanings, respectively, as in the Commonwealth Act. 
         
         
        law enforcement agency 
         has the same meaning as in section 13 of the Criminal Records Act 1991, and includes a person or body prescribed by the regulations for the purpose of this definition. 
         
         
        (2) A person who has in his or her possession any child pornography is guilty of an offence. 
         
         
        Maximum penalty: 100 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years (or both). 
         
         
        (3) Nothing in this section makes it an offence: 
         
         
        (a)…………… 
         
         
        (b)……………. 
         
         
        (c) for a person to have in his or her possession any film, publication or computer game that is classified other than as RC. 
         
         
        (4) Proceedings for an offence under this section: 
         
         
        (a) are not to be commenced later than 2 years after the date of the alleged offence, and 
         
         
        (b) in the case of a film, publication or computer game that is unclassified at the time of the alleged offence, are not to be commenced until the film, publication or computer game concerned has been classified, and 
         
         
        (c) are to be dealt with summarily before a Local Court constituted by a Magistrate sitting alone. 
         
         
        (4A) However, subsection (4) (b) does not prevent a person being arrested for, or charged with, an alleged offence against this section before the film, publication or computer game concerned has been classified. 
         
         
        (5) …………….. 
         
         
        (6) In any proceedings under this section, a certificate issued under section 87 of the Commonwealth Act signed (or purporting to be signed) by the Director of the Classification Board (or by the Deputy Director of the Classification Board) and stating that the film, publication or computer game concerned is classified RC on the basis that it describes or depicts, in a way that is likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult, a person (whether or not engaged in sexual activity) who is a child under 16 or who looks like a child under 16 is prima facie evidence of the matter stated in the certificate. 
         
         
        (7)…………….. 
        
       
      
    6 The relevant provision of the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act that defines “film” for the purposes of s 587B is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        film 
         includes a cinematograph film, a slide, video tape and video disc and any other form of recording from which a visual image, including a computer generated image, can be produced (together with its sound track), but does not include: 
         
         
        (a) a computer game, or 
         
        
       
      
    (b) an advertisement for a publication, a film or a computer game. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    7 The same Act defines “a computer generated image” as: 
     
      
       
        
         
        computer generated image 
         means an image (including an image in the form of text) produced by use of a computer on a computer monitor, television screen, liquid crystal display or similar medium from electronically recorded data. 
        
       
      
    8 At the end of the prosecution case it was clear that the prosecution were not relying upon the existence of the recorded images in the temporary Internet cache folder as supporting the charge. This was because there was no evidence that the defendant was aware that the images were recorded onto the computer’s hard drive in any form. The evidence was that the images were automatically recorded by the computer’s software when the defendant viewed them so that, if the defendant returned to the site, the computer could recover the recorded images without downloading them again. A person who was aware of the existence of the recorded images in the folder could access and view them without visiting the Internet site. But there was no suggestion that the defendant had ever done so. The overwhelming inference was that the defendant had only viewed the images and had never intentionally saved them onto either of the hard drives in the computer or any other storage facility, such as a compact disc. There was no evidence that he had ever printed any of the images. 
     
      
    9 In those circumstances the prosecution conceded that it could not prove that the defendant was in possession of the images recorded on his computer in the absence of any knowledge that they were there. Rather the prosecution contended that they were evidence of the defendant’s use of the computer to view the images which themselves amounted to a film for the purpose of s 578B when the images were being displayed upon the computer’s monitor from the Jpeg file stored in the temporary Internet cache. 
     
      
    10 The evidence as to the manner in which a computer deals with information from an Internet site was given by a police officer with expertise in the field of computer science. There was no dispute as to the evidence he gave and his oral testimony was augmented by a report that was placed in evidence without objection. The relevant parts of his evidence in chief were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        A. Searches were run through the described areas on hard drive disc 2 for suspected child pornography images. At least 247 large images of interest, that’s images equal to or exceeding 400 pixels by 400 pixels, that might be refused classification as child pornography were located in the allocated file system. 
         
         
        Q. Just pause please, in plain English what do you mean by allocated file system? 
         
        A. I mean a file system in which the user would be able to locate those files. 
         
         
        Q. Thank you. 
         
        A. In excess of 5000 thumbnail sized images with images equal to or less that 200 pixels by 200 pixels appearing to depict child pornography material were located in [the] allocated file system. Both the large and thumbnail size files were located in [the] internet cache an area located within the file system with a storage of file content including images and pages downloaded from the internet whilst web browsing. 
        
       
       
        
        ................................ 
         
         
        Q. Now, the internet cache, you told his Honour about some area allocated within the hard drive for the storage of file content, how does the internet cache work? 
         
        A. When a user clicks on a link to download a web page that web page typically in a default situation is loaded into the internet cache which is a file system which stores the image from which it is rendered for viewing by the user. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: No, I'm not sure I understand what you mean there.  
         
         
        FLIEGNER: Q. Does the temporary internet cache automatically store [the] image that's seen on the screen? 
         
        A. That's correct. 
         
         
        Q. When an image is seen on the screen, for instance take to use an example from annexure A number 2 there (sic) allxboys.com, how does the cache work in relation to a hit on or a visit to the allxboys.com web page? 
         
        A. Okay, the file, the file that represents the web page would typically be in hypertext, that's .a form of language, computer language. That comes through a network to the user's computer. Before it appears on the computer it actually goes into this file system that is called internet cache. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Q. That's before it comes onto the screen for viewing? 
         
        A. That's correct, it actually goes into this Internet cache first, together with any pictures that may be there, there are references to those pictures and they’re also called from the serving computer and they come down into the cache as well. Now this is done for efficiency because if the user needs to go back to look at that page again it's much more efficient to load that page if it hasn't changed from his or her computer, rather than to pull it all the way down the Internet and the time overheads that are associated with that. 
         
         
        Q. So where you see that back, forward, back, forward, that's accessing this cache, yes? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        FLIEGNER: Q. All right, now is this an automatic process? 
         
        A. Yes it is and it's generally a default process. It can be modified but in my experience of looking at computers forensically that it is extremely rare. 
         
         
        Q. Do you know whether it was modified in the present case in relation to the exhibit now before the Court? 
         
        A. It appears not to have been modified. 
         
         
        Q. In relation to the material that's stored in the temporary Internet cache, for example an image file, how can that file be, how can that file [be] dealt with or treated as compared to a file anywhere else in the hard drive? 
         
        A. It's in a directory structure that is created by the web browser as opposed to deliberately created by the user, but the contents are available if you wish to search for them 
         
         
        Q. Could the contents of the temporary Internet cache using a picture file an example be dealt with as any other file could? 
         
        A. Copied or saved, is that what you mean-­ 
         
         
        Q. Yes? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        
       
      
    11 In cross examination the officer gave the following evidence about the cache and how it operated; 
     
      
       
        
         
        Q. Let's assume the user of the computer went to the allxboys website, entered the website through clicking on the member's entry portal, [he] would have then been given a range of options to choose from presumably, is that a fair summary? 
         
        A. I can't see any problem with that. 
         
         
        Q. And at some time at around about 10.44am on 16 April there was appearing on the screen of the computer the Jpeg image which is depicted in annexure F of your report on the first page? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. Now once that picture appeared - in order for that picture to appear on the computer screen of this computer, what's happened is that a computer somewhere else in the world has sent a message through the telephone system to this particular computer in Sutherland, right? 
         
        A. Yes, yes. 
         
         
        Q. The computer sitting on a desk in Sutherland has received a message via the telephone system and has created without any other conscious or deliberate effort by the user of the computer a cache file on the hard drive of the computer, this one the second hard drive of the computer, right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. This is a mechanism which is done automatically by the computer, is it not? 
         
        A. It's done by the computer, it's more appropriately the web browser [that] controls the cache, it's part of the computer's software. 
         
         
        Q. So it's the web browser which through an automatic mechanism creates the file in the cache file system, right? 
         
        A. Before it displays it on the screen. 
         
         
        Q. Before displaying it on the screen, right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. So as far as the user is concerned, the user clicks something, in the twinkle of an eye or perhaps as long as a minute, depending on the efficiency of the Internet system being operated, a picture appears on the screen or appeared on the screen, right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. The user is interested in what's on the screen and their deliberate consciousness presumably is focussed on what is being viewed and you would accept would you not that there's little or [no] conscious or deliberate thinking about what’s happening down in the hard drive of the computer once the image appears on the screen, right? 
         
        A. Well it depends how much they know about what goes on I guess. 
         
         
        Q. Indeed, indeed. But let's talk about what they would see for instance on the screen of their computer. On the screen of their computer would appear a picture, right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. After having viewed it for however long it appeared on the screen, the user would move the cursor on the screen to another page of either that website or another site, 
         
        right? 
         
        A. Or close the browser. 
         
         
        Q. Or close the browser? 
         
        A. Or turn the computer off, or any number of things, yes. 
         
         
        Q. Let's take the case where the person is still interested in looking at other images on the site, the same site, they might use a link on the page that sends you back to a gallery of pictures, right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. Or they might click a button that's available on the screen that allows them to go back to the immediate page before this one, right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. And then once moved from this Jpeg, there would then be another message sent from the remote computer to the Sutherland computer creating yet another file on the cache if it was - 
         
        A. Yes just in the example you're using there are other things that can occur and that is that if the user clicks on a link to generate a picture, that picture may be generated in another window of the browser, which can mean that it is still there rather than, sorry to correct you but the example you're citing relates to a single browser window. Windows is called just that, you're probably aware, because of the ability for it to open a large number of windows at any one time and allow the user to toggle through those windows and look at them all. 
         
        
       
      
    12 A little later the following questions and answers were recorded: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Q.  
        So let me get this straight, the user of the computer had gone to the relevant site and looked at a number of images between 16 April and 11 May, right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. Those images had been stored on the cache? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. On 14 May a user of the computer had gone back to the same site on the web, the allxboys website? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. And had looked at some pictures that had already been viewed on another occasion? 
         
        A. On a previous occasion. 
         
         
        Q. Yes? 
         
        A. That's correct. 
         
         
        Q. There was no localised manualised (sic) deliberate attempt to go to the cache, it was an automatic process that occurred because the user of the computer clicked the website photo, not any mechanism used to deliberately access the cache, right? 
         
        A. Yes, the access of the cache was an automated process on behalf of the web browser, it wasn't a deliberate process. 
         
         
        Q. The web browser is a machine, not the person browsing the web? 
         
        A. True. Sorry, when I refer to the web browser I mean the web browsing software, you need an explorer. 
         
         
        Q. So it was a function of the software of the computer, not a conscious function of the user of the computer? 
         
        A. It was a function of the software of the computer to resurrect if you will that image from [the] cache. The (sic) going to download the image, I've already said that has to have been done by some user initiated action. 
         
         
        Q. Can I just ask about cache files, they could last indefinitely but there is no set length of time for them to remain on the hard drive of a computer, is there? 
         
        A. From my understanding and research I've done of the cache it is a function of the required space in the operating system that the cache may be deleted or subject to some deletion when the space it occupies is needed for re-use. 
         
        
       
      
    13 At the end of the prosecution case both parties addressed the magistrate. As I have already noted, the Crown did not rely upon the stored images in the cache folder, but argued that the viewing of each of the 50 images, later place by police on to the CD, on the computer monitor was possession of a “film” for the purposes of s 578B. Mr Boulton SC, who appeared for the defendant both before the Magistrate and in this Court, argued that the single charge was duplicitous if the Crown were relying upon possession of the 50 images only when each appeared on the monitor and was viewed by the defendant. The magistrate ruled against that proposition and it was not ventilated before this Court. Mr Boulton then argued that what the defendant saw on his computer monitor was not a “film” for the purposes of the offence. 
     
      
    14 The magistrate gave a short ex tempore judgment dismissing the charge. Relevantly he held: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The prosecution case is that the defendant, when he viewed on 50 separate occasions images on his screen, was in possession of a film in terms of the act. Mr Boulten, who represents the defendant, has argued that in the special narrow circumstances of the prosecution case, which does not any longer involve knowledge of what was in the hard drive but knowledge in relation to the image on the screen at the time that the defendant, and in this case it is alleged the defendant, viewed the image that he was then, on each of those 50 occasions, in possession, in terms of what I decided earlier, that is control, exclusivity, knowledge of that film, which I infer from his argument, it has to be, because of the definition that I am required to consider, that is, the film. 
         
         
        As I said, Mr Boulten argues that the definition of film does not and cannot refer to the image on the screen, that is the computer screen, that it requires an acceptance that the word film involves some physical recorder, such as a slide or a tape or a disk, such as one of the disks that were sent for classification which show that on the hard drive there was, without making any formal finding, that it appears very clearly explicit and criminal images. But I am not here dealing with the question of what one should say about it morally or criminally about those particular images but whether or not what he was looking at on the screen, in this special case and the concessions made here by the Crown, is a film. It may have been argued that in fact he did have knowledge by reason of the number of times that he accessed the image, that that could be the only inference available to him but, as I am understanding the Crown case, it is the separate acts of looking at the screen. They cannot establish knowledge about what is inside the tower, inside the hard drive, but nevertheless, the prosecution, in response to the submission of Mr Boulten, say that the prosecution case involves accessing jpeg files and that there is evidence of what a jpeg file is, as set out in exhibit 10A, that is, a Joint Photographic Expert Group - jpeg, is an image compression format used to transfer colour photographs and images over computer networks.

        The Crown says that the word `includes` is not to be seen as exhaustive of the definition of film that the Court can have regard to and any other form of recording from which a visual image can be produced. Certainly, computer generated images define to mean an image produced by use of a computer on a computer monitor, television screen, liquid crystal display or similar medium for electronically recorded data. 
         
         
        This is a criminal charge, I have had regard to the purpose of the legislation, including gaol sentences imposed on those that are involved in this activity but I have come to the view that the definition of film is such and my understanding of its meaning does not include the jpeg files and so I, therefore, accept the defence argument that in these special circumstances here, that it has not been shown, beyond reasonable doubt, at this stage, that what he possessed was a film. 
         
        
       
      
    15 At the outset of the proceedings before me it was argued by Mr Boulten that the appeal was incompetent because the decision made by the magistrate was a mixed question of fact and law and, therefore, did not fall within the scope of s 56(1)(c) of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act which provides that the prosecution may appeal against an order dismissing a charge “but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone”. 
     
      
    16 In Director of Public Prosecutions v Belani (2005) 64 NSWLR 319 Johnson J considered the scope of an appeal under s 56(1)(c) and stated the following principles: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [26] A finding of prima facie case involves a decision whether, on the evidence as it stands at the end of the prosecution case, the Defendant could lawfully be convicted. This is a question of law: May v O’Sullivan (1955) 92 CLR 654 at 658; Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden at 174–176 (paras 43–50). If the Magistrate has wrongly concluded that there was no prima facie case when, in fact, there was, this is an error of law. 
         
         
        [27] A finding of fact may reveal an error of law where it appears that the Magistrate has misdirected himself, that is, has defined otherwise than in accordance with law, the question of fact which he has to answer. An ultimate finding of fact, even in the absence of a misdirection, may reveal error of law if the primary facts found are necessarily within or outside a statutory description and a contrary decision has been made: Australian Gas Light Co v Valuer-General (1940) 40 SR(NSW) 126 at 138; Azzopardi v Tasman UEB Industries Ltd (1985) 4 NSWLR 139 at 156. The Director contends that the learned Magistrate erred in law in this way in wrongly confining the meaning of the word “race” in s 40(1)(a) Safety and Traffic Management Act. 
         
        
       
      
    17 That case concerned the proper construction of s 40(1) of the Safety and Traffic Management Act in respect of an offence charged in breach of that section and, in particular, whether the section applied only to planned or organised races and not to impromptu or unplanned races between vehicles upon a road. The magistrate, by reason of his interpretation of the relevant provision, held that there was no prima facie case and dismissed the charges. On his view the word “race” in the section meant an organised race event. Johnson J held that this interpretation was erroneous and amounted to an error of law in confining the words of the section in the way that he did. His Honour further held that the magistrate made an error of law in dismissing the charges and granted the relief sought by the plaintiff. 
     
      
    18 In Director of Public Prosecutions v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 343, Johnson J again considered the issue and stated the following principles in relation to an error of law for the purposes of s 56(1)(c): 
     
      
       
        
         
        [58] Section 56(1)(c) Appeal and Review Act confines a prosecutor who appeals to the Supreme Court against an order of acquittal in summary criminal proceedings to a ground that involves a question of law alone. There is no universally applicable test for distinguishing questions of law from questions of fact: Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd (1995) 186 CLR 389 at 394; Sood v R [2006] NSWCCA 114 at para 30. 
         
         
        [59] The formulation “question of law” employs general words capable of application at different levels of generality: Attorney General for NSW v X (2000) 49 NSWLR 653 at 660 (para 25). The expression “question of law” is wider than “error of law”: Attorney General for NSW v X at 677 (para 124). 
         
         
        [60] A mixed question of fact and law does not fall within the description of “question of law alone”: Williams v R (1986) 161 CLR 278 at 287 and 314; Attorney General for NSW v X at 663 (para 44). 
         
         
        [61] That an appeal to this Court by a prosecutor from an acquittal in summary criminal proceedings is confined to a question of law alone is not surprising. Such an appeal constitutes a statutory exception to the rule against double jeopardy: Davern v Messel (1983-1984) 155 CLR 21 at 30. 
         
         
        [62] However, a decision of a court of summary jurisdiction acquitting a defendant has never been regarded with the same sanctity as the verdict of a jury and the consistent trend of legislation, both in England and Australia, has been towards allowing the prosecution to appeal against an order of a Magistrate dismissing a charge and empowering the Supreme Court on appeal to quash the order: Davern v Messel at 37–38. 
         
        
       
      
    19 That case was concerned with the dismissal of charges laid under clause 18A of the Pawnbrokers and Second-Hand Dealers Regulation and the issue was whether the magistrate had misconstrued a phrase in the regulations as a result of which he held that there was no prima facie case. When considering whether the prosecution appeal did involve a question of law alone, Johnson J stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [76] ……………….. There was no factual dispute in this case. Although the learned Magistrate did not make findings of fact in the course of his reasons for dismissing the charges, the facts emerging from both the prosecution and defence cases in the Local Court were clear and uncontested. The Defendant had taken each of the five items in trade or pawn in the course of the licensee’s business. A label had been prepared for each item which contained a contract number. Four of the five items were placed in that part of the Defendant’s business premises nominated as the 14-day holding area. The labels were placed in that area as well, but were not attached to the items. The Gemini mountain bicycle was held by the Defendant elsewhere in its business premises. The Defendant had taken the items in this way and retained them for at least six days and up to 11 days without affixing the labels to the items. It was a deliberate decision by the Defendant not to affix physically the label to each item. 
         
         
        [77] A fair reading of the learned Magistrate’s reasons supports a conclusion that his Honour approached the construction and application of cl 18A in the manner submitted by the Plaintiff. 
         
         
        [78] In my view, this approach involved a fundamental misunderstanding of the meaning of words contained in cl 18A PSD Regulations. In effect, his Honour posed for himself the wrong statutory question for determination. There has been a misdirection as to law: Australian Gas Light Co v Valuer General (1940) SR 126 at 138; Azzopardi v Tasman UEB Industries Ltd (1985) 4 NSWLR 139 at 156; Director of Public Prosecutions v Belani [2005] NSWSC 1013 at para 27. I am satisfied that the appeal is based upon a ground that involves a question of law alone. 
         
         
        [79] I am satisfied that the Plaintiff has demonstrated that the learned Magistrate erred in law in his construction of cl 18A PSD Regulations. I am satisfied also that the learned Magistrate erred in law in dismissing each of the five charges upon the basis of the erroneous construction of the provision. 
         
        
       
      
    20 In the present case there was no dispute of fact to be resolved by the magistrate other than whether on the facts as agreed the offence had been made out. That question depended upon the construction to be given to the word “film” in s 578B. The magistrate held that on the facts the defendant was not in possession of a “film” as he interpreted the relevant provisions and, therefore, there was no prima facie case. Whether or not there was evidence to support the charge was in my view a matter of law even though it involved a consideration of the meaning of a word in the provision giving rise to the offence. It seems to me in the circumstances of an appeal by the prosecutor against the dismissal of a charge where the magistrate has found that there is no evidence to support it, that this involves a “question of law alone” notwithstanding that it also involved the determination of a meaning of a word in a section of an act. 
     
      
    21 It is clear that for the purpose of s 578B a “film” includes “a cinematograph,……,and any other form of recording from which a visual image, including a computer generated image can be produced”. It is also clear that a “computer generated image” is not a film: it is a visual image that is produced from a “film”. A computer generated image is “an image…produced by use of a computer monitor……from electronically recorded data”. Therefore, it is the “electronically recorded data” in the computer that amounts to a “film” for the purposes of the section. 
     
      
    22 As I understand the evidence, “the electronically recorded data” that produced the “computer generated image” viewed by the defendant was the jpeg file sent by the computer operating the web site to the computer operated by the defendant when he indicated by clicking on a particular page and then on a particular image that he wished to view the image or images on the page. Before the defendant could view either the page displaying the thumbnail images or the page displaying the enhancement of a single image from the thumbnails, the relevant jpeg file had to be sent to the defendant’s computer and stored automatically in the temporary Internet cache. It was the jpeg file, transmitted to and stored in the defendant’s computer, that created the image that he viewed on the monitor. 
     
      
    23 In my opinion what the defendant viewed on the monitor was a “computer generated image”. The jpeg file in the temporary Internet cache was a “film” within the terms of the section because it was a “form of recording from which …….a computer generated image can be produced”. Although the defendant had a “film” or a number of “films” on one of the hard drives of his computer, he was not in possession of any “film” on his computer because he was not aware of its existence. 
     
      
    24 The plaintiff points out that the definition of “film” is not exhaustive and includes “any other form of recording”. But a “film” must be a recording. A recording in everyday parlance is a store of information for subsequent reproduction, however permanent or temporary that storage might be. In my opinion if the information is not stored there is no recording of the information. There is no reason to read the word any differently when it is used in the relevant provisions. To the contrary the examples specified of recordings in the definition of “film” are all storage facilities for the reproduction of information. The image when viewed by the defendant on the monitor was, in my view, merely the retrieval or reproduction of material stored in the jpeg file in the temporary Internet cache. 
     
      
    25 The plaintiff in the initial submissions argued that the defendant “clicked on various photographs and must have been acutely aware that at least at that time the computer had recorded and retained the information transmitted”. There is in my opinion no evidence to support that proposition and it seems to me, with respect, to be contrary to the way the case was presented by the prosecutor before the magistrate. The prosecutor conceded in effect that he could not prove that the defendant knew that the images were recorded on the computer in any shape or form. 
     
      
    26 The plaintiff in later written submission, received after the Court had reserved, submitted that “the only restriction on ‘recording’ is in the capacity of such a recording to produce a visual image”. It was then argued that “thumbnail images are inherently capable of producing visual images in the sense of ‘showing visual images’ because they are already in the form of visual images”. The argument proceeded as follows: the defendant paid for accessed thumbnail images that were displayed upon his monitor; the image was a collection of pixels; a photograph may itself be a recording; the thumbnail images are less permanent than the recording in the cache; but nevertheless the images were at the behest of the defendant sent to his computer for his viewing for such time as he desired; in that sense they were a recording. 
     
      
    27 With respect I do not completely follow the argument. The thumbnails of images, and the enlarged images, were in the possession of the person operating the Internet site. They were not in the possession of the defendant unless he knew that they were recorded in the jpeg file in the cache of his computer. While the defendant might have thought that he was viewing images that were on the computer of the Internet site, in fact he was viewing images on his computer. In any event, it does seem to me to matter what the defendant thought was the mechanism whereby he was able to view the images. 
     
      
    28 The Magistrate held that a “film” for the purposes of the section could not include a jpeg file. As I understand the evidence that finding, with respect, cannot be correct. The problem for the prosecution was not that the jpeg files in the temporary Internet cache could not be a recording for the purpose of the definition of a “film” under the section but rather that the defendant did not know of their existence. But in my opinion the Magistrate was correct in finding that the visual image on the monitor was not itself a recording and, therefore, the plaintiff when viewing an image was not by that activity alone in possession of a recording. There was no prima facie case and the magistrate was correct in dismissing the charge. 
     
      
    29 The summons should be dismissed with costs.

    3 ROTHMAN J: Ricky Malcolm applies for leave to appeal the sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Blackmore of the District Court on 9 December 2005. The applicant had pleaded guilty to the offence of aggravated robbery contrary to s.95(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment. He was sentenced by Blackmore DCJ to a non-parole period of 2 years’ imprisonment, to date from 22 January 2005 to 21 January 2007, and thereafter a parole period of 1 year and 4 months, expiring on 21 May 2008; the total sentence is 3 years, 4 months. 
     
      
    4 The grounds of the appeal, and application for leave to appeal, raise manifest excess in the sentence, and the balance between general deterrence and rehabilitation in circumstances where the applicant, as in this case, suffers from an intellectual disability.  
     
      
    5 The details of the facts are irrelevant but there needs to be some understanding of the nature of the offence. Essentially the offence arose when the applicant, leading two friends, assaulted the victim on a Saturday evening outside Central railway station. The applicant stole the victim’s mobile phone. The offence occurred on 22 January 2005 and it would not yet have been dark. The assault was motivated by a desire to obtain money and was totally unprovoked. It involved stalking, threatening, terrifying and assaulting the victim before robbing him.  
     
      
    6 Shortly afterwards the applicant was arrested and had in his possession the mobile phone. After initially denying that he had committed the offence, the applicant pleaded guilty.  
     
      
    7 The applicant was described in a psychologist’s report as being “probably in the borderline range” of intelligence. 
     
      
       
      The Psychologist’s Report 
       
      
    8 Ms Katie Seidler complied a psychologist’s report on the applicant. Because of the nature of the argument put, the psychologist’s report takes on a significance it might not otherwise. Ms Seidler says: 
     
      
       
        
        “[The applicant’s] affect was inappropriate in the sense that he impressed as being immature and he often laughed or chuckled inappropriately. He … presented as a simple person who was not particularly psychologically minded. He was both oriented and alert and did not demonstrate any overt evidence of mood or thought disorder. … 
        
       
       
        
        [The applicant] was generally restless during testing and readily tried to give up on tasks that were clearly difficult for him. At times, he needed a great deal of encouragement and direction to stay focused on the tasks required of him.  
        
       
       
        
        [The applicant’s] intelligence was assessed. … Verbal measures are generally more affected by education, cultural experiences and language familiarity than non-verbal tests. [The applicant’s] verbal intelligence was assessed as falling in the range of a mild intellectual disability, with his scores being superior to only 2% of similar aged peers. His non-verbal or performance intelligence was determined to be in the below average range at the 21st percentile. There was a 20 point difference in [the applicant’s] verbal and non-verbal IQ scores and a difference of this magnitude is statistically significant, such that making an estimate of his overall intelligence quotient is inappropriate. It is suggested that [the applicant’s] non-verbal intelligence levels are probably a more sound estimate of his optimal intellectual functioning, however, functionally he is suggested to be performing at a level below this, probably in the borderline range. [The applicant’s] lower verbal intelligence is probably further compromised by his learning difficulties and only limited formal educational experience.  
        
       
       
        
        [The applicant’s] reading ability was assessed. … His score on this measure was commensurate with that of an 11 year old child. This is barely above the minimum standard of survival literacy skills, which is generally accepted to be equivalent to the age of 10 years.  
        
       
       
        
        [The applicant] then completed … a measure of short term memory or attention skills which requires the testee to hold and manipulate numerical information in memory. He performed at below the first percentile which is very poor and consistent with his lower verbal intelligence and reported history of attention deficit symptomatology. … 
        
       
       
        
        [The applicant’s] visual organisation skills are considered to be impaired, over and above his assessed level of intelligence. … 
        
       
       
        
        Overall, [the applicant] is a man who is functioning at a low level intellectually. In particular, he has a verbal intellectual deficit, which includes limited literacy and verbal comprehension skills. His functioning ability is considered to be partly reflective of his learning difficulties and very limited educational experience, in addition to genetic vulnerabilities. Verbal intelligence is known to be associated with the ability to self regulate through the mechanism of internal speech. Therefore [the applicant] would likely find it very difficult to reflect on experience and monitor his behaviour accordingly. He would have limited insight and would have poor perspective taking skills. In addition, his ability to reason in abstract or conceptual terms would be limited by his executive functioning difficulties. Specifically, [the applicant] could be expected to have greater difficulty utilising what cognitive resources he possess when compromised by stress, distress or increased demand. In summary, [the applicant] is a person with severely compromised cognitive and psychological maturity.”  
        
       
      
    9 Further, the pre-sentence report from the Probation and Parole Service confirms the views expressed by Ms Seidler and refers to his history of substance abuse. The applicant is a person who knows that what he did, in committing the offence, was wrong. But his intellectual disability prevents him from understanding why it is wrong. Persons who suffer from an intellectual or mental disorder do not serve as an appropriate medium for making an example to others: R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 50, per Hunt CJ at CL. However, his Honour went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “Considerations of general (or even personal) deterrence are not rendered completely irrelevant, and the significance of the offender’s mental incapacity is to be weighed and evaluated in the light of the particular facts and circumstances of the individual case. The reason for the principle is that the interests of society do not require such persons to be punished as severely as persons without that disability because such severity is inappropriate to their circumstances. The full understanding of the authority and requirements of the law which is attributed to the ordinary individual of adult intellectual capacities can not be expected of a person whose intellectual function is insufficient to have that understanding.” 
        
       
       
      Principles  
       
      
    10 As have been pointed out on a number of occasions, it is not unusual for persons suffering from mental disorders to come before the courts. The sentencing of such a person, a not uncommon experience for judicial officers, requires the exercise of a discretion involving balancing general deterrence, specific deterrence and the prospects of rehabilitation. The difference is that society cannot require of a person who is suffering a mental disorder that they be used as an example to the general public, because a person with a mental disorder may not understand fully the distinction between right and wrong or the gravity of their actions. But the goals of sentencing remain the same. They are the protection of society, deterrence of the offender and others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform: R v Veen (No. 2) (1988) 164 CLR 476. 
     
      
    11 As was pointed out in R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67, the principles of sentencing do not require automatic consequences. In particular, the fact of a mental disorder does not require, automatically, a lesser sentence than might otherwise be the case. 
     
      
    12 The sentence that was imposed by his Honour for a violent, wholly unprovoked attack on a person walking in the street was a sentence which is at the low end of the range available for a crime of this seriousness. 
     
      
    13 It is clear from the remarks on sentence that his Honour was mindful of the particular problems suffered by the applicant and took them into account in the exercise of his discretion. It is true, as is submitted, that, on the evidence before this Court and the sentencing judge, the applicant did not fully understand the gravity of his actions. It is also true that he understood that his actions were wrong. As earlier stated, what is clear from the psychological profile of this applicant is that personal deterrence has a great impact than might rehabilitation.  
     
      
    14 His Honour described the balance as favouring general deterrence in this case. Persons suffering this kind of disability ought rarely be used as the example by which others can be deterred from similar offences. But the overwhelming impression is that his Honour was, in fact, referring to personal or specific deterrence. Perhaps his Honour was mindful that usually specific deterrence, as a predominant consideration, is confined to recalcitrant offenders. The comments of his Honour show a concern for impressing on the applicant that conduct of this kind is unacceptable and will be punished.  
     
      
    15 In any event, it cannot be said that a lesser sentence is warranted in law on account of such an error: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    16 The sentence imposed by his Honour displays no substantial identifiable error. Nor is it manifestly excessive. The sentencing judge has approached an extremely difficult sentencing task with the proper regard to the sensitivities involved.  
     
      
    17 I propose that leave to appeal be granted and the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is a Crown appeal asserting the manifest inadequacy of sentence imposed upon the Respondent by Puckeridge DCJ on 13 April 2006 at Sydney District Court. The Respondent was committed for sentence following his plea of guilty in Central Local Court to a charge of knowingly taking part in the cultivation of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited plant (cannabis sativa) for which the prescribed maximum penalty is imprisonment for twenty years and/or a fine of $550,000. His Honour was asked to take into account on a Form 1, three charges of deemed supply of prohibited drug, namely 978.7 grammes of cannabis leaf (the indictable quantity is 1000 grammes); 87.5 grammes of methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (the indictable quantity is 1.25 grammes) and 7.18 grammes of methylamphetamine (the indictable quantity is 5 grammes). The cultivation which was the subject of the principal charge consisted of 6,795 plants. 
     
      
    2 His Honour sentenced the Respondent to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of eight months thirty days and a balance term of twenty one months and one day. The sentence was directed to commence on the day of imposition and the period arrived at by taking into account one month one day of pre-sentence custody undergone by the Respondent after his arrest and prior to entry into bail. 
     
      
    3 The Respondent stood for sentence upon an agreed statement of facts which incorporated the charges on the Form 1. The facts were: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the 15 March 2003 police executed two search warrants on neighbouring properties in the Fifield area, about 90 kilometres north west of Parkes. The first warrant was executed on the property ‘Emu Plains’. The second warrant was executed on a property ‘Hippy Valley’ where police located 2 cannabis plantations of mature plants fed by an irrigation system sourced from ‘Emu Plains’. A total of 6,765 cannabis plants were located. The estimated value of the crops was $13,880,000. There was a site on ‘Happy Valley’ (sic) with a large blue and white marquee tent covering racks with Hessian attached, a toilet block, tents, caravan, large work site office, large generator and other items consistent with accommodation and facilities for workers to occupy to harvest and dry the cannabis plants. 
        
       
       
        
        ‘Emu Plains’ is owned by Guiseppe Mammone, date of birth 7 November 1931. ‘Hippy Valley’ was, until a short time prior to the 15 March, owned by Skorin Holdings, of which Bill Skorin (date of birth 10 February 1974) was a director. Bill Skorin is the nephew of Guiseppe Mammone. 
        
       
       
        
        ‘Hippy Valley’ was transferred to Luca Badalamenti on 17 January 2003. The person Laca Badalamenti, is not know (sic) to exist and is believed by police to be an alias for Bill Skorin. 
        
       
       
        
        The plants located by police at ‘Hippy Valley’ were initially propagated at the Dubbo property, ‘Terrabella’. Ignazio Mangano transported the seedlings from ‘Terrabella’. Mr Mangano also brought fertiliser and provided advice on occasions concerning the growing of the crop. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused was one of 3 men, the others being John Ramsay and Geoff Kelly, who set up camp on ‘Hippy Valley’, prepared the 2 sites for planting, planted the seedlings, watered and fertilised the crops, helped build the drying racks and set up facilities for the cutters to live when the crops were to be harvested. This commenced in August/September 2002 and was still continuing until just before police executed the warrants. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused with Geoff Kelly hired a Jaden Mini Loader with auger attachment that was used to dig the holes for the plants. Bill Skorin brought food and supplies to the property but the accused and the other 2 males did on occasions leave the property to buy additional supplies and for other reasons. The accused used the phone in the house on ‘Emu Plains’ to make phone calls. A neighbour spoke to the accused when he was at the house on ‘Emu Plains’ about shooters coming through a broken fence on ‘Happy Valley’ (sic) onto his property. There is a telephone intercept of Skorin telling Mammone about ‘Ginos’ dealings with the neighbours. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused fled the property when there were signs the crop had been discovered. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused was arrested at a unit at Parramatta on the 8 June 2004. 
        
       
       
        
        The person John Ramsey has been granted an Indemnity. The person Geoff Kelly has not been apprehended. The person Skorin has been sentenced. The person Mangano is awaiting sentence on another crop with this crop to be taken into account on a form 1. The person Mammone has pleaded guilty on his trial date and is listed for sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        FORM 1 CHARGES 
        
       
       
        
        When the accused was arrested on the 8 June 2004 a search warrant was executed on unit 6, 5 Robinson Road, Parramatta that was occupied by the accused and his girlfriend. 
        
       
       
        
        Located in the unit was 
        
       
       
        
        1. 978.7 grams of cannabis leaf. 
         
        2. 87.5 grams of 3,4-Methylenedioxymethylamphetamine 
         
        3. 7.18 grams of Methylamphetamine. 
        
       
       
        
        The DNA of the accused was located on the packaging of the 87.5 grams of Methylenediosymethylamphetamine an (sic) 441 grams of the cannabis leaf.” 
        
       
      
    4 The outcomes in relation to other offenders as mentioned in those facts should be noted. Ramsey was granted an indemnity, presumably in response to information and potential evidence to inculpate others, and he was not prosecuted. Kelly has not been apprehended. Mangano was dealt with in respect of a different cultivation on another property which was near Dubbo and had his participation in this offence taken into account on a Form 1 when he was sentenced in respect of the other matter. Mammone pleaded guilty on the day fixed for his trial to the identical offence as the respondent of knowingly taking part in the cultivation of a large commercial quantity of cannabis. Mammone was also sentenced by Puckeridge DCJ and he imposed sentence consisting of a non parole period of two years six months and a balance term of two years eight months twelve days. At the time of this offence Mammone was on parole. He was aged seventy four years. On a Crown appeal to this Court, differently constituted, his sentence was increased to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of three years six months and a balance term of two years two months.  
     
      
    5 Skorin pleaded guilty to a charge similar to that against the respondent save that the span of time over which he was alleged to be knowingly concerned was two months longer than that alleged against the respondent. Evidence was called at his sentence hearing concerning a dispute as to his level of involvement. This included evidence from Ramsey. Puckeridge DCJ imposed a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of one year and a balance term of one year two months which was increased on Crown appeal to this Court, again differently constituted, to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of two years and nine months and a balance term of one year nine months. 
     
      
    6 In assessing sentence to be imposed on the respondent, his Honour nominated a starting point of total sentence of three years four months. The Crown contends that this was so low as to be below the range available within the sound exercise of discretion. I consider that this submission has been made good. 
     
      
    7 This was a major criminal enterprise and the actual crop exceeded by a multiple of six of that required to constitute a large commercial quantity. The estimated value of the crop in the agreed facts confirms the scale of operations. For about six months, the respondent was variously engaged in setting up accommodation and equipment for necessary workers and the use of equipment for planting and development of the crop towards the intended harvest. It understates the real content of his activity to describe him as a mere “crop sitter”. He is to be sentenced for what he has actually done rather than merely as a reflection of some position within a criminal hierarchy: Olbrich v The Queen 1999 199 CLR 270. 
     
      
    8 Puckeridge DCJ applied a “discount” of 25 percent to his assessment to take into account the respondent’s early plea of guilty. No error is revealed in his so doing and it should be maintained if this Court resentences. 
     
      
    9 There is a further factor which is, in my view, demonstrative of the inadequacy of the starting point selected by his Honour and that is the difficulty in perceiving that any real weight has been given to the matters on the Form 1. The offences scheduled therein were far from trivial. They revealed involvement of the respondent with other forms of drug in addition to the growing crop and, in the case of the first charge, involvement with cannabis which had in fact been harvested. To take these offences into account there should have been some increase in the penalty which would have been appropriate for the principal offence: Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 2002 56 NSWLR 146. 
     
      
    10 It is submitted by the Crown that there is further error in his Honour’s imposition to be found in the excessive granting of favour to the respondent in fixing a ratio between non parole period and total sentence. That specified in the sentencing legislation was departed from upon a finding of special circumstances and there is no challenge to this finding as such. But the consequence of his Honour’s application was that the period in actual custody was equivalent to only about one third of the total term, which is in marked contrast to three quarters of total term which would be the case if the statutory ratio had been applied. 
     
      
    11 The reasons given by his Honour for this specification were the available employment for the respondent with his brother upon release and a need for supervision whilst he was in fact on parole. The Crown Prosecutor in this Court commented that there is no reason to think that the employment with the brother was not available during the six months or so that the respondent devoted himself to criminal activity in developing the cannabis crop. It was necessary for his Honour to determine what was the minimum period of detention called for by the commission of this crime, taking into account the Form 1 matters, and a period of ten months could not fulfil this requirement particularly when regard is had, not in the least, to the respondent’s active participation in a major, sophisticated, continuing criminal enterprise: Power v The Queen 1974 131 CLR 623. 
     
      
    12 On behalf of the respondent it was submitted that intervention was not called for by reason of his low level of involvement and his subjective circumstances, in particular that in the long period between arrest and sentence he had achieved rehabilitation. It is true that the respondent’s level of involvement was less than that of others. Insofar as it was submitted that attention should be paid to the sentences received by co-offenders, I would accept that the respondent should be dealt with less severely than they were. From a different point of view, the gap between the terms received by the respondent when compared with those received by the co-offenders (after appeals) might be regarded as fortifying a conclusion that his sentence was manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    13 It appears to have been common ground that the long delay in the respondent’s appearance for sentence was provoked by a Crown desire to deal with the co-offenders first, but there is no reason to conclude that the respondent was not content to remain at liberty and on bail during the extended period. It was not sought by him to accelerate the proceedings and no doubt, as the Crown Prosecutor observed, had the respondent expressed a desire to be sentenced, he would have been accommodated. I do not consider that delay is a factor which operates against the Crown being granted the intervention by this Court which it seeks. 
     
      
    14 Puckeridge DCJ made findings favourable to the respondent concerning absence of significant record and prior good character, remorse, unlikelihood of further offence and rehabilitation. These findings were clearly open and should be re-applied in any sentence reassessment.  
     
      
    15 However, for the reasons already canvassed, I consider the ground that the sentence was manifestly inadequate has been made out. I would adopt his Honour’s finding in regard to special circumstances. The period of one month one day pre sentence custody should be more conveniently taken into account by commencing the sentence on 12 March 2006 rather than 13 April 2006 which will avoid the somewhat awkward ratios which would be reduced to months and days. 
     
      
    16 Allowing for the restraint to be exercised when proceeding to resentence after successful Crown appeal, I would assess a starting point of imprisonment for a total of four years six months reduced to three years four months to apply a discount of 25 percent for the plea of guilty (slightly rounded down in favour of the respondent). As previously stated, I would find special circumstances but apply a ratio different from that selected by his Honour. After appeal, the ratio in the cases of both Mammone and Skorin involved a non parole period of approximately 60 percent of total sentence whilst the factors in each case are different, I would regard that ratio as appropriately indicative for the respondent. 
     
      
    17 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal against sentence allowed. 
       
      2. Sentence imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
      3. In lieu thereof the respondent be sentenced, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of two years commencing on 12 March 2006 and expiring on 11 March 2008 with a balance term of one year four months commencing on 12 March 2008.  
       
      4. The earliest date of eligibility for parole specified as 11 March 2008.

     ANTHONY STEWART DRINAN v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
      
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Rothman J. 
     
      
    2 HOEBEN J: I agree with Rothman J. 
     
      
    3 ROTHMAN J: Anthony Stewart Drinan was sentenced by his Honour Judge Finnane at the Sydney District Court on 26 August 2005 for three offences: malicious damage (date of offence 10 August 2004); common assault (date of offence 10 August 2004); aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence (date of offence 14/15 August 2004).  
     
      
    4 For each of those offences, Mr Drinan was sentence to a s.9 bond (in relation to Counts 1 and 2) and in relation to Count 3, a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months’ imprisonment with a total term of 6 years, each of which was to date from 24 June 2005. From those sentences Mr Drinan seeks leave to appeal and, to the extent leave is granted, requests this Court to quash the sentences and impose lesser sentences.  
     
      
    5 The maximum sentence for each offence is: Count 1, malicious damage, imprisonment for 5 years; Count 2, common assault, imprisonment for 2 years; and Count 3, aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence, imprisonment for 20 years. No standard non-parole period is set for any one of the offences.  
     
      
       
      Background Facts 
       
      
    6 On 9 August 2004 someone stole a six week old dog from the residence of the applicant and his girlfriend. They sought and obtained information on the identity of the thief or thieves. From that information the applicant suspected that Darren McKeown and Nathan Carrick were responsible. The circumstances of the robbery were that the thieves had hit the adult mother dog in order to steal the puppy.  
     
      
    7 On 10 August 2004, three persons, one of whom was the applicant, went to Mr Carrick’s place. They knocked on the window and the applicant’s brother, Matthew Drinan, kicked a hole in the wall. All of this was at or about 10.30 pm. When the said Matthew Drinan kicked the hole in the wall, the effect was that Mr Carrick was hit through the hole. The applicant and his co-offender then started questioning and abusing Mr Carrick. At the time the applicant was armed with a pick handle. A Mr Stender took hold of Mr Carrick’s shirt and threatened him and, before they left the premises, the applicant hit Mr Carrick on the shoulder with the pick handle and smashed the bedroom window. The evidence is that this incident would not have been reported but for the occurrence of the later incident which I will now describe.  
     
      
    8 On 14 August 2004 at about 11.00 pm, the applicant and Mr Stender, together with their respective girlfriends and another, consumed a large quantity of the alcohol at home in Orange. (The Sentencing Judge found that both the applicant and Mr Stender were alcoholics and had been alcoholics for many years.) At approximately 11.00 pm that night Mr Stender and the applicant went to Mr McKeown’s home. Again the applicant was armed with the wooden pick handle which, by this time, had been wrapped in red coloured tape because the wood of the handle had split. The Sentencing Judge found that the applicant took the pick handle with him because he intended to use it to assault either or both Mr McKeown or Mr Carrick. Mr Stender knew that the applicant was in possession of the pick handle and was likely to use it.  
     
      
    9 On arrival at the McKeown home, they damaged the screen door. After discussion with the pregnant girlfriend of Mr McKeown, Mr Stender and the applicant departed. They went to Mr Carrick’s place of residence. There, once more, Mr Stender damaged the screen door and entered the premises.  
     
      
    10 Mr Carrick, the victim, was in the rear bedroom lying on a mattress watching television. Mr Stender kicked the mattress. Both men then yelled at him about the stolen dog (the dog had been returned by the Police two days earlier). Mr Carrick indicated that it was Mr McKeown who had stolen the dog and curled up under the blankets fearing for his safety and protecting his head with his arms. The sentencing judge described the scene thus: 
     
      
       
        
        “Despite the fact that Mr Carrick was obviously helpless and completely unable to defend himself, both men then set about assaulting him. [The applicant] used the wooden pick handle to strike Mr Carrick upwards of ten times or more on the shoulders, arm, chest and left side of his head. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Stender assaulted Mr Carrick by kicking him in the forehead and on the side of the head three times. He then stomped on his head just above the ear twice. At one point, Mr Stender tried to persuade [the applicant] to leave, [the applicant] pushed him away and kept hitting the victim. The victim was crying and shouting; as it turns out he is a man who has a mild mental disability.” 
        
       
       
      Finnane DCJ described the behaviour as “particularly violent”. 
       
      
    11 The applicant and Mr Stender left the premise leaving Mr Carrick injured without taking precautions to ensure that assistance was gained for him. Mr Carrick was severely injured. The next day when he could summon help, he was taken to Orange Base Hospital where he was found to be suffering from a badly broken jaw and severe bruising to the left side of his body. He underwent surgery and the insertion of plates. On his arrest, or as soon after his arrest as was reasonable, the applicant pleaded guilty and was treated by the sentencing judge as having pleaded guilty to all three charges at the first opportunity.  
     
      
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    12 The applicant raises three grounds of appeal, which grounds go to both leave and the merits of the appeal. Those grounds are: 
     
      
    a Ground One: His Honour erred by using as a starting point the standard non-parole period and then crafting the sentence around it, rather than, having determined that the standard non-parole period did not apply, exercising his sentencing discretion in accordance with established sentencing practice and by reference to matters identified in s.3A, s.21A, s.22, s.22A and s.23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999;b Ground Two: His Honour erred in failing to properly consider the issue of parity;c Ground Three: The sentence imposed for the aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence is manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      Ground One: Inappropriate Use of the Standard Non-Parole Period 
       
      
    13 Pursuant to the principles involved in sentencing, His Honour was required to determine whether the objective seriousness of the offence was within the mid-range of seriousness. The submission of the applicant concentrates on some words used by his Honour and, with respect to Counsel, does so out of context. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am required to approach sentence in these matters having regard to principle. When it comes to matters where standard non-parole periods are imposed, it is recognised that the level of sentences imposed before the standard non-parole period regime came in, are quite different and reference to previous statistics are of very limited value. That is because one of the effects of the standard non-parole period system is to cause an increase in sentence and in particular the minimum period that a person spends in custody… [His Honour referred to  
        R v Pellew 
         2005 NSWCCA 151] 
        
       
       
        
        A standard non-parole period of 5 years is applied to this offence if a Judge comes to the conclusion that it is in the middle range of objective seriousness. The maximum penalty is 20 years. The middle range of objective seriousness is always a difficult thing to determine. Because in this case the defender pleaded guilty, I am not in any way obliged to impose a standard non-parole period, even if I come to the conclusion that the offence is in the middle range of objective seriousness.  
        
       
       
        
        However, I am required to have regard to the non-parole period which is fixed as one guide post and the maximum as another. I am then required to look at questions of discount of sentence that might apply because of an early plea of guilty and any matters in aggravation and mitigation. What, in truth, I am required to do is to determine, having regard to the fact that I do not have to impose that period but do have to determine where in the range of objective seriousness this applies, what is the non-parole period that I would fix before discounting it for an early plea of guilty. I must have regard to all the aggravating and mitigating features.” 
        
       
      
    14 There is no error involved in that approach of his Honour. His Honour went on to determine the sentence that he sought to impose both as to non-parole period and the remainder of sentence. Nothing in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 is inconsistent with the approach adopted by his Honour and this ground of appeal fails.  
     
      
       
      Ground Two: Parity 
       
      
    15 The complaint made by the applicant is that Finnane DCJ imposed identical sentences on the applicant and his co-offender Robert Stender. 
     
      
    16 Finnane DCJ imposed identical overall effective sentences on both the applicant and his co-offender. In the case of the applicant, he was sentenced for three offences, while Mr Stender was sentenced for two offences.  
     
      
    17 The subjective circumstances of each offender were different. Unlike the applicant, Mr Stender had a record of previous convictions and was on a s.12 bond from Queensland at the time of the offence. The applicant had no prior offences. Further, the applicant submits that Mr Stender was older than the applicant, although it is conceded that the age difference is only 10 months.  
     
      
    18 The applicant draws the Court’s attention to what is said to be a concession. During the course of submissions, the Crown conceded that there was no distinction between the objective circumstances of the offence committed by each of the co-offenders. As a result of that concession no submission was made on behalf of the applicant as to parity.  
     
      
    19 An analysis of the facts would suggest that the concession by the Crown was generous to the applicant. As previously noted, when the applicant was assaulting the victim with a pick handle, the co-offender sought to have him cease the activity and leave. One would have thought, in those circumstances, that the objective circumstances of each offender were to some extent different. Nevertheless, the concession was made. The applicant now suggests that sentencing each of the applicant and his co-offender to the same sentence in circumstances of that concession and the absence of a submission on parity was an error of law and, also implicitly, a denial of natural justice. 
     
      
    20 The objective circumstances of the offence may well be the same and for the purposes of this appeal I will treat them as the same. The fundamental question is whether the subjective differences between the two co-offenders warrant a less severe sentence for the applicant in circumstances where the applicant has pleaded guilty to an additional offence. Put another way, do the subjective differences warrant a more severe sentence for the co-offender in the circumstances of these offences? The age difference does not seem to be particularly significant. It certainly does not, in the circumstances of this case, mean that the co-offender was the leader and the applicant his subordinate. Ultimately, his Honour treated the previous convictions and the s.12 bond from Queensland as not making a material difference to the sentence to be imposed. That was a matter within the discretion of his Honour.  
     
      
    21 The notions of equal justice require consistency in punishment between co-offenders in like circumstances, and due discrimination for relevant differences in criminality: Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295; Lowe v The Queen (1994) 154 CLR 606. Fundamentally, the question is always whether the same sentence is justified for both and, if not, the extent of any differences. In this case, the Crown conceded that the objective seriousness of the offence (as distinct from the offenders) was comparable. His Honour applied this assessment. That necessarily implies that, taking into account only objective seriousness of the offences, the sentences should also be comparable. However, one must bear in mind that in the case of the applicant there are three offences and in the case of the co-offender there are two. Moreover, his Honour’s view that the record of previous convictions and the existence of the previous s.12 bond from Queensland, were not such as to warrant disparate sentences, is one which, in the circumstances of this case, was open to his Honour and with which this Court ought not interfere. Otherwise put, there is no justified sense of unfair treatment by treating each of the co-offenders comparably, notwithstanding their slightly different subjective circumstances. 
     
      
       
      Ground Three: Manifest Excess 
       
      
    22 As the discussion with his Honour during the course of sentencing indicated, one can imagine worse cases than the instant case. However, it is always possible to imagine a worse case. By and large, a worse case than this aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence would have probably resulted in other serious charges being laid. This is a situation where, because it was thought the victim had stolen a puppy of the applicant, the applicant damaged the victim’s property, assaulted him on one occasion and then assaulted him quite seriously, having broken into his premises to do so, on a second occasion. The victim was bashed with a pick handle in his own home. This is an extremely serious and violent offence. Clearly there are, as the Sentencing Judge indicated, subjective factors which the Sentencing Judge took into account to impose a non-parole period of two years and six months as part of a total effective term of six years (i.e. a remainder of term of three years and six months). 
     
      
    23 The maximum sentence that could have been imposed was 20 years imprisonment. A lesser sentence than 2½ years’ non-parole period for these offences would be less than adequate. 
     
      
    24 In these circumstances there is no manifest excess in the sentence that has been imposed. Each of the subjective circumstances has been taken into account and the Sentencing Judge found special circumstances warranting a shorter non-parole period than required by the statute.  
     
      
    25 I would reject each of the grounds of appeal and I propose the following orders: 
     
      
    a Leave to appeal be granted;b The appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 HUNT AJA: I agree with the order proposed by Barr J, and with the reasons he has given. 2 One particular complaint made by the appellant is that the trial judge failed in his directions concerning delay to use language which conveyed “the weight and authority of the court”. It is a complaint which appears to misunderstand what is meant by that phrase, a misunderstanding which has occurred in some other appeals. What it means is no more than that the various warnings which either the legislature or the appellate courts have required trial judges to give in relation to various issues to be determined by the jury must be seen by the jury to be given on the judge’s own behalf, and not merely by way of reference to what counsel may have submitted to the jury. It does not require any particular form of words to demonstrate that the direction is being given by the judge on his or her authority. 
     
      
    3 It is clear that the judge added the weight of his judicial authority to the directions in issue in this appeal, and that the jury would so have understood them. 
     
      
    4 BARR J: The appellant, Darren Peter Wade, appeals against his conviction following a trial by jury in the District Court of the offence of having had sexual intercourse with the complainant, whom I shall call T, without her consent in circumstances of aggravation, namely that T was under the age of sixteen years. The offence was committed on 25 October 2000. T was twelve years old at the time and her brother, whom I shall call J, was thirteen years old. They lived with their mother. The appellant and the mother of the children had cohabited from time to time over the years. The appellant was the father of J but not of T, who was the child of a marriage between the mother and another man. After that marriage came to an end the mother and the appellant resumed their relations. The mother described them as “on and off”. At the time of the events giving rise to the charge, the mother, the appellant and the two children were generally resident in the one house. The mother had her own room. So did T. So did J. The appellant sometimes slept in the mother’s room but most of the time he occupied a bed in the lounge downstairs.  
     
      
    5 25 October 2000 was the night of T’s school dance. She attended the dance and the appellant picked her up afterwards using T’s mother’s car. He drove her home. T went to her mother’s room to say goodnight to her mother before retiring to bed in her own room. Those facts were uncontroversial at the trial. Also uncontroversial was the fact that T had had some difficulty bedwetting.  
     
      
    6 According to the evidence of T, she retired to bed and slept. At some later time she was woken by the appellant, who told her to take off her shorts. He said that her mother did not want her to wet her shorts. The appellant took off her shorts and as he did so he inserted his finger into her vagina. He left the finger there for some considerable time, probably an hour or so. T was afraid but did not call for help. The appellant told her that what had happened was a secret. He left her room. T told nobody what had happened. 
     
      
    7 It was not until March 2004 that T told her mother what had happened. She did so during an apparently difficult conversation in which she, T, had to explain why she had not been attending technical college classes. By that time, the mother and the appellant had ceased their relationship and there was some further delay before the complaint was brought to his attention. Altogether some three years and eleven months elapsed between the time of the events complained of and the time when notice was given to the appellant. 
     
      
    8 J gave evidence. He recalled the night of the school dance and T’s being brought home by the appellant. He recalled T going upstairs to her room. He recalled the appellant going there as well shortly afterwards. When asked what happened then he gave this answer -  
     
      
       
        
        A: 
         I don’t know, I just heard the door open and then heard him come back out some time later and I didn’t think anything of it at the time.  
        
       
      
    9 T’s mother gave evidence. She remembered the night of the school dance. She took T to the dance in her car, a red Holden Camira, and dropped her off. The mother returned home and remained there. She had something to drink during the evening and fell asleep. When she awoke she asked where the appellant was and J told her that he had gone to collect T. The appellant and T arrived home about ten minutes later. She saw both of them. T came to her room and told her how she had enjoyed the dance. She said that she was going off to bed and left her mother’s room. The appellant came into the room and the mother thanked him for collecting T. He said that he was going downstairs to watch television. They said goodnight.  
     
      
    10 The appellant gave evidence. He admitted driving T home from the school dance in her mother’s red Camira. He admitted being in the house after everyone had retired to bed. He denied having gone to T’s room. He denied having assaulted her.  
     
      
    11 There is a single ground of appeal, namely - 
     
      
       
        
        1. There was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the learned trial Judge’s failure to adequately warn the jury of the danger in convicting the applicant on the evidence of the complainant in 
          
        that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) The trial Judge failed to use language of warning in delivering the portion of his summing up concerning the disadvantages suffered by an accused where there is delay in complaint; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) The trial Judge failed to use language which showed that his words on this issue bore the weight and authority of the court.  
          
         
        
       
      
    12 As his Honour plainly told the jury, the real issue for them was whether the appellant had penetrated T with his finger. His Honour reminded the jury that the only witness to give evidence to that effect was T, and that the result was that before they could find the appellant guilty they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that T was an honest and accurate witness. His Honour summed up on delay in complaint, dealing first with its possible effect on the jury’s assessment of the evidence of T herself. His Honour concluded with a direction, twice given, that these circumstances led to the need to scrutinise the complainant’s evidence with great care. This unexceptionable direction was strong and accorded with R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12.  
     
      
    13 Then his Honour continued -  
     
      
       
        
        Whether or not you were satisfied that there were good reasons for the complainant not making a complaint, that is to say not telling anyone about the matter until some three and a half years later, there still remains a further matter for you to consider and that is this, that the evidence is that this allegation was not brought to the attention of the accused until May last year and as I understand it that is common ground. Any delay in the prosecution of a charge will to some extent obviously compromise the ability of the person who faces that charge to properly meet it. The longer the delay obviously the more the ability to meet the charge will be compromised. 
        
       
       
        
        Now the accused does not have an onus, he does not have to prove anything or disprove anything, but like any of us, if we are charged with a criminal offence he is entitled to mount a case to challenge that charge. In this case, obviously, his ability to do so will have been compromised at least to some extent by the long delay between when this event is said to have occurred and when he was first made aware of the allegation. Memories fade and you saw examples of that from a number of the witnesses who could not remember things because of the effluxion of time, that is probably the most significant way in which a person’s ability to contradict a charge or challenge a charge will be compromised because of delay. There may be other reasons, his ability to recall exactly what happened on the night, where he was at various times and so on will undoubtedly have been compromised you might think. When you assess all the evidence in the case and his ability to challenge the allegations that have been made against him you must bear in mind that that ability will have been compromised to some extent because of the delay in bringing the charge to his attention.  
        
       
      
    14 It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that his Honour’s directions fell so far short of the requirement in Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 that there was a miscarriage of justice. Counsel drew the Court’s attention to passages from the judgments in Longman itself and from later cases in the High Court of Australia and in this Court which have to some extent refined and explained the need for directions in particular cases, both as to what ought to be said and as to what need or ought not to be said. Dealing with the effect upon an accused person of a delay of twenty-four years, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ said this in Longman v The Queen at 91 -  
     
      
       
        
        … there is one factor which may not have been apparent to the jury and which therefore required not merely a comment but a warning be given to them: see Reg. v. Spencer, at p 141. That factor was the applicant's loss of those means of testing the complainant's allegations which would have been open to him had there been no delay in prosecution. Had the allegations been made soon after the alleged event, it would have been possible to explore in detail the alleged circumstances attendant upon its occurrence and perhaps to adduce evidence throwing doubt upon the complainant's story or confirming the applicant's denial. After more than 20 years that opportunity was gone and the applicant's recollection of them could not be adequately tested. The fairness of the trial had necessarily been impaired by the long delay (see Jago v. District Court of New South Wales, unreported, delivered 12 October 1989, pp 8,22-23,38-39,57-58) and it was imperative that a warning be given to the jury. The jury should have been told that, as the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of more than 20 years, it would be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinizing the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning, were satisfied of its truth and accuracy. To leave a jury without such a full appreciation of the danger was to risk a miscarriage of justice. 
        
       
      
    15 In Crampton v The Queen [2000] HCA 60; (2000) 206 CLR 161 at 181, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ were considering a delay of nineteen years, and said this at [45] -  
     
      
       
        
        The trial judge should have instructed the jury that the appellant was, by reason of the very great delay, unable adequately to test and meet the evidence of the complainant. Her Honour should not have offered the qualification that she did in relation to the remarks she did make about the delay. An accused's defence will frequently be an outright denial of the allegations. That is not a reason for disparaging the relevance and importance of a timely opportunity to test the evidence of a complainant, to locate other witnesses, and to try to recollect precisely what the accused was doing on the occasion in question. In short, the denial to an accused of the forensic weapons that reasonable contemporaneity provides, constitutes a significant disadvantage which a judge must recognise and to which an unmistakable and firm voice must be given by appropriate directions. 
        
       
      
    16 Reference was made to the judgment in R v BWT (2002) 54 NSWLR 241 of Sully J, with whom Wood CJ at CL and Dowd J agreed, summarising the principles which had by then emerged. It was submitted that where there had been substantial delay there must be a warning, not simply a comment or a caution. The warning must be correctly focused and framed. It must identify particular problems which delay may have occasioned to the accused. It must not simply be a repetition of counsel’s arguments but must have the unmistakable authority of the Court (at 273-4). Reference was made to the judgment of Sully J at 273 -  
     
      
       
        
        …first, that because of the passage of time the evidence of the complainant cannot be adequately tested; secondly, that it would be, therefore, dangerous to convict on that evidence alone; thirdly, that the jury is entitled, nevertheless, to act upon that evidence alone if satisfied of its truth and accuracy; fourthly, that the jury cannot be so satisfied without having first scrutinised the evidence with great care; fifthly, that the carrying out of that scrutiny must take into careful account any circumstances which are peculiar to the particular case and which have a logical bearing upon the truth and accuracy of the complainant’s evidence; and sixthly, that every stage of the carrying out of that scrutiny of the complainant’s evidence must take serious account of the warning as to the dangers of conviction. 
        
       
      
    17 Counsel for the appellant fairly drew attention to other decisions of this Court calling for the adoption of a more flexible approach: R v GS [2003] NSWCCA 73; R v WSP [2005] NSWCCA 427. In R v DGB (2002) 133 A Crim R 227 Howie J, with whom Meagher JA and Simpson J agreed, said this at [30] -  
     
      
       
        
        In the present case, I am unpersuaded that it was necessary, either as a matter of law or in order to ensure a fair trial to the appellant, that the trial judge use the phrase ""dangerous to convict"" in warning the jury as to the approach to be taken when assessing the complainant's evidence. No such warning was sought by an apparently competent defence counsel. 
        
       
      
    18 It was submitted that his Honour’s words fell short of even the narrowest requirement of Longman v The Queen. They did not bear the weight and authority of the Court. Instead of using the clear language of warning and authority, his Honour put the matter in conversational language, using such words as “to some extent” and “you might think”. The words failed to convey the seriousness of the matter. The jury would not have understood that they were being given a warning based on the combined experience of the Court of the dangers of convicting a person on the type of evidence available in this case. Reference was made to the need expressed in this Court by Adams J in R v Murre [2001] NSWCCA 286 for an emphatic warning.  
     
      
    19 As Simpson J observed in R v DRE [2006] NSWCCA 280 at [47], the principle dealt with in Longman v The Queen has, since that case, had a long and rather troubled history. As her Honour observed at [59] no definitive statement of the minimum requirements of a Longman direction have yet emerged.  
     
      
    20 Some things may be said with confidence. First, the charge to the jury should take into account all the relevant circumstances of the case before the jury. One circumstance will be the length of time which elapsed between the events and the accused’s appreciation of the accusation. In cases of gross delay, the charge will need to be strong. It is not irrelevant that the strong warnings called for in Longman and Crampton resulted from delays approaching and exceeding twenty years. See also R v Sheehan [2006] NSWCCA 233, another case in this Court calling for a strong direction, which was concerned with delays varying between seventeen and twenty-two years.  
     
      
    21 On the other hand, the shorter the time between events and accusation, the less insistent must surely be the need for a strong warning. Spigelman CJ described DRE, a case involving a delay of up to three years for some counts but only a matter of months for others, as at best a borderline case for a Longman direction. However, I do not understand his Honour to have formed that conclusion from a reckoning of time alone – that a Longman direction was required was accepted by both sides in the appeal – and I would not wish to be understood as proposing such an approach.  
     
      
    22 There may be other circumstances, too. There may be evidence going directly to the accused’s ability to remember events and otherwise account for his movements and activities. Such circumstances must be borne in mind as well.  
     
      
    23 Secondly, it may be said that no particular form of words is needed when directing the jury: R v Kesisyan [2003] NSWCCA 259.  
     
      
    24 Thirdly, it is not necessary, in fact undesirable, to use the words “dangerous to convict” or “unsafe to convict” when giving a Longman warning. These expressions bear similar meanings: Doggett v The Queen (2001) 208 CLR 343 per Glesson CJ at [10]; see also the judgment of Spigelman CJ in R v Robinson [2006] NSWCCA 192 and of Sully J in R v BWT.  
     
      
    25 What is necessary is that the trial judge should add the weight of judicial opinion that the relevant disadvantages do exist and why they exist.  
     
      
    26 The relevant circumstances of this case are as follows. The delay, as I have said, was just short of four years. It was common ground that only four persons were present in the house at the time of the alleged events, namely the complainant, the appellant, the complainant’s mother and the complainant’s brother. There was no possibility that any other person may have been present. This was not the sort of case where there might have been writing or diary notes or other communications, records of which might have been lost in the meantime. There was no possibility of the lost opportunity to seek the aid of other witnesses. There was no suggestion that the complainant’s mother or brother ever entered the complainant’s room. In a practical sense there were only two possibilities: the complainant was in her room and was visited by the appellant, as she said, and that the two remained alone and separated at all relevant times.  
     
      
    27 The appellant showed by his evidence that he remembered the events of the night. He remembered collecting the complainant and taking her home. He knew that she wet the bed. Her mother had told him. He conceded in cross-examination that he could have gone to the complainant’s room if he had wished to do so. He denied having done so.  
     
      
    28 This was a very short trial. The evidence was complete well inside two sitting days. The issue was of the narrowest kind. Although it could not be said that if the appellant had learned of the complaint sooner he would not have been able better to defend himself the length of the delay and the circumstances of the case lead to no strong presumption of that kind. What his Honour told the jury must be judged accordingly. 
     
      
    29 The only potential adverse effect for the defence was the loss of memory of the detail of the events of the night. The jury must have understood that by what his Honour said. The charge was couched in the language of loss of memory of events and detail, for example -  
     
      
       
        
        Obviously his ability to (mount a case to challenge the charge) will have been compromised at least to some extent by the long delay… 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Memories fade… 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        That is probably the most significant way in which a person’s ability to contradict … will be compromised because of delay.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        There may be other reasons… you must bear in mind that that ability will have been compromised to some extent because of the delay.  
        
       
      
    30 The defence case, as put in cross-examination, was one of deliberate concoction. Nothing was put forward to suggest that the appellant might have been prejudiced through delay. In my opinion, looking overall at the passage of the summing-up complained of, what his Honour said was sufficient to bring home to the jury that this appellant, having to answer a charge after a long delay, was bound to be to some extent compromised by the fading of memory. I do not regard the use of the words “to some extent” as inhibiting the strength of the charge. It would be unrealistic to suggest that any significant delay would produce a total loss of memory, and clearly the appellant had no total loss of memory. In fact he appeared to have a good memory of the events of the evening.  
     
      
    31 Secondly, his Honour explained why the ability of the appellant to defend himself might have been compromised, namely by the fading of memory. Although his Honour suggested that there might be other reasons, the case itself suggested none.  
     
      
    32 Finally, his Honour’s direction was clear, that the jury were bound to bear in mind that such failure of memory as existed would affect the ability of the accused to defend himself.  
     
      
    33 This direction was not of the strongest kind but was, I think, adequate to the circumstances of the case, following, as it did, a strong Murray direction. I think that it must have appeared so to defence counsel, who did not ask his Honour to give any further direction or stronger direction than that now complained of. Accordingly, leave is required to appeal on this ground. In my opinion the appellant has not made out a case for a grant of leave, which should be refused.  
     
      
    34 I would dismiss the appeal.  
     
      
    35 JOHNSON J: I agree with Barr J and with the additional observations of Hunt AJA.

      2005/2353 Regina v Suman Sood 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 12 July 2006 Dr Suman Sood pleaded not guilty to all counts on an indictment containing three counts. Counts 1 and 2 were brought under s83 of the Crimes Act 1900 and charged that she unlawfully administered (Count 1) and unlawfully caused to be taken (Count 2) a drug with intent to procure miscarriage. The third count was of manslaughter of a child to whom I will refer as PP. 
     
      
    2 The trial commenced with the empanelling of a jury on 12 July 2006. Prior to that, from 3 July 2006, a number of preliminary issues were debated and determined. During the course of the trial I made a number of interlocutory rulings and decisions, on questions of evidence, procedure and other matters. It was not always possible to finalise reasons in writing for those rulings and determinations. What follows is a compendium of reasons for the various rulings made. 
     
      
    3 It is convenient to begin with an outline of the case the Crown set out to make against Dr Sood. 
     
      
       
      the Crown case 
       
      
    4 The facts alleged by the Crown are more fully set out in a judgment concerning the tender of evidence (R v Sood [2006] NSWSC 695, unreported, 10 July 2006). 
     
      
    5 The Crown case was as follows. On Saturday 18 May 2002, a young woman (LT), having learned that she was 23½ weeks pregnant, consulted Dr Sood at her clinic in Fairfield, with a view to having the pregnancy terminated. She made an appointment for LT to return on Monday 20 May 2002, at midday. On that day, Dr Sood administered to LT, vaginally, an abortifacient (prostaglandin). At the same time, she gave either one or two tablets, also prostaglandin, to LT, with advice to take them orally. She then made an appointment for LT to return to the clinic the following Tuesday for the termination to be performed. 
     
      
    6 On Dr Sood’s advice, LT waited at the clinic after having taken the tablets, for an hour or so before returning home. 
     
      
    7 That evening LT began to suffer abdominal pain. Her cousin telephoned Dr Sood who advised that she take painkillers. At about 4.00 am the following morning LT delivered a baby, into a toilet bowl. Ambulance officers were called. They retrieved the baby, who was later named PP, from the toilet bowl, but, believing that he was dead, they placed him in a plastic bag wrapped in a towel. They conveyed LT and PP to Westmead Hospital. PP was then found to be alive. He died shortly afterwards. 
     
      
    8 The Crown case with respect to the s83 counts is that both the administration, and the supply, of the abortifacients was unlawful. 
     
      
    9 Administration or supply of a drug for the purpose of procuring a miscarriage (or termination of pregnancy) is unlawful in this state unless: 
     
      
       
      (i) the person by whom the drug is administered or supplied has an honest belief that doing so is necessary to preserve the woman involved from serious danger to her life, or physical or mental health, which the continuance of the pregnancy would entail; 
       
      (ii) that that belief is based on reasonable grounds; and 
       
      (iii) that in the circumstances the danger of the termination is not out of proportion to the danger of continuing the pregnancy. 
       
      
    10 The Crown proposed to put its case on manslaughter in two alternative ways: manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act; and 
     
      
       
        
        manslaughter by gross criminal negligence. 
        
       
       
      1. pre-trial ruling 
       
      
    11 On 11 July 2006, before the jury was empanelled, but following pre-trial argument on four issues, I delivered rulings in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “RULINGS FOLLOWING ARGUMENT OF 10 JULY 2006 
         
        
       
      
    1. The Crown will be permitted, during opening, to hand to the jury a document setting out its contentions of law. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    2. For the purposes of s83 of the Crimes Act 1900 a two-stage test is prescribed. The first is a subjective test; the second an objective test: that is, a question of proportionality is to be determined by reference to a reasonable person in the position of the accused. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    3. Manslaughter: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) it is not necessary to include the word ""wickedly"" in the definition of criminal negligence; 
           
          (b) the Crown will be permitted to open to the jury a case of manslaughter by criminal negligence.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      The rulings were communicated to the legal representatives of the parties by email on that day. What follows are my reasons for so ruling. 
       
      
    12 S83 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        83 Administering drugs etc to woman with intent 
         
         
        Whosoever: 
         
         
          
          unlawfully administers to, or causes to be taken by, any woman, whether with child or not, any drug or noxious thing, or 
           
           
          unlawfully uses any instrument or other means, 
          
         
         
        with intent in any such case to procure her miscarriage, 
         
        shall be liable to imprisonment for ten years.” 
        
       
      
    13 Four issues arose for determination: they were 
     
      
    1. whether the Crown should be permitted, during opening, to provide to the jury a document setting out its contentions of law;2. the proper construction of the word “unlawfully” as it appears in s83 of the Crimes Act (which is also applicable to the offence of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act);3. whether the Crown ought to be permitted to put to the jury a case of manslaughter by criminal negligence;4. if the Crown is so permitted, the correct characterisation of negligence for the purposes of that charge. 
     
      
    14 It is convenient to deal with the issues in that sequence. 
     
      
       
      1. should the Crown, during opening, be permitted to provide to the jury its contentions of law in writing? 
       
      
    15 The Crown proposed that, during opening, it be permitted to provide to the jury, in writing, a statement of what it contended to be the relevant legal principles. A draft was circulated. 
     
      
    16 It was anticipated that some issues of considerable complexity will arise during the course of the trial. There were also some unusual aspects to the trial. To the best of my knowledge no charge under s83 of the Crimes Act has been prosecuted in this State for some decades. Nor has there been a case in which it was alleged that, by unlawful termination of pregnancy, resulting in the live birth but subsequent death of a child, the offence of manslaughter has been committed. 
     
      
    17 It may also be acknowledged that pregnancy termination is a subject on which some members of the community have strong, and even emotional, views. It is no part of the Crown’s case to suggest that pregnancy termination is necessarily unlawful. However, that may not be readily apparent to all members of the jury. 
     
      
    18 Senior counsel who appeared for the accused opposed the course proposed by the Crown. The principal reason he advanced in opposition was that such a course is unconventional and that juries are not, ordinarily, given, at that early stage of the trial, any such document. Further, when juries are given written directions, as is increasingly common, and as would almost certainly occur in this case, such directions are given by the Court, with the imprimatur and authority of the judge. For the Crown to be permitted, during opening, to hand to the jury such a document would, so the argument ran, give the Crown an unfair advantage and suggest an imbalance between the two parties in authority and standing. 
     
      
    19 It was not disputed that it is conventional for the Crown Prosecutor, in opening a trial to a jury, to outline the relevant principles of law. The purpose of this is to enable the jury better to follow the evidence and to obtain a grasp of what the relevant issues are, and the purpose for which different aspects of the evidence are adduced. More often than not the statement of law is uncontroversial. Invariably the outline is given with the rider that the statement of the law by the Crown Prosecutor is subject to directions of the Court and that the ultimate source of the law to be applied by the jury is the judge. 
     
      
    20 In this case, there has been some dispute as to the correct statement of some legal principle, and these issues will be the subject of subsequent rulings in this judgment. 
     
      
    21 Unconventionality is not, in my opinion, a sufficient reason to refuse the Crown’s application. Criminal trials are known to be more complex, and of vastly greater duration, than has been the case in past times. A great deal is demanded of juries. There can be few members of juries who are accustomed to sitting, hour after hour, day after day, listening to and absorbing information. It must be very difficult to absorb and retain the quantity of often complex information that is routinely put before juries. By their nature, juries are not legally trained, and so, it might be expected, the legal concepts, or some of them, will be new to most or all members of any jury. That is so in any criminal trial which involves any complexity of law; it is more likely to have added impact in the present trial, which has both unusual, and, to some, potentially highly emotional, aspects. 
     
      
    22 The purpose of a Crown opening is to alert the jury to the nature of the case they will be called upon to decide. That includes, necessarily, an explanation of the law that they will be required to apply, as well as an outline of the facts the Crown anticipates will emerge in its evidence. That demands of the jury a rapid absorption of both legal principles and factual matters. In many openings, and I anticipated (correctly, as it happened) that the opening in this trial would be one such, a good deal of complex factual material would be put to the jury. For example, I was told that a number of expert witnesses had been qualified and were expected to be called. 
     
      
    23 In my opinion, anything that can reasonably be done that will assist the jury to discharge its difficult function and arrive at the correct verdict is to be welcomed. 
     
      
    24 In this era of modern communications, new means have been developed to enable recipients of information better to absorb and digest that information. It is seldom that participants in conferences and seminars do not make use of written material, either on screen or by paper, to reinforce the information being communicated. That is basic educative practice. 
     
      
    25 I saw (and see) no reason why the jury should not be given the assistance of a document setting out the applicable law. It has the benefit that members of the jury will not be expected to have the law explained to them once only (at this early stage of the trial), and to attempt to recall it. The jury would be able to refer to a document from time to time. That would leave them more able to concentrate upon the outline of the evidence given in opening, and the evidence as it is adduced. 
     
      
    26 There are various functions to be performed in a criminal trial, of which opening by the Crown is the first. All functions have one common element: they should put the jury in a position to arrive at the correct verdict(s) on the evidence, according to law correctly explained and understood by them. A clear and correct statement of relevant legal principle is fundamental to the jury reaching the correct result. This is much better achieved by their being given a document accurately stating the legal principles than by orally explaining the law and hoping that some or all will obtain an accurate understanding of it and then recall it. 
     
      
    27 I, accordingly, allowed the Crown to present the jury with a written outline, making it clear that the outline contains its contentions of law, and that it is subject to any different formulation or direction by the Court. 
     
      
    28 It was suggested that, if the jury were to be given such a document, it ought to be given to them by the Court, rather than by the Crown. I have earlier outlined the reasons for this position. There is some merit in the argument. However, while there had been considerable preliminary argument in this matter, I was not certain that all contentious issues had been exposed. As then advised, I expected, in due course, to give the jury written directions which would supersede those to be drafted by the Crown for use in opening. I was (and am) firmly of the view that no disadvantage would accrue to the accused by reason of the provision to the jury of the Crown’s contentions in writing. It is, in principle, no different from the Crown orally giving an outline of what it claims to be the relevant principles of law, and of which the jury might even attempt to take a note. 
     
      
       
      2. the s83 charges: “unlawfully” 
       
      
    29 The next issue concerned the correct formulation of the law, and the directions to be given to the jury, in respect of that element of each of the s83 charges encompassed by the word “unlawfully”. This was also applicable to the element of unlawfulness in the charge of manslaughter constituted by the commission of an unlawful and dangerous act. 
     
      
    30 It has long been accepted that the concept of unlawfulness for the purposes of s83 was correctly articulated by Levine Ch. Q.S. in R v Wald (1971) 3 NSWDCR 25. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… for the operation to have been lawful in this case the accused must have had an honest belief on reasonable grounds that what they did was necessary to preserve the women involved from serious danger to their life, or physical or mental health, which the continuance of pregnancy would entail, not merely the normal dangers of pregnancy and childbirth; and that in the circumstances the danger of the operation was not out of proportion to the danger intended to be averted. The Crown of course bears the onus of establishing that the operations were unlawful.” 
        
       
       
      That case involved a trial of five medical practitioners on charges which included charges under s83 of the  
      Crimes Act. 
       At the close of the Crown case an application was made for verdicts of not guilty by direction. It was in that context that Levine Ch. Q.S. came to rule upon the meaning of “unlawfulness” under s83. The test has since been adopted in other NSW proceedings: see  
      K v Minister for Youth and Community Services 
       (1982) 1 NSWLR 311, per Helsham J;  
      CES v Superclinics (Australia) Pty Ltd 
       (1995) 38 NSWLR 47, NSWCA. 
       
      
    31 But for one thing, there was no issue in the present trial that this represents a correct statement of legal principle. However, senior counsel for the accused raised an issue which had to be determined. 
     
      
    32 In so formulating the test of unlawfulness, Levine Ch. Q.S. drew upon an earlier decision of Menhennitt J in R v Davidson [1969] VR 667. In that case an accused was charged under a Victorian statutory provision which was, for material purposes, identical to s83. During the course of the trial, in its eighth day, it became necessary for the trial judge to rule upon the meaning of “unlawfulness” in the provision there under consideration. Recourse to the text of the ruling in Davidson reveals a discrepancy between the two rulings. Both posed a test of unlawfulness that contained two distinct limbs – the first being an honest belief on reasonable grounds that the operation was necessary to preserve the patient from serious danger to life or physical or mental health; the second which may be encapsulated as a test of proportionality. The discrepancy between the two rulings is this: while the Wald ruling might fairly be read as imposing a subjective test in respect of the first limb – that is, focussing attention upon the actual belief said to have been held by the accused person – the second, of proportionality, is framed as an objective test, not incorporating the subjective belief of the accused person. That is not the case in the Davidson ruling. Menhennit J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “For the use of an instrument with intent to procure a miscarriage to be unlawful the accused must have honestly believed on reasonable grounds that the act done by him was (a) necessary to preserve the woman from a serious danger to her life or her physical or mental health (not being merely the normal dangers of pregnancy and childbirth) which the continuance of the pregnancy would entail; and (b) in the circumstances not out of proportion to the danger to be averted.” 
        
       
      
    33 His Honour immediately went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “Accordingly, to establish that the use of an instrument with intent to procure a miscarriage was unlawful, the Crown must establish either (a) that the accused did not honestly believe on reasonable grounds that the act done by him was necessarily to preserve the woman from a serious danger to her life or her physical or mental health (not being merely the normal dangers of pregnancy and childbirth) which the continuance of the pregnancy would entail; or (b) that the accused did not honestly believe on reasonable grounds that the act done by him was in the circumstances proportionate to the need to preserve the woman from a serious danger to her life or her physical or mental health (not being merely the normal dangers of pregnancy and childbirth) which the continuance of the pregnancy would entail.” 
        
       
      
    34 It will be seen that, in each passage, Menhennit J appears to have envisaged a subjective test in relation to each limb. He expressly related the question of proportionality, in two different passages, to the honest belief on reasonable grounds of the accused person. 
     
      
    35 I am of the view that too much emphasis should not be given to the different formulations. It is apparent, from each of the rulings, that the question of whether the test was to be submitted to the jury as a subjective or an objective one never arose and was never debated. Each of these rulings was given in the course of a relatively lengthy trial, after a jury had been empanelled. No doubt each judge was under some pressure to rule upon the questions committed to him without delaying the further progress of the trial or inconveniencing the jury more than was necessary. I do not believe that the different formulation in Wald was a deliberate departure from that in Davidson. 
     
      
    36 Whether the second limb should be approached as a subjective or objective test must be decided according to principle, and not solely upon the authority of either Wald or Davidson. 
     
      
    37 As Menhennit J in Davidson made clear, the question of lawfulness or unlawfulness of a relevant act depends upon the law of necessity. The administration or supply of a drug with intent to procure a miscarriage is not unlawful if the three tests are satisfied. It is authorities in relation to that principle that guide the present determination. The principle was stated in Stephen: “Digest of the Criminal Law”, first edition, chapter 3, article 43, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “An act which would otherwise be a crime may in some cases be excused if the person accused can show that it was done only in order to avoid consequences which could not otherwise be avoided, and which, if they had followed, would have inflicted upon him or upon others whom he was bound to protect inevitable and irreparable evil, that no more was done than was reasonably necessary for that purpose, and that the evil inflicted by it was not disproportionate to the evil avoided. The extent of this principle is unascertained.” 
        
       
       
      This statement does not assist in resolving the present issue. It includes no reference to any subjective belief of the person accused of the crime. However, subsequent decisions have gone further. Most specifically, in  
      R v MacKay 
       [1957] VR 560 Smith J stated the law of necessity in the following terms: 
       
       
        
        “For these reasons I accept the submission of the Crown that in cases such as the present the test laid down by the law today for determining whether the homicide is justifiable or not is a twofold test which may be stated in this form: (1) did the accused honestly believe on reasonable grounds that it was necessary to do what he did in order to prevent the conclusion of the felony or the escape of the felon; and (2) would a reasonable man in his position have considered that what he did was not out of proportion to the mischief to be prevented?” 
        
       
       
      His Honour effectively restated these propositions in relation to self-defence in  
      R v Tikos (No 1) 
       [1963] VR 285. In  
      R v Loughlan 
       [1981] VR 443 Young CJ and King J in the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria considered a defence of necessity to a charge of escaping lawful custody. Their Honours maintained the same distinction – holding that in order to establish the defence, the accused must honestly believe on reasonable grounds that he is placed in a situation of imminent peril; and that the element of proportionality means that the acts done to avoid the imminent peril must not be out of proportion to the peril to be avoided. Their Honours put the test another way as follows: 
       
       
        
        “… would a reasonable man in the position of the accused consider that he had any alternative to doing what he did to avoid the peril?” 
        
       
       
      And in  
      R v Rogers  
      (1996) 86 A Crim R 542, in the context of a conviction of attempting to escape lawful custody to which, again, a defence of necessity had been pleaded, Gleeson CJ, with whom Clarke JA and Ireland J agreed, held that the issues relevant to the defence were: 
       
       
        
        “… an accused person’s belief as to the position in which he or she is placed, and as to the reasonableness and proportionality of the response.” 
        
       
      
    38 These all clearly and carefully draw a distinction between the approach to be taken to the two limbs of the test. In my opinion the weight of authority demands that I accept the contentions of the Crown. 
     
      
    39 Further support for that is to be gained by this further consideration. 
     
      
    40 The first limb of the test concerns the (reasonably based) belief in the accused that it is necessary to do what is done for the relevant purposes. The second concerns the proportionality of what is done to the danger involved. But, if the issue in the second concerns the belief of the accused rather than the objective reality of the proportionality, nothing is added to the first test. That is, if an accused person honestly believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to do what is done, that necessarily incorporates a belief in the proportionality of that conduct. The second is entirely subsumed in the first. 
     
      
    41 That is not so if an objective test is applied to the second limb. 
     
      
    42 Accordingly, both because of authority, and because of the logic inherent in the Crown’s position, I concluded that the test of proportionality is an objective one. 
     
      
       
      3. manslaughter by criminal negligence 
       
      
    43 The elements of manslaughter by criminal negligence may be stated as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i) the accused did an act or omitted to do an act; 
       
      (ii) as a result of which the death of a person was caused; 
       
      (iii) the accused was under a duty of care to that person; 
       
      (iv) the act or omission constituted a breach of the accused’s duty of care to that person of such magnitude as to warrant being punished by a criminal justice system. 
       
      
    44 The issue which was raised concerns the third of these – whether the Crown was able to show that Dr Sood owed a duty of care to the child PP. It was, at least for the purposes of the argument, common ground that no act or omission of Dr Sood relied upon by the Crown was done or omitted after the birth and death of PP. Every act of Dr Sood upon which the Crown relied was committed prior to the birth of PP. 
     
      
    45 That does not preclude the existence of a duty of care in Dr Sood to PP. It is well established in the civil law that a duty of care may be owed to a subsequently born child. The rights of the child do not crystallise until birth, but that does not affect the existence of the duty of care: Lynch v Lynch (1991) 25 NSWLR 411; X and Y (by her tutor X) v Pal (1991) 23 NSWLR 26; CES v Superclinics (Australia) Pty Ltd (1995) 38 NSWLR 47. 
     
      
    46 The point that was raised by senior counsel for Dr Sood was this. In May 2002 Dr Sood was in a professional relationship, as a medical practitioner, with LT. Her primary duty was to LT. Indeed, at that time, her only relevant duty was to LT. She owed no duty to the foetus, which did not then have separate life. And she owed no duty to PP who, not then having been born, was not capable at that time of being owed a duty. She had agreed to terminate LT’s pregnancy. Her duty to LT, therefore, was to extinguish the life of the foetus LT was carrying. Such a duty was entirely inconsistent with any duty to PP. 
     
      
    47 Neither counsel sought with any precision to identify the content of the duty said (on behalf of the Crown) to be owed by Dr Sood to PP. I concluded that the duty was a duty to take reasonable steps to ensure that he was not born alive but in a condition that was incompatible with survival. 
     
      
    48 (In different circumstances the duty may also be a duty to ensure that a baby is not born alive, but in a damaged or disabled condition; such an approach is irrelevant in the present case because of the manner in which the Crown has framed its case.) 
     
      
    49 The argument advanced on behalf of Dr Sood could not be accepted. The cases to which I have referred above [45] make it clear that a duty to an unborn child comes into existence when that child is born alive. It is, however, a retrospective duty. If Dr Sood had discharged her duty to LT, then there would be no question of any duty to PP crystallising because he would not have been born alive. But, assuming his live birth, a duty came into existence. It was a duty of the nature I have identified. 
     
      
    50 I rejected the proposition that the Crown should not be permitted to put a case to the jury based upon criminal negligence, by reason of the absence of any duty of care owed by Dr Sood to PP. 
     
      
       
      4. the correct characterisation of negligence 
       
      
    51 This issue arose in the context of the accuracy or completeness of the written outline of the law proposed to be put before the jury by the Crown. The point was a narrow and simple one. Senior counsel for Dr Sood sought to have incorporated in the statement the concept of “wicked negligence”. This was said to derive from the decision of the High Court in The Queen v Lavender [2005] HCA 37; 218 ALR 521. There a trial judge had directed a jury that the degree of negligence required to constitute the crime of manslaughter is very high indeed, and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “It has been described in the past as having to be wicked.” 
        
       
       
      He added that a person had to be “wickedly negligent” before being convicted of the crime of manslaughter. 
       
      
    52 Senior counsel relied upon one passage in the joint reasons of Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ as supporting the proposition that the statement of the law he sought to have put before the jury was correct. However, para [58], the passage upon which he relied, is not support for that proposition. The paragraph gives reasons why a direction sought on behalf of that respondent (Lavender) would have been erroneous and inappropriate. Their Honours referred to the elements of the offence as put to the jury by the trial judge, and included the need for the prosecution to persuade the jury to the criminal standard that the conduct of the respondent was not only unreasonable, but “wickedly negligent”. 
     
      
    53 This is, in my view, descriptive of what the Crown must establish. An epithet such as “wicked” or “wickedly” may be appropriate for oral direction, and may colourfully bring home to the jury the very high test to be met by the Crown when charging manslaughter by criminal negligence. It does not follow that “wickedness” is an element of the offence in such a way as to require incorporation into any written outline of the law. I declined to require the Crown to amend its proposed outline in the way contended for on behalf of Dr Sood. 
     
      
       
      2. Evidence ruling:  
      Evidence Act 
       1995, s38 (Dr Allen) 
       
      
    54 On Friday, 21 July 2006 the Crown sought leave, under s38(1) of the Evidence Act 1995, to question, as though cross examining, a witness it had called (Dr Arthur Allen). The issues thus raised are rather more complex than is ordinarily the case. I will begin by giving some general background and outlining the relevant evidence. 
     
      
    55 Dr Allen is a medical practitioner who was employed by Dr Sood in the Fairfield practice. His principal role was to administer sedation to patients undergoing pregnancy terminations. He had no contact with LT. 
     
      
    56 One highly significant factual issue in the Crown case concerns the evidence given by LT that Dr Sood had administered to her, vaginally, prostaglandin drugs. The Crown case was that, on Monday 20 May 2002, Dr Sood administered to LT a prostaglandins drug called Cytotec. She did this vaginally. On an earlier occasion when she was questioned by the Medical Board about the events of May 2000, Dr Sood denied that she ever administered prostaglandins vaginally. In a document containing a series of what are said to be admissions (exhibit P), administered under s184 of the Evidence Act, Dr Sood is recorded as having stated (to the Medical Board) that she did not use any vaginal medications for the purpose for which prostaglandins are used; that she only gave patients oral medication; that she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have never used any vaginal preparations for terminations. If I was to give oral medication I would give two tablets of Cytotec and then one tablet hourly before the termination”, 
        
       
       
      and that she never used any vaginal prostaglandin agents during termination procedures (exhibit P, paras 30 – 32). 
       
      
    57 On 11 June 2002 Dr Allen provided a statement for the purposes of the Medical Board inquiry in relation to the subject matter of the present trial. That statement does not appear to contain anything controversial so far as the present issue is concerned. 
     
      
    58 On 27 June 2006 Dr Allen attended a conference in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (“the DPP”). The conference was recorded and extracts of the transcript were provided. The extracts were marked for identification 25. This is the document to which reference is made, without clear identification, at t733. The document records that Dr Allen was questioned about the use of drugs in the clinic. He disclaimed any personal involvement in the administration of drugs. When asked whether drugs were used vaginally he is recorded as having answered: 
     
      
       
        
        “Sometimes you use vaginally, sometimes give orally.” 
        
       
       
      He was asked: 
       
       
        
        “Generally, who inserted vaginal drugs?” 
        
       
       
      to which he replied: 
       
       
        
        “Dr Sood.” 
        
       
       
      He said he did not recall seeing her administer the drugs. When asked the source of his information that drugs were inserted vaginally he answered: 
       
       
        
        “I think Dr Sood told me.” 
        
       
       
      When asked another question about his source of knowledge about the use of prostaglandins he said: 
       
       
        
        “I would have been told, can’t be precise, I would see the notes and she would tell me she used Cytotec.” 
        
       
       
      He affirmed that Dr Sood had told him that she used Cytotec. 
       
      
    59 When called to give evidence Dr Allen was asked similar questions. The following questions and answers appear in the transcript: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Are you able to say whether tablets were administered to patients orally and/or vaginally? 
         
        A. Well, no, I was not involved in that aspect of the treatment. 
         
         
        Q. Did you discuss that with Dr Sood?  
         
        A. I can't recall it.” 
        
       
       
      Thereupon the application for leave to question as though cross examining was made. 
       
      
    60 Eventually Dr Allen was cross examined on the voir dire. The subject matter of the cross examination included the answers he had given when questioned in conference. 
     
      
    61 When expressly asked if Cytotec was a drug used in the clinic from time to time, Dr Allen replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well, I had no specific recall of that.” 
        
       
       
      He said that he knew Cytotec “would be used” in the practice because it is a drug that is presently used in the clinic in its present operation (which is not under the control of Dr Sood). He denied any specific recollection of being told by Dr Sood that Cytotec had been used by her. When pressed about the question asked in conference in which he affirmed that Dr Sood had told him that she used Cytotec, he firstly denied any recollection of the question, and then said: 
       
       
        
        “Well, I may have said that. I don't know that it was the truth.” 
        
       
       
      He said that he could not recall if it were the truth. He maintained, on a number of occasions, that he had no recollection or no “clear memory” of the use of the drug. 
       
      
    62 He explained his answer that drugs were sometimes administered vaginally, sometimes orally, as intended to be a reference to general practice, not specifically related to the practice of Dr Sood. He was asked about the question: 
     
      
       
        
        “Generally, who inserted vaginal drugs?” 
        
       
       
      in response to which he had named Dr Sood. Of this question and answer he said: 
       
       
        
        “Well, generally, who inserted vaginal drugs would have been the doctor who was going to do the procedure.” 
        
       
       
      He said he did not know why, in answer to the question in conference he had identified Dr Sood as the person who so administered the drugs. He said he did not specifically recall any cases where she had done so. 
       
      
    63 In answer to a further question, he said that there were no doctors in the practice, other than Dr Sood, performing terminations. 
     
      
    64 Dr Allen was subjected to what could only be called a friendly cross examination by senior counsel for Dr Sood. He maintained that he did not have any relevant recollections. 
     
      
    65 S38(1) is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
         “ 
        38 Unfavourable witnesses 
         
         
        (1) A party who called a witness may, with the leave of the court, question the witness, as though the party were cross-examining the witness, about: 
         
          
          (a) evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party, or 
           
          (b) a matter of which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge and about which it appears to the court the witness is not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence, or 
           
          (c) whether the witness has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent statement.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    66 S38(1) thus provides three distinct gateways to the grant of leave under the sub-section. The same gateways identify the subject matter about which the witness is permitted to be so questioned. However, the scope of questioning is not to be unduly confined. The questioning is not required to be specifically directed to the subject matter that triggers the grant of leave, but extends to questioning directed to establishing the probability of the factual state of affairs in relation to that subject matter contended for by the party conducting the questioning, or the improbability of the witness’s evidence on that subject. It also extends to questioning relevant to the witness’s credibility in relation to that subject matter: R v Le [2002] NSWCCA 186; 54 NSWLR 474 at [67] per Heydon JA (as his Honour then was) with whom Dunford and Buddin JJ agreed. 
     
      
    67 I am satisfied that each of the three gates has, in the present circumstances, been unlocked. The evidence given by Dr Allen was, in material respects, unfavourable to the Crown in that it failed to acknowledge that vaginal administration of prostaglandin drugs had taken place at the clinic; and the cross examination on the voir dire from MFI 25 shows that Dr Allen had made a prior inconsistent statement. Of most significance, it appeared to me that Dr Allen had not, in examination in chief, made a genuine attempt to give evidence on a matter of which he may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge. In reaching this view, I took into account both the answers given by him to questions asked in his evidence in chief, and the answers given by him in cross examination on the voir dire. 
     
      
    68 Unlocking the gate, however, is not necessarily conclusive that leave ought to be given. It is necessary that the evidence sought to be adduced by s38(1) questioning is relevant: Evidence Act, s56. It is also necessary to take into account each of the matters specified in s192(2); and to apply the tests contained in ss135 and, more particularly, 137. 
     
      
    69 It became necessary to identify with some precision the basis upon which the Crown sought to rely upon any evidence it anticipated would be adduced from Dr Allen in the proposed cross examination. Senior counsel for the Crown said, in the first instance, that the evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “…would be admissible to prove it more likely that this doctor inserted a tablet vaginally.” 
         
        
       
      When it was put to him that this was a tendency purpose, he replied: 
       
       
        
        “It's admissible on two bases: Firstly, it's admissible to prove a lie told by the accused in paragraphs 30 to 32 of the admissions.” 
        
       
      
    70 He maintained that it was open to the Crown to prove, by admissible evidence, that, on another occasion, Dr Sood had told a lie, and that this was relevant to the assessment of her credibility. The lie was that she did not (as a matter of practice) ever administer prostaglandin drugs vaginally. Alternatively, he sought to rely upon the lie allegedly told in the Medical Board as evidence of consciousness of guilt: see Edwards v The Queen [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193. This was a departure from the position previously adopted by the Crown. 
     
      
    71 In a previous judgment concerning the admissibility of evidence in this trial (R v Sood [2006] NSWSC 695, 10 July 2006), I dealt with the very same proposition in relation to evidence that Dr Sood had told the Medical Board that she did not carry out pregnancy terminations on patients whose pregnancy exceeded 20 weeks. I there held that it was not open to the Crown so to impugn the credibility of any person except when that person is a witness in the proceedings. I see no reason to change the view there expressed. 
     
      
    72 It is true that there have been instances where the credibility of an accused person has been challenged by reference to out of court statements made by that person, the statements said to be false. One such case is R v Villa [2005] NSWCCA 4, a decision to which I was a party. There the issue concerned directions given to a jury in respect of lies allegedly told by the appellant.  
     
      
    73 Within a short time of the events the subject of the trial, the appellant, who was not then a suspect but was considered a potential witness, gave a number of accounts of his movements and observations at around the time of the offences. Some of these accounts were given to police, others to acquaintances. There were significant discrepancies and inconsistencies in these accounts. The appellant did not give evidence in the trial, but, as the judgment shows ([36]), he relied upon what he had told police in a recorded interview that had been conducted when he was regarded as a potential witness. The Crown sought to rely upon certain of the content of his various statements as lies evidencing a consciousness of guilt, in accordance with Edwards. The trial judge ruled against that, but did allow the prosecution to rely on, as relevant to his credibility, inconsistencies in the various versions he had given. 
     
      
    74 It is not entirely clear from the judgment on what basis the record of the interview was admitted in the trial. It does seem that there were parts of the recorded interview that did, properly, constitute admissions for the purposes of s81 of the Evidence Act. In any event, it seems clear that there was no issue about the admissibility of the record of the interview. What was there at issue, then, was the use that could be made of the alleged lies and inconsistencies contained in a document which was uncontroversially otherwise before the jury. The evidence of alleged lies was not tendered for the purpose of challenging the credibility of the accused at a time when he had not given evidence. As it happened, he never did give evidence. 
     
      
    75 The basis on which exculpatory statements, made out of court, by an accused person may be admitted was extensively canvassed by Grove J in R v Rymer [2005] NSWCCA 310; 156 A Crim R 84, a decision upon which the Crown relied. Such statements are, as hearsay statements, by s59 of the Evidence Act, not admissible unless they come within one of the exceptions provided for in the succeeding sections. Unless made at a time when the events the subject of the statements were fresh in the memory in the sense explained by the High Court in Graham v The Queen [1998] HCA 61; 195 CLR 606, they are not admissible either in the Crown case, or in support of a defence case. However, as the history traced by Grove J shows, they have traditionally been admitted out of fairness to the accused person, and that tradition does not appear to have altered (in practice) following the enactment of the Evidence Act, even though the basis of admissibility of the statements may be more questionable since that enactment. 
     
      
    76 The facts of Rymer were not complex (although the judgment has its complexities). There the accused person had made exculpatory statements when questioned about the events the subject of the charges. Contrary to the usual practice the Crown declined to tender those statements as part of the Crown case. It was in those circumstances that Grove J traced the history of the practice of admitting evidence of statements made by an accused person when first questioned, to which I have already referred. 
     
      
    77 The trial judge had ruled that the statements were admissible, under s66 of the Evidence Act, but only in the event that the accused gave evidence. This was held on appeal to have been incorrect. As a result of the ruling, and in order to secure the admission of the statements, the accused made a decision to give evidence. This, on appeal, was said to have been brought about as a result of the incorrect ruling by the trial judge. 
     
      
    78 The Court of Criminal Appeal, constituted by Grove, Barr and Latham JJ held that, by reason of the timing of the making of the statements, they were not admissible under s66 of the Evidence Act. Their Honours held, however, that the statements were admissible under s60, which provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        60 Exception: evidence relevant for a non-hearsay purpose 
         
         
        The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is admitted because it is relevant for a purpose other than proof of the fact intended to be asserted by the representation.” 
        
       
      
    79 The Court held that the statements had “dual relevance” – denial of facts alleged against the accused, and the credibility of the accused. Credibility was an issue, the Court said, because, in a criminal trial: 
     
      
       
        
        … the credibility of an accused is put in issue in a unique sense … as a consequence of the plea of not guilty”. 
        
       
      
    80 Rymer was a case decided on its own particular facts. It is not, in my opinion, authority for the proposition that, in a criminal trial, the Crown is able to call evidence in its case in chief to challenge the credibility (in general) of the accused. Indeed, Grove J expressly recognised this. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “62 I am conscious that the concept that the statement in response to allegation is germane to the credibility of an implied assertion of innocence in a plea of not guilty involves a very liberal construction of the scope of s 60. I consider that construction should be so extended in congruity with principles applicable where criminal liability is sought to be affixed. There should be a recognition of the attributes of modern technology and, in particular, a video record provides a rational resource from which credibility assessment might be made. Further, I would be reluctant to determine that the statutory construct had extinguished the availability of a common practice in the conduct of criminal trials in this State in the absence of express statutory indication that that was the intention of the legislature.” 
        
       
      
    81 The circumstances of the present case vary substantially from those of Rymer. I did not accept that, through the evidence of Dr Allen, the Crown could establish that Dr Sood lacked credibility. It could not establish that she was untruthful in the account that she gave to the Medical Board, unless it sought to do so by establishing that any untruthfulness came about as a result of consciousness of guilt (see Edwards), and the Crown evidence came within the established principles which permit such evidence to be adduced. Initially the Crown had expressly disclaimed reliance upon that principle. 
     
      
    82 However, there is a distinction between evidence going to the credibility of an accused person (who is not, at that stage, a witness, and who may never be a witness) and evidence going to the accuracy of an account of relevant facts asserted by that accused on a previous occasion and to be relied upon by the accused person in the trial as representing his or her response to the prosecution allegations. At the stage of the proceedings at which this issue arose, the response made by Dr Sood to the Crown allegations was to be derived from what she had told the Medical Board, as recorded in Exhibit P. It was known that she proposed to rely upon that account as her explanation for the relevant events, and as her response to the Crown case. This was so whether or not she gave oral evidence, something that was not known at the time the ruling was to be made. 
     
      
    83 The evidence Dr Allen could give was relevant, not to the credibility of Dr Sood, which becomes an issue only if she becomes a witness, but as to the facts asserted by her. There is, as I have noted above, a distinction. 
     
      
    84 For that reason I considered it appropriate to permit the Crown to cross examine Dr Allen and ruled accordingly. 
     
      
       
      3. Evidence ruling:  
      Evidence Act 
       1995, s38 (Ms Zoretic) 
       
      
    85 Ms Minna Zoretic has given evidence in the Crown case. Ms Zoretic is a nurse who, in 2000, was employed in Dr Sood’s clinic at Fairfield. Her principal role was to undertake counselling of patients (presumably those patients who consulted Dr Sood for the purposes of a termination of pregnancy), but she performed other duties from time to time. She was working at the clinic on Saturday 18 May 2002. Her evidence was that Dr Sood asked her to counsel LT. She gave an account of her dealings with LT. She identified LT as the person whom she had seen that day because LT was of Islander appearance.  
     
      
    86 In several respects Ms Zoretic’s account of the counselling and its surrounding circumstances was said to have differed from the account given by LT. 
     
      
    87 Because of the significant departure in Ms Zoretic’s evidence from the account given by LT, the Crown sought, pursuant to s38 of the Evidence Act 1995, leave to question her as though cross examining. 
     
      
    88 By subs(6) of s38, in considering whether or not to give leave under subs(1), the court is required to take into account: 
     
      
       
      (a) whether the party seeking the leave gave notice at the earliest opportunity of the intention to do so; and  
       
      (b) the matters on which, or the extent to which, the witness has been, or is likely to be, questioned by another party. 
       
      
    89 Neither of the s38(6) matters is presently material. A more comprehensive list of matters to be taken into account is contained in s192(2). I will return to s192(2). 
     
      
    90 S38(1) is somewhat confined in its operation. It does not permit cross examination at large. It permits, where leave is granted, questioning in the nature of cross examination about three specific subject matters: 
     
      
      (a) evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party who calls the witness and seeks leave; 
       
      (b) any matter about which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge, and about which it appears to the court the witness is not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence; or 
       
      (c) any prior inconsistent statement made by the witness. 
       
      
    91 Despite some confinement of the subject matters opened up by s38(1), the subsection is to be given a reasonably liberal scope. The permitted questioning may extend to questions directed to the factual states of affairs relevant to those subject matters: R v Le [2002] NSWCCA 186; 54 NSWLR 474. 
     
      
    92 Each identified subject matter is, in effect, a trigger which permits the grant of leave, provided the subs(6) or s192(2) considerations do not mandate otherwise. 
     
      
    93 Only the first trigger is here relevant. The Crown contends that the evidence given by Ms Zoretic was unfavourable to it because, in the respects mentioned, it contradicted or was at variance from, evidence mentioned below. Ms Zoretic’s evidence was, therefore, capable of casting doubt upon the credibility or reliability of LT on those matters. A necessary consequence was that Ms Zoretic’s evidence was capable of casting doubt more generally upon LT’s credibility or reliability. 
     
      
    94 The areas on which Ms Zoretic’s evidence varied from LT’s are not necessarily matters of central or fundamental importance to the Crown case. However, any evidence that impacts upon LT’s credibility or reliability is of considerable significance in the overall proceedings. 
     
      
    95 The evidence given by Ms Zoretic relevant to this application is outlined below. She said: 
     
      
       
      (i) that when LT attended the clinic on Saturday 18 May she was accompanied by two other people – a young female (also of Islander appearance) and a younger male, not of Islander appearance; 
       
      (ii) that LT did not know (or said she did not know) the duration of her pregnancy, but that she said that it (the pregnancy) was “further on”; 
       
      (iii) that LT did not have an ultrasound report with her. 
       
      
    96 From a statement made by Ms Zoretic it was also known that she would give evidence that the three people she said were present were behaving, in her view, inappropriately, in that they were giggling and laughing. This evidence had not been given by her at the time the s38 application was made. 
     
      
    97 The evidence itemised as (i) is in direct conflict with evidence given by LT. LT was adamant that, although she had attended on the date in question with her cousin, who is a female of Islander appearance, there was no male present. As I have previously recorded, she conceded that she had given evidence to that effect in committal proceedings, but maintained, in the trial, that she had then been in error. This evidence was, therefore, clearly unfavourable to the Crown. 
     
      
    98 The evidence of LT concerning the ultrasound (item (iii)) was not in direct conflict with that given by Ms Zoretic. LT’s evidence was that she attended the clinic on the Saturday, provided some information in writing to a receptionist and was then seen by Dr Sood. She gave the ultrasound report to Dr Sood. After having seen Dr Sood she was seen by one of the nurses who asked her to go through a risk list. She did not at any time expressly say that she showed the nurse the ultrasound report or in any way referred to it. In the circumstances, I did not regard this evidence as inconsistent with that of LT or as unfavourable to the Crown. 
     
      
    99 As to the evidence of Ms Zoretic mentioned in item (ii), the position is somewhat different. LT gave evidence that, from the time she had the ultrasound, she was aware of the duration of the pregnancy. From this, it seems, during the course of argument on the s38 application, all involved assumed that she had (or would have) told Ms Zoretic, and that, therefore, the evidence given by Ms Zoretic was in direct conflict with that of LT on this issue. On that basis the evidence of Ms Zoretic was unfavourable to the Crown. In fact, in preparation for these reasons, subsequent to ruling, I had recourse to the transcript. In cross examination (t345) LT said that she had told the nurse that she did not know the duration of the pregnancy. But three questions later she replied negatively to the same proposition. Appreciation of the equivocal nature of LT’s evidence on this issue casts the evidence of Ms Zoretic in a different light. I was not referred to LT’s evidence during the course of argument. I do not now regard this evidence as unfavourable to the Crown. 
     
      
    100 At the conclusion of the argument I gave leave under s78. At the request of senior counsel for Dr Sood, I identified the subject matters as to which the leave related as those identified by the Crown the previous day. 
     
      
    101 In doing so, I had in mind the factors required by s192(2) to be taken into account. Put briefly, I considered it unlikely that a grant of leave would add unduly to the length of the trial (or, indeed, to shorten it) (s192(2)(a)); I thought no unfairness either to Dr Sood or to any witness, including Ms Zoretic, was likely to be occasioned (s192(2)(b)); I was conscious of the nature of the proceedings, a criminal trial of serious charges (s192(2)(d)); and no question of adjournment or alternative orders or directions arose (s192(2)(e)). That left for consideration the importance of the evidence (s192(2)(c)). 
     
      
    102 As I made plain, repeatedly, during argument, the issue of whether or not “a boy” had been present struck me as being of no importance whatsoever. But the issue was pursued with vigour, determination and persistence. It showed signs of being put to the jury as a most significant factor in its evaluation of the reliability of the testimony of LT. It was principally for that reason that I granted leave. 
     
      
    103 A further factual issue concerns Ms Zoretic’s evidence, given later, that the three persons whom she said were in the room together were laughing and giggling. LT denied that this was so. She said that it was not something to giggle about. This falls into the same category as the matter with which I have just dealt. 
     
      
       
       
      4. Evidence ruling: exclusion of evidence already given (Ms Chodat) 
       
      
    104 Ms Joan Chodat was a witness called by the prosecution. Ms Chodat was employed at Dr Sood’s clinic as a receptionist. She was on duty on Wednesday 22 May 2002 when NSW Police, led by Detective Clive Ainley, attended and presented her with a search warrant, which they intended then to execute. Ms Chodat telephoned Dr Sood, who returned to the clinic, arriving shortly thereafter. Detective Ainley explained to Dr Sood the purpose of the presence of the police. Police proceeded to execute the search warrant. The procedure was recorded on videotape. So much is uncontroversial. 
     
      
    105 Indeed, the bulk of Ms Chodat’s evidence was uncontroversial (although, as it was, in a number of respects, inconsistent with the evidence of other witnesses, both parties disclaimed significant reliance upon it). However, some parts of it are far from uncontroversial. Ms Chodat said that when Dr Sood arrived at the clinic Detective Ainley explained that the search warrant “was in relation to the birth of a baby that had died”. Ms Chodat said that Dr Sood was very surprised at the presence of the police and that: 
     
      
       
        
        “She came behind the reception desk and said she’d done something silly.” 
        
       
       
      Dr Sood did not further explain and Ms Chodat did not ask for a further explanation. 
       
      
    106 No objection was taken to this evidence when it was given. Senior counsel for Dr Sood cross examined Ms Chodat. He had Ms Chodat confirm her evidence that the remark was made as the two women stood behind the reception desk. He elicited from her that this evidence did not appear in a statement that she had made to police. Of this Ms Chodat said that she had told police; it was not her decision that it not be included in the statement, and that she had not drawn the omission to the attention of the officer taking the statement. Senior counsel put directly to Ms Chodat that no such thing had been said and that if she believed it had, her belief was mistaken. She maintained that it had been said and that she was not mistaken. 
     
      
    107 This evidence was given on 18 July 2006, the fifth day of evidence. On the following morning senior counsel for Dr Sood applied to have the evidence (that Dr Sood had said that she had done something silly) excluded, and for a direction that the jury disregard it. Two bases for the application were advanced. Firstly, it was submitted that the evidence was not relevant; secondly, that if it were relevant, it ought to be excluded under s137 of the Evidence Act, as evidence the probative value of which is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to Dr Sood. 
     
      
    108 In support of the relevance objection, senior counsel argued that the evidence would permit a conclusion that, even before police officers had announced the purpose of their search, Dr Sood had made the comment without any factual foundation for an inference that the “something silly” had anything to do with the subject matter of the charges she now faces. It was put that the comment could have an unwarranted significance. It was also put that the comment was potentially ambiguous. 
     
      
    109 Senior counsel then raised another consideration, material to the s137 argument. This was based upon facts known to me by reason of other proceedings. In 2001 Dr Sood was charged with a very large number of offences under the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), of dishonestly obtaining financial benefit by deception. Senior counsel therefore argued that the admission of the evidence of Ms Chodat put Dr Sood in a difficult position. If the remark had been made, on the material facts being known, it could not easily be concluded that “the silly thing” to which Dr Sood was referring was to do with the termination of LT’s pregnancy; it was equally possible, and even likely, that she was referring to something to do with the subject matter of the Commonwealth charges. Senior counsel stated that a search warrant in relation to those charges had earlier been executed. But clarification – that in making the remark Dr Sood might have had in mind the facts giving rise to the Commonwealth charges – would necessarily have involved Dr Sood in disclosing that she faced another completely unrelated set of criminal charges. That was the unfairness said to activate s135 or s137. 
     
      
    110 I considered an analogous issue in R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52. There the evidence under consideration was evidence of flight which is, generally, subject to the same principles as evidence of lies suggestive of a consciousness of guilt. The appellant in that case was able to give an explanation for his flight, which was not indicative of a consciousness of guilt of the offence with which he was charged, but would have forced him to reveal the commission of other offences of a similar nature to those he then faced. With the concurrence of Ipp JA and Adams J, I held that, in those circumstances, application of s137 dictated the exclusion of the evidence. 
     
      
    111 At the time this second argument was advanced, as I then said, I regarded it as considerably more powerful than those earlier advanced. I considered that insufficient information concerning, for example, the timing of the events surrounding the Commonwealth charges was known. The issue was deferred. Senior counsel provided a chronology of relevant events and some correspondence. 
     
      
    112 The argument resumed on the afternoon of 28 July 2006. In the meantime, the progress of the trial brought to light other material that impacted upon the determination. 
     
      
    113 Evidence was given by Detective Ainley of the execution of the search warrant. The evidence included a videotape of the search. (A transcript of the conversation accompanying the execution of the search warrant was also tendered and became Exhibit N.) 
     
      
    114 What emerged from this evidence was that the video clearly shows, at an early stage, that Detective Ainley identified with precision the reason for the search warrant, and the subject matter of the investigation – the death of a child, and the medical treatment given by Dr Sood to LT. The video showed Dr Sood moving behind the reception desk, where Ms Chodat was standing. By the time she did this the purpose of the search had been mentioned on a number of occasions. Any proposition that, if Dr Sood had said to Ms Chodat that she had done something silly, she had been referring to matters concerning the Commonwealth charges, evaporated. By the time she moved behind the desk (when, on Ms Chodat’s evidence, she made the remark) she was well aware that her involvement with LT was the matter under investigation. 
     
      
    115 There was no evidence put forward (in a voir dire, as happened in Cook) that, in order to explain the remark, Dr Sood would be forced to a position as a result of which the jury would be aware of the Commonwealth charges. Indeed she could not do so – the cross examination of Ms Chodat signified that Dr Sood has adopted the position that she did not say anything of the sort. She could hardly then have sought to explain the remark by saying that she believed that the police were investigating the Commonwealth charges, and that was what she had in mind. 
     
      
    116 Accordingly, I saw no unfair prejudice to Dr Sood in the admission of the evidence and determined that it would not be excluded. 
     
      
       
      5. Ruling on evidence: evidence of Dr Buist as to whether PP was born alive 
       
      
    117 An essential element of the Crown case on manslaughter, whether by unlawful and dangerous act or criminal negligence, is that PP was born alive. That was a matter of real contention. On 1 August 2006 senior counsel for Dr Sood made an application for the retrospective exclusion of certain evidence given by one of the medical practitioners. 
     
      
    118 The witness was Dr Robert Buist. Dr Buist is a gynaecologist and obstetrician. His evidence was principally directed to the cause of the birth and death of PP, and to the proper practice of pregnancy terminations. 
     
      
    119 However, Dr Buist also gave some evidence on the subject of whether PP was born alive. It was this evidence that senior counsel sought to have retrospectively excluded, as being outside Dr Buist’s expertise, and therefore as not meeting the tests of opinion evidence imposed by s79 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    120 Examination of Dr Buist’s evidence suggested to me that his evidence that PP was born alive was not initially part of his provided opinion. At a late stage in his examination in chief, in answer to a question on a different subject, Dr Buist said: 
     
      
       
        
        “…and I would say that the fact that this baby was born alive was consistent with … ” 
        
       
      
    121 This was taken up by Senior counsel for the Crown, who put a number of factual assumptions to Dr Buist and asked if, in Dr Buist’s view, PP was born alive. Dr Buist answered affirmatively. 
     
      
    122 Senior counsel for Dr Sood also took up the issue in cross examination. 
     
      
    123 Dr Buist expressed significant reluctance to be drawn on the issue. He said that he was not qualified to answer the question; that a neonatologist or paediatrician had the appropriate expertise. He maintained this throughout the questioning. That being the case, even though the evidence had already been given, I considered that the application made on behalf of Dr Sood was well made. I ordered that the evidence be excised from the transcript. 
     
      
       
      6. Ruling on evidence:  
      Evidence Act 
        
      1995 
       s138: evidence of Dr Peat 
       
      
    124 The Crown proposed to call Dr Brian Peat, a specialist obstetrician /gynaecologist who practices in South Australia. The Crown served upon Dr Sood’s legal advisors, pursuant to s177 of the Evidence Act 1995, an expert report, on the basis of which it intended to adduce oral evidence from Dr Peat. 
     
      
    125 It was common ground that the report was prepared by Dr Peat at the request of the NSW Health Care Complaints Commission (“the HCCC”), pursuant to s30 of the Health Care Complaints Act 1993 (“the HCC Act”), for the purpose of proceedings involving a complaint by the Medical Board against Dr Sood in the Medical Tribunal. 
     
      
    126 In the report Dr Peat expressed opinions as to various aspects of the medical services said to have been provided by Dr Sood to LT. For the purposes of preparing his report, Dr Peat was provided with a folder of material. What was contained in the folder has not been identified, and was not identified in the report. 
     
      
    127 S30 of the HCC Act relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) In investigating a complaint, the Commission may obtain a report from a person (including a person registered under a health registration Act) who, in the opinion of the Commission, is sufficiently qualified or experienced to give expert advice on the matter the subject of the complaint. 
         
        … 
         
        (4) Such a report may be used in disciplinary or related proceedings under a health registration Act but  
        may not be admitted or used in any other proceedings before a court 
        , tribunal or body,  
        except with the consent of the person giving the report 
        , the complainant  
        and the person against whom the complaint is made 
        . 
         
         
        (5) A person from whom such a report is obtained, the Commission or the Commissioner may not be compelled to produce the report or to give evidence in relation to the report or its contents in any such other proceedings.  
        
       
       
        
        …” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    128 Dr Sood is the person against whom the complaint was made (see subs(4)). She did not consent to the use of the report in these proceedings. 
     
      
    129 The Crown did not intend to tender the report or to seek to have it admitted into evidence, but rather, to adduce evidence from Dr Peat in accordance with its contents. Senior counsel for Dr Sood contended, therefore, that the report may not be used, even in the limited way proposed by the Crown. Senior counsel for the Crown argued to the contrary. He proposed that “used in … proceedings” means used in a formal sense, by production or tender. That raised for determination the question of what is meant by the phrase “used in … proceedings before a court …” in subs(4). 
     
      
    130 As I have mentioned, the report was served on Dr Sood’s legal practitioners. This was done pursuant to the Crown’s duty of disclosure, as signalling its intention to adduce evidence to the effect of the opinions expressed in the report. In my opinion, that of itself comes within the expression “used in … proceedings before a court”. 
     
      
    131 The further use proposed to be made of the report also comes within that phrase. That is, the Crown Prosecutor proposed to examine Dr Peat by reference to the contents of the report. Whether he were to do this with the report available to him, or from his memory of the contents of the report, does not, in my opinion, matter. In my opinion, so to question Dr Peat is prohibited by s30. 
     
      
    132 The argument was, however, potentially an arid one. It was accepted on behalf of Dr Sood that, if Dr Peat were willing to do so, he could be invited to prepare a second report, not for the purposes of the HCC Act, but at the request of the DPP. There is no bar to Dr Peat having access, for that purpose, to the same material as he used in preparing his report for the HCCC. There can be no barrier (by reason of anything contained in s30) to the use of such a report. 
     
      
    133 Senior counsel for Dr Sood urged that, when regard is had to the purposes of s30(4) and (5), the evidence should not be admitted. That purpose, he argued, was to permit suitably qualified experts to give advice to the HCCC in a way that limited the use that could be made of it. The consent of the author of the report, the complainant and the person against whom the complaint is made is required before it can be used in other proceedings. In other words, each of those persons may veto the further use of any report provided under s30. So much is correct. However, the section does not preclude the author of a report voluntarily participating further in relation to the same subject matter. 
     
      
    134 Nevertheless, s30(4) is clear in its terms and provides no discretionary avenue to the admission of the evidence, even where the prohibition may easily (and without any impropriety or unfairness) be circumvented. I so ruled, and allowed the Crown the opportunity of obtaining its own, separate, report from Dr Peat. This is what ultimately happened. 
     
      
    135 Senior counsel for Dr Sood then argued that such an exercise would be fruitless, because any evidence so obtained would have been obtained in contravention of an Australian law, and that the evidence ought, therefore, be excluded under s138 of the Evidence Act. S138 relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Evidence that was obtained: 
         
          
           
          (a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or 
           
          (b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law, 
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained. 
          
         
         
        (2) ... 
         
         
        (3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account: 
         
          
          (a) the probative value of the evidence, and 
           
          (b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and 
           
          (c) the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and 
           
          (d) the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and 
           
          (e) whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and 
           
          (f) whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and 
           
          (g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and 
           
          (h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    136 The contravention of law asserted was an alleged breach of s99A of the HCC Act. That section creates an offence of improper disclosure of information obtained in the exercise of functions under that Act. It may be accepted that preparation of a report for the purpose of s30 involves the exercise of such a function. S99A provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “99A Offence: improper disclosure of information 
         
         
          
          If a person discloses information obtained in exercising a function under this Act and the disclosure is not made: 
          
         
         
          
          (a) with the consent of the person to whom the information relates, or 
           
          (b) in connection with the execution and administration of this Act, or 
           
          (c) for the purposes of any legal proceedings arising out of this Act or of any report of any such proceedings, or 
           
          (d) with other lawful excuse, 
          
         
         
          
          the person is guilty of an offence. 
          
         
         
          
          Maximum penalty: 10 penalty units or imprisonment for 6 months, or both.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    137 On behalf of Dr Sood it was claimed that, in providing his report to the DPP, Dr Peat had (admittedly unwittingly) committed an offence against s99A. The evidence thus obtained by the DPP was obtained in contravention of an Australian law. 
     
      
    138 To establish the relevant facts Dr Peat gave evidence on the voir dire. A copy of the report was an exhibit on the voir dire. The evidence was to the following effect. 
     
      
    139 In order to prepare his report Dr Peat was provided, by the HCCC, with a folder of material. When he completed his report, Dr Peat returned all the material to the HCCC, including his letter of instructions. He retained a copy of the report. 
     
      
    140 Dr Peat was approached by Detective Ainley, the NSW police officer investigating the present matters. He could not recall whether he provided a copy of the report to Detective Ainley, or whether Detective Ainley already had a copy. 
     
      
    141 It was accepted that the report had in fact been produced to this Court in response to a subpoena issued at the instance of the DPP, but it was not clear by whom it was produced. In any event, it may well have been the case that Detective Ainley had obtained a copy of the report from sources other than Doctor Peat. 
     
      
    142 It was thus never clearly established that Dr Peat had provided the report to NSW police. Thus I am unable to conclude that there has been a breach of s99A constituted by Dr Peat’s giving the report to Detective Ainley. 
     
      
    143 It was also clear, on the evidence, that Dr Peat had had some discussions with, and given some information to, the Crown prosecuting legal team. I am prepared to infer that, in so doing, Dr Peat discussed the opinions expressed in his report. There was no direct evidence that Dr Peat had provided any other information to those individuals. That raised the question whether, in disclosing the contents of his report, Dr Peat could be said to have “disclose[d] information obtained in exercising a function under …” the HCC Act. 
     
      
    144 The purpose for which the report was prepared must be borne in mind. That was for the use of the Medical Tribunal consequent upon a complaint made against Dr Sood by the NSW Medical Board. Dr Peat did not anywhere set out a statement of the facts upon which he relied, or the assumptions which he made or on which his opinion was based, except as will appear below. He did not recount any of the factual matters previously contained in the folder of material he had been given. It appears clear that his report was written on the basis that the material that had been made available to him would also be available to the Medical Tribunal and did not require restatement. Accordingly, subject to what follows, there is little or nothing in the report that clearly discloses the information obtained by him in exercising his function under the HCC Act. There are, however, references, incidentally, to such information. For example, Dr Peat expressed the view that Dr Sood did not have an established network with local hospitals against the possibility of preterm delivery. He made reference to the version given by LT (to whom he referred by name), but did not extract anything from that version. Instead, simply by referring to “Ms T …’s version” he proceeded to express a series of opinions. The only specific reference made to LT’s account was: 
     
      
       
        
        “She was told to ring a certain number if ‘anything went wrong’.” 
        
       
       
      He also referred to advice given to her to take some pain relief. 
       
      
    145 It is plain enough that the report is based upon much more comprehensive information provided to Dr Peat, but that information is only peripherally disclosed in the report. By far the most significant single fact revealed by the report, which must have been obtained by Dr Peat in exercising his function under the HCC Act, was the identity of LT. 
     
      
    146 Accordingly, there is some ground for concluding that, in discussing the contents of the report with the DPP, Dr Peat was in breach of s99A. 
     
      
    147 However, it does not follow from that that the evidence was obtained (by the DPP) in contravention of an Australian law, or as a consequence of a contravention of an Australian law. Specifically, it does not follow from the fact (assuming it to be the fact) that Dr Peat committed a breach of s99A, that the material subsequently in the possession of the DPP was obtained as a consequence of that breach: the two (i.e. a breach of s99A, and possession by the DPP of information contained in the report) may coexist, without a causal connection. It was made plain that the report (or a copy thereof) was produced to this Court in response to a subpoena (probably served upon the Medical Board, the Medical Tribunal, or the HCCC), and access to it was granted to the DPP. Indeed, it is a fair inference that the DPP became aware of Dr Peat as a result of having access to the material produced in response to subpoena(e), including Dr Peat’s report. If that were the case, the Crown obtained the evidence by means other than as a consequence of any contravention by Dr Peat of s99A. 
     
      
    148 It is true that s30(5) of the HCC Act relieves the HCCC of any obligation to produce such a report, under compulsion, in any proceedings other than those for which the report was prepared. However, subs(5) does not prohibit the HCCC from producing such a report. It merely protects it against compulsion to produce. Accordingly, production of the report under subpoena cannot be said to have constituted any impropriety or contravention of an Australian law. 
     
      
    149 Finally, the test provided by s138(1) balances the desirability of admitting the evidence against the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence in question was obtained. Subs(3) prescribes, non exhaustively, the matters a court is required to take into account in making that judgment. Even if it could be said that the DPP had obtained the report in, or in consequence of, contravention of s99A, the factors set out in subs(3) of s138 favour the admission of the evidence. So far as I could evaluate from the report, the opinions to be expressed by Dr Peat have significant probative value (subs(3)(a)); any such contravention was (it was conceded) neither deliberate nor reckless, but inadvertent (subs(3)(b)); I could not categorise the contravention as grave (subs(3)(d)); and the offences for which Dr Sood is on trial are serious (subs(3)(c)). 
     
      
    150 Given that other medical practitioners have given, and are expected to give, evidence, it is difficult to evaluate the importance of Dr Peat’s evidence and I regard this factor as neutral (subs(3)(b)). Subs(3)(f) is irrelevant. I would consider it extremely unlikely that any other proceeding is likely to be taken in relation to any contravention (subs(3)(g)). 
     
      
    151 The final matter concerns subs(3)(h). It was accepted that the evidence was readily obtainable by the DPP without contravention of an Australian law. Senior counsel for Dr Sood contended that this tipped the balancing exercise in her favour, since the DPP would have had no difficulty in obtaining the evidence lawfully. However, the contrary could equally be argued: the ready availability, by lawful means, of the evidence could suggest that any unlawfulness in the manner in which it was in fact obtained is of little moment. Certainly, when it is accepted, as it was, that any contravention established was anything but deliberate or malicious or reckless, I was of the view that that factor favoured admission of the evidence. 
     
      
    152 Accordingly, I concluded that s138 should not provide the basis for exclusion of the evidence. 
     
      
    153 I therefore permitted the evidence of Dr Peat to be adduced. These are my reasons for doing so. 
     
      
       
      7. Consciousness of guilt 
       
      
    154 After all the evidence, both prosecution and defence, was complete, senior counsel for the Crown sought (contrary to the position he had earlier adopted) to rely on certain aspects of the evidence as evidence that the conduct of Dr Sood signified a consciousness of guilt.  
     
      
    155 There is nothing particularly complex nor controversial about evidence relied upon as evidence of consciousness of guilt. The principles were neatly summarised most recently by Whealy J in R v Lodhi [2006] NSWSC 672 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A lie can constitute an admission against interest only if it is concerned with some circumstance or event connected with the offence (i.e. it relates to a material issue). 
         
         
        (2) The lie must be precisely identified, as should the circumstances and events that are said to indicate that it constitutes an admission against interest. 
         
         
        (3) The jury must be satisfied that the lie was a deliberate lie. 
         
         
        (4) The lie may be taken into account only if the jury is satisfied, having regard to the circumstances and events, that it reveals a knowledge of the offence, or some aspect of it, and that it was told because the accused knew that the truth of the matter about which he lied would implicate him in the commission of the offence. 
         
         
        (5) It is necessary for the jury to be reminded that there may be reasons for the telling of a lie apart from the realisation of guilt.” 
        
       
      
    156 To these I would add: 
     
      
       
        
       
      (6) The lie must indicate consciousness of guilt of the offence charged, and not of some other criminal or discreditable conduct. 
       
      
    157 Whealy J went on to observe that these “beguilingly simple statements of principle” are not always so easy to apply. 
     
      
    158 I would add that the same principles apply, with necessary adaptations which can readily be made, to conduct other than lies (flight is an excellent example) which could be seen to indicate a consciousness of guilt of the offence charged. 
     
      
    159 The Crown provided a document entitled “Lies” (MFI 34), setting out in eight unnumbered dot points the evidence on which it sought to rely in this way. It is necessary to spend a little time outlining the evidence concerned. 
     
      
    160 (i) The first item of evidence was evidence that when police were executing the search warrant Dr Sood said of LT: 
     
      
       
        
        “She only came once.” 
        
       
      
    161 This does appear in Exhibit N, the transcript of what is to be heard on the videotape of the execution of the search warrant. It appears at an early stage, and at a time when Detective Ainley had told Dr Sood that police were investigating the birth and death of PP, and Dr Sood’s engagement with LT. Specifically, he asked about medical records. The transcript then records that Dr Sood said: 
     
      
       
        
        “She only came once.” 
        
       
      
    162 However, she immediately went on to say something about the medical records, and cut herself off, asking: 
     
      
       
        
        “Can I wait until she rings back, then I can talk to you.” 
        
       
      
    163 The videotape itself shows that Dr Sood had made a telephone call, and spoken to somebody from United Medical Protection, which, it is known, is Dr Sood’s insurer. The “she” to whom she referred in the second part of that answer was, it may be inferred, the solicitor to whom she had spoken. 
     
      
    164 I would further infer from this that when Dr Sood said: 
     
      
       
        
        “She only came once” 
        
       
       
      she was somewhat distracted and not focussing fully upon what she was saying. It is significant that, much later in the proceedings, when asked about LT’s records again, she said that they were at home, and added: 
       
       
        
        “Because I mean she came on Saturday and then she came on Monday ….” 
        
       
      
    165 I concluded that the answer on which the Crown sought to rely was not capable of being seen as a deliberate lie told by Dr Sood for the purpose of avoiding criminal responsibility for her actions. I declined to allow the Crown to rely on that evidence as evidence of consciousness of guilt. 
     
      
    166 (ii) the eighth dot point on the Crown’s list concerned evidence given by Dr Sood to the Medical Board, initially in a prepared statement, part of Exhibit P. After outlining her account of her treatment of LT on Saturday 18 May and Monday 20 May 2002, Dr Sood said that LT did not attend (as expected) on Tuesday 21 May and that: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        The next I knew 
         was when the police attended my surgery on 22.5.02, in execution of a search warrant.” (italics added) 
        
       
      
    167 It was common ground that, after the Monday consultation, Dr Sood had been contacted by LT’s cousin, CK, at about 9.00 pm on that evening, conveying to Dr Sood a history of LT having abdominal pain. There was also evidence (which was disputed) that Dr Sood had, at about 8.00 am on Tuesday 21 May, telephoned LT on her mobile telephone. LT was by that time at the Westmead Hospital. 
     
      
    168 The Crown’s position in relation to the statement that the next Dr Sood knew (after the Monday consultation) was the execution of the search warrant was said to be a lie designed to exculpate Dr Sood. I also concluded that this omission could not qualify as capable of being a deliberate lie told for the purpose of escaping criminal liability. I declined to allow that matter to go to the jury for that purpose. 
     
      
    169 (iii) Also in her statement to the Medical Board Dr Sood said, of the Monday 20 May meeting with LT: 
     
      
       
        
        “I attended the Fairfield practice to pick something up at around midday on Monday 20.5.02. The patient came in …” 
        
       
      
    170 She repeated this when answering questions in the Medical Board. Exhibit P records that she there said: 
     
      
       
        
        “On Monday [LT] came in again. I usually work at Campbelltown on Monday afternoons but I had to pick up a few things from Fairfield. 
        
       
       
        
        She came in while I was there. …” 
        
       
      
    171 The Crown contrasted this with what she had said to Detective Ainley during the execution of the search warrant. Exhibit N records that she there said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… It is very hard for me to say where I would have, because the day, both the days she came we were not … it wasn’t a regular surgery running you know what I mean.  
        So on Monday I only came for her to the surgery. I mean I don’t work Mondays, you see 
        .” (italics added) 
        
       
      
    172 The Crown also contrasted the statements to the Medical Board with evidence given by LT and CK to the effect that the Monday meeting was by appointment. The Crown sought to rely upon what it characterised as the lie to the Medical Board as a lie designed to protect Dr Sood and within the principles stated in Edwards. 
     
      
    173 I concluded that the statements to the Medical Board were capable of being perceived by the jury as deliberate lies having the necessary characteristics. I accordingly allowed that evidence to go the jury as evidence of consciousness of guilt. 
     
      
    174 (iv) The fourth and fifth matters relied upon by the Crown concerned handwritten notes put by Dr Sood to the Medical Board as notes she had made of her encounter with LT on Monday 20 May, including recording that she had given LT two Triprofen tablets. It was the Crown case that the notes were subsequently fabricated by Dr Sood, for the purpose of concealing her involvement in the offences with which she was charged. 
     
      
    175 Detective Ainley gave evidence that Dr Sood did not produce these notes during the course of the execution of the search warrant. Detective Ainley asked Dr Sood about the notes a number of times. Dr Sood repeatedly offered to obtain them for him, either from the Eagle Vale practice, or from her home. She said she was not sure where they were. 
     
      
    176 It was the Crown case that the notes were created by Dr Sood at some later time, and were tailored to fit in with ascertainable facts (such as, for example, LT’s evidence that Dr Sood had given her one or two tablets to take orally), but in such a way as to cast Dr Sood’s conduct in an innocent light, and, for example, to account for LT’s evidence that Dr Sood gave her two tablets. 
     
      
    177 I concluded that it was open to the jury to be satisfied that the notes were a fabrication, subsequently and falsely created, and come within the principles applicable to evidence indicating a consciousness of guilt. 
     
      
    178 (vi) I have referred extensively, in an earlier part of these rulings, to the evidence of Dr Allen. Put shortly, the Crown alleges that Dr Allen, who was employed by Dr Sood, falsely told the Medical Board that he had, at the request of Dr Sood, telephoned a Queensland termination clinic in order to obtain the cost of a late termination. He produced a written note which he claimed he had made during the course of and as a result of the conversation. 
     
      
    179 There was good reason to conclude that Dr Allen was not being truthful when he gave this evidence. 
     
      
    180 The Crown then sought to rely upon that evidence as implicating Dr Sood in the fabrication. I concluded that it was open to the Crown to do so, and, if the jury was satisfied, firstly that Dr Allen had fabricated the evidence, and secondly that Dr Sood was involved in the fabrication, that evidence was capable of satisfying the Edwards tests. Accordingly I allowed that matter to go to the jury as evidence of consciousness of guilt. 
     
      
    181 (vii) Finally, the Crown sought to rely upon cross examination of Dr Allen by Dr Sood’s counsel as further evidence of conduct evidencing consciousness of guilt. The reasoning process was this. Senior counsel cross examined Dr Allen, suggesting that the telephone call to Queensland had in fact been made. Indeed, it was put to Dr Allen that he had made two such telephone calls and had made two records of the telephone calls. Other evidence, of telephone records, established or suggested that the telephone calls had not been made on the date asserted by Dr Allen. 
     
      
    182 The argument put by the Crown was that, because senior counsel perpetuated what was said to be Dr Allen’s false evidence, and because it could be inferred that senior counsel was acting on instructions from Dr Sood, the original conduct evidencing consciousness of guilt continued. 
     
      
    183 It seems to me that that approach does not sit comfortably with the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Abdallah [2001] NSWCCA 506; 127 A Crim R 46. There the Court held that it is not open to a trial judge to direct a jury that counsel could be expected to open a case to the jury consistently with what instructions had been furnished by the accused. The Court recognised a number of potential explanations for an inconsistency between evidence ultimately given by an accused person, and the case that had been opened to the jury on behalf of the accused by counsel. In other words, it seems to me that the Court rejected the proposition that a jury could infer that counsel is (always) acting on instructions in the conduct of an accused’s case. 
     
      
    184 I concluded that the argument put on behalf of the Crown required too much by way of inference on the part of the jury. It required the jury to infer that, in cross examining Dr Allen as he did, counsel was acting precisely in accordance with his instructions from Dr Sood; and, on a different aspect, that, in giving those instructions, Dr Sood was aware of any fabrication on the part of Dr Allen. I did not preclude counsel for the Crown from commenting upon the manner in which the accused’s case had been put. What I rejected was that the conduct of counsel could be used as the basis for an inference that, in giving those instructions, Dr Sood was acting out of a consciousness of guilt. 
     
      
       
      8. Discharge of one juror 
       
      
    185 On Wednesday 9 August 2006 senior counsel for the Crown began and completed his final address to the jury. The following day, Thursday 10 August, senior counsel for Dr Sood commenced his final address. That continued for the whole of that day. It was expected to continue on the following day, Friday 11 August. 
     
      
    186 On that day, however, Dr Sood was admitted to hospital and the trial could not proceed. As it happened, it did not resume until Wednesday 16 August. 
     
      
    187 On the morning of Monday 14 August I received a further communication, to the effect that one member of the jury was also ill, and was in hospital. At that time it was not possible to obtain further information. The communication had been made by the juror’s spouse, by mobile telephone. That person then remained uncontactable for the remainder of the day. On Tuesday 15 August I was provided with a medical report signed by Dr Mitchell Lawlar, on the letterhead of Sydney Hospital and Sydney Eye Hospital. He identified the juror who, he said, was an inpatient at Sydney Hospital, suffering from infectious gastro-enteritis. He said that the juror was “highly contagious” and isolated in a single room, and likely to remain in hospital for a further two days, although, Dr Lawlar said, that was variable, depending upon the progress of the disease. 
     
      
    188 S22 of the Jury Act 1977 provides for such a situation. Where a member of a jury in a criminal trial is discharged by the court, the jury is considered as remaining for all purposes of the trial properly constituted provided the number of members does not reduce below the statutory limit (fixed according to the length of the trial). 
     
      
    189 S22 envisages as reasons for discharge of a member of a jury in a criminal trial illness or incapacity to continue to act “or for any other reason”. 
     
      
    190 I was satisfied that the medical evidence established that it was appropriate to discharged the identified juror. In reaching that view, I took into account the uncertainty of the date (if at all) on which that juror would be able to resume duty; the late stage of the trial; and the loss of time already by reason of Dr Sood’s illness. Those circumstances meant that, at what was a relatively critical time in the trial, the late stage of final addresses, the jury had been absent, including the weekend, for five days. I was satisfied that it was undesirable to take further time, particularly, as I have mentioned, in light of the uncertainty about the juror’s capacity to resume duty. 
     
      
    191 Although senior counsel for Dr Sood indicated a preference to proceed with a jury of a full quota, once the medical evidence was received he did bow, I thought, to the inevitable, and did not argue against the course that I took. I accordingly discharged the juror and ordered that the trial proceed with the remaining jury members. 
     
      
    192 That concludes the matters calling for reasons or explanation for decisions made during the course of the trial.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: On the admission and of Records of Interview of each accused. 2 Eva McBride, an eighty-one year old senior was first seen by police lying on the ground being treated by ambulance officers for injuries on her face. The prosecution case is that each of the accused approached Mrs McBride from behind shortly after she had alighted from her car at the Foster Ten Pin Bowling Centre. APC it is alleged ran up, grabbed her handbag, pulling it from her shoulder. She fell to the ground. Both accused then ran from the car park. 3 CP was arrested later that day. He was born in April of 1990 and at the time of his arrest was fifteen and a half years old. He participated in an interview with Detective Elkins at about 3pm that afternoon in circumstances to which I shall later come. The tender of that interview by the prosecution is objected to by the defence. At 3am on the morning following the robbery, APC was arrested, having moments before been asleep in his bed. Five days before the robbery of Mrs McBride, a warrant had issued for his arrest in connection with a charge of entering land with intent to commit an indictable offence. Senior Constable Cunningham, who had been the informant in that earlier offence, woke APC from a sleep and announced there was a warrant out for him and he was under arrest. Thereafter he was handcuffed, placed in the rear of a caged truck and driven to the Taree Police Station where he was charged in relation to the relevant warrant.4. APC was born in July of 1992. In October of 2005 he was aged thirteen years and three months. APC also took part in an ERISP in circumstances to which I shall return. Again the tender of the ERISP in the prosecution case is objected to. 5 A jury has been empanelled to hear what was said to be a short trial. It was required to attend yesterday and again today. A voir dire was held yesterday. It occupied the Court from 9.30am until 6.15pm. I indicated at the conclusion of the proceedings that I would be ruling to exclude the interview with CP. Insofar as APC interview I indicated, I needed time to consider both the facts and the law before I would rule. Last night I spent considerable time looking at both the facts and the law. I have spent until 2 o’clock today and indeed considerable time in the early hours of this morning writing this judgement.6 The Court’s task is to examine the facts and circumstances leading to the participation of each accused in his interview. I shall also have regard to the legal principles governing the issues of admissibility, and if appropriate, the exercise of discretion. I propose to review the facts and circumstances relating to the APC interview first. 7. Leading Senior Constable Michelle Cunningham’s evidence was that she and another police officer attended ---- Street, Forster at about 3.10am on 11 October 2005. Her purpose in attending was to arrest APC. The house was in darkness when they approached the front door but it was opened. I have inferred that their arrival was expected. She heard one of the two occupants say “APC is in the bedroom”. She went to the bedroom at the front of the house with two other police officers. There she saw APC asleep in bed. She said, “APC you are under arrest”. He was handcuffed. She then told him he had the outstanding warrant. He was taken from the bedroom to the front of the house. She spoke with the occupants and inquired about the whereabouts of his guardian, one RR. Her inquiries produced no useful information for her. 8. APC was taken to the rear of a police vehicle, which, as I understand it, was a caged utility and placed into the back of that by one of the supporting police officers. She asked the accused, “Who can come to the station with you?”. He replied, “Don’t know”. He went to the police station at Taree. On the return journey, I am assuming it was the return journey to Taree, she phoned Detective Elkins, the officer in charge of Mrs McBride’s robbery investigation to inform him of APC’s arrest. At the same time she told him that there was no-one available to be a support person, or words to that effect.9. Earlier, at 7pm, Senior Constable Cunningham had called in to ---- Street she said to see if the Appellant was there. It would seem Senior Constable Cunningham believed there was in existence bail conditions requiring him to be at that address at that time. However she was unable to identify by way of an offence the particular bail conditions she was alleging had been breached. 10. It is sufficient if I say that I am satisfied the accused was properly arrested pursuant to the warrant and properly informed that that was the purpose for his arrest.11 At Taree Police Station Sergeant Frank Brown was rostered to perform team leader’s duties between 6pm and 6am. He was also the custody manager. At about 3.50 Senior Constable Cunningham and APC arrived. APC was delivered into the custody of Sergeant Brown, who then began to induct him into the police custody system, pursuant to Part 10 of the Crimes Detention After Arrest Act. 12 Senior Constable Cunningham, probably at the direction of Sergeant Brown, completed a form known as Aboriginal Custody Notification Form addressed to the Taree Aboriginal Legal Service (ALS) office. The form contained details of the date, 11/10/05, time of arrest (3.10am), time of notification (4.10), surname of person in custody (PC), given name (A), date of birth (14/7/92), adult/juvenile (juvenile was circled), home address (---- Street, Foster), home phone number, offences being investigated (warrant). The rest of the notification form was incomplete. 13 Several incomplete headings would have been of relevance, namely expected bail situation (bail was intended to be refused), CAN (a warrant had been issued under s 54(2)/181(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act (1986) in respect of a charge/sequence number each 24697653 sequence 1; first court appearance date; officer in charge of investigation; notifying officer. It is significant to note this notification, as with others later sent, was not marked for the attention of any representative of the ALS. It was simply faxed to and addressed to the Taree ALS. 14 Sergeant Brown notes that as he entered APC into the custody, APC appeared tired and requested to be placed in a police cell. He was so placed at 4.15am. No support person was present. APC was searched, entered into the custody system, and as I say, moved to the cell. Sergeant Brown and Senior Constable Cunningham both acknowledge there were other secure rooms at the police station other than the police cells. 15 I am satisfied neither saw anything inappropriate about keeping a thirteen year old in police cells overnight. I am also satisfied the normal procedure at Taree is to do what Sergeant Brown did on 11 October 2005. I am also satisfied Brown was motivated by kindness in allowing a sleepy boy to head for the police cell. However the housing of youths aged 13 in police cells when other accommodation is available, is wrong. Part 2 of Schedule 1 of the Guidelines for Custody Managers and other Police Officers, to the regulation for the Crimes(Detention after Arrest) Act, clause 5 make this clear:  
     
      
     
     
      
      “5(1) An Aboriginal person or Torres Strait Islander who is a child should not be placed in a police cell except in exceptional circumstances that make it necessary for the wellbeing of the child. 
      
     
     
      
      (2) If it is necessary to detain a child overnight in a police cell the custody manager should arrange for a support person to remain with the child unless it is not reasonably practical to do so. 
      
    16 I am satisfied the custody manager did not turn his attention to either of those provisions. 17 A Custody Check List and covering sheet was completed, much of it most likely by Sergeant Craigie Hanson, the custody manager who followed Sergeant Brown. It allocates a charge number or event number of 24985736. Sergeant Brown was of the opinion that as the trigger for the arrest was the execution of an arrest warrant, 18 Part 10A of the Crimes Act 1900 did not apply. In my view he was correct. There was no investigating period required at that time.s 356C of Part 10A of the Crimes Act (now s 114 Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 would appear to make this clear. The latter Act replaced the repealed Part 10A on 5 December 2005. As Part 10A appears to have been the prevailing legislation in October 2005 my references will be to it. It provides, that is, s 356C provides that a police officer may in accordance with this section detain a person who is under arrest for the investigation period provided by s 356D... 
     
      
      (3) If, while a person is so detained the police officer forms a reasonable suspicion as to the person’s involvement in the commission of any other offence, the police officer may also investigate the person’s involvement in that other offence during the investigation period for the arrest. 
      
    19 It seems to me that this was not an arrest for that purpose but rather one relating to the execution of a warrant.20 At 6am Sergeant Brown’s shift as custody manager finished. Sergeant Hanson took over. Sergeant Hanson was not called by the Crown to give evidence. Custody records were tendered through Sergeant Brown. By 4.12am Sergeant Brown had found the following property on APC: $39.55, a pair of shoe laces and one black tracksuit top. The $39.55 may have had some significance inasmuch as my understanding of the evidence is that Mrs McBride had about $150 stolen from her and it was the prosecution case that the loot contained in the bag had been divvied up between the two offenders shortly after the offence. The black tracksuit top ultimately was entered into an exhibit book at 1.51pm. Its significance may have related to the McBride robbery in which case then its entry into the exhibit book would have constituted part of the investigative procedure.21 At some time around 5.30am a Fact Sheet for the bailing hearing was prepared for the Taree Children's Court, in relation to the warrant and the charge of breaking and entering with intent. Significant to this matter says the defence is the following paragraph contained in the statement: 
     
      
      “At 3.10am on Tuesday 11 October police were invited into the premises situate at ……………. Street, Forster. The young person, APC, was located by police in a bedroom of the residence. The young person was arrested by police and conveyed to Taree Police Station. The young person was entered into custody. At the time of the arrest of the young person no suitable support persons were available to be with the young person.  
      The young person is to be interviewed in relation to other serious offences of a violent nature on 11/10/05.”  
      (emphasis supplied by me) 
      
    22 At 6.15, 7.03, 7.35 and 8.22 APC was disturbed from his sleep, spoken to and made no complaints. Custody records show that at 8.45 APC was re-arrested by Detective Senior Constable Elkins in relation to the assault and rob matter at Forster on Mrs McBride. The record notes Detective Senior Constable Elkins had also brought the child’s mother from Foster to Taree to enable a “10A” interview process to be completed. 23 It was at 8.45am, then, that APC was regarded by police as being subject to 10A of the Crimes Act. Between 8.50 and 8.55 APC’s auntie, RR, made personal contact with him. I note the “end” time entry was made about two hours after the visit had been completed. What is peculiar is that the “start” time for the visit was also made after the visit had been completed but was made at 8.57. 24 It would appear to me that no inquiries from APC were made as to who he would like to be his support person. I am satisfied from the evidence of Senior Constable Cunningham that there were tensions in the house at ---- Street. Whether those tensions extended to Auntie RR or not has not been established by the evidence. I would have thought the onus was on the Crown to satisfy me that Auntie RR was a suitable person to be a support person.25 APC was given breakfast at 9.08 to 9.20 after a 10A Summary of Rights was administered by custody manager, Craigie Hanson. It is unclear to me whether Craigie Hanson is a man or a woman. When I began writing the judgment it appeared to me that she was a woman but as matters proceeded, particularly given that the caution was said to be given by a “he” it may well be that Sergeant Hanson is a male. If Sergeant Hanson is a female then some person other than the custody manager would appear to have administered the cautions. At least that is what I take from the interview.26 I am also at a loss as to how somebody can be fed at 9.08 to 9.20 and at the same time have his caution and summary rights administered. I would have thought, reading the Act but not being seized with any protocol that is used, that the administering of a caution and the explanation of the rights would have taken a substantial time in its own right. One or other or both of those procedures, that is breakfast and the setting out of the appropriate obligations may well have been rushed.27 The evidence as to the time of the interview is confused. The videotape encryption shows the interview commencing at about 10.01 and concluding at 10.24. The clock on the wall at the rear of the interview room shows the interview starting at what would appear to be either 9.40 or 10.40 and concluding at 10 or 11 o’clock. Detective Elkins makes the comment in the interview and I am prepared to accept it, that the interview finished at 10.02. The accused was taken to the dock at 10.13. 28 A second Aboriginal Custody Notification Form was sent to the Taree ALS by fax at 9.20a.m. Again it was not addressed to any representative of the ALS. A third Aboriginal Custody Notification Form was sent to the Taree ALS at 9.23a.m. Just what effect it was thought could be achieved by sending the notice minutes before the interview was to begin is unclear and was not explored in the evidence.29 The accused was interviewed by Detective Elkins and Detective Sergeant Laura Thurtell in the presence of his mother. He agreed he had been advised of his rights by the custody manager and he (the custody manager) read a form out explaining the rights. When asked whether he understood he had the right to contact a solicitor and tell him where he was, his answer, which was in my view equivocal, was interrupted by his auntie who said “Yeah, he read it out to you this morning”. His auntie RR then repeated herself. The accused was then asked whether he understood his rights. The sense I got at that point in time in the interview was that the accused felt pressure both from his auntie and the police officer to answer “Yes” and he did. 30 Detective Senior Constable Elkins never sought to test that understanding by asking the thirteen year old to explain the right back to him, see R v Collins, per Brennan J, as he then was. Given that exchange set out in the interview, it would be difficult to be satisfied the accused knew what right he had in respect of having a solicitor present. When asked how long he had been at school APC said he did not know. Again his aunt RR volunteered. She said the only school he would have been to had been in homes. 31 APC admitted that he and his co-offender had wanted money so went to the car park. Detective Elkins indicated he had seen the video, thereafter placed hearsay evidence onto the record of what he had seen in the video and asked the accused to comment as to who it was who he, Detective Elkins had seen in the video grab the lady’s handbag. APC’s response was that it was he. Detective Elkins then continued what was hearsay evidence of what he had seen on the video, namely that he had seen the lady fall when the person grabbed the handbag and then asked the offender whether he saw that happen. 32 What relevance Detective Elkins saw on the video has to do with the issues in the trial is beyond me. I doubt that those who instruct him in questioning techniques or interviews would approve this approach. Had I been asked, I would have seriously considered rejecting the questions. It had the effect of getting hearsay evidence before the jury. It seems to me it requires the subject of the interview to trust the detective as to (a) that he had actually seen the video; and (b) that he had accurately, fairly and fully described what he had seen and (c) that the oral description as understood by Detective Elkins was equally understood in the same terms by the thirteen year old lad who was hearing the description. True they may, if accurate, have been one and the same thing but that is still no guarantee that it would have been understood by the interviewee in those terms.33 Further, when it comes to the tender of the tape of the incident there is a real prospect, of transference of what the detective saw or thought he saw on the video, to what the jury members see or believe they see when they review or recall the tape. To me it is an extremely dangerous practice. Of course APC, aged thirteen, would have been unaware the questioning procedure being used was so tainted. 34 Likewise questions 50 and 51 indicate the detective had been told that APC ran away and hid in the bushes, going through the lady’s handbag and taking money. What Detective Elkins had been told could not have been relevant evidence against APC standing on its own. The answer “Yes” is relied upon as an admission, yet analysed APC is doing no more than agreeing that Elkins had been told something. His answer simply was “Yes”.35 The effect of questions 46 to 51, that is the questions about the tape, and the questions about what he had been told, places Elkins in a position not only of power in respect of the accused but also with superior knowledge in respect of the events that he is questioning the thirteen year old Aboriginal boy about. While such questioning may be useful and indeed perhaps even admissible towards the end of an interview after a suspect has given his account, and there is a factual basis contained in the interview for asking such questions, the method as used was unfair, being at the commencement of the interview, because it simply reinforced the power imbalance between the thirteen year old and two trained and experienced detectives.36 At the time the interview was being conducted, therefore at some point between, say, 9.30am and 9.55am on 11 October 2005, Mr Christopher O’Brien, a solicitor of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, a well known practitioner in the Taree region, approached the front desk at the Taree Police Station. The police station is next door to the Court. O’Brien is a frequent visitor to the Taree Police Station where from time to time he sees or interviews his clients in custody. 37 He was greeted by a male police officer. He is now unable to identify or describe that police officer. O’Brien asked whether there was a young person in custody named APC. The officer said “Yes”. He asked could he see the young person in custody. The police officer replied “He’s being interviewed, you can’t see him at this stage”. O’Brien said “I want to convey something about his rights”. The police officer gave the same answer he had just given. O’Brien left the police station. 38 APC had in the past been and could still be regarded as being O’Brien’s client. On this evidence I am prepared to find O’Brien did not identify himself as a solicitor, or that APC was his client. He was, of course, dressed in a suit, he used the term “young person” and “conveying something about his rights”. That surely would have identified him as being a person at least involved in the administration of criminal justice and open to the real likelihood of his being a solicitor. O’Brien had been notified by the ALS solicitor, Mr North, that APC was in custody.39 There are a number of matters of concern relating to the interview. Some occur before the interview but set a background against which the police conduct is to be assessed: 
     
     The arrest of the accused at 3am. I am satisfied the accused was not available for arrest at 7pm on 10 October nor do I make any criticism of Senior Constable Cunningham for conducting the arrest at this time. Nonetheless being awoken, handcuffed, transported in the rear of the caged truck demonstrates a no-nonsense and tough approach by the police to the accused. 
     
     
     Housing the accused in police cells with no support person, contrary to the regulation guidelines, or even having regard to the existence of the guidelines when a secure room was available. I accept that it was necessary to keep the accused overnight, and I accept that it may have been difficult, if not impossible to have found a support person, but I am satisfied no thought was given to the latter. 
     
     
     The continual disturbance of the accused’s sleep from 6am to 8am apparently to see if there was any matter he wished to complain about. Sleep disturbance and deprivation would not be conducive to the accused’s wellbeing and one would imagine that it ought to have some better purpose than to see if he wanted to complain. I note that Sergeant Brown has not recorded as having deprived the accused of sleep. It is accepted there may be instances where continual disturbance may be necessary but a sleeping youth who is not a suicide risk and is not ill does not appear to me to be one of them. 
    40 The notification to the Taree ALS subsequent to the accused’s re-arrests needed to comply with the requirements of Regulation 28 of Part 10A. It’s in these terms,  
     
      
      “If a detained person is an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander, then unless the custody manager is aware that the person has arranged for a legal practitioner to be present during the questioning of the person, the custody manager must: 
      
     a) immediately inform the person that a representative of an Aboriginal Service  organisation will be notified that the person is being detained in respect of an offence;  and b) notifies such a representative accordingly. (my emphasis)41 The obligation upon the custody manager is to notify a representative of the Aboriginal Service organisation. Such an obligation is different from notifying an Aboriginal Service organisation in that it requires notification to a person who “represents” the organisation. Such a person is more than a mere employee. He or she is a person capable of representing the ALS. The protocol of faxing notifications to the Taree ALS falls far short of notifying a representative of the ALS. 42 It relies upon the person who clears the fax machine, if he or she is not such a representative to find the representative and bring the fax to the attention of the representative. Such procedure may involve delay. I do not know which notification for instance, whether it was the 4am, 9.20 or 9.23 one that caused Mr North to notify O’Brien. However, if North had been notified directly then he could have directed the custodial manager to O’Brien and O’Brien would have been notified earlier. Clearly this is one of the values of personal notification. 43 Personal notification also plays a part in the CP case, to which I will come later. 44 There is an apparent failure of the custody manager, or interviewing police, to establish who the accused desired for a support person, that he had the right to select someone he chose as a support person for the interview, or that he could have chosen a barrister or solicitor to be present. Detective Elkins claims he believes s 13(1) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 sets out a hierarchy commencing with the person responsible for the welfare of the child at the time. I note there is no such Provision in the section. 45 What the section in fact says is this,  
     
      
      “13(1) Any statement, confession, admission or information made or given to a member of the police force by a child who is a party to criminal proceedings should not be admitted in evidence in those proceedings unless: 
      
     
     
      
      a)  
      There was present at the place where and throughout the time during which, it was made or given – 
       
        
        (i) a person responsible for the child; 
        
       
      
     (ii) an adult (other than a member of the police force) who was present with the  consent of the person responsible for the child; 
     
      
       
        
        (iii) in the case of a child who is above the age of sixteen years – an adult (other  
         
         than a member of the police) who was present with the consent of the child; or 
        
       
      
      
      (iv) a barrister or solicitor of the child’s own choosing; or 
      
    b)  the person acting judicially in those proceedings [comes to a view of one sort or another]. 46 I disagree with Detective Elkins. There are four options. The use of the word “or” in the section does not connote a hierarchy. I seriously doubt his true belief is as he claims in evidence. 47 Whether the task of offering selection is the responsibility of the custody manager alone puts the question too narrowly. The police officer in charge of the interview should satisfy himself or herself before the interview proceeds past the formalities that the suspect understood his or her right to freely select and experience the right. That was not done in this case. 48 I have viewed parts of the interview. I concede I have not viewed it all. To me the accused appears tired, unsure of what is meant by a number of formal questions at the beginning and conclusion of the interview. Persuaded to answer “Yes” to the question about understanding his rights to have a lawyer present when he still appeared unsure.49 Continuing the matters of concern include the decision made at the front desk to deny the accused access to a professional person who had come to the station specifically to advise the accused of his rights. Had Mr O’Brien been earlier notified by the custody manager, or Detective Senior Constable Elkins, I am satisfied he would have been afforded the opportunity of explaining to the accused his rights. It is also possible he may have supported the accused during the interview, had the accused chosen in the face of the solicitor’s advice to participate in an interview. Any solicitor permitting a thirteen year old client to participate in an interview without seeking to accompany him or her would in my view be sailing close to professional callousness and negligence. Having seen this accused in the interview I would strengthen this comment.50 Defence counsel has invited me to find there was an abuse of the investigating period provided by s10. That claim has not been made out. 51 The seminal cases setting out the law and discretionary principles I apply are R v Phung and Huinh[2001] NSW SC 115 and R v Mark Helmhut[2001] NSW CCA 372. From those cases I distill the following principles.  
     
     It may be accepted that the purpose of the legislative regime that applies to the interviewing of children, and particularly those in custody following arrest, is to protect them from any disadvantage inherent in their age as well as to protect them from any form of police impropriety. As to the former, what is required is compliance with procedure laid down, so as to prevent the young, or vulnerable, accused from being overawed by the occasion of being interviewed at a police station by detectives, who are likely to be considerably older and more experienced than they are. 
     
     
     It is important that police officers appreciate that the regime now established is designed to secure ethical and fair investigations, as well as the protection of individual rights of some significance which attach in particular to children. Those rights obviously are of great importance, when a child is facing a charge as serious as murder or armed robbery. 
     
     
     The provisions (relating to questioning and arrest) need to be faithfully implemented and not merely given lip service or imperfectly observed. The consequence of any failure to give proper regard to them is to risk the exclusion of any ERISP, or the product of any investigative procedure, which is undertaken in circumstances where there has not been proper compliance with the law. 
     
     
     There is a positive obligation under the legislation to ensure that the child or vulnerable person can understand what is being said. For example see Regulation 29(Crimes)(Detention after Arrest) Act. That makes sense of satisfying themselves. Regulation 29 may well relate to interpreting but nonetheless for young people it still stands. Some of the formal questioning may need explanation. The regulations give rise to a positive obligation to assist a vulnerable person in exercising his or her rights, see Regulation 20. 
     
     
     The role of a support person is to act as a check on possible unfair or oppressive behaviour, to assist a child, particularly one who is timid, inarticulate, immature or inexperienced in matters of law enforcement, who appears to be out of his or her depth or in need of advice, and to provide that comfort which accompanies knowledge that there is an independent person present during the interview. 
     
     
     The custody manager is required to explain to the support person that his or her role is not confined to acting merely as an observer, but also extends to doing the other things specified. 
     
     
     Some human beings are more vulnerable in facing police interrogation than others. Many factors bear upon an individual’s vulnerability. Age, education, personality and general experience of life are some that are relevant to an individual’s capacity to deal with police questioning. Plainly that capacity varies from individual to individual. That means a contravention of any of the obligations, including the obligation to notify a representative of the ALS may have different consequences, depending upon the particular characteristics of the individual who is being interviewed by the police. 
     
     
     The consequences in question may make it unfair for the evidence to be admitted.  
    52 I am satisfied that there have been a number of irregularities in complying with the statutory regime and guidelines put in place to ensure fairness to vulnerable persons. These include the failure to house the accused overnight with a support person and in a secure place other than a police cell; the failure to notify a representative of the Taree ALS; the failure to provide the accused access to Mr O’Brien and the failure to formulate appropriate questions as the front part of the interview on the offence itself commenced. 53 I am satisfied there was no thorough investigation of whether the accused understood his rights and I am also satisfied that he did not understand them. I have not been satisfied that the support person was properly instructed by the custody manager. 54 I am satisfied the interview proceeded because an unfair and unethical advantage was taken by Detective Elkins. I accept that the investigation of crime in this region is no easy task. I accept that the provisions such as those required by Part 10A and the various regulations are frequently regarded by police as a roadblock impeding effective police investigation. 55 Nonetheless as Wood J, Chief Judge at Common Law, has said, what is now demanded by our law makers is not only effective but ethical policing. I am satisfied Detective Elkins attempted to comply with Part 10A and the Regulations to the extent that the compliance he gave would, he thought, have been acceptable to the Court. 56 I am satisfied APC was a vulnerable person, indeed a textbook example of vulnerability, young in age, overawed in the power imbalance with no personal resources to deal with his questioners and the strong likelihood that the support person was not much better equipped than he. He was grossly uneducated, probably less than of average intelligence (at least his answers would tend to demonstrate this), poorly supported by a support person who I have inferred from the evidence of Senior Constable Cunningham, may have been, I do not say was, antagonistic towards him. 57 It is likely she did not know the extent of his (the accused) rights, and thought all that was necessary was that someone read them out to him, and he would understand them, notwithstanding the formal language in which they are couched. 58 I am satisfied the admissions made in the interview are likely to be true, at least insofar as the activity of the accused APC is concerned. It may be that he has overstated his co-offender’s role but that evidence could not have been used against CP in any event. 59 I am satisfied the admissions are crucial to the Crown Case. I have been told the Crown case cannot succeed without them. 60 I am conscious in the balancing that must be done, proper weight must be given to the public interests in seeing offenders brought to account for their crimes in courts of law and that that applies with greater emphasis the more serious the crime. I recognise such a policy has application in matters involving children. 61 s 90 of the Evidence Act 1995 is in the following terms,  Discretion to Exclude Admissions  In a criminal proceeding the Court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact if: (a) ... (c) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution; (d) having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence.62 I am satisfied the admissions are voluntary in the sense they were not forced out through threats or importuning or bribery. However the effect of the failure to follow procedures put in place for vulnerable people has denied to this accused matters to which he was properly entitled. Because of his vulnerability, - unprotected as he was by the legislative regime that was supposed to provide protection for him, a confession came into existence. I am satisfied it would be unfair to the accused pursuant to the criteria I should consider under s 90 to permit the admission of the evidence. 63 The offence that occurred on 10 October was targeting an eighty-one year female by at least one, and on the Crown case two, youths. The handbag was snatched and she fell injuring herself. The fall and injury would appear not to have been intended, but nonetheless are consequences of the robbery. The victim was hospitalised, although on the evidence before me it is unclear how long. I am aware that there was at least one wound to her face and that the face was substantially damaged. 64 The two young persons are being tried according to law. I have sought to balance public interest against fairness to the accused. 65 It appears to me the breaches have an aura of endemic about them. I have earlier referred to Sergeant Brown’s decision to place the thirteen year old in the cells as a matter of course. I refer to the failure to recognise the young person’s right to the choice of a support person likewise appears to have an aura of endemic about it. The failure to notify a representative has been established as a protocol, although no doubt not deliberately so. 66 All of these failures remain notwithstanding Woods’ J decision in Phung and Huinh earlier referred to and the clear admonition issued in 2001 by him, and later by the Court of Criminal Appeal applying Phung and Huinh in Helmhut’s Case. Well, I am concerned of course only with consequences in this case. It is against that background that I assess them. I would exclude the ERISP in the exercise of my discretion created by s 138 of the Evidence Act.67 I now turn to the interview of CP. CP was arrested by Senior Constable Russell in close vicinity to the crime scene. He was placed in the rear of a caged vehicle. At the time of his arrest $50 was on him. As I earlier mentioned Mrs McBride’s wallet had contained something in the order of $150. Leading Senior Constable Michelle Eggert who was at the scene when the accused was arrested, assumed the role of custody manager at the Forster Police Station. 68 Initially attempts were made to contact the accused’s mother, MT. These attempts were unsuccessful. The evidence is unclear as to who was seeking to make contact, how he or she was seeking to do so and what level of success, if any, that person or persons had. It is to be remembered the Crown bears the onus of proof in compliance with Part 10A in the relevant provisions.69 CP was entered into custody at 10.50. He had been arrested at 10.30 and conveyed from the arrest scene at 10.45. Detective Elkins and other investigators arrived at Forster Police Station at 11.05. Once it was established the accused’s mother or any other adult could not be contacted, “Legal Aid” was informed. 70 The accused is an indigenous Australian who identifies as an Aboriginal. He was aged fifteen at the time of his arrest. On two bases then he qualifies as a vulnerable person. 71 At 12.25 Peter North from the ALS made telephone contact with the accused. North advised him. As a consequence of that advice and on instructions from the accused North told Detective Senior Constable Elkins the accused would not be participating in an interview. North had sought to give this information to the custody manager but had been told by Elkins she was unavailable, thus he communicated directly with Elkins requesting him to convey the message to the custody manager. That interchange was completed by 12.30. The accused confirmed that the was not interested in making an interview. Elkins then made the decision to terminate the investigation period. He was entitled to do so. 72. s 356D (Crimes Act 1900) sets out the parameters of the investigation period: 1) The investigation period is a period that begins when the person is arrested and ends at  a time that is reasonable having regard to all the circumstances, but not exceeding the maximum investigation period. 2) The maximum investigation period is four hours or such longer period as the maximum  investigation period may be extended by a detention warrant. s356E sets out the criteria for  determining what is a reasonable time 3) 356E Determining reasonable time: i) ... ii) In determining what is a reasonable time for the purposes of s 356E(1) all relevant  circumstances of a particular case must be taken into account. iii) Without limiting the relevant circumstances that must be taken into account the  following circumstances (if relevant) are to be taken into account: (a) the person’s age, physical capacity and mental capacity and condition... (d) whether the person has indicated a willingness to make a statement or to answer any questions.73. S 356G provides the circumstances in which an investigation period may be extended.74. S 356G detention warrant to extend investigation period: 1) A police officer may, before the end of an investigation period, apply to an authorised justice  for a warrant to extend the maximum investigation period beyond four hours. 75. One issue raised in this case is whether the investigation period, having been ended can be reactivated. I have no doubt the investigation period was ended. Detective Sergeant Elkin says he was in the process of charging the accused with a charge, but not the charge he presently faces. The custody record shows the charging process commenced at 12.31 and was stopped at 12.35 because it was determined to wait for the mother. That 12.35 entry was made at 14.47, that is two hours and 12 minutes after the charging process had stopped. 76. On my reading of Part 10A there is only one way to extend a investigation period and that is by means set out in 356G. The investigation period having finalised I am of a view that it was no longer open to the detective to avail himself of s356G. 77. Detective Elkins claimed he stopped the charging process because he felt s 13(1) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987set up a hierarchy of support persons and that the mother took precedence over the lawyer. I have already indicated my attitude to that claim. In my view Detective Elkins, when told the mother was on her way saw a potential advantage to his investigation. He recognised immediately she was not a trained solicitor, that there was a strong likelihood she would be more malleable than a trained criminal lawyer, possibly take a different view about the accused participating in an interview. I am satisfied it was because he saw a potential advantage to his investigation that he stopped the charging process. 78. I have not been satisfied he was consciously acting in breach of any regulation or statute, simply that he sought the advantage. Had the matter stopped there, notwithstanding that I have held his conduct may have been unacceptable, it may well be the discretion properly exercised at that point would have seen the interview admitted. 79. Upon arrival of the mother however he went too far. I shall return to this. 80. At 3.30 the accused’s mother arrived. Again the mechanism by which the police became aware the mother was travelling to Foster from Taree is unclear. It was their belief she was hitchhiking. She was afforded the opportunity of speaking to her son. It is unclear exactly where but it may have been in an interview room. Upon her arrival at the police station MT spoke to an officer at the front desk who connected her with Detective Elkins. She said to Detective Elkins, “I’m CP’s mother, I want to see my son”. 81. Detective Elkins took her to the interview room and said to her that her son had hit the big league this time. She said “What do you mean”. He said, “The lady received injuries”. She said, “CP wouldn’t do anything like that. I want to see my son”. He said, “CP is all right. He spoke to someone at Legal Aid”. Thereafter she saw her son and then subsequently spoke to Detective Elkins. 82. It would appear that there were intermittent meetings with Detective Elkins. One such time was when she was upset and he took her to the police courtyard to allow her to smoke a cigarette there. On this occasion he said to her, “The solicitor said not to do an interview”. He told her that he, Detective Elkins had seen video footage of the incident. CP’s role was very minor, hiding in the bushes. She asked if she could see the footage. He said “No, it’s at the ten pin bowling alley”. He continued, “It would be in CP’s best interests to do an interview now and get it all cleared up”. 83. MT remarked that the detective seemed friendly. She returned to the interview room. She said in her evidence that as a consequence of the conversation with Detective Elkins she felt she bullied CP into the interview. She also said that CP did not want to do the interview. 84. While all of this conversation was not put to Detective Elkins in cross-examination, it was put to him that he had spoken to MT and had told her CP should do the interview. He denied he had spoken to her in those terms. I am equally satisfied he would have denied the balance of the conversation and I take him to have done so. 85. However I am satisfied it is more probable than not the conversation set out by MT is true. I am satisfied Detective Elkins had seen the video footage by the time he was ready to interview the accused. I am satisfied the accused was at some stage hiding in the bushes. I am satisfied Detective Elkins saw the arrival of MT at the police station as a potential advantage to his investigation. I am satisfied he saw that advantage as bearing upon the potential for her son to take part in an interview. I am satisfied his conduct had the consequence of putting pressure on the accused through the medium of the accused’s mother. I am satisfied that pressure was applied to circumvent the advice given by Mr North and intended that the accused would follow the urgings of his mother. I am satisfied the accused determined to follow the advice of his mother and that his will was overborne by his mother’s importuning. 86. In this sense I am not satisfied the interview was voluntary. I would exclude it upon that basis. 87. I recognise significant admissions were made in the interview. I would also exclude it pursuant to s90 of the Evidence Act. I echo here the relevant discretionary considerations I earlier referred to in the case of APC. I would exclude it under s 138 as being improperly obtained by the application of pressure and importuning. Again I echo the relevant discretionary considerations earlier referred to in APC’s Case. 88. Having looked at the accused’s custody record and the time lag between events and entries made, I would recommend to the powers that be that greater pressure be put upon custody managers to comply with their obligation enshrined in the regulations to make entries into the custody record contemporaneously. 89. The ERISP of CP is rejected. **********

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Youssef Elali appears for sentence today on three matters. In relation to one of those there is a Form 1. The three offences are supplying cocaine. The matter on the Form 1 is an offence of goods in custody. It relates to the substantive matters, as I will shortly outline.2 The offender pleaded guilty in the Local Court to two offences of actually supplying cocaine. In this Court, shortly before his trial was about to commence, he pleaded guilty to another offence on an indictment. This was also an offence of supplying cocaine. It does not relate to an actual supply but it is a case of the offender being in possession of a substantial quantity of cocaine for the purpose of supplying it.3 On 7 September 2005 the offender was contacted by an associate of his, by the name of Jeffrey Telavavai. Mr Telavavai offered the offender a job. He said that he could earn a thousand dollars for a day’s work. The offender knew full well that he was being offered work that was illegal. He was under financial pressures at the time and so he decided to accept Mr Telavavai’s offer. He did this despite the advice and request of the offender’s partner. At the time they had two children. Despite these entreaties the offender ignored his partner’s request and went off to perform the illegal work offered to him by Mr Telavavai. 4 The offender met Mr Telavavai in the Kings Cross area. He was taken to a hotel where he was shown a mobile phone and given some keys. His job was to deliver drugs to people who would order them over the phone. One of those calls was from an undercover police officer. He telephoned the mobile phone and spoke to the offender and arranged to meet him. They met up. The offender purchased fifty dollars worth of cocaine from the offender. The drug was secreted in a small red balloon in the offender’s mouth. The balloon proved to contain .9 of a gram of cocaine. The offender asked if he could meet up to get some more. The offender said “Yeah, but you know it won’t be me.” The offender was observed leaving that meeting and going back into the hotel where he was based. 5 Later, another police undercover officer also arranged to be supplied with cocaine. He also telephoned the offender on the mobile phone and made arrangements to meet up. Again the offender went to meet with the undercover officer and supplied him with cocaine in a balloon that he kept in his mouth. The officer handed over fifty dollars and left, and once again the offender was observed as he left the meeting. He was arrested a short distance away from the hotel where he was based. Police found the Nokia mobile phone which the undercover officers had rung to arrange the drug supplies. That phone rang constantly whilst the offender was in police custody.6 Police took the offender back to the police station. There they found not only the money that had been supplied by the undercover officers but other money which was the proceeds of other sales of cocaine, selling at fifty dollars per capsule. It is the possession of that money which forms the basis of the goods in custody matter on the Form 1.7 Police went to the room at the motel where the offender had previously been based. When they got there they found a number of items, the most relevant of which were other balloons, one of the fifty dollar notes handed over by one of the police officers during the undercover operation, more cash and, most importantly of all, other drugs. There were a large number of capsules, each containing cocaine. In fact there were one hundred and nineteen capsules containing 21.5 grams of that drug.8 Clearly, the offender was performing the occupation of a drug supplier. His job was to receive orders for the drug and meet up with the purchasers, handing over small quantities of cocaine for money. 9 The two offences to which the offender pleaded guilty in the Local Court, they being offences of actual supply, are examples of the criminality encompassed by the matter on the indictment. For that reason the sentences for the actual supplies will be wholly concurrent with the sentence for the matter on the indictment. 10 It was put on behalf of the offender, and I accept, that the offender’s involvement was limited to this particular day. It seems to be accepted by the Crown that what was happening was that the offender was working “a shift”. There is material to support the offender’s assertion that his criminality was limited to working on that particular day. In particular the offender did not answer the relevant mobile telephone on 6 September, the day before he was arrested, and when the first undercover officer asks for further cocaine, later that night, the offender says that he will not be the one to supply it. I am therefore prepared to proceed on the basis that the offender’s involvement was limited to this single day. But that does not mean that the offender was not trafficking to a substantial degree. Indeed he was. He was prepared to supply cocaine to whoever wanted it. There were more than one hundred capsules of that drug present in the room.11 The quantities supplies were comparatively small, but the offender was prepared to do that regularly and often. 12 The offender was certainly not a principal in this organisation. He was a street level dealer supplying drugs that were not his, on behalf of another person, but doing so for substantial profit.13 The offender has a criminal history, although there is nothing approaching the seriousness of these matters. There is a matter of possession of a prohibited drug which is consistent with information contained in the presentence report, and it is important to note that at the time of these offences the offender was on a s 12 bond imposed by the Local Court for affray. I should say at this stage that although the offender consented to me dealing with the consequences of his breach of that bond I declined to do so. I have no information as to the nature of the offence, before me, and so I would be unable to apply the principle of totality in determining the appropriate overall sentence for these matters and the matter for which he must now serve a sentence of imprisonment following his breach of a s 12 bond.14 The offender is now twenty-four years of age. He lives with his de facto partner and their two children in a granny flat at the rear of his partner’s parents’ home. The offender’s partner is pregnant with the third of their children. The offender’s childhood was described as dysfunctional and disrupted. His parents separated when he was sixteen years of age. The offender’s father was a violent and intolerant man. It is suggested that the offender reacted adversely to his parents splitting up. It was at that time that he began consuming alcohol, experimenting with drugs and mixing with an anti-social peer group. It seems that that attitude continued to the time that he committed this offence, associating with Mr Telavavai for the purpose of committing these offences.15 The offender left school at sixteen and was regularly employed until he suffered an injury at work. Documents were tendered to me demonstrating the severity of that injury. For a considerable period of time the offender was unable to work, receiving Workers Compensation. However, towards the end of last year, or the beginning of this year, the offender commenced employment with his brother-in-law. These were light duties because of the injuries which he had suffered earlier at work. More recently, in fact only about a month ago, he has now started work with a demolition company. He strips and cleans buildings, earning about $600 a week. His partner is not presently employed but does receive government benefits. 16 This offence was a very serious one. It was aggravated by the circumstance that the offender was on the bond, that I have spoken of, at the time. The Crown says that it was committed in company. Although there were two offenders involved in the offence nothing in the statement of facts satisfies me that the offender was actually in company at the time that he committed these offences. It is true that he was to some extent jointly sharing the room with Mr Telavavai, but that is not enough, in my view, to amount to the aggravating circumstance of it being in company in s 21A. It is also suggested by the Crown that the matter was part of organised criminal activity. That is true, but it is difficult to imagine a drug supply matter such as this which is not organised. Although it is an aggravating feature in terms of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act it is, as I have said, common to most other offences of drug supply.17 The offender has expressed his remorse in evidence before me, describing his decision to involve himself in the drug supply activities of Mr Telavavai as a stupid decision. It is not only stupid, it is significantly criminal. Nevertheless, the offender has expressed his remorse and I accept that his remorse is genuine. 18 I am not able to find that offender’s prospects for rehabilitation are good. There are prospects, but in view of: the offender committing this offence whilst he was on a bond (the breach of which would have resulted in his imprisonment); the matters referred to in the presentence report; the offender’s previous unsatisfactory response to counselling; and suggestions in the references tendered on his behalf that he is easily led, I am unable to find that the offender’s prospects for rehabilitation are good. 19 The offender, as I am mentioned on a few occasions now, did plead guilty. The plea of guilty to the actual supply matters came at the earliest opportunity, but the plead of guilty to the matter on the indictment only came shortly before the trial was due to commence. I will not quantify the discount I have imposed for the actual supply matters because those sentences are ultimately irrelevant to the overall sentence. I will discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed on the offender because of his plea of guilty to the matter on the indictment by approximately ten per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of his plea.20 The offender has spent one day in custody on this matter so it is appropriate that the sentence commence on 7 September 2006, that is yesterday. 21 Mr Dailly did tell me that he was instructed to suggest that the offender serve his sentence by way of periodic detention. I have given consideration to that matter in light of the fact that the period of custody I have decided to impose makes him eligible for such a sentence, however in my view and consistent with the authorities nothing less than full time custody is appropriate in this case. The offender deliberately set out to break the law. He deliberately set out to profit from drug supply activities. Those drug supply activities can make people a lot of money, as is evident from the fact that he was offered one thousand dollars for a day’s work. In those circumstances, the criminal law has to act as a substantial deterrent to others who may be attempted to make easy money through drug trafficking. The cases to which the Crown referred in her written submissions make it clear also that a sentence of full time custody is required for those who traffic to a significant degree in the absence of exceptional circumstances, which I am satisfied do not exist here.22 The offender is therefore sentenced to imprisonment for the actual supply matters. They are the ones to which the offender pleaded guilty in the Local Court. The offender is sentenced to imprisonment for fixed terms of ten months. They are to date from 7 September 2006. They are fixed terms because of the sentence I will now announce on the matter on the indictment.23 For the offence of supplying cocaine appearing on the indictment, taking into account the matter on the Form 1, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of eleven months, which will commence on 7 September 2006 and expire on 6 August 2007. I set a head sentence for that matter of twenty-two months.

      HIS HONOUR: This is the matter of GS. S 11 of the  
      Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 
        
      1987 
       prohibits the publication of the name of the offender and nothing must be published which identifies him or could lead to his identification. 
       
       
       
      1. When sentencing an offender for a criminal offence the task of the sentencing judge is to resolve a number of competing tensions. The resolution of those tensions must ultimately find its expression in the sentence imposed by the Court upon this offender for the harm done to this victim, in this community, see  
      R v Gladue [1999] 1 SCR 688 at [80] 
      . Many tensions in this case are strongly pulling in different directions.  
       
       
       
      2. Rowan Barker works as a journalist for a leading radio station. On 3 December 2005 he was celebrating the Christmas season with work colleagues at the St Ives Chase home of Justin Kelly, a colleague, about to depart the same broadcasting station. The celebration turned to disaster when four penetrating stab wounds were inflicted by GS, a total stranger to Rowan Barker. The major wound was life threatening. His attacker was a sixteen and a half year old youth, at the time “wasted” on drugs and alcohol, still smarting from an argument with his mother earlier that night. There is no suggestion he had any cause or reason known to the law to plunge a knife four times into Rowan Barker. The only connection between the offender and the victim had commenced minutes before when GS demanded to know the whereabouts of Zeus.  
       
       
       
      3. That demand must have been incomprehensible to Barker whose immediate response was “Who?” In the space of some fifteen short exchanges between the journalist and the youth Rowan Barker was grievously injured. GS was charged with maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm in company. He pleaded guilty. Today he must answer to the community for his conduct. Although he was only aged sixteen and a half at the time of the offence, he is to be sentenced “at law”; that is, the law as it applies to adults. 
       
      4. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence before the Court. I will need to have regard to matters personal to the offender including his youth. The starting point for such assessments requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to the offence and to the offender. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed even if looking through a glass darkly. There are technical questions relating to deterrence and discounts; the impact s 6 the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 will have upon my approach to sentence. There are three additional matters before me that would normally be dealt with by the Children’s Court for which sentences will need to be fixed. Finally of course the ultimate penalty to be imposed will need to be fixed. The question of special circumstances will need to be looked at. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community will also need to be determined, see R v Cuthbert [1967] 2NSWLR 329, R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594, R v Hayes [1984]1 NSWLR 740.Additional Facts:-5. Rowan Barker arrived at Justin Kelly’s premises some time Saturday afternoon. Justin Kelly had scheduled his party to commence at 3pm. In all about twenty-five guests turned up. Dinner was at about 7.15. By 11.30 only some five people were still partying. 6. The front of Kelly’s property has two sections. The first, a fenced area containing a pool; the second, a driveway of some ten metres connected to a double garage. The living area is to the left of the garage and behind the pool. The party was held in the driveway. The adjoining Street, Warrimoo Street, was some thirty to forty metres east of the driveway entrance to Kelly’s house. Kelly’s house is in a different street to Warrimoo Street. 7. It was a warm afternoon and evening. Rowan Barker was wearing jeans and it would seem a light blue t-shirt. By 11.30pm he says that he was moderately affected by alcohol. He still had control of his senses and judgment. 8. Not so his attacker. Having been scolded by his mother, as I say, earlier in the evening, he walked into his bedroom. His evidence is, “I did what I always did when I felt negative feelings, I got wasted. I smoked as many cones [of cannabis] as I could. I opened a bottle of Jim Beam and kept drinking. I remember there to be about half a bottle left.” There is hearsay evidence that he, in fact, consumed the whole bottle. 9. Some time around 11.30 to 11.45 Rowan Barker was seated on the driveway. He saw two young males approach. They were standing about eight metres from him. They appeared to have walked from Warrimoo Street down Kelly’s Street. One of those males was GS. I take up what then happened through the eyes of Rowan Barker: 
       
        
         
         
         
        “The first male [GS] was standing on the eastern edge of the driveway, while the second male was standing towards the western edge just on the roadway. The first guy said “Where’s Zeus?” I said “Who?” He said “Where’s Zeus, man?” I said “I don’t know what you’re talking about, there is no Zeus here” he said “Come on, where is he?” I said “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” He said “Tell Zeus GS wants to speak to him” I said “There’s no-one called Zeus here, I don’t know what you’re talking about”. At this point I stood up and walked over to him and said, “We don’t know Zeus.” he said “Tell Zeus GS wants to talk to him.” Again I said, “I don’t know Zeus, I don’t anyone by that name here”. He said “Tell Zeus to ring George”. At this point the conversation was going nowhere, I just wanted to get rid of him and said “Yeah whatever”. I don’t know if he misunderstood me, thinking that I knew Zeus, and by this stage Justin had walked over and stood to my left basically in front of the second guy. The first guy was becoming extremely agitated. I said, “Mate you should just go, we don’t know Zeus”. He said, “You think we should go do you?” like it was a challenge. I said “Yeah I think you should go”.  
         
         
         
        The next thing I felt him punching me, well that’s what I thought at the time until I saw my t-shirt was wet with blood. Thinking back on it I think he reached into his jeans pocket at the rear and used his right to strike me. I saw him turn and run towards Warrimoo Avenue and his mate went with him. If felt as though I had been hit about four times. I turned around and started walking back towards the group and the first thing I remember Sarah saying, “Oh my God he’s been stabbed”. I can also recall the sound of an older model sounding V8 motor taking off screeching tyres ...  
         
         
         
         
        At no time in my estimation did I initiate this argument or inflame the situation in any way. I was just trying to get him to leave. These two males I have never seen before. The first male was extremely agitated which gave the impression he may have been affected by drugs of some kind. The second may have talked briefly to Justin but I didn’t hear him say anything.” 
         
         
        
       
      10. The second male did in fact say something to Justin Kelly. Justin Kelly walked over to the area where Rowan, GS and the other male were. Justin Kelly said to the male “What’s going on?” The male said, “Look I’m sorry about all this”. It was at about that moment that Kelly also saw a jab which he thought was a punch. It became immediately apparently because of the blood soaking into a light-coloured t-shirt that Rowan had been stabbed. Kelly began to chase GS and the other youth as they ran to the motor vehicle in Warrimoo Avenue. The two climbed into the rear seat. GS extended a fist out the rear window raising his middle finger as the motor vehicle sped off along Warrimoo Avenue.  
       
       
       
      11. I am satisfied the account of Rowan Barker and Justin Kelly set out what actually transpired. The only other account before me is that of GS. To understand that account it is important to remember that at the time of his offending conduct he was experiencing the combined effect of several marijuana cones and a vast quantity of spirits. This account comes from a letter GS has written to the Court. The relevant portion is: 
       
       
        
         
         
        “There was also another dream that I was surrounded by a group of men much older and bigger than I was. I remember feeling as if my life was going to end as if I was going to be killed. I was with Tim and looked over to him to pull me out of that and at that time he backed off as if he was leaving me to be killed. At that point I realised that no matter who says they care for me or have my back that they really just say it but don’t mean it. I started having flashbacks as I thought my life was flashing before my eyes and I was going to be killed. I saw every single time I have been beaten up. When someone approaches me wanting a fight, I just freeze up like a rabbit in the spotlight before it gets run over. In this dream I felt like the whole world had turned on me and that I can’t trust anyone because no-one really cares what happens to me.” 
        
       
       
       
      12. As best I can determine from the evidence the group of men, if this dream relates to the facts of the incident, were two in number, that is Barker and Kelly. This account is remembered through a drunken haze. There is nothing which suggests to me that any of the guests at Justin Kelly’s party showed any aggression towards GS. The account does reflect unfounded paranoia being experienced by GS. As will be seen this is a condition professionals have diagnosed. I am satisfied he was experiencing a drug-induced paranoia that was in existence prior to that night. I am satisfied that the paranoid ideation that the strangers, he was in fact harassing, harboured ill will towards him, was a factor in him determining to use a weapon on Rowan Barker. I will have more to say about this paranoia later. 
       
       
       
      Objective Criminality: 
       
       
       
      13. From the facts as he finds them to be a sentencing judge is required to assess what is called the objective criminality of the offence as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of the offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the instant offence with criminality of offences of a similar genre. It is in this way that the seriousness of the criminality of this offence can be evaluated. The objective criminality has perhaps the most important impact upon the sentencing outcome. 
       
       
       
      14. The assault upon Rowan Barker was a serious breach of the peace that the criminal law is designed to preserve. Further, the injuries inflicted were both wanton and truly serious. One of the measures of criminal conduct is the quantum of damage inflicted upon a victim, see  
      R v Buttsworth [1983] 1 NSWLR 658 
      . 
       
       
       
      15. Dr Brereton, the head of cardio-thoracic surgery at Royal North Shore Hospital was called to attend emergency surgery. The primary wound had caused bleeding in the sac around the heart, high blood pressure, elevated venous - that is vein - pressure, severe rapid beating of the heart. In respect of this wound alone Dr Brereton observed, “If the wound had been one centimetre deeper or closer to the mid-line of the body, or if Barker had been further from medical care, or had not received expert immediate resuscitation, he would not have survived”.  
       
       
       
      16. There were three other wounds, to the left arm, the left upper abdomen and one to the back adjacent to the left armpit. The wound to the left upper abdomen penetrated to, but not into the left lung. Rowan Barker spent two days in intensive care and thereafter substantially more days on the recovery ward at the North Shore Private. His condition was such that for several days there was a restriction on his visitors. In May of this year he said this: 
       
        
         
         
         
        “As a result of the operation I have a surgery scar which runs down the middle of my chest and is about eight or nine inches long. I also have four separate scars from the stab wounds which are, one to my left abdomen, one on my left chest, one to my upper left back and one to my left upper arm. I also have a couple of further surgery related scars. The stabbing of my left upper arm - has caused nerve damage. At times I feel numbness to my left forearm, intermittent pain and pins and needles to my arm. Since the stabling, my left arm’s movement has been restricted due to the muscle damage. My arm definitely isn’t as strong as it used to be. I am seeking medical advice in relation to the left arm.” 
        
       
       
       
      17. The offending conduct was unprovoked. I have earlier described it as gratuitous. While not in his own home, Rowan Barker was a guest on private property, and entitled to feel secure from strangers walking the streets. The offence was impulsive and impetuous.  
       
       
       
      18. There is no suggestion on the evidence before me the other male present played any part in the offending conduct. True it was he arrived with and departed with the offender, but otherwise it seems he had nothing to do with the offence. Rowan Barker puts him on the other side of the driveway. Barker says that he was unable to hear the conversation occurring between that man and Justin Kelly. The man was apologising to Kelly for the aggression and behaviour of GS moments before he wielded the knife. True he ran but that action was as consistent with panic as with any wrong-doing by him.  
       
       
       
      19. Nor am I satisfied the driver of the car had any knowledge anything had happened, other than something had gone on, or wrong, because the two passengers arrived in his car running, seeking to escape from Justin Kelly. I am sure the driver of the car was told within moments of the car leaving something of what had happened. But on the evidence before me his offending conduct related to aiding an escape, rather than participating in the wounding. 
       
       
       
      20. Grievous bodily harm was occasioned to Rowan Barker. It should be understood that the plea of guilt to the charge before me, coupled with the use of a weapon, clearly establishes that the offender intended physical harm to be inflicted on each of the occasions he struck his victim. However, it does not establish that he intended each of the actual injuries inflicted. Nor does it establish that he intended that the sum of the injuries would, or any of them would, amount to grievous bodily harm.  
       
       
       
      21. The infliction of multiple stab wounds using a knife does of course amount to an aggravating feature of his offending conduct.  
       
       
       
      22. I cannot be satisfied that Justin Kelly’s premises and guests were deliberately targeted. While the evidence establishes the offender had been to the premises next door on previous occasions, the evidence is silent as to whether either of the persons accompanying him knew the person “Zeus” or had previously been to his premises. I should indicate that Zeus, as it turned out, was the nick- name of a person who lived next door to Kelly. 
       
       
       
      23. Given GS’s high level of intoxication it is possible there was confusion between the three as to precisely where they were heading and why. That being so, there is no evidence to suggest the knife attack or any other form of assault was planned.  
       
       
       
      24. There are a number of other factors that played some part in the offender’s commission of this offence. I have referred to one already, GS’ unfounded paranoid ideation that the adults in the driveway, it would seem particularly Rowan Barker from whom he was demanding the whereabouts of Zeus, were harbouring ill will towards him. It would seem that the offender felt they were not co-operating with him, but also in some way harboured him ill-will.  
       
       
       
      25. The offender describes himself as “wasted”. He had ingested both marijuana and copious quantities of alcohol. These drugs would have impacted upon his capacity to make judgments, to process the information he was given, to recognise with clarity his surroundings, all of which may have had some impact upon his conduct.  
       
       
       
      26. The offender’s immaturity to deal with the situation in which he found/imagined himself to be in is apparent. That immaturity first reveals itself in the offender’s response to his mother’s scoldings, and took a near lethal turn when he lashed out with a deadly weapon without any real appreciation of the awful seriousness of his acts. 
       
       
       
      27. I have had regard to matters of aggravation, some of which are enumerated in s 21A of the  
      Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
      . I have sought to deal with all matters of aggravation in my reliance upon the common law and relevant factors of aggravation in assessing the objective criminality. This is not a case where I would regard factors of aggravation being so prominent as to require them to be considered anew by reliance upon the statutory provisions contained in s 21A. 
       
       
       
      Subjective matters: 
       
       
       
      28. I turn now to the subjective factors. I am entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence but I am also sentencing this offender for it. Each offender coming before the Court varies from other offenders who stand or have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to the offender may offer to the Court some explanation or insight into the commission of this offence by this offender or some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate. 
       
       
       
      Personal background and family dynamics: 
       
       
       
      29. GS was born in April of 1989. He is currently seventeen years old, he was sixteen years and eight months at the time of the incident. He is a single youth although he has been in relationship with a girl Kelly for some time. Kelly’s parents are both school teachers and their influence on this offender in recent times has been important and beneficial. GS was born in England, the second of four children. He comes from a strongly supportive and caring middle class family without any obvious abuse from them towards him or each other. For much of his life his mother has been bedevilled by and battled with depression. He experienced early health problems. He suffered major ear afflictions with at least seven burst ear drums in his first two years of life.  
       
       
       
      30. He had been from very early childhood anxious, timid and clinging. As a toddler he displayed excessive temper tantrums. He was difficult to discipline. As a pre-schooler he displayed separation anxiety. As a young person he was hyper-sensitive and had difficulty with socialisation. There were a number of periods when his mother was absent from home, either because she was overseas or on other occasions hospitalised with depressive illness. 
       
       
       
      Education and work skills:- 
       
       
       
      31. Through his education years there have been developmental and other problems. In pre-school he had difficulty separating from his mother. While there he developed a number of odd, but apparently non-aggressive behaviours. During primary school there were speech problems and a need for speech therapy. Those speech problems may have reflected in later schooling. There were difficulties with concentration, reading and writing through primary and secondary school. In high school there was bullying. During the high school years he began to abuse alcohol and cannabis, to which I shall come in more detail later. There is hearsay evidence that the offender got into bad company and “put on acts like a gangster”. 
       
       
       
      32. Kam Wong, a consultant psychiatrist treating the offender, expressed the opinion that the offender “being a victim of bullying and aggression has coped by using the defence of identification with the aggressor in order to protect himself”. The offender told Dr Wong that older students who had been bullying him told him they had put a “contract” on him. Dr Wong reports that both the offender and his mother report receiving numerous phone threats against his safety. The offender gives these threats as an explanation for carrying a knife with him on the night. 
       
       
       
      33. GS commenced his high school studies at a well-known North Shore Catholic independent school. There he completed year seven and most of year eight. In the latter part of year eight his then girlfriend became pregnant. GS and the girlfriend took time out of school for some three weeks in order to find someone who would administer an abortion. Neither child had access to Medicare cards. The girl did not wish to tell her parents. This information became known to his school which then expelled him.  
       
       
       
      34. He went to a State school. His English teacher was keen to foster a competence in speaking publicly. Students were required to give short speeches before the class. Such was GS’s level of social phobia that he truanted the school rather than speak to his class.  
       
       
       
      35. Until recently that was the end of his formal schooling. In more recent times he has been competing his school certificate (year ten) via correspondence. He harbours plans of eventually completing his higher school certificate possibly through TAFE.  
       
       
       
      36. He is presently unemployed. He claims that is because of the stringent bail conditions imposed upon him. In the past he has done casual work as a “trolley boy” for Woolworth’s. In 2005 he began full-time work at a paper factory. He lasted five months. He left there as older staff were making threats against him because he was not working fast enough. He still however counts as one of his friends a man, James, aged twenty-one whom he has known for five years who also worked at the factory. 
       
       
       
      Health:- 
       
       
       
      37. At the time of this incident the offender weighed forty-five kilograms. He now weighs seventy-five. He reports that he is a more active and less lazy person. He told Juvenile Justice that he now enjoys jogging with his present girlfriend’s father. 
       
       
       
      Mental health issues:- 
       
       
       
      38. This offender first referred to Dr Wong in early January of this year. Having taken a history, including his childhood and developmental problems, Dr Wong diagnosed: 
       
        
         
         
         
        ...“There is little doubt that he has been suffering from a chronic anxiety disorder, depression, attention deficit disorder and low self-esteem. Unfortunately he has resorted to the use of illicit substances as a self-medication for his chronic dysphoric and anxious state. Unfortunately his cannabis and alcohol abuse have resulted in the undesirable consequences of paranoia, increased irritability, further cognitive impairment and poor judgment and insight, not to mention increased anxiety and deepening of depression. Being a victim of bullying and aggression he has coped by using the defence of identification with the aggressor in order to protect himself... 
         
          
         
         
        GS is a young man with emotional, psychological and social immaturity. He uses immature defence mechanisms, makes poor judgments and is easily influenced by his peers. Due to his many “wasted” years he has few coping and life skills.” 
         
        
       
       
      39. GS was also sent to an experienced clinical psychologist who specialises in child and adolescent mental health. Dr Christopher Lennings administered a number of tests in late July of 2006. He found:  
       
        
         
         
        “Mr S’s most severe psychopathology, falling into the severe clinical range, included symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and interpersonal problems, but he also obtained very high scores on scales assessing general anxiety disorder, disturbance of self-concept and a high risk score on suicidal rating scale...he remains a highly psychologically vulnerable young man...” 
        
       
       
       
      40. Dr Lennings found from a cognitive assessment that the offender was in the low average end or better than the bottom thirty-two per cent of the population. Dr Lennings thought such an estimate was perhaps conservative, but described GS’ cognitive ability as “adequate”. There were areas of impoverishment - his ability to remember, and associate words and short stories. It would appear there was also impoverishment of cognitive organisation, that is, recall from memory. There were signs emerging from the testing of mild impairment affecting executive functioning and memory. Executive functioning is important because it is involved in the control of behaviour. It was Dr Lennings' observation: 
       
        
         
         
         
        “Given that both marijuana and alcohol could be expected to significantly affect behavioural and emotional control, it is likely that the offence occurred within the context of the effects of the substances further impacting upon already somewhat impaired cognitive function. The cause of such cognitive dysfunction cannot be determined from the nature of this assessment.” 
        
       
       
       
      41. Matters mitigating the offender’s criminality would need to be proved on the balance of probabilities. If there were pre-existing deficits in behavioural and emotional control, exacerbated by the marijuana and alcohol taken that night that would in my view amount to a mitigating factor. I am well satisfied of the ingestion of copious quantities of alcohol and marijuana. I am satisfied without the need of specialised pharmacological evidence that both consumed in quantities impact upon behavioural and emotional control. From histories taken by Dr Wong and Dr Lennings and others who assessed the offender and their observations I am satisfied there was pre-existing behavioural and emotional control issues. I have cited in these remarks on sentence the two pertinent passages from Dr Wong and Dr Lennings.  
       
       
       
      42. It should be understood that this mitigating factor does not amount to any excuse for the offender’s acts, nor is it any finding that his acts were unwilled. It simply explains that his decisions to act as he did were in some way impacted because behavioural and emotional inhibitions were at some impaired level from two sources. While this matter has been analysed in the course of dealing with subjective matters, the mitigating impact of the impaired behavioural and emotional control affects the objective seriousness of the offending conduct.  
       
       
       
      Alcohol and drugs: 
       
       
       
      43. In September 2003 GS was referred to the Hornsby Child Adolescent Medical Health Service. At that stage he had been expelled from the independent Catholic school earlier referred to. For the year following he was disclosing to his social worker significant alcohol abuse nightly until he passed out. At that time he was thirteen to fourteen years old. He was on-referred to a drug and alcohol counsellor but refused the counselling. He told Dr Wong he had been abusing cannabis up to twenty cones daily. He told Juvenile Justice that he was smoking thirty to fifty cones daily and then began to sell to his friends. At the time of the offence it was the situation that he was smoking 100 cones daily.  
       
       
       
      44. A hundred cones daily is a mammoth quantity of cannabis. He began to experience severe levels of paranoia. At some stage during his cannabis history he reduced. There was an incident where he says he was beaten up and then went back to cannabis increasing his consumption to 100 cones daily. He was smoking at this level just prior to his offending conduct. He would experience blackouts and memory loss brought on by alcohol and perhaps cannabis abuse. He would feel out of control, nothing would make sense to him.  
       
       
       
      45. After his offending conduct he re-presented himself to the child adolescent mental health services. Thomas Campbell, reporting for the Hornsby Child Adolescent Mental Health Service, makes this observation: 
       
        
         
         
         
        “In regard to Mr S’s second presentation to our services in December 2005 there has been a much more successful outcome. Mr S has grown in maturity and in his attitude to a remarkable extent. He has said that he is determined to have good relationships with his family and girlfriend prior to any incarceration. He has taken on board whole-heartedly our recommendations eg attending drug and alcohol counselling and rehabilitation. His abstinence over the last six months has been apparent. He has actively sought to patch up relationships with his family. He has become much more able to understand the triggers for his change in mood, his lack of confidence in certain areas and how to deal with anger... 
         
          
         
         
        Given his relative youth at the time he commenced his substance abuse it appears clear to me that his psychological and social [and possibly physical] development has been severely impacted by this problem. When sober and drug-free Mr S is of a different character in that he is able to take much more responsibility for his actions. Over the last six months (of sobriety) for instance there has been a noticeable emotional development in him...” (my inclusion) 
         
        
       
       
      Criminal history:- 
       
       
       
      46. This offender has no prior criminal history. While it is clear that in a period of perhaps as much as a year or so prior to the offending conduct he was supplying cannabis, apparently to support his habit, he was never charged with any offence. Nor does his offending come on top of having been held accountable before a court previously for offending conduct. This is his first appearance, as I understand it, on such a basis in court. With youth one often one experiences within the criminal justice system that a court appearance can be a turning point. In this case the first turning point would appear to have been the offence, but one would hope this appearance would act as a support to that. 
       
       
       
      Attitude to the offence:- 
       
       
       
      47. Every professional youth worker or expert witness who has interacted with this offender since the offence has been impressed with this offender’s sense of remorse. He has verbalised his remorse, privately in counselling sessions, publicly in the Court. He has written a letter to the victim. It commences:  
       
        
         
         
        “I know I am probably in no place to be contacting you. I know that you might read this first sentence and want to throw the letter out and I totally understand if you are thinking who do I think I am, but I would appreciate if you heard me out on this. I’m getting sentenced shortly and I just can’t go away without letting you know how I feel. I can’t even begin to stress how deeply sorry I am for stabbing you. I feel terrible and my heart is with you and your family. I know you might not want to hear all this but whether or not you accept this I don’t expect you to accept my apology, I don’t see that to be possible, but for my own peace of mind explaining myself to you is something I have to do. There is no way I want to continue living with the trauma and the guilt every day for the rest of my life, particularly when I’m trying to sleep, but writing you this letter will at least stop me thinking to myself ‘If only he knew how I felt.’. I can’t help but to think that perhaps you believe that I do not feel guilty for what I have done.”. 
        
       
       
       
      48. He has sought to apologise in person to the victim. Without seeking in any way to put pressure on either the victim or the offender, because conferencing of this kind requires expert and proper preparation, it is nonetheless an important matter for the Court to take into account that his contrition is such that he would be willing to apologise personally. 
       
       
       
      49. The offending conduct and its horrific consequences appear to have been a watershed event, causing the young person to attempt to gather himself together and accept a path to rehabilitation. For the past nine months he has made substantive progress. Considerable positive changes to his lifestyle are noted by those working with him.  
       
       
       
      The plea of guilty: 
       
       
       
      50. The offender was charged at the outset with serious offences of what are known to lawyers as crimes of specific intent. The issue at the Committal Hearing in the Local Court was whether the Crown was able to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, the necessary specific intent. Once the committing magistrate ruled in the offender’s favour, the Crown accepted a plea to the present charge at the Local Court. The offender has been committed for sentence on that charge. He can be given the benefit for an early plea. Apart from legal argument at the Local Court, the resources of the Crown have not otherwise been extended. The committal was done on written documents the Crown was always obliged to tender at the Local Court. 
       
       
       
      Rehabilitation Prospects:- 
       
       
       
      51. There are a number of positive rehabilitation factors: 
       
       
       
       Strong support from his family, girlfriend, her family, the extended family and family friends. Fourteen references and letters from that group were tendered for my consideration. Not surprisingly, because they were tendered by the defence, but impressively nonetheless, all of the letters supported the view of the professionals that remarkable progress has been made in the past nine months. They are also evidence of the strong support at community level that the offender has. 
       Persistent efforts being made by GS over the past nine months to address causes of offending behaviour through continual counselling and psychiatric treatment. 
       Persistent efforts during this year to deal with drug abuse through abstinence and counselling, for example the Taking Charge Program run by Father Riley’s group through July and August of this year. 
       Some effort to address inadequacies in education. 
       Profound contrition for his conduct and insight into its impact upon his victim. 
       Improvements in physical health and some participation in physical activity.  
       
       
       
      52. There are some negative indicators that cannot be discounted, including: 
       
       
       
       Serious as yet unresolved psychological issues such as guilt, and unresolved grief over the untimely death of the man Tim. 
       A past history, since the age of thirteen, of serious drug and alcohol abuse. 
       A past resort to drugs and alcohol, in circumstances where he was experiencing emotional and mental pain, and possibly in circumstances of manipulation by him of the family dynamics. 
       Past association with negative peer groups: 
       Absence of useful employment skills. 
       His post sentence plans (meaning these Court proceedings) do not appear to have developed any long-term focus. That may, of course, be readily explainable by a recognition of the likelihood of detention.  
       
       
       
      53. If his path was to continue as it has in the past nine months the likelihood of his re-offending would be remote. But one must take him with his history. His recent past suggests his rehabilitation prospects are positive. His past conduct means it still must be a focus in the immediate future. 
       
       
       
      Setting the Sentence:- 
       
       
       
      54. Custodial history of the offender:- This offender has spent eight days in custody. For him these eight days appear to have had a profound impact. That personal impact of his own detention took on new meaning because the other man present at the scene, Tim, committed suicide, in part caused by physical abuse experienced by him, including apparent repeated sexual abuse in prison. The offender’s newly found perception of the darker side of custody has caused him anxiety and stress in the past nine months. 
       
       
       
      Deterrence:- 
       
       
       
      55. General deterrence plays a crucial part in the sentencing of adult offenders, and in the case of young persons who conduct themselves like adults in the way in which they commit serious offences. Generally, however, the punitive-retribution paradigm of sentencing associated with general deterrence gives way to considerations of rehabilitation among the young. Considerations of rehabilitation are expected to play a more important part when sentencing young offenders. 
       
       
       
      56. In my analysis of the objective criminality I have noted the significant part the offender’s immaturity played in his offending conduct both in dealing with his mother’s scolding and dealing with the situation his paranoia led him to believe he was in. I have also found an impairment in his behavioural and emotional control exacerbated by his copious consumption of alcohol and cannabis.  
       
       
       
      57. Most of those dealing with the offender since his offence have noted change in the offender, since the event, pointing to his growing maturity, his loss of immaturity and his growing emotional development. In this case rehabilitation can and should be a primary aim of sentencing, see  
      GDP 
       (1991) 53 A.Cr.R. 112 at 116. 
       
       
       
      Maximum Penalty:- 
       
       
       
      58. The maximum available penalty for this offence is ten years imprisonment. Even though this offender is being sentenced “at law” the principles set out in s 6 of the  
      Children’s (Criminal Procedure) Act 1987 
       apply. On the question of sentence for this offence three of those principles have resonance.  
       
        
         
         
        Principles relating to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction. 
         
         
         
        (6) A court in exercising criminal jurisdiction with respect to children shall have regard to the following principles: 
         
        ... 
         
          
          (b) That children who commit offences bear a responsibility for their actions but because of their state of dependency and immaturity require guidance and assistance. 
           
          (c) That it is desirable whenever possible to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption. 
           
          (d) That it is desirable wherever possible to allow a child to reside in his or her own home. 
           
          (e) That the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind. 
          
         
        
       
       
       
      59. In his full and helpful submissions Mr Haesler SC, counsel for the young person, sought to advance concepts crystallised in an American case as underpinning the relevant jurisprudential philosophy applying in children’s cases and reflected by s 6. The case relied upon was a death penalty case, but nonetheless the rationale of an approach with a more muted focus on retribution and punishment has a wider relevance that was called for in that case. I have accepted Mr Haesler’s point form summary of the points made by Kennedy J in  
      Roper v Simmons 
       543 US 2005 at pp 15-16:- 
       
       Juveniles are more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures including peer pressure. 
       The character of a juvenile is not as well formed as that of an adult. The personality traits of juveniles are more transitory, less fixed. 
       The susceptibility of juveniles to immature and irresponsible behaviour means their irresponsible conduct is not as morally reprehensible as that of an adult. 
       Their own vulnerability and comparative lack of control over their immediate surroundings means juveniles have a greater claim than adults to be forgiven for failing to escape negative influences in their whole environment. From a moral stand point it would be misguided to equate the failings of a minor with those of an adult, for a greater possibility exists that the minor character deficiencies will be reformed. 
       The relevance of youth as a mitigating factor derives from the fact that the signature qualities of youth are transience; as individuals mature the impetuousness and recklessness that may dominate in younger years can subside. 
       
       
       
      Impact of guideline judgment:- 
       
       
       
      60.  
      Thompson and Houlton 
        
      (2000) 49 NSWLR 383  
      applies in this case. The offender is allowed the full benefit of the discount; I set that discount at twenty five percent. 
       
       
       
      Parity:- 
       
       
       
      61. I have held the offender acted alone. Whilst he was in company I do not regard the Crown proving beyond reasonable doubt that company as participating other than by being present. There is no evidence that they had any knowledge the offender had a knife, or that he was likely to use it in the circumstances in which he found himself. Tim, who was present at the driveway, is deceased. He was never dealt with at court. The other person in the nearby vehicle was not present. He appears to have been an accessory after the fact. In any event he did not receive a custodial penalty. 
       
       
       
      Balancing the objective and subjective matters:- 
       
       
       
      62. At the outset of this judgment I remarked that the competing tensions fall strongly in different directions. The objective features of this case, particularly the viciousness of the attack, its unprovoked nature, the repetitive use of the weapon and the horrific injuries inflicted elevated this offence to a serious crime. These features were mitigated by other matters, including the offender’s immaturity and the role it played in his criminal conduct, his impaired emotional and behavioural controls, his impaired judgment, the prominence of paranoid thinking. 
       
       
       
      63. The offender’s subjective case is, remarkably, perhaps even extraordinarily strong. Those who support him have spoken of the event being a catalyst. It would seem it has been an epiphany for him. I have determined but for the plea of guilty I would have set an overall sentence of two years and eight months imprisonment for this offence. I would discount that by twenty five percent making it a term of imprisonment of two years.  
       
       
       
      64. I have anguished long over whether the offender should be returned to custody and if so for how long. At the end of the day however I have determined to suspend the sentence, but upon the stringest of conditions.  
       
       
       
      65. My reasons for so doing include the principles set out in s 6 of the  
      Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 
      , the rehabilitation progress made to date in the community, the fear of disrupting that progress by a period of custody [s.5  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
      ] the unfavourable influences that the offender may be exposed to within the detained population, the recommendation of Juvenile Justice and other authorities and to avoid, if possible, returning him to custody, and the personal deterrence effect of a suspended sentence. 
       
       
       
      66. Juvenile Justice wrote: 
       
        
         
         
         
        “Taking into account the aforementioned issues the unit respectfully suggests that any community based order handed down should include [a number of conditions]...It is acknowledged, however, that the offences committed by the person are serious in nature and therefore the Court may wish to deal with this matter by way of a custodial sentence. Should this be the case it is respectfully recommended that G receive a suspended sentence with supervision provided by Stanmore Intensive Programs Unit.”. 
        
       
       
      There is an alternative suggestion of a short period in custody followed by a longer period of parole. 
       
       
       
      Special circumstances:- 
       
       
       
      67. This is a case in which special circumstances should be found. This offender’s response to rehabilitation since the offence was committed demonstrates that his best prospects for rehabilitation are in a community based setting. It is recommended by Juvenile Justice who are expert in this matter. He has genuine deep felt anxieties over and beyond what normally one might expect in respect of returning to custody.  
       
       
       
      Formal Orders:- 
       
       
       
      68. Would you stand up, please. GS, I convict you of the offence that you maliciously inflicted grievous bodily upon Rowan Leslie Barker while you were in the company of Timothy Mullins. For that offence I sentence you to a non-parole period of nine months and an additional term of fifteen months, making an overall sentence of two years.  
       
       
       
      69. Pursuant to s 12 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
       it is my intention to suspend that sentence provided that you agree to my so doing and provided that you enter into a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of two years from today. 
       
       
       
      70. That is not some empty request that you are to consider because that bond will have serious conditions attached to it. They will include these:- 
       
       
       That you will be of good behaviour. 
       
        
        That you will provide to the registry here at Penrith your present address and that you will notify that registry of any change in your address. 
         
        That you will answer to this Court for any breach of the conditions that I am setting. 
         
        That you will accept supervision by Juvenile Justice and in particular by the Stanmore Intensive Programs Unit. 
         
        That you will reside at an address as directed or as selected by Juvenile Justice. 
         
        That you will participate in counselling individual, family (provided family members are willing to so participate) and group work as directed by Juvenile Justice. 
         
        That you will attend alcohol or other drug programs and/or treatment as directed by Juvenile Justice. 
         
        That you will submit at your own expense to random drug testing at least five times monthly for the next nine months and thereafter as required by Juvenile Justice. 
         
        That you will maintain and/or seek appropriate education/training - including apprenticeships - and/or employment as approved by Juvenile Justice in consultation with you and your parents. 
         
        That you will participate in ten hours of structured physical exercise, such as jogging or gym work, perhaps dedicated is better than structured, weekly for the next nine months.  
         
        And then one for Juvenile Justice that any breach of the bond is to be notified to this Court within forty eight hours. 
        
       
       
        
       
      Now have a discussion with your solicitor, with your legal counsel, and if necessary with your mother. Do you want me to take a morning tea adjournment? 
       
       
      HAESLER: No, I don’t think so your Honour. My instructions are that strict though they are he will accept all those conditions. 
       
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: 71. All right. The formal order I make then is that you are convicted, that the sentence as I announced them will be imposed, that is a nine month non-parole period and a fifteen month balance of term. That sentence will be suspended conditional upon you entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of two years. I am not going to go through those conditions again unless formally requested.  
       
       
      72. Pursuant to s 166, I will treat these matters pursuant to the provisions of the  
      Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 
      , for the supply of prohibited drug I find you guilty and you are subjected to a bond to be of good behaviour pursuant to s 33(1)(b) of the  
      Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987  
      for a period of twelve months.  
       
       
       
      73. In respect of the unlawfully obtain goods charge I find you guilty and because the maximum sentence for that is six months imprisonment I would only impose a bond of the same length, six months, pursuant to the same section. 
       
       
       
      74. For possessing prohibited drugs I find you guilty and a 12 month bond pursuant to the same provisions. 
       
       
       
      75. For the purposes of those bonds being executed and rather than see you go into custody, although I thank the custodial officer for being here, I remand you into the custody of your instructing solicitor and, do you want to be responsible Mr Haesler? 
       
       
      HAESLER: I’m happy to be responsible your Honour.

    JUDGMENTIntroduction1 Thomas Alfred Berryman makes application for a certificate to be issued pursuant to s.2 Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (“the Act”). The applicant was arraigned on 15 May 2006 on a number of charges of sexual assault relating to two complainants, J.C. and D.C.2 The respective complainants had made statements to police in relation to the allegations, or the bulk of them, in October and early November 1991. The applicant was in Europe and the United States between mid 1991 and February 2000. He was charged a number years after that return to Australia, in January 2005. The accused was acquitted by the jury at the end of the Crown case in relation to 3 counts (Counts 2, 3 and 5), leaving 3 counts to be considered. The jury returned verdicts of not guilty in relation to the remaining counts on 31 May 2006. 3 Application is now made for a certificate in circumstances set out in the detailed submission of the applicant. This application is opposed by the prosecution.Legal Principles to be Applied4 The Costs in Criminal Cases Act, 1967 relevantly provides: 
     
      
       “2.The Court or Judge ……. in any proceedings relating to an offence … punishable … upon indictment may - 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) where a defendant, after a hearing on the merits, is acquitted or discharged as to the information then under inquiry ….. grant to that defendant a certificate under this Act, specifying the matters referred to in  
        s.3 
         relating to those proceedings. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      3. (1) a certificate granted under this Act shall specify that, in the opinion of the Court …… granting the certificate –  
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings; and 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances”. 
        
       
      
    5 The application proceeds on the basis of the evidence from the proceedings, no further evidence or material (apart from submissions) has been produced by either party (cf. s.3A of the Act). The relevant provisions of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act have been considered in a number of decisions of the Court of Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal. The principal judgment concerned with their interpretation relevant to this matter is the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Allerton v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (1991) 24 NSWLR 550. In that matter the Court held: 
     
      
       “… (T)he task of court or judge, justice or justices in specifying their opinion is indeed to ask a hypothetical question, (as set out in s.3(1)(a)). But that question is addressed to evidence of all of the relevant facts, whether discovered before arrest or before committal (if any); after committal and before trial, during the trial or afterwards, admitted under s.3A of the Act. All of the relevant facts proved, whenever they became known to the prosecution and whether or not in evidence at the trial, must then be considered by the decision maker.  
      The decision maker must then ask whether, if the prosecution had evidence of all the relevant facts immediately before the proceedings were instituted it would not have reasonable to institute the proceedings 
      ” (559G-560B) –  
      emphasis added 
      . 
      
    6 The applicant bears the onus but even if an applicant establishes matters set out in s.3(1) of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act, he is not entitled as of course to a certificate for costs. A trial judge has a general discretion to refuse the application (Ramskogler v Director of Public Prosecutions and Anor (1995) 82 A.Crim R 128 (at 134-135, 142).7 In R v Pavy CCA (unreported) 9 December 1997, the Court of Criminal Appeal approved what had been observed by Blanch J in R v MacFarlane (unreported) 12 August 1994, that the primary test was whether it was reasonable to institute the proceedings if the prosecution had been in possession of all relevant facts known at the time of the application.8 In Regina v Groom [2000] NSW CCA 538, after citing Pavy with approval Smart AJ observed: 
     
      
       “As was pointed out in  
      Allerton 
       at 557-558 the “institution of proceedings” refers to the time of arrest or charge not to some later stage such as committal for trial or the finding of a bill” [9]. 
      
    9 Later in Groom Acting Justice Smart said: 
     
      
       “In almost every criminal case the law has to be applied to the facts. It is the facts which determine whether it was reasonable to prosecute (although) I can imagine cases where the law is unclear and there is much to be said on both sides. In such cases it would usually be reasonable for one to leave the issue to the court to decide and for the Crown to institute proceedings. This happens most regularly in prosecutions for dishonesty (etc). However, the present case involved no such complexities. The issue is simple, namely, whether the evidence was sufficient to enable a jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that (the appellant was guilty)[16]. While I agree that the jury system is an important part of the criminal justice system it does not follow that in all cases where sufficiency of evidence is the issue that it is reasonable for the Crown to prosecute”[17]. 
      
    10 Further he observed: 
     
      
       “I do not regard the general policy issue to which the Crown has referred (seeing justice be done) as relevant to the exercise required by s.3(1)(a) 
        
      of the Act. That is wholly objective, namely, whether on all the relevant facts it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings”[19].  
      
    11 Justices Barr and Greg James were in agreement. 12 In Regina v Bernard Lawrence Johnston (2000) NSW CCA 197, the Court rejected again the argument that the relevant discretion to grant a certificate (or not grant a certificate as the case may be) was that it was proper to prosecute because “it is necessary that justice be seen to be done”. Her Honour Justice Simpson, stated: 
     
      
      “I would …..expressly reject the argument by the Crown that a relevant consideration in the evaluative process and the exercise of the discretion is that “it is necessary that justice seem to be done”. The perception that justice is done is not advanced by the unreasonable institution of criminal prosecutions nor those based on evidence known to be inadequate to sustain a conviction” [19]. 
      
    13 She conveniently summarised the circumstances in which a certificate may be granted at para [16] of her judgment: 
     
      
       “The circumstances in which a certificate may be granted are those stated in  
      s.3 
       of the Act. They may conveniently be re-stated as involving the following process:  
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (i) an evaluation of all of the evidence as it emerged at trial;  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (ii) an assumption that all that evidence was available to the prosecution before the proceedings were instituted;  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (iii) a determination whether, if the prosecution had been in possession of all of that evidence, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings;  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        where it is concluded that, in those circumstances, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (iv) a determination whether any act or omission of the accused contributed to the commencement of or continuation of the proceedings;  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        and, where such an act or omission is found to exist:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (v) a determination whether that act or omission was, in the circumstances, reasonable”.  
        
       
      
    14 With her views Justice Wood expressly agreed.15 In Regina v Jonathon Harold Manley [2000] NSW CCA 196, the Court of Criminal Appeal considered the terms of ss.2 and 3 Costs in Criminal Cases Act, 1967 in the context of determining whether a Court of Criminal Appeal, differently constituted, could grant a Certificate under the Act. Wood CJ at CL said inter alia: 
     
      
       “In the ordinary course of events a prosecution may be launched where there is evidence to establish a  
      prima facie 
       case but that does not mean it is reasonable to launch a prosecution simply because a  
      prima facie 
       case exists. There may be cases where there is contradictory evidence and where it is reasonable to expect a prosecutor to make some evaluation of that evidence”. (Citing with approval Blanch J. in

    16 His Honour went on to say that he would be reluctant to attempt any exhaustive definition of the test of “reasonableness”. He said: 
     
      
       “It seems to be me that the section calls for an objective analysis of the whole of the relevant evidence …… Matters of judgment concerning credibility, demeanour and the like are likely to fall on the other side of the line of unreasonableness, being matters quintessentially within the realm of the ultimate fact finder, whether it be judge or jury”[14].  
      
    17 The “dismissal” or “acquittal” must be “on the merits” (R v Turner (and Ors) (1980) 1 NSWLR 19).The Crown Case18 It is not possible to detail all the evidence from the trial except merely to set out some key points. Three counts related to JC, three to DC. JC and DC were brothers, JC the elder. They and their mother had moved to Byron Bay to escape what I understood to be a violent domestic situation and the accused, who had lived in Byron Bay for some years before hand, befriended the family in early 1988 and took JC and the mother to karate classes he taught. The Crown case was that the accused had cultivated the relationship with the family to provide an opportunity for him to sexually assault firstly JC (on several occasions in 1988) and later DC, between late 1990 and April 1991. Counts 4 and 5 relating to DC occurring just before, or after, his 10th birthday and count 6 around Easter 1991 The accused was a local “identity”, with an interest in surfing, alternative remedies and social welfare. He had a connection with a local youth refuge which he helped found and at which he worked for a period. He was relatively well off to begin with and eventually was reasonably wealthy by local standards. He was generous to the family of the complainants. He provided material and emotional support to their mother, and to the children, and eventually the mother, the children and Ms Disson (who briefly had an affair with the accused after she had left the youth refuge as a client) resided in a property owned by the accused.19 The first assaults (Counts 1-3) were allegedly committed upon JC when he was 12 years of age. The first assault allegedly occurred when he was being baby sat in his own home, the second and third assaults allegedly occurred at the accused’s home after JC had accompanied a friend of the accused to Brisbane airport to pick him up after he had returned from a trip to Thailand. After the alleged assaults the accused maintained a relationship with the family. The evidence established that the mother in fact had travelled to a property near Nyngan in April 1989 after the mother claimed that JC had complained to her of the accused’s conduct in respect of the allegations in Counts 2 and 3. This occurred in March 1989. The assaults on DC allegedly followed the same pattern, however they occurred allegedly at the accused’s home when the complainant, on two separate occasions, stayed over with the accused by himself with the mother’s permission. DC, it was alleged, complained to his mother on or about 8 October 1991. The accused left Byron Bay as a permanent resident to return to Sydney in late 1990, although he still owned property in the township. He returned to Byron Bay around New Year 1990-1991 and around Easter 1991. In late June 1991 the applicant travelled to Europe and then onto the United States. The mother claimed in early June 1991 she confronted the accused in a telephone conversation about the assaults upon JC and the accused confessed. The first official complaint to authorities was made to an officer of the Department of Community Services in early October 1991. Subsequently complaints were made to officers of the New South Wales Police Service and statements were made by the respective complainants on 14 October and in early November 1991.Consideration20 The allegations of JC and DC were joined on the indictment and a limited tendency issue was left to the jury in relation to some of the counts. However, the Crown case in proof of guilt was dependent almost exclusively upon the truthfulness of JC and DC, supported to some extent by some evidence of relatively recent complaint, opportunity and purported admissions, or conduct amounting to consciousness of guilt, all arising from the mother’s evidence. As the trial was conducted, whilst the complainants were subject to attacks upon their credibility, some not misplaced, the most significant time within the Crown case with one witness was taken up with attacking the credibility and motives of the mother. 21 This unusual focus was not without merit because, if the mother was telling the truth, there had been relatively recent complaints by both complainants which enhanced their credibility. Such delays as occurred could readily be explained by the relationship of the accused with the family as well as their youth. The mother gave other evidence that tended to incriminate the accused by his conduct and his words. The evidence established a prima facie case in respect of each count.22 The Crown case effectively collapsed, it appeared to me, because the jury did not accept the mother as a witness of truth on critical matters and because the evidence revealed the complainants had been influenced by their mother and her bitterness towards the accused. Ms Disson, a romantic partner of both the accused and the mother, had been relied upon by the Crown to incriminate the accused in several ways, by suggesting he had a sexual interest in one of the complainants, the timing of which could not have been truthful or accurate, and by claiming the accused was in possession of embarrassing photographs which revealed him to have an interest in young boys while he was in Thailand, which evidence I rejected. The photos were never produced. Ms Disson was a transparently unreliable witness who the jury would not have had any trouble rejecting, both because of the detail of the evidence and her close relationship to the complainants’ mother. She had been clearly influenced by the complainants’ mother to give a statement to police approximately four months after the initial statements were given by the complainants to the police.23 There were some confounding aspects of the accused’s conduct, particularly the accused’s generosity and interest in the boys at different stages of their lives and his willingness to allow them independently to stay at his home several years apart. The jury may have found this perplexing, as did I, but suspicion of itself is no substitute for proof of guilt. On the other hand, at the trial the evidence was overwhelming that the accused was a generous person, an altruist in fact, not the mean spirited person that the complainants’ mother sought to portray in her evidence. It may have been that the mother told the truth about some of matters, however her bitterness towards the accused was barely concealed and her attempted portrayal of him in a negative fashion as an exploitive opportunist was overwhelmed by other far more reliable evidence. Eventually, the mother’s evidence and its manner of presentation was a liability to the Crown’s case. She bore the onslaught of the accused’s Counsel with stoicism, however those who are prepared to tell deliberate untruths are well capable of presenting in this way. Ultimately the verdicts of not guilty were inevitable. When confronted by contradictory material her prevarication was obvious. The coalition of improbabilities in the conduct of JC and the mother particularly, would have made it impossible for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of the allegations. In assessing this matter I have ignored the supposed speed of the return of ultimate verdicts in relation to Counts 1, 4 and 6 and that the jury did not wish to hear any more evidence regarding Counts 2, 3 and 5 at the end of the Crown case. These events however confirm with clarity, the lack of difficulty the jury had in concluding that the Crown had not proved the accused’s guilt.24 During the proceedings of course there was clear evidence of the accused’s good character, an aspect of which was his generosity and consideration for others. In that regard I am mindful of some evidence that was excluded from the jury’s consideration, particularly from Ms Disson, however in any event that her general reliability, as I have indicated, was highly suspect.25 The applicant has put a number of features of the case that establish, in his submission, that it was unreasonable to institute proceedings. Those matters may be paraphrased as follows: 
     
      
      i. JC stayed overnight with the accused after the alleged assault in Count 1. 
      
     
     
      
      ii. The alleged “common lie” regarding the accused having been picked up at Coolangatta Airport, rather than Brisbane Airport, after his trip to Thailand. 
      
     
     
      
      iii. Further contact by JC with the accused after the three assaults. 
      
     
     
      
      iv. The continued relationship of the mother of the complainants with the accused after learning of at least some of the assaults. 
      
     
     
      
      v. The permission given by the mother for DC to stay with the appellant after learning of the assaults upon JC. 
      
     
     
      
      vi. The credibility of the mother’s claims regarding contact with the accused after he went to Europe. 
      
     
     
      
      vii. The purported cross-contamination of accounts by JC and DC at the time of official complaint being made. 
      
     
     
      
      viii. The possibility of DC’s recollection of events when he spoke to police being contaminated by his mother’s influence as revealed by the interruption to his interview when he failed to remember being assaulted, spoke to his mother, and then remembered a relevant issue. 
      
     
     
      
      ix. The alleged colluded untruths of Ms Disson. 
      
     
     
      
      x. The affect of appropriate directions upon the Crown’s capacity to prove the guilt of the accused. 
      
     
     
      
      xi. The circumstances in which the “Prasad direction” was given. 
      
    26 I do not accept that matters (x) and (xi) are relevant to the determination of this matter. That relevant directions are required as a matter of law does not, in my view, reflect upon a particular feature of this case that would warrant the exercise of any discretion to issue a Certificate. The circumstances of the Prasad direction are not relevant because that direction was not given by reason of any view the Court held of the inherent weakness of the Crown case. It was given because as the case stood, proof of guilt of the accused in relation to each of the counts of the indictment, was dependant upon proof of a simple threshold issue. If the jury had a reasonable doubt about that issue, it entitled the jury to return a verdict of not guilty at that point. If my view, as reflected in the transcript, for giving a Prasad direction as requested by the accused was “in error”, no injustice was done to the Crown case as subsequent events, including the evidence in the defence case, demonstrated. This was a matter where, from the outset, the accused put to the jury that the complainants, in collusion with the mother, had in effect “put their heads together” to falsely accuse Mr Berryman. In my view the evidence established that these matters were driven by the mother in October 1991 because she had fallen out with the accused. 27 The various matters identified by the accused have been the subject of specific comment in the Crown’s submissions. I agree with what the Crown has put in relation to the matters raised in points (ii) and (viii). These matters are really matters of little moment in the assessment of the application. However the Crown’s response to the submissions encapsulated in (i), (iii) – (vii) does not adequately in my view reflect the evidence at the trial and its importance to the ultimate issues to be determined. 28 The evidence revealed that JC had contact with the accused after the various alleged assaults, in circumstances that reveal him to neither fear, loathe or resent the accused. Further, the mother’s attitude to the accused up until at least shortly before he left for overseas, but particularly after the first alleged complaint of JC, was inexplicable, if in fact some of the allegations of JC had been made to her as she claimed as early as March 1989. The complaint made was self evidently and inexplicably limited. There was also in this matter a real risk of cross contamination between the mother, JC and DC before the Department of Community Services was contacted in early October 1991. Further, there was an element of recent invention in the additional allegation of DC, made 13 years after his first statement, of oral sex performed upon him by the accused. In some respects his memory improved, in others it diminished. His capacity to describe the accused’s home was of little moment because there was no dispute that he and JC had been there.29 The Crown pointed to the complainants’ mother as “vulnerable”, explaining her permission for the accused to maintain contact with her family and moving to premises owned by the accused at Kendall Street Byron Bay after JC had complained of being abused. Rather than “vulnerable”, the evidence clearly established that she was at least “unconventional” in her approach to life and had, by her own admission, for some period of time been somewhat dysfunctional. She was however dependant upon the accused both materially and emotionally, at least up until the time that he left Byron Bay for Sydney and possibly beyond that, until the time that he went overseas. She was not “stupid” or inexperienced in the world. Nor at any relevant time was she inexperienced with abuse issues. She may, to some extent, have been manipulated emotionally by the accused but she, in my view, clearly had the capacity, materially and otherwise, to sever her connections with the accused if to do so would protect her children. This she would have done if relevant complaint had been made. I do not accept that her purported vulnerability would have permitted her to allow her children to be subjected to risk of sexual abuse, which is what she would have had the jury believe. Or, that she would have minimized the import of what JC had complained about, as she claimed in her evidence.30 The alleged “confession” of the accused made in early June 1991 I do not accept as the truth and neither did the jury. Nor would the jury have accepted his claimed obsession with JC. The claimed “admission” was an ex post facto exploitation by the mother of the accused’s contact with the religious Minister which was prompted by her own manipulative behaviour. On the Crown case, given the alleged cynical exploitation of the boys by the accused, the character of such a confession was highly unlikely.31 Although much of the weaknesses in the Crown case were exposed by cross-examination of key Crown witnesses and from material produced by the accused at trial, the key features of improbability must have been apparent from the chronology of events known to the prosecution, particularly coming from the mother.32 The accused gave impressive evidence of denial of guilt. His oral evidence and supporting documentation created a positive case to rebut the evidence of the complainants and their mother, both as to facts in issue as well as to the credibility of his accusers. In the context of relevant material to be considered when addressing the question posed in s.3(1)(a) of the Act, it confirms the view I have come to that it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings.33 As to whether the accused has by any act or omission contributed to the institution of proceedings, I note that he exercised his right to silence on arrest and that the bulk of material raised in his “defence”, was produced at trial. His absence overseas, after the mother claimed he had “confessed”, may have compounded the suspicions attaching to the conduct of the accused, as alleged by the complainants. The accused’s conduct might have contributed to the institution of the proceedings but ultimately I do not think it did. Even if it did so, I note that when absent overseas, the accused instructed solicitors to undertake proper enquiry, to be advised that enquires of the Lismore Child Mistreatment Unit “have not revealed any complaints” against him. This information was incorrect, but not through any fault of the accused or his solicitors. The police negligence or incompetence in this matter was such that whilst a warrant was issued for the accused’s arrest at least by early 1992, when it was known the accused was overseas, apparently the Department of Immigration or other relevant Federal Agencies were not advised. The accused returned to Australia in February 2000, went overseas in August 2004 (and returned), but was not arrested until January 2005. The delay in prosecuting the matter was no fault of the accused (absent a finding of deliberate failure to submit to the jurisdiction between early 1992 and 2000), yet no fault either of the Director of Public Prosecutions. At no time was there a deliberate withholding of evidence given the “adversarial character” of the proceedings (Manley at [76]-[78]).Conclusion34 I have concluded that if the prosecution, before the proceedings were instituted, had been in possession of evidence of all relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings and that any actions of the accused that might have contributed to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in all the circumstances, particularly his contribution to delay and his exercise of his right to silence. I propose to exercise the Court’s discretion to issue a Certificate. I have considered the issue of whether I should issue a Certificate under the Act expressed as a percentage of the applicant’s costs (Treasurer (NSW) v Ianelli [1999] NSWCA – unreported 9 February 1999). Given my earlier findings I cannot justify the exercise of the discretion available to do so in this matter.

    1 GILES J A: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    3 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Mimi Oudomvilay, pleaded guilty in the District Court to four charges of fraudulently omitting to account and two charges of fraudulent misappropriation, both of them offences under s128A Crimes Act, carrying a maximum sentence of seven years imprisonment. The first three charges were fraudulently omitting to account, the fourth and fifth charges were fraudulent misappropriation, and the sixth was a further charge of fraudulently omitting to account. She asked that a further charge of fraudulently omitting to account be taken into account on a Form One. 
     
      
    4 She was sentenced as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        On the fifth charge (fraudulent misappropriation), imprisonment for three years and nine months with a non-parole period of two years and three months, dating from 11 March 2005; 
        
       
       
        
        On the first charge (fraudulently omitting to account), taking into account the offence on the Form One, imprisonment for four and a half years with a non-parole period of one year and nine months, dating from 11 June 2007; 
        
       
       
        
        On the second charge (fraudulently omitting to account), imprisonment for a fixed term of three years and four months, dating from the 11 March 2005; 
        
       
       
        
        On the third charge (fraudulently omitting to account), imprisonment for a fixed term of three years, dating from 11 March 2005; 
        
       
       
        
        On the fourth charge (fraudulent misappropriation), imprisonment for a fixed term of two years and three months, dating from 11 March 2005; 
        
       
       
        
        On the sixth charge (fraudulently omitting to account), imprisonment for a fixed term of three years dating from 11 March 2005. 
        
       
      
    5 It will be seen that the sentences on all charges but the first were to commence on 11 March 2005. The sentence on the first charge was to commence on the 11 June 2007, at the expiration of the non-parole period fixed in respect of the fifth charge. The overall sentence is imprisonment for six years and nine months with an effective non-parole period of four years, dating from 11 March 2005. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against these sentences. 
     
      
       
      Facts  
       
      
    6 The applicant is a woman of Laotian descent, who at the relevant time was practicing as a solicitor at Fairfield. She was also the president of an organisation known as the Lao Community Advancement Co-operative. Many of the clients of her practice were from the Lao and general Asian communities. The learned sentencing judge observed that these clients “typically possessed poor English skills and placed a high degree of trust” in the applicant because of her role as president of the Co-operative.  
     
      
    7 The offences occurred over the period between December 2002 and October 2003, and involved the applicant’s misuse for her own purposes of money in her trust account. There is no need to recite the facts of each of the offences, although it will be necessary later to refer to the fifth charge. Her Honour described the pattern of the offences in this way:  
     
      
       
        
        The prisoner would typically take trust money from one client without authorisation and convert the trust cheque into an equivalent amount as a bank cheque. The bank cheque would then be used to pay for her business or personal expenses. The withdrawal from the trust account would be disguised by the prisoner falsifying the payee details on the ledger and creating false file notes and other documentation to ‘support’ these transactions. 
        
       
       
        
        When clients from whom the prisoner had taken funds requested the return of their money, she would generally ‘stall’ them until she could again use the trust funds of another client to pay them. Again these subsequent unauthorised transactions would be disguised as previously described. 
        
       
      
    8 As will be seen, the victim of the offence the subject of the fifth charge was the Lao Community Advancement Co-operative. Otherwise, apart from the offences the subject of the first and second charges, the victims of the offences were people from the applicant’s Asian client base. In October 2003 the management of the practice was undertaken by the New South Wales Law Society and the applicant’s dealings were investigated. The total amount defrauded by her was, in round figures, $809,350.00. It appears that the practice had not been profitable, and the applicant spent the money on wages and other expenses relating to the practice, together with personal expenses.  
     
      
    9 At the time of sentence, all the clients of the practice but one had been reimbursed by the Fidelity Fund, and the remaining client was in the process of being paid. The Co-operative had also been repaid but, as her Honour observed, “at the expense of others”. The applicant herself repaid only $13,400.00, the amount the subject of the offence on the Form 1.  
     
      
    10 Her Honour noted that, from statements given to police by members of the applicant’s staff, it appeared that she had “directed them to make false entries in ledgers and to assist her in the creation of various false documents”. Her Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        She attempted to disguise her fraudulent activities from both her clients and the Law Society trust account inspectors through various deceptions and the use of false documents. When initially interviewed she could not remember where the majority of the funds, fraudulently taken from her trust account, were used. Investigators therefore identified a number of personal and business expenses paid by her using trust account funds that explain the shortfall at receivership in her trust account.  
        
       
      
    11 A statement of facts recorded that the applicant appeared to be remorseful and had claimed that she intended to make good the shortfall arising from the offences. Her Honour found that she appeared to be “relatively truthful when interviewed by police, with the exception of deliberately attempting to minimise the involvement of others, such as staff and family members, in her fraudulent activity”.  
     
      
       
      Subjective Case  
       
      
    12 The applicant was thirty-seven years old at the time of the offences and is now forty. She has no prior convictions. She is married and has four children. At the time of sentence her Honour found that the children could be cared for by her husband and her mother, but noted that the inevitable effect upon the children of her imprisonment was “a very sad aspect of this case”. Her Honour also observed that the applicant had lost her livelihood as a solicitor and her “considerable standing in the Lao community”.  
     
      
    13 It seems that the offences had compromised her relationship with her extended family. At the time of sentence her home was about to be sold to creditors, and her Honour described her as “without funds”. Fortunately, she retained the support of her husband, her mother and some close friends. Her Honour accepted that her conditions of custody would be more onerous because of her concern about her children. 
     
      
       
      The Application 
       
      
    14 Three grounds of the application were notified. Two of them relate to particular aspects of her Honour’s approach to sentence. The third is that the overall sentence and effective non-parole period are manifestly excessive. This was not pursued as a separate ground at the hearing. Counsel for the applicant, Mr Corish, acknowledged that the effective sentence, while severe, was within the available range. His argument was that the matters identified in the first two grounds demonstrated that the sentencing process had miscarried, and that the Court should intervene and impose a lesser sentence.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1 – the 5th charge 
       
      
    15 The fifth charge related to a cheque for a substantial sum to the Lao Community Advancement Co-operative, following the maturation of a term deposit held by the Co-operative. The applicant deposited this cheque into her trust account and used the proceeds to pay personal and business expenses. It seems that she later withdrew trust money held on behalf of some of her clients, without authorisation, and deposited it into the Co-operative’s account. In this way she concealed her fraudulent use of the Co-operatives money. It was this which led to her Honour’s finding, previously referred to, that repayment of the Co-operative had been “at the expense of others”. 
     
      
    16 Her Honour found that this offence was aggravated by the fact that the applicant “was prepared to take money of clients to protect her standing in the Lao community, even though temporarily”. Mr Corish noted that her Honour had elsewhere in the remarks on sentence found the offences to be “objectively serious” and to involve “a very significant breach of trust”. He submitted that it was inappropriate to find, as an additional aggravating circumstance, that the applicant owed a duty to the Laotian community and the Co-operative because of her ethnicity. He also argued that there was no evidence to support a finding that her purpose in using clients’ money to make good the loss to the Co-operative was to support her standing within that community.  
     
      
    17 In my view, this argument misconceives what her Honour was saying. The aggravating circumstance her Honour found was not simply that the applicant sought to protect her standing in her community. It was that she did so by using her clients’ money to conceal her fraud. It was the use of clients’ money which was the gravamen of the finding although, in my view, the additional finding that the applicant’s motive was to protect her standing within the community was also open. This ground is not made out. 
     
      
    Ground 2 – extra curial punishment 
     
      
    18 Mr Corish submitted that her Honour had failed to take into account as a mitigating factor the fact that the applicant had been struck off the roll of solicitors. Her Honour referred to that matter when summarising the subjective case, noting that she had “lost her right, indeed privilege, to be a solicitor”. Her Honour did not mention the matter again and Mr Corish argued that, from the fact that it was not specifically referred to as a mitigating factor, it should be inferred that it was not taken into account as such. He submitted that it should have been, as it amounted to a form of extra curial punishment. He referred to R v Daetz & Anor (2003) 139 A Crim R 398, particularly per James J at [61]-[63]. 
     
      
    19 Before outlining the applicant’s subjective case, her Honour had set out the applicable mitigating factors under s21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. These included her plea of guilty and her prior good character, and her Honour’s finding that she had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to re-offend. Extra curial punishment is not one of the mitigating factors set out in subs (3). No doubt, that is why her Honour referred a little later to the applicant’s loss of her career as a solicitor. It was in the context of her Honour’s assessment of the deleterious effects upon the applicant of the offences, including her loss of standing in her community and the compromise of her relationship with members of her extended family.  
     
      
    20 It was appropriate for her Honour to have regard to all those matters in mitigation of sentence and, clearly, it was for that purpose that she referred to them. This ground also fails. 
     
      
    21 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

     Stephen GARRETT v Geoffrey Noel FREEMAN 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCOLL JA: I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgment of James J. I agree with his Honour’s reasons and the orders he proposes. I would add the following observations concerning the question raised in the Stated Case concerning the commencement of the prosecutions.  
     
      
    2 Section 179 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 (the “Parks Act”) relevantly provides that “any legal proceedings for an offence against … this Act … may only be taken by a police officer or by a person duly authorised by the Director-General in that behalf, either generally or in any particular case.”  
     
      
    3 Lloyd J concluded that proceedings commenced by the respondent, “Stephen Garrett for and on behalf of the Director General of the Department of the Environment and Conservation” had been commenced by him in his own right: Stephen Garrett for and on behalf of the Director-General, Department of Environment and Conservation (NSW) v Freeman [2006] NSWLEC 322. 
     
      
    4 His Honour held (at [14]) that the proceedings had been commenced by the respondent because he concluded that the present case was relevantly indistinguishable from Stuckey v Iliff [1960] HCA 57; (1960) 105 CLR 164.  
     
      
    5 Stuckey v Iliff turned on whether proceedings had been commenced “in the name of the Commissioner” as required by s 244 of the Income Tax and Social Security Contribution Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) so as to be characterised as a “taxation prosecution” for the purposes of s 243 of that Act. The proceedings had been commenced by “Iliff, an officer of the Taxation Branch of the Department of the Treasury, in the name of and for and on behalf of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation …”. Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Kitto, Menzies and Windeyer JJ concluded that in order to satisfy s 244 the information had to be in the Commissioner’s name whereas, on its face, it was in Iliff’s name. Applying that literal approach their Honours concluded that the complaint was Iliff’s and not the Commissioner’s. The Court did not expressly consider the significance of the phrase “for and on behalf of….”. It was concerned only with the question whether the proceedings had been commenced in the Commissioner’s name, not whether Iliff had brought the proceedings on behalf of the Commissioner. 6 The critical question in the present case is the capacity in which the respondent brought the proceedings. The Prosecutor in each summons was identified as: 
     
      
       
        
        “Stephen Garrett for and on behalf of the Director-General of the Department of the Environment and Conservation.”  
        
       
      
    7 Resolution of that question turns on the meaning of the phrase “for and on behalf of”. Words indicating something is done on behalf of another (per procurationem) are classic words of agency indicating that A (in this case the respondent) is acting on B’s (in this case the Director-General’s) behalf: London City Council v Agricultural Food Products Ltd [1955] 2QB 218 at 222 per Denning LJ; at 223–224 per Romer LJ; see also McRae v Coulton (1986) 7 NSWLR 644 at 663–666 per Hope JA (with whom Kirby P and McHugh JA agreed); O’Reilly v Commissioners of State Bank of Victoria [1982] HCA 74; (1983) 153 CLR 1 at 10-11 per Gibbs CJ (with whom Murphy J agreed). 
     
      
    8 It was common ground that it was the respondent (among others, but not including the Director-General) who had been authorised to commence prosecutions for breaches of the Parks Act. Section 179 required that he commence the proceedings in his own capacity as a person so authorised. Instead he commenced them as agent for the Director-General. That did not comply with s 179. Accordingly, Lloyd J erred in concluding (at [15]) that the proceedings had been brought by a person duly authorised by the Director-General in that behalf and, further, (at [16]) in concluding that the words “for and on behalf of the Director-General of the Department of the Environment and Conservation” were mere surplusage. They were not. They indicated the capacity in which the respondent had commenced the prosecutions. 
     
      
    9 I agree with Lloyd J, however, that the defect thus exposed was capable of cure pursuant to s 16(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Subject to the decision in R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 281; (2005) 64 NSWLR 10, to which I will shortly come, Crothers v Sheil [1933] HCA 42; (1933) 49 CLR 399 was authority for the proposition that s 16(2) applied in the present circumstances. 
     
      
    10 A critical distinction between R v Janceski and this case, in my view, was that the defect at issue in that case did not fall within either s 16 or s 17 of the Criminal Procedure Act: see R v Janceski (at [79]) per Spigelman CJ (with whom Woods CJ at CL (at [173]) agreed, adding (at [206]) his agreement with the proposition that s 16 could not be called in aid to cure the defect in the indictment; see also Howie J (at [273]), with whom Hunt AJA (at [212]) agreed; Johnson J agreeing with Howie J (at [287]). That situation was remedied after Janceski by the insertion of subs (1)(i) in s 16. 
     
      
    11 It is, accordingly, inapposite, for the appellant to seek to pray in aid Spigelman CJ’s observation (R v Janceski at [90]) that: “the criminal law is one of the last areas of the law in which a technical point is still a good point.” That observation must be understood to be subject to the historic availability of provisions such as that now enshrined in s 16 of the Criminal Procedure Act, intended to ensure that defects to which it applies do not invalidate criminal proceedings or convictions. This legislation, as James J has said, derives from Lord Jervis’ Act, the history of which was traced by Jordan CJ in Ex parte Lovell; re Buckley (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 153 at 167 ff. 
     
      
    12 Lord Jervis’ Act was, as Jordan CJ pointed out (at 170) adopted in New South Wales in 1850. The purpose of Lord Jervis’ Act was to render summary convictions “less open to attack” in circumstances where “large numbers of delinquents escaped punishment upon grounds some of which were highly technical.” (Lovell at 167; see also Boral Gas (NSW) Pty Ltd v Magill & Anor (1993) 32 NSWLR 501 at 515–518 per Mahoney JA). 
     
      
    13 Section 16 operated, accordingly to allow the proceedings to continue notwithstanding the defect in their commencement and be disposed of on their merits: Boral Gas (NSW) Pty Ltd v Magill & Anor (at 517); Corporate Affairs Commission v Bain (1991) 55 A Crim R 73 at 78. 
     
      
    14 GROVE J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of James J in draft form. 
     
      
    15 At the hearing there was, as his Honour has noted, agreement between the contesting parties that s 179 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 providing that legal proceedings for an offence against the Act “may only be taken by a police officer or by a person duly authorized by the Director-General (of the Department of Environment and Conservation) in that behalf, either generally or in any particular case” be construed so that, while there was no limit on the range of persons who could be authorized, the Director-General could not institute proceedings herself. Whether that exclusion could be overcome by the Director-General solemnly authorizing herself does not need to be addressed. 
     
      
    16 Resort to dictionaries reveals that the word “behalf” has etymological roots in notions of division or share such as in old expressions like “on his halve”. On one view, “in that behalf” may connote delegation of a shared (halved) power, therefore a power by necessary implication vested in the delegator. I wish simply to record a reservation about the assumption of the correctness of the concession concerning the exclusion of the Director-General. 
     
      
    17 In the present instance, as James J has pointed out, the respondent proclaimed his institution of proceedings to be “for and on behalf” of the Director-General which are words of agency. The clear purpose of the proclamation was that the respondent was agent for the sole person who was conceded for the purposes of the case stated to be incapable of instituting proceedings. 
     
      
    18 In the light of the practical consequences of the answers which his Honour has proposed to questions 5, 6 and 7, answers to questions 2, 3 and 4 may not be required to resolve the issues in the prosecution, but in the circumstances and acting upon the agreed construction which was not debated, I do not dissent from his analysis and reasons. 
     
      
    19 I agree with the answers which James J has proposed to the questions asked in the case stated.20 JAMES J: This is a case stated by his Honour Justice Lloyd of the Land and Environment Court pursuant to s 5AE of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 submitting a number of questions of law to this Court for determination by it. 
     
      
    21 Two prosecutions commenced by summons were brought in the Land and Environment Court as being within Class 5 of that Court’s jurisdiction (proceedings number 50043 of 2005 and 50044 of 2005). 
     
      
    22 The defendant to both summonses was Mr Geoffrey Noel Freeman, who is the appellant in this Court. At all relevant times Mr Freeman was an employee of the Port Macquarie-Hastings Council. 
     
      
    23 Before the summonses were amended pursuant to leave granted by Lloyd J on 8 June 2006 the prosecutor was identified in each summons as “Stephen Garrett for and on behalf of the Director-General of the Department of Environment and Conservation”. In this appeal Mr Garrett is identified as being the respondent. 
     
      
    24 Each prosecution was based on ss 118D and 175B of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974. 
     
      
    25 Section 118D of the National Parks and Wildlife Act provides, so far as is relevant, that a person must not do anything that causes danger to any habitat (other than a critical habitat) of a threatened species if the person knows that the land concerned is habitat of that kind. In proceedings number 50043 of 2005 the threatened species was identified as the eastern chestnut mouse. In proceedings number 50044 of 2005 the threatened species was identified as the grass owl. In each summons it was alleged that the Council had caused damage to the habitat of the threatened species by undertaking the construction of road works, knowing that the land concerned was habitat for the species.  
     
      
    26 Section 175B of the National Parks and Wildlife Act provides, so far as is relevant, that, if any corporation contravenes any provision of the Act, each person who is concerned in the management of the corporation is taken to have contravened the same provision, unless the person can satisfy the court of one or more of certain matters. None of these matters are relevant to the present appeal. 
     
      
    27 In each summons it was alleged that the appellant had committed an offence against s 118D by reason of s 175B of the National Parks and Wildlife Act, in that the Council being a corporation had committed an offence against s 118D of the Act and the appellant had been concerned in the management of the Council. 
     
      
    28 The appellant pleaded not guilty to both of the charges. Similar charges based on s 118D of the Act had also been brought against the Council, which pleaded guilty to the charges. 
     
      
    29 The hearing of the charges against the appellant took place before Lloyd J in June 2006. 
     
      
    30 At the hearing it was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the proceedings were defective, because they had been taken otherwise than in accordance with the requirements of the National Parks and Wildlife Act and in particular s 179. Section 179 of the Act provides, so far as is relevant, that any legal proceedings for an offence against the Act “may only be taken by a police officer or by a person duly authorised by the Director-General (of National Parks and Wildlife) in that behalf, either generally or in any particular case”. It was submitted that on the proper interpretation of s 179 proceedings for an offence against the Act can be taken only by a police officer or by a person authorised by the Director-General and cannot be taken by the Director-General herself. However, it was submitted, both of the proceedings had been taken by the Director-General and not by Mr Garrett.  
     
      
    31 Lloyd J delivered a judgment dated 8 June 2006, which is annexed to the stated case. In his judgment Lloyd J held that each of the proceedings had been taken by Mr Garrett and not the Director-General and that the words in the description of the prosecutor in each summons “for and on behalf of the Director-General of the Department of Environment and Conservation” were mere surplusage. It will be necessary to refer to Lloyd J’s judgment of 8 June 2006 in more detail later in this judgment. 
     
      
    32 At the hearing in the Land and Environment Court the prosecutor made two applications concerning the description of the prosecutor in the summonses, namely:- 
     
      
    1. That the provisions of s 16(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 should be applied in favour of the prosecutor. 
     
      
    2. That leave should be granted to the prosecutor to amend the summonses pursuant to Pt 20 of the Supreme Court Rules 1970 by deleting from the description of the prosecutor the words “for and on behalf of the Director-General of the Department of Environment and Conservation”. 
     
      
    33 Section 16(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act is one of the many statutory provisions derived from the original imperial enactment known as “Lord Jervis’ Act”. It provides that no objection may be taken or allowed to any indictment by which criminal proceedings are commenced “on the grounds of any alleged defect in it in substance or in form”. 
     
      
    34 It has been common ground between the parties before Lloyd J and on this appeal that, by virtue of s 15 of the Criminal Procedure Act, s 16(2) of that Act applied to the proceedings in the Land and Environment Court, the word “indictment” in s 16(2) being read as a reference to each of the summonses. 
     
      
    35 Lloyd J decided that, if he was wrong in holding that the words in the description of the prosecutor in each summons “for and on behalf of the Director-General of the Department of Environment and Conservation” were mere surplusage, then the presence of those words was a defect falling within s 16(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act and was cured by s 16(2). 
     
      
    36 Lloyd J also decided that leave should be granted to the prosecutor to amend the summonses pursuant to Pt 20 r 4(3) of the Supreme Court Rules by deleting the words “for and on behalf of the Director-General of the Department of Environment and Conservation”. It has been common ground between the parties that Part 20 of the Supreme Court Rules was applicable to the proceedings in the Land and Environment Court.37 After the prosecutor had closed the prosecution case at the hearing before Lloyd J, it was submitted on behalf of Mr Freeman that there was no case to answer in either proceeding. This submission was based on s 731 of the Local Government Act 1993 which provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A matter or thing done by the Minister, the Director-General, a council, a councillor, a member of a committee of the council or an employee of the council or any person acting under the direction of the Minister, the Director-General, the council or a committee of the council does not, if the matter or thing was done in good faith for the purpose of executing this or any other Act, and for and on behalf of the Minister, the Director-General, the council or a committee of the council, subject a councillor, a member, an employee or a person so acting personally to any action, liability, claim or demand.” 
        
       
      
    38 At the hearing of the appeal counsel for the appellant isolated the words in the section which he submitted were relevant as being:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A matter or thing done by…an employee of the council…does not, if the matter or thing was done in good faith for the purpose of executing this or any other Act and for and on behalf of…the council… subject…an employee…to any action liability claim or demand”. 
        
       
      
    39 Lloyd J found that what the appellant had done had been done by him as an employee of the Council, had been done in good faith for the purpose of executing the Local Government Act and for and on behalf of the Council. The only matter in issue was whether s 731 extended to criminal prosecutions, so that an employee of a council, if the conditions for the operation of the section were otherwise satisfied, would not be subjected to any criminal liability. 
     
      
    40 In a judgment dated 15 June 2006, which is annexed to the stated case, Lloyd J concluded that the exemption from liability in s 731 of the Act did not extend to criminal prosecutions. 41 In the case stated by Lloyd J the appellant’s contentions are stated as being:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The appellant contends that I have erred in law in the interpretation of:- 
        
       
       
        
        a) s 731 of  
        the Local Government Act 
        , 
         
        b) s 179 of the  
        National Parks and Wildlife Act 
        , 
         
        c) s 16(2) of the  
        Criminal Procedure Act 
        , and  
         
        d) Part 20 Rule 4 of the incorporated  
        Supreme Court Rules 
        .” 
        
       
      
    42 In the stated case the contentions by the respondent are stated as being that the various decisions made by Lloyd J were correct for the reasons given by his Honour. It is also contended that an additional reason why Lloyd J’s decision of 15 June 2006 should be regarded as being correct is that it is in conformity with New South Wales Bar Association v Muirhead (1998) 14 NSWLR 173 per Kirby P at 195 D-E, Hope JA agreeing at 198. 
     
      
    43 In the stated case the questions submitted to this Court for determination are stated as being:- 
     
      
       
        
        1. Did I err in law in holding that s 731 of the Local Government Act does not apply to criminal prosecutions? 
        
       
       
        
        2. Did I err in law in finding that the proceedings were in each case taken by the respondent rather than by the Director-General of the Department of Environment and Conservation? 
        
       
       
        
        3. Did I err in law in finding that the proceedings were in each case properly taken by the respondent for the purposes of s 179 National Parks and Wildlife Act? 
        
       
       
        
        4. Did I err in law in finding that the words in the name of the prosecutor in the summonses, “for and on behalf of the Director-General of the Department of Environment and Conservation”, were mere surplusage? 
        
       
       
        
        5. Did I err in law in finding that the inclusion of the words “for and on behalf of the Director-General of the Department of Environment and Conservation” in each of the summonses was governed by s 16(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act? 
        
       
       
        
        6. Did I err in law in finding that there was a mistake in the name of the party in the summonses for the purposes of Part 20 Rule 4(3) of the incorporated Supreme Court Rules? 
        
       
       
        
        7. Did I err in law in permitting the second further amendment to each of the summonses? 
        
       
      
    44 I will deal with each of the questions in turn.  
     
      
       
      1. Did I err in law in holding that s 731 of the Local Government Act does not apply to criminal prosecutions? 
       
      
    45 I have already set out earlier in this judgment the full terms of s 731 of the Local Government Act and also those of its terms which were isolated by counsel for the appellant as being the relevant terms in the present appeal. It is convenient to repeat the terms of s 731 which were isolated by counsel for the appellant, as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A matter or thing done by…an employee of the council…does not, if the matter or thing was done in good faith for the purpose of executing this or any other Act and for and on behalf of…the council…subject…an employee…to any action liability claim or demand”. 
        
       
      
    46 On this appeal there was no dispute that each matter or thing done by the appellant, who was an employee of the Council, was done by him in good faith for the purpose of executing the Local Government Act and for and on behalf of the Council. The only issue is whether s 731 protects the appellant from being subjected to criminal liability. It was accepted by counsel for the appellant that, of the collection of words “action, liability, claim or demand” in s 731, only the word “liability” could be apt to include criminal liability. 
     
      
    47 In his judgment of 15 June 2006 Lloyd J held that an exemption from liability provision such as s 731 is to be strictly construed, citing Board of Fire Commissioners (NSW) v Ardouin [1961] HCA 71; (1961) 109 CLR 105 especially per Kitto J at 116 and Bankstown City Council v Alamdo Holdings Pty Ltd (2004) 135 LGERA 312 per Spigelman CJ at 321 (33-34). Lloyd J observed that Alamdo Holdings had been reversed by the High Court ((2005) 79 ALJR 1511) but the principle of construction stated by Spigelman CJ in the Court of Appeal had remained undisturbed.  
     
      
    48 Lloyd J concluded at par 22 of his judgment:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In applying the principles referred to in the Court of Appeal and in the High Court in  
        Alamdo Holdings 
         — that is, to give the exemption from liability provision the most strict interpretation its words demand, and by having regard to the scope and purpose of the section — I conclude that it does not offer protection from criminal prosecution. If an employee of a council commits a criminal offence which applies to all citizens generally, then any subsequent criminal prosecution is not an “action, liability, claim or demand” within the meaning of s 731 of the Act.” 
        
       
      
    49 Lloyd J also considered that the language used in s 731 was the language of civil actions and not criminal proceedings.  
     
      
    50 It was submitted by counsel for the appellant on this appeal that the word “liability” in s 731 had to be interpreted in context and that the context included, not merely the other terms of s 731, but the rest of the Local Government Act.  
     
      
    51 It was submitted that in a number of other sections of the Local Government Act the legislature has expressly provided that the sections are to be limited in their operation to “civil” proceedings or, conversely, that the sections are to be limited in their operation to “criminal” proceedings. Counsel referred to ss 8(2), 439(2), 440(8), 647(5) and 679(5) and to ss 440C, 440D and 440E. Counsel pointed out that in s 731 the legislature had not expressly limited the operation of the section to civil proceedings.  
     
      
    52 Attention was drawn by counsel for the appellant to the apparent width of the words in s 731, “any action, liability, claim or demand”. Counsel pointed to the difference in language between those words in s 731 and the different collections of words used in certain other sections of the Act, for example in s 679(5) where the words used are “any civil claim, action or proceeding”. 
     
      
    53 It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that Alamdo Holdings was of little assistance in the present case because it was concerned with the interpretation of s 733 of the Act, which has a different context from s 731, and in Alamdo Holdings in the High Court Gleeson CJ, Gummow J, Hayne J and Callinan J had stressed at par 36 of their joint judgment “the importance which must be attached to context indicates the caution with which there must be approached holdings in cases upon statutes with a different subject, scope and purpose to that of s 733”.  
     
      
    54 Counsel for the appellant submitted that the liability, if any, of the appellant was a derivative liability, the Council itself being the principal offender, and that s 731, on the interpretation urged by counsel for the appellant, would strike an appropriate balance between the various competing interests, by exempting from liability, including criminal liability, any person acting in a derivative capacity, provided that the other conditions in the section were satisfied, while not affecting the liability of the principal offender, the council.  
     
      
    55 Counsel also referred to s 353A (1A) of the Crimes Act 1900 (since repealed) as an example of a statutory provision where the words “action, liability, claim or demand” could not be read down so that the word “liability” only applied to civil liability. 
     
      
    56 Counsel for the respondent accepted that the word “liability” is capable of referring to criminal liability, as well as civil liability. However, it was submitted that the other words with which the word “liability” occurs in s 731, namely “action”, “claim” and “demand” are words which are inapt to refer to criminal proceedings and hence the immediate context in s 731 would suggest that “liability” in s 731 does not extend to criminal liability. 
     
      
    57 It was submitted by counsel for the respondent that the other sections of the Local Government Act to which counsel for the appellant had referred the Court were in such different contexts as not to provide any assistance in interpreting s 731. 
     
      
    58 Reliance was placed by counsel for the respondent on the principle of construction of statutory provisions exempting from liability, which had been referred to by Lloyd J, and to what, it was submitted, would be the far-reaching consequences of interpreting s 731 so as to protect councillors, members of committees, employees of councils and other persons acting under direction, from any kind of criminal liability. 
     
      
    59 Counsel for the respondent referred to Fowler v Taylor [1957] VR 593 (Dean J) and New South Wales Bar Association v Muirhead as supporting the respondent’s submissions. 
     
      
    60 I will now proceed to consider the submissions made by counsel. 
     
      
    61 I accept that s 731 of the Local Government Act must be interpreted in its context (Alamdo Holdings at [36]). 
     
      
    62 The immediate context of the word “liability” in s 731 is that it is joined with the words “action”, “claim” and “demand” and, as was submitted by counsel for the respondent and not disputed by counsel for the appellant, none of those other words would be apt to refer to criminal proceedings or to criminal charges. Hence, the immediate context of the word “liability” tends to favour the respondent. 
     
      
    63 I accept the submission by counsel for the appellant that, apart from the general statements of principle about the interpretation of statutory provisions conferring exemptions from liability, the judgments of the Court of Appeal and of the High Court in Alamdo Holdings, which concerned s 733 of the Local Government Act, are of little assistance. 
     
      
    64 Section 733 of the Local Government Act provides that a council does not incur any liability in respect of any advice furnished in good faith by a council relating to the likelihood of any land being flooded or the nature or extent of any flooding or any thing done or omitted to be done in good faith by the council insofar as it relates to the likelihood of land being flooded or the nature or extent of any such flooding. 
     
      
    65 One issue in Alamdo Holdings, which was ultimately resolved in favour of the Council, was whether the Council had acted in good faith.  
     
      
    66 Another issue, which was also ultimately resolved in favour of the Council by the High Court, overruling the Court of Appeal, was whether s 733 protected the council from liability to injunctive relief. The High Court held that the need of a council for protection against injunctive relief, which might require substantial expenditure of funds to comply with the injunctive relief, was no less than if a court, in lieu of injunctive relief, had awarded damages in a similar substantial sum. 
     
      
    67 I do not consider that the other sections of the Local Government Act to which this Court and Lloyd J were referred by counsel for Mr Freeman offer any assistance in interpreting s 731.  
     
      
    68 The Local Government Act is an extremely long Act containing over 700 sections and the other sections of the Act to which counsel referred occur in different chapters of the Act from s 731 and deal with quite different subject matters and in each case it is obvious why the legal proceedings referred to are limited to either civil proceedings or criminal proceedings. 
     
      
    69 Section 8 of the Act sets out “a charter” a council has and then in sub-s (2) provides that a council in the exercise of its functions must pursue its charter but that nothing in the charter or in s 8 gives rise to, or can be taken into account in, any civil cause of action. The obvious intention of sub-s (2) is to prevent a failure by a council to observe its charter grounding a civil cause of action against the council or being taken into account in a civil cause of action against the council. 
     
      
    70 Sections 439 and 440 occur in chapter 14 of the Act which is headed ”Honesty and disclosure of interests”. Section 439 requires members of a council and others to act honestly and exercise a reasonable degree of care and diligence in carrying out their functions. Sub-section (2) provides that nothing in s 439 gives rise to, or can be taken into account in, any civil cause of action. Section 440 provides that regulations under the Act may prescribe a model code of conduct for members of councils and others. Sub-section (8) provides that nothing in s 440 or in a code gives rise to, or can be taken into account in, any civil cause of action. The obvious intention of s 439(2) and s 440(8) is to prevent any contravention of s 439 or of a code grounding a civil cause of action or being taken into account in a civil cause of action, while at the same time preserving any criminal liability. 
     
      
    71 Section 647(5) occurs in chapter 16 of the Act which is headed “Offences” and section 679(5) occurs in chapter 17 of the Act which is headed “Enforcement”. Both provisions state that payment of a penalty notice for an offence is not to be regarded as an admission of liability for the purpose of, and does not affect or prejudice, any civil claim, action or proceeding arising out of the same occurrence. Payment of a penalty notice obviously can be regarded as an admission of the criminal liability involved in the commission of the offence in respect of which the notice issued.  
     
      
    72 Sections 440C, 440D and 440E are in Division 2 of Part 1 of chapter 14 of the Act, which is headed “Serious corrupt conduct”. Sections 440C and 440D confer a power on the Minister or the general manager of a council to suspend certain persons from office or duty “if criminal proceedings for serious corrupt conduct are instituted against the person” (s 440C (1)(b) and s 440D (1)(b)). It is obvious that the legislative intention is that the drastic power of suspension should be limited to cases where criminal proceedings have been instituted for serious corrupt conduct. 
     
      
    73 Section 353A of the Crimes Act was a provision of a different Act dealing with a quite different subject matter.  
     
      
    74 Section 353A of the Crimes Act conferred a power to search any person who was in lawful custody on a charge of committing an offence. The power was conferred on any constable of police and, where a person in custody was a female and no female constable was available to conduct the search, any female acting under and in accordance with the request of a constable (sub-s (1)(b)). 
     
      
    75 Sub-section (1A) provided that a search conducted by a person in accordance with sub-s (1)(b) did not, “if the search would be lawful if conducted by a constable”, subject the person making the search to any action, liability, claim or demand “whatever”.  
     
      
    76 It may well be that s 353(1A) gave protection against criminal liability. However, it was to be interpreted in its own specific context. The person making the search was protected, only if the search would have been lawful if conducted by a constable and the emphatic word “whatever” occurred after the words action, liability, claim or demand. 
     
      
    77 Section 731 is a statutory provision conferring an exemption from liability. In Alamdo Spigelman CJ, in a passage in the Chief Justice’s judgment which is not affected by anything said in the High Court judgments, after referring to Board of Fire Commissioners (NSW) v Ardouin, in which Kitto J said at 116 that “the protective nature of the provision (protecting the Board from liability) is such that a most strict interpretation of its words is plainly demanded”, said at 321 (34):- 
     
      
       
        
        “Since  
        Ardouin 
         exemption from liability provisions have often been strictly, even jealously, construed”. 
        
       
      
    78 The adoption of such an approach in the interpretation of s 731 favours a conclusion that the word “liability” in s 731 does not include criminal liability.  
     
      
    79 As was said in the joint judgment in the High Court in Alamdo Holdings (at par 29), general statements calling for a narrow reading of immunity provisions do not provide a substitute for a consideration of the subject, scope and purpose of a statutory text. In the present case it seems to me that a consideration of the subject, scope and purpose of s 731 favours the same conclusion as would be favoured by the general statements of statutory interpretation, that s 731 does not confer an immunity from criminal liability. As was submitted by counsel for the respondent, it would be surprising if all of the many persons who are protected by s 731 were to be exempted from all forms of criminal liability. 
     
      
    80 Before Lloyd J counsel for Mr Freeman offered as an example of a case where there would be an injustice, if s 731 was not interpreted as extending to criminal liability, the case of an employee of a council hurrying in a vehicle to a bushfire for the purpose of controlling the fire and exceeding the speed limit. 
     
      
    81 In his judgment of 15 June 2006 Lloyd J responded to this example by saying:- 
     
      
       
        
        “But what would happen if in doing so the employee caused the death of a pedestrian or the occupant of another vehicle? It could not be suggested in such an event that the employee would be immune from prosecution for an offence of culpable driving causing death. The circumstances may be a mitigating factor on the question of sentence, but I cannot see any policy reason providing an exemption from liability or immunity from prosecution in such circumstances.” 
        
       
      
    82 In my opinion, there is considerable force in this response by Lloyd J to the example given by counsel for the appellant. 
     
      
    83 Counsel for the respondent referred to Fowler v Taylor and New South Wales Bar Association v Muirhead. 
     
      
    84 In Fowler v Taylor, a health officer employed by a shire council was convicted for an assault which the informant alleged the officer had committed by pushing her aside to enter a house which the officer desired to inspect in the course of his duty. Dean J of the Victorian Supreme Court held that an officer exercising a power of entry conferred by a section of the Victorian Health Act 1928 was entitled to use reasonable force to enter premises and was not guilty of assault, if he used no more force than was reasonably necessary to gain admittance.  
     
      
    85 The officer also sought to rely on s 392 of the Health Act which provided, so far as is relevant:- 
     
      
       
        
        “No matter or thing done…by any officer of any council…acting under the…authority of…any council shall (if a matter or thing was done…bona fide for the purpose of executing this Act) subject…any of them personally to any action liability claim or demand whatsoever”. 
        
       
      
    86 At p 595 Dean J said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “But I do not think the protection afforded by s392 of the Health Act 1928 extends to criminal responsibility. The word ""liability"" is found in association with the words ""action claim or demand"", all of which relate to civil liability. This colours the sense in which the word ""liability"" is used in the section, upon the principle expressed in the maxim noscitur a sociis. Further, I think if the section had been intended to give protection from criminal responsibility, it would have been clearly so stated. Again, I can find no case in which the section has been invoked for this purpose. I therefore think s392 affords no answer to a charge of assault even when committed bona fide in the execution of the Act.” 
        
       
      
    87 Counsel for the appellant criticised Dean J’s judgment in Fowler v Taylor on the grounds that Dean J had had regard only to the immediate context of the word “liability” in s 392 of the Health Act. However, in my opinion Fowler v Taylor, which is a judgment on the meaning of the word “liability” in the same collection of words as in the present case, that is “action, liability, claim or demand” assists the respondent. 
     
      
    88 In New South Wales Bar Association v Muirhead the New South Wales Bar Association took proceedings for contempt of court against a Senior Commissioner of the Compensation Court.  
     
      
    89 In his judgment Kirby P referred to s 247 of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 which provided:- 
     
      
       
        
        “247. No matter or thing done by a commissioner in the exercise of any of the commissioner's functions shall, if the matter or thing was done in good faith, subject the commissioner personally to any action, liability, claim or demand.” 
        
       
      
    90 At p 195 Kirby P said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Certainly, the protection from liability in s 247 is limited to matters or things done “in good faith”. It is also limited to liability to “any action, liability, claim or demand”. At the least, the summons for relief in respect of alleged contempt of court would not fall within the protection of that section, any more than other criminal conduct would. The section is designed to provide protection from civil suits and then only in respect of conduct done “in the exercise of any of the commissioner's functions”. To the extent that the senior commissioner was shown to have exceeded those functions, as the claimant's summons suggests, s 247 would have no protective application.” 
        
       
      
    91 Hope JA delivered a short separate judgment in which, after dealing with other matters, Hope JA said that he otherwise agreed with Kirby P. Mahoney JA, the other member of the Court, delivered a separate judgment in which he did not deal with the interpretation of s 247. 
     
      
    92 What Kirby P said in Muirhead was obiter and was said by his Honour in a different context. However, it provides some support for the respondent. 
     
      
    93 In my opinion, for the reasons I have given, s 731 of the Local Government Act should be interpreted as not applying to confer protection against criminal liability and question 1 in the stated case should be answered “no”. 
     
      
       
      2. Did I err in law in finding that the proceedings were in each case taken by the respondent rather than by the Director-General of the Department of Environment and Conservation? 
       
       
      3. Did I err in law in finding that the proceedings were in each case properly taken by the respondent for the purposes of s 179 National Parks and Wildlife Act? 
       
       
      4. Did I err in law in finding that the words in the name of the prosecutor in the summonses, “for and on behalf of the Director-General of the Department of Environment and Conservation”, were mere surplusage? 
       
      
    94 These three questions are closely interrelated and can conveniently be considered together.  
     
      
    95 Earlier in this judgment I referred to s 179 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act, which provides that any legal proceedings for an offence against the Act “may only be taken by a police officer or by a person duly authorised by the Director-General in that behalf”. I also referred to some submissions made by counsel to Lloyd J concerning the interpretation of s 179 and to Lloyd J’s conclusion in his judgment of 8 June 2006 that each of the legal proceedings had been taken by Mr Garrett as the prosecutor and that the words in each summons “for and on behalf of the Director-General of the Department of Environment and Conservation” were mere surplusage.  
     
      
    96 On this appeal counsel for the appellant repeated the submissions which had been made before Lloyd J, that, on the proper interpretation of s 179, legal proceedings for an offence against the Act may be taken only by a police officer or by a person authorised by the Director-General and cannot be taken by the Director-General herself. These submissions were not disputed by counsel for the respondent.  
     
      
    97 It was then submitted by counsel for the appellant that the words “for and on behalf of”, occurring in the description of the prosecutor in each summons before the amendments made pursuant to the leave granted on 8 June 2006, were words of agency, so that the prosecutor in each summons was, not Mr Garrett, but his principal the Director-General and, accordingly, the proceedings had not been taken in accordance with s 179.  
     
      
    98 It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that a conclusion that the proceedings had not been properly taken was supported by the decision of Hemmings J in Fairfield City Council v Colorpak Products (NSW) Pty Ltd (1988) 78 LGERA 144. 
     
      
    99 Insofar as might be objected that such a conclusion would be unduly technical, counsel referred to the judgment of Spigelman CJ in R v Janceski (2005) 64 NSWLR 10, in which his Honour said inter alia at 29 (95):- 
     
      
       
        
        “…courts have always insisted on punctilious compliance with legal formalities which have any substantive purpose, before the State imposes the stigma of a criminal conviction on any citizen”. 
        
       
      
    100 Counsel for the appellant submitted that the decision of the High Court in Stuckey v Iliff (1960) 105 CLR 164, on which Lloyd J had relied and on which counsel for the respondent continued to rely, was distinguishable.  
     
      
    101 On this appeal counsel for the respondent submitted that Lloyd J had been correct in finding that the proceedings had been taken by Mr Garrett and not by the Director-General. It was submitted that the words “for and on behalf of the Director-General”, which appeared in the summonses before they were amended, were not words of agency but words intended to demonstrate Mr Garrett’s authority to bring the proceedings, that is that he was a person who had been authorised by the Director-General to bring the proceedings. 
     
      
    102 Counsel for the respondent submitted that Colorpak was distinguishable and that the decision of the High Court in Stuckey v Iliff supported the respondent. 
     
      
    103 I will now proceed to consider the submissions made by counsel. 
     
      
    104 I accept the submission by counsel for the respondent that the decision of Hemmings J in Colorpak is distinguishable from the present case.  
     
      
    105 Colorpak concerned s 33 of the Clean Waters Act 1970 (since repealed). Section 33 provided that the consent of the responsible Minister or of a member or officer of the State Pollution Control Commission was required for the institution of proceedings for the prosecution of an offence under the Act, unless the proceedings were instituted “by a servant of the council with the consent of either the council of an authorised member of servant of it”. Hemmings J held that s 33 did not authorise the institution of proceedings, without the consent of the Minister or a member or officer of the Commission, by the council itself, as distinct from a servant of the council acting with the consent of the council. 
     
      
    106 Hemmings J’s decision would lend some support to s 179 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act being interpreted so that proceedings within s 179 can only be taken by a person authorised by the Director-General and not by the Director-General herself. However, it is common ground between the appellant and the respondent that this is the proper interpretation of s 179. No issue corresponding to questions 2, 3 and 4 in the stated case arose in Colorpak, because it was not disputed in Colorpak that the prosecutor was the Fairfield City Council. 
     
      
    107 In Stuckey v Iliff a prosecution had been brought under s 251L of the Income Tax and Social Security Contribution Assessment Act 1936, which prohibited a person demanding a fee for the preparation of an income tax return, if he was not a registered tax agent. 
     
      
    108 Under s 243 of the Act the prosecutor could rely on an averment in the complaint commencing the prosecution as prima facie evidence of a matter averred, if the prosecution was a “taxation prosecution” within certain sections of the Act. That in turn depended on whether the prosecution had been instituted by an officer of the Department “in the name of the Commissioner” within s 244 of the Act. The complaint had been drawn as one by a named officer of the Department of Taxation (Mr Iliff) “in the name of and for and on behalf of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation”.  
     
      
    109 In Stuckey v Iliff the High Court held that the complaint was not a complaint “in the name of the Commissioner” within s 244 of the Act and hence the prosecution was not a “taxation prosecution” and, consequently, s 243 of the Act was not applicable to the prosecution. 
     
      
    110 In the present case Lloyd J held that Stuckey v Iliff was an authority that a criminal proceeding commenced by an originating document in which the prosecutor is described as a named individual “for and on behalf of” an official or a body is a criminal prosecution by the named individual and not by the official or the body. 
     
      
    111 In Stuckey v Iliff, Dixon CJ, McTiernan J, Kitto J, Menzies J and Windeyer J in their joint judgment, after referring to a number of sections of the Act, said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The difficulty, however, is that the actual information in the present case was laid by the respondent Iliff and not by a Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner. S 244 provides that where any taxation prosecution has been instituted by an officer in the name of the Commissioner the prosecution shall, unless the contrary is proved, be deemed to have been instituted by the authority of the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner, as the case may be. With an evident intention of complying with this provision the complaint was drawn as a complaint of Iliff, an officer of the Taxation Branch of the Department of the Treasury, in the name of and for and on behalf of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation under the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936–1959 for the State of Queensland. But does this comply with the provisions so as to bring the complaint within s 233 and s 243? It is Iliff's complaint. When he says that he makes it in the name of the Deputy Commissioner he must mean that he makes it for him. For a mere inspection of the complaint shows that it is not in the name of the Commissioner. Apparently the formula ""in the name of and for and on behalf of"" is used simply to mean ""on behalf of"". At all events it is not in his name. Indeed the proceedings have been headed as between the appellant Stuckey and the respondent Iliff. Unfortunately the form adopted does not comply with s 244(1). It becomes the complaint of the officer and not the complaint of the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner notwithstanding that such a complaint may be instituted by the officer under the authority of the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner. The distinction may be regarded as refined and of little practical significance, but the effect is that, although the complaint states that it is a complaint in the name of and for and on behalf of the Deputy Commissioner, it is the complaint of Iliff and unfortunately, unless it falls within s 244, it cannot fall within s 243 because to fall within s 243 it must be a taxation prosecution, and to be a taxation prosecution it must fall within s 222. It follows that the complainant could not avail himself of the averment provisions of s 243 to support a complaint in the form which he adopted. Perhaps it may be the good fortune of the appellant but on the state of the record he is entitled to the dismissal of the complaint. Accordingly the appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed. In lieu of the conviction the complaint should be dismissed.” 
        
       
      
    112 I have not found it an easy matter to assess the significance for the present appeal of this passage in the joint judgment in Stuckey v Iliff. There are a number of statements in the passage that the complaint (or information) should be regarded as having been made by Iliff and these statements might be capable of supporting Lloyd J’s view of the effect of Stuckey v Iliff. However, the conclusion I have ultimately come to is that Stuckey v Iliff should be regarded as simply a decision that the complaint in question had not been brought “in the name of the Commissioner” as required by s 244 of the Act and that the decision does not have the general significance attributed to it by Lloyd J. 
     
      
    113 In the present case, before the summonses were amended the prosecutor was described in each summons as “Stephen Garrett for and on behalf of the Director-General of the Department of Environment and Conservation”. I do not consider that the words “for and on behalf of the Director-General of the Department of Environment and Conservation” occurring in the description of the prosecutor can be discarded as mere surplusage. In my opinion, the natural interpretation of the words “for and on behalf of” is that they are words of agency and that the proceedings should be regarded as having been taken by Mr Garrett as an agent on behalf of a principal, the Director-General, and hence the proceeding should be regarded as having been taken by the Director-General. Consequently, I would answer questions 2, 3, and 4 of the stated case as follows:- 
     
      
       
      2. Yes. 
       
      3. Yes. 
       
      4. Yes. 
       
       
      5. Did I err in law in finding that the inclusion of the words “for and on behalf of the Director-General of the Department of Environment and Conservation” in each of the summonses was governed by s 16(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act? 
       
      
    114 Earlier in this judgment I noted that Lloyd J decided that, if he was wrong in holding that the words in the description of the prosecutor in each summons “for and on behalf of the Director-General of the Department of Environment and Conservation” were mere surplusage, then the presence of those words was a defect falling within s 16(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act (a Lord Jervis Act provision), which was applicable to the proceedings, and was cured by s 16(2). In his judgment Lloyd J referred to Crothers v Shiel (1933) 49 CLR 399 and Corporate Affairs Commission v Bain (1991) 55 A Crim R 73 as supporting this decision. 
     
      
    115 On this appeal counsel for the appellant submitted that, if the words in question were not mere surplusage, s 16(2) could not properly be applied. Counsel sought to distinguish Crothers v Shiel and Corporate Affairs Commission v Bain and sought to rely on the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Janceski (2005) 64 NSWLR 10. 
     
      
    116 Counsel for the respondent submitted that Lloyd J had been correct in holding that the words in question were a defect falling within s 16(2), which could be cured by the operation of s 16(2). 
     
      
    117 It is clearly the case that some defects in an indictment or some other document by which criminal proceedings are commenced are incapable of being cured by a Lord Jervis Act provision. See for example ex parte Lovell, re Buckley (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 153 especially at 173-174. 
     
      
    118 However, in my opinion, the High Court decision of Crothers v Shiel is a strong authority that s 16(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act could properly be applied in the present case. 
     
      
    119 Crothers v Shiel concerned a prosecution under the Milk Act 1931 and the Lord Jervis Act provision was s 65 of the Justices Act 1902. Section 80 of the Milk Act provided that “any information complaint or other legal proceeding under this Act may be taken in the name of the Milk Board by the secretary or any other officer authorised by the Board in that behalf either generally or in any particular case”. The information in question was signed by Mr Crothers who was described in the information as “an officer in the service of the Milk Board duly authorised to prosecute herein”. In the proceedings Mr Crothers was described as being the informant and he was named as the prosecuting party.  
     
      
    120 The leading judgment in the High Court was given by Rich J, with whom Dixon J and McTiernan J agreed, and with whom Evatt J also agreed, apart from one, unrelated, aspect of the case. 
     
      
    121 In his judgment Rich J said at p 407:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is true that the information does not comply with it (s 80) but I find it unnecessary to decide whether it is an exhaustive statement of the mode of prosecution. The appellant was the proper officer to lay the information on behalf of the Board and the information shows that he did so prosecute. Where the information fails to comply with s 80 is that the appellant exercised his authority in his own name and not in the name of his principal the Board. This, in my opinion, is a defect in the information, and is healed by s 65 of the  
        Justices Act 
         1902. I cannot agree with Mr Watt’s contention that the information is not defective in substance or in form and that all that is wrong is that the informant had no locus standi. When s 80 of the  
        Milk Act 
         is looked at with the information what appears is that the right person had proceeded by an appropriate information and in the information has proceeded expressly on behalf of his principal but has drawn up the information in his own but not in his principal’s name. “ 
        
       
      
    122 Accordingly, in Crothers v Shiel the proceedings were brought by an individual in his own name, and not in the name of his principal, who under the relevant legislation was the person in whose name the proceedings should have been brought, whereas, in the present case, on the interpretation I have put on the description of the prosecutor in the unamended summonses, the proceedings were brought by an individual on behalf of his principal when under the relevant legislation the proper person to bring the proceedings was the individual himself. Although the proper party to take proceedings was the Milk Board in Crothers v Shiel but Mr Garrett in the present case, similar reasoning to that employed by the High Court in Crothers v Shiel would strongly support a conclusion that the defect in the summonses was within the Lord Jervis Act provision and was capable of being cured by the operation of that provision. 
     
      
    123 On the hearing of the appeal little real attempt was made by counsel for the appellant to distinguish Crothers v Shiel.  
     
      
    124 In Corporate Affairs Commission v Bain, Bain had successfully defended four informations laid against him by the Corporate Affairs Commission. The seal of the Corporate Affairs Commission had been affixed to each information by Mr O’Dea, an authorised officer of the Commission. 
     
      
    125 After the informations had been dismissed, a Local Court Magistrate made an order that the Corporate Affairs Commission pay Mr Bain’s assessed costs. A notice of appeal to the District Court was lodged against the costs order. In the notice of appeal Mr O’Dea, and not the Commission, was identified as the appellant.  
     
      
    126 A submission was made to the District Court judge who heard the appeal that the appeal had not been brought by the proper appellant. The District Court judge hearing the appeal held that s 127 of the Justices Act (a Lord Jervis Act provision applying to appeals) was applicable to the appeal and should be applied in favour of the Corporate Affairs Commission.  
     
      
    127 The District Court judge stated a case for the Court of Criminal Appeal. The Court of Criminal Appeal held that an error had been made, in that Mr O’Dea had been identified as the appellant, but that the error was cured by s 127. In so holding the Court of Criminal Appeal referred to Crothers v Shiel. 
     
      
    128 In its judgment the Court of Criminal Appeal said of s 65 of the Justices Act (the general Lord Jervis Act provision in the Justices Act):- 
     
      
       
        
        “There is much authority for the view that s 65 should be given a wide construction. Thus, in  
        Ex parte McAuley; 
          
        Re Cam, 
         (1944) 44 SR (NSW) 258 at 259–60 Jordan CJ (with whom Halse-Rogers J concurred) said: “Section 65(1)(a) is a most valuable section, and it is important that it should not be whittled away by the allowance of objections to an information if they can be cured without causing injustice. As was pointed out by Griffith CJ in  
        Hedberg v Woodhall 
         (1913) 15 CLR 531 at 534–5 the section means that ‘if objections are taken which really do not go to the merits of the case the magistrate is not to stay his hand, but to proceed to dispose of the case on the merits’. If the defect is curable, it is the duty of the magistrate to aid in curing it.” See also  
        Parmeter v Proctor 
         (1949) 66 WN 48” 
         
        
       
      
    129 It was submitted on behalf of the appellant in the present case that Corporate Affairs Commission v Bain was distinguishable from the present case, in that the Corporate Affairs Commission was obviously the proper party to appeal and had resolved to appeal against the costs order and the Court of Criminal Appeal referred to the error which had occurred as being in the nature of a “clerical error”.  
     
      
    130 I would accept that Corporate Affairs Commission v Bain is not as strong an authority in favour of the respondent as Crothers v Shiel but, nevertheless, I consider that it lends some support to the respondent. 
     
      
    131 Counsel for the appellant sought to rely on the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Janceski.  
     
      
    132 In Janceski the indictment which had been presented at a trial had been signed by a barrister at the private bar who was not authorised to do so pursuant to s 126 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Section 126 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides that an indictment shall be signed by the Attorney General, the Solicitor General or the Director of Public Prosecutions or for and on behalf of the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions by a Crown prosecutor, a Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions or a person authorised by the Director of Public Prosecutions to sign indictments for and on behalf of the Director. It was held by the Court of Criminal Appeal that the indictment was invalid because it had not been signed by an authorised person. 
     
      
    133 The Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Janceski was constituted by a bench of five judges. All of the five judges agreed in the result. The Chief Justice delivered a long judgment, in par 96 and 97 of which he indicated concurrence with part of Howie J’s judgment. Wood CJ at CL delivered a judgment in which his Honour said that he agreed with both the Chief Justice and Howie J. Howie J delivered a judgment with which Hunt AJA and Johnson J agreed. 
     
      
    134 The reasoning in the judgments in Janceski is intricate and I do not propose to endeavour to summarise all of the reasoning. However, important grounds for the decision included:- 
     
      
       
      1. An indictment is the instrument by which the jurisdiction of a court to try an accused person is invoked (see for example Spigelman CJ at 22 (54), Wood CJ at CL at 40 (205), Howie J at 54 (271)). For a court’s jurisdiction to be invoked it is essential for an indictment be a valid indictment. An indictment which has not been signed by a person authorised by s 126 is not a valid indictment.  
       
       
      2. There was an important substantive purpose in maintaining strict compliance with s 126, that is of ensuring that the Director of Public Prosecutions, subject only to the Attorney General’s power, would be in control of the process of instituting criminal proceedings and that that would be manifest to all parties to the proceedings (see for example Spigelman CJ at 29 (97), Howie J at 54 (272)). 
       
      
    135 As regards the first ground in the present case the summonses by which the proceedings were commenced were sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the Land and Environment Court, even though that Court, acting in the exercise of its jurisdiction, might decide that the proceedings had been brought by the wrong prosecutor. 
     
      
    136 As regards the second ground, there is no such important substantive purpose in refraining from applying s 16(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act in the present proceedings.  
     
      
    137 I consider that question 5 in the stated case should be answered “no”. 
     
      
       
      6. Did I err in law in finding that there was a mistake in the name of the party in the summonses for the purposes of Part 20 Rule 4(3) of the incorporated Supreme Court Rules? 
       
       
      7. Did I err in law in permitting the second further amendment to each of the summonses? 
       
      
    138 These questions were dealt with together in counsel’s submissions and it is convenient to deal with them together. 
     
      
    139 Earlier in this judgment I noted that Lloyd J decided that leave should be granted to the prosecutor to amend the summonses pursuant to Pt 20 r 4(3) of the Supreme Court Rules by deleting the words “for and on behalf of the Director-General of the Department of Environment and Conservation”. 
     
      
    140 It was common ground between the parties both before Lloyd J and on this appeal that Pt 20 of the Supreme Court Rules 1970 applied to the proceedings before Lloyd J in the Land and Environment Court. 
     
      
    141 If, as I have held, the defect in the summonses could be cured by s 16(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act, it was not strictly necessary for the summonses to be amended. Section 16(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act would operate according to its tenor to prevent any objection being taken or allowed on the grounds of the alleged defect. However, as was stated in Corporate Affairs Commission v Bain at p 78:- 
     
      
       
        
        “For the sake of good order, what is implied should properly be amended so that it becomes express”. 
        
       
      
    142 Part 20 r 4(3) of the Supreme Court Rules provided:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Where there has been a mistake in the name of a party and the court is satisfied that the mistake was not misleading or such as to cause reasonable doubt as to the identity of the person intended to be made a party, the court may make an order for leave to make an amendment to correct the mistake, whether or not the effect of the amendment is to substitute a new party”. 
        
       
      
    143 The question asked in question 6 in the stated case is whether Lloyd J erred in finding that there was “a mistake in the name of a party” within Pt 20 r 4(3). 
     
      
    144 It is correct, as counsel for the appellant submitted, that Lloyd J’s conclusion that there had been “a mistake in the name of a party” was based on his Honour’s view that the words which were omitted by the amendments were mere surplusage and I have held that those words were not mere surplusage. However, I consider that his Honour’s conclusion that there had been “a mistake in the name of a party” within Pt 20 r 4(3) of the Rules can be justified on another basis. 
     
      
    145 Although I have held that the words which were omitted by the amendments were not to be regarded as having been mere surplusage and that the inclusion of those words in the summonses produced the consequence that the proceedings were to be regarded as having been taken by Mr Garrett’s principal the Director-General of the Department of Environment and Conservation, Lloyd J made a separate finding “that it was always intended that Stephen Garrett was to be the prosecutor”. On this basis I would hold that there was a mistake in the name of a party and his Honour did not err in so finding. 
     
      
    146 It was clearly open to Lloyd J to find that the other conditions for the application of Pt 20 r 4(3), that the mistake was not misleading and not such as to cause reasonable doubt as to the identity of the person intended to be made a party, were satisfied. By virtue of the concluding words of Pt 20 r 4(3) the amendments could be made, even if the effect of the amendments was to substitute a new party.  
     
      
    147 In my opinion, questions 6 and 7 in the stated case should be answered “no”. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    148 The questions in the stated case should be answered as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        1. No. 
         
        2. Yes. 
         
        3. Yes.

     GRAHAM JOHN EVANS v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: Graham John Evans appealed against his conviction on two charges of armed robbery (the first two counts in the indictment) and one charge of assault with intent to rob (the third count in the indictment). The third count in the indictment had originally charged a third offence of armed robbery. However, at a late stage in the trial the prosecutor, with the leave of the trial judge, amended the third count to a charge of assault with intent to rob.  
     
      
    2 It was alleged by the Crown that the three offences of which the appellant was convicted had been committed on the same day, 28 February 2002, in the chambers of the Strathfield Municipal Council. At the trial there was no dispute that on 28 February 2002 a man had entered the Council chambers and had committed the three offences. This man was wearing overalls and a balaclava which covered his head. The live issue at the trial was whether the Crown could prove that the appellant was the offender.  
     
      
    3 At the time the offences were committed there were a number of persons in the Council chambers, both employees of the Council and members of the public. Employees of the Council who were in the chambers at the time the offences were committed included Helen Connell, Patricia Smith, Lesley Thompson, Nasim Samad and Laura Gleeson. Members of the public who were in the chambers at the time the offences were committed included Zbigniew Marszalek and Bo Qin Huang. All the persons I have mentioned gave evidence for the Crown at the trial. 
     
      
    4 The victim of the offence charged in the first count in the indictment was Laura Gleeson from whom the robber took cash belonging to the Council. The victim of the offence charged in the second count in the indictment was Mr Marszalek who was robbed of his own cash. The victim of the offence charged in the third count in the indictment was Mr Huang. In response to a demand by the offender Mr Huang put cash belonging to himself on the counter but, according to evidence given by Mr Huang and Mrs Gleeson, this cash was not ultimately taken by the offender.  
     
      
    5 A number of persons who had been in the Council chambers gave evidence tending to show that, after the offender left the Council chambers, a baseball cap and a tissue were lying on the floor of the chambers and that they had not been on the floor before the offender entered the chambers and it was part of the Crown case that the cap and the tissue had been dropped by the offender. 
     
      
    6 Surveillance cameras were installed in the Council chambers and were operating at the time the offences were committed and some film showing the commission of the offences was taken. The film was taken using three cameras situated in different locations in the chambers and the resulting film was not a continuous film but a succession of still images, with the point of view constantly changing. The film was in black and white and the quality of the images was far from ideal. Nine still photographs were selected and these photographs, together with enlargements of them, all of which showed the offender, were admitted into evidence. 
     
      
    7 The cap which according to the prosecution case had been dropped by the offender was forwarded to the Division of Analytical Laboratories in March 2002. After it was received the cap was stored in a secure location at the Laboratories. In August 2003, a forensic biologist succeeded in lifting DNA material from an area on the inside front brim of the cap, which was a part of the cap which would have been likely to have been in contact with the forehead of any person wearing the cap. An analyst was able to obtain a DNA profile for the material lifted from the cap. 
     
      
    8 On 30 December 2003 the appellant was arrested for an unrelated matter at his home in Campbelltown, which was a house owned by his father, and the appellant was taken to a police station. The appellant was then taken back to the house in Campbelltown, where a search warrant was executed by police. In the course of the execution of the search warrant a balaclava was found in a bedroom in the house and was seized and a pair of overalls were found in the laundry of the house and were seized. A box containing a large number of balaclavas similar to the balaclava found in the bedroom was found in the basement of the house. There was evidence at the trial that the balaclavas had been obtained by the appellant in the year 2000. 
     
      
    9 The appellant was taken back to the police station. He participated in an electronically recorded interview in which, for the most part, he declined to answer questions. He did, however, consent to a buccal swab being taken from him.  
     
      
    10 On 8 January 2004 the buccal swab taken from the appellant was forwarded to the Division of Analytical Laboratories. The swab was subjected to DNA analysis and a DNA profile obtained.  
     
      
    11 On comparing the DNA profile of the material lifted from the cap and the DNA profile of the swab taken from the appellant it was found that the profiles matched. That DNA profile would be expected to occur in fewer than 1 in 10 billion people in the general population.  
     
      
    12 Later in 2004 the tissue which had been seen on the floor of the Council chambers and the balaclava which had been seized in the execution of the search warrant were submitted or re-submitted to the Division of Analytical Laboratories.  
     
      
    13 As regards the tissue, Ms Michelle Franco, a forensic biologist employed by the Division of Analytical Laboratories, gave evidence at the trial that attempts had been made to recover DNA from three areas of the tissue. No DNA was recovered from one area. The amount of DNA recovered from the other two areas was too low, according to Ms Franco’s evidence, to enable profiles of the contributors to the DNA to be determined and, in Ms Franco’s opinion, the appellant could not be excluded as a possible contributor. It was not possible to determine whether any DNA was present on the balaclava. 
     
      
    14 The Crown case at the trial was principally based on the evidence tending to show that the cap had been dropped by the offender, the evidence that the DNA profile of the material lifted from the cap matched the DNA profile of the swab taken from the appellant and the low frequency of that DNA profile in the general population, the security video and the enlarged still photographs showing the offender, the evidence that the appellant had had access to a balaclava and a pair of overalls, which, it was submitted, were similar to the balaclava and the pair of overalls the offender had worn, the comparison which the jury were asked to make between the appearance of the offender in the video and photographs and the appearance of the appellant when wearing the balaclava and the overalls which had been seized during the execution of the search warrant (at the request of the Crown prosecutor the appellant had put on the balaclava and the overalls during his cross-examination) and evidence of respects in which, it was submitted, the appellant tallied with such descriptions as the eye witnesses to the offences had been able to give about the offender’s sex, voice, height, age, manner of walking, build, hair and skin complexion. 
     
      
    15 The appellant gave evidence at the trial. He denied having gone to Strathfield Council chambers and committing the offences. He said that he could not be sure where he had been on 28 February 2002. He gave evidence about the balaclavas and the overalls which police had found at his home and about the cap. The appellant’s brother Allan Evans and the appellant’s father Douglas Evans also gave evidence in the defence case.  
     
      
    16 Dr Brian McDonald gave evidence in the defence case, as being an expert in the testing and analysis of DNA. Dr McDonald accepted that it was probable that the source of the DNA material on the cap was the appellant. He said that the DNA material on the cap could have got on to the cap, otherwise than by the person who contributed the DNA wearing the cap. The DNA could have been transferred to the cap from any item which came into contact with the cap. Dr McDonald was of the opinion that sufficient DNA had been recovered from the tissue to enable the appellant to be excluded as a contributor to the DNA on the tissue.  
     
      
    17 I will be making further references to the evidence of the accused and the other defence witnesses, when I consider some of the grounds of appeal against conviction. 
     
      
       
      Evidence of some of the Crown witnesses  
       
      
    18 I will now summarise the evidence of some of the Crown witnesses. I will deal with these witnesses in the order in which they were called at the trial.  
     
      
       
      Helen Connell 
       
      
    19 In February 2002 Ms Connell was an employee of the Council. At about 4:00 pm in the afternoon of 28 February 2002, while walking along a pathway leading to the building in which the Council chambers were situated, she passed a man who she thought was oddly dressed. It was February and a warm day but the man was wearing overalls, a bright red beanie and sunglasses. The beanie seemed to be too big for the man. When asked by the Crown prosecutor to describe the material of the beanie, Ms Connell said that it looked woollen. 
     
      
    20 Ms Connell was able to see part of the man’s face and could tell that it was not a young person’s face.  
     
      
    21 Ms Connell was asked to describe the overalls the man was wearing. She said that they were dark, with long sleeves and were not new “they looked like they’d been worn for a while”.  
     
      
    22 Ms Connell estimated that the man’s height “in a hunched position” was about her height (5’ 6 ½”). The man had a normal build. Ms Connell was not able to see any of his hair. 
     
      
    23 Ms Connell was shown, without any objection, the balaclava which had been seized during the execution of the search warrant and was asked “Are you able to say anything about that?” she replied:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It’s a similar colour as the beanie that the man was wearing. Considering the size of it, if he had that on your head there would be an excess amount sitting at the top so yes, it could be the same beanie”. 
        
       
      
    24 After the balaclava was shown to Ms Connell it was marked for identification 1.  
     
      
    25 Ms Connell was then shown, without any objection, the overalls which had been seized during the execution of the search warrant. Without actually being asked any question, she said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “They’re a similar style though they look a lot dirtier than what the man had worn and probably a little faded as well but they look exactly the same style and they yeah, they looked like the same sort of style the man was wearing”. 
        
       
      
    26 After the overalls had been shown to Ms Connell they were marked for identification 2. 
     
      
    27 In cross-examination Ms Connell agreed that the overalls the offender had been wearing were not as dirty or as faded as the overalls which had been shown to her and that “the only thing about the overalls that’s the same is that they’re the same style of overall”.  
     
      
       
      Patricia Smith 
       
      
    28 In February 2002 Ms Smith was working as a town planner at the Council. She said that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “While I was serving the customer my attention was drawn to a person coming through the doors that slid back. That person had a dark pair of overalls on and a bright ski mask and was adjusting the ski mask over what looked like to me wraparound sunglasses”. 
        
       
      
    29 This person was carrying a bag and took out what Ms Smith observed to be a gun. From a distance of approximately one metre he pointed the gun at Ms Smith and said “give me all your serious cash”. Ms Smith replied “I don’t have any cash” and the offender turned his attention from her to one of the Council’s customer service officers.  
     
      
    30 Ms Smith was asked to describe the man’s clothes and she replied:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Heavy duty, dark coloured overalls that appeared to be too large on the person that was wearing them, a bright coloured balaclava, with wraparound sunglasses.” 
        
       
      
    31 Ms Smith was asked to describe the overalls and she replied:- 
     
      
       
        
        “They were sort of like the heavy duty King Gee type overalls with the various pockets with buttoned up, you know, studs on the body”. 
        
       
       
      She said that the overalls were dark and long sleeved.  
       
      
    32 Ms Smith was asked to describe the “ski mask” and she said “it was woollen and from my recollection it was orange or a bright colour like that”. It looked like “a fisherman knit type of fabric”, although the witness conceded that she herself was not a knitter. 
     
      
    33 The sunglasses the offender was wearing were covered by “the balaclava”. All the witness could see of the sunglasses were the lenses, which appeared very dark and wraparound.  
     
      
    34 After the offender turned his attention to a customer service officer, he kept demanding that he be given “all your serious cash”. The tone of the voice was very relaxed. 
     
      
    35 Ms Smith saw two members of the public who were at the counter take cash out of their pockets and put it on the counter. Laura Gleeson, the customer service supervisor, came over, took money out of a drawer and provided it to the offender.  
     
      
    36 Ms Smith is recorded in the transcript of her evidence in chief as estimating that the man was four inches taller than herself, she being between five foot six and five foot eight and she said that the man was of a slight build. 
     
      
    37 Ms Smith, without any objection, was asked to look at the balaclava MFI 1 and was asked “what if anything can you say about that item?” Ms Smith replied “it’s very similar to the one that I recollect”. When asked to explain how it was similar, she said “just the knit” and when asked if there was anything else she could comment on, she said “not really, no”. 
     
      
    38 Ms Smith, without any objection, was asked to look at the overalls MFI 2. The following questions and answers occurred:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A. That was the style of overalls, but I – it looks very similar. 
         
         
        Q. Are you able to say what it is about these overalls that I’m showing you that appear to be similar? 
         
         
        A. It’s the same style with a collar. And studs and the pockets and so on. 
         
         
        Q. Are you able to indicate anything about the colour of these overalls? 
         
        A. My recollection is that it was just a darker colour overall. I couldn’t be real certain of the colour.” 
        
       
      
    39 Ms Smith was cross-examined about parts of a statement she had made to police in the evening of 28 February 2002. In her statement she had said about the offender:- 
     
      
       
        
        “He was also wearing a pair of clean, dark coloured, heavy duty style overalls with a collar”. 
        
       
      
    40 Ms Smith had also said in her statement that the offender spoke “reasonably slowly and in clear English”. 
     
      
    41 In cross-examination Ms Smith said that she herself was only five foot two inches tall, although she had said or was recorded as having said in her evidence in chief that she was five foot six to five foot eight tall.  
     
      
    42 Ms Smith was cross-examined about part of her statement to the police in which she had said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I would describe the man with the overalls as about five foot eight to five foot ten tall, thin build. He sounded like he could possibly be in his mid 20s, maybe younger, and he spoke with a clear English accent but slowly”. 
        
       
      
    43 In re-examination Ms Smith said that, at the time she filled in an offender’s description form about 20-25 minutes after the incident, she was “totally traumatised”. At the time she made her statement to the police, about one and a half hours or longer after the incident, she was still extremely upset.  
     
      
    44 In re-examination Ms Smith explained what she had said about the offender’s accent as being “a clear English accent”. The offender’s accent was “English Australian accent but very slow and almost purposeful”.  
     
      
    45 Ms Smith was re-examined about a description of the offender she had given in the offender’s description form, namely “man in red overalls and balaclava approached the counter and pulled out sawn-off shot gun”. She said that what she had intended to convey was that the man was wearing a red balaclava and overalls. 
     
      
    46 In further cross-examination, when asked what was her best recollection of the colour of the balaclava, Ms Smith said “it was red or a bright colour orange”. 
     
      
       
      Lesley Thompson 
       
      
    47 Ms Thompson gave evidence that on the afternoon of 28 February 2002 she was a customer service officer employed by the Council. She said that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A man walked in and I actually looked up and then looked down again, not thinking, and I looked up and he had a balaclava on and blue overalls and he asked for the serious money”. 
        
       
      
    48 Ms Thompson estimated the man’s height at five foot six inches to five foot eight inches. She was asked what he was wearing and she replied:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Worn blue King Gee overalls, light blue, lighter blue, not the navy blue, and a red balaclava that was worn. The eyes were stitched and nose was stitched and the mouth, so you had the stitching around the openings of the eyes and nose and the mouth”. 
        
       
      
    49 Ms Thompson said that the overalls were long sleeved, not brand new, had no stains on them, had a collar and had press-stud buttons.  
     
      
    50 Ms Thompson described the balaclava as being red, woollen, matted, with “white stitching around the nose and white stitching around the mouth”.  
     
      
    51 The man was carrying a sports bag out of which he took a gun. “He asked for the serious money”. 
     
      
    52 Laura Gleeson came down and asked the man to remove the balaclava. The man asked again for the “serious” money and said “this is not a joke”. Ms Gleeson unlocked and opened a drawer, took money out of the drawer and handed it over. A member of the public put money on the counter and the offender swept it into his bag. 
     
      
    53 Ms Thompson described the man as fairly thin because the overalls looked a bit large for him, his skin complexion was “fair to medium”, he was “late 30s to mid 40s”. After a lapse of approximately three years, Ms Thompson was unable to describe his voice.  
     
      
    54 The Crown prosecutor then said “I would just like you now to have a look at this item, please, which is MFI 1”. 
     
      
    55 Counsel for the appellant at the trial objected to the witness being shown the balaclava, on the grounds that the witness had given a description of the balaclava she had seen, which was in some respects inconsistent with MFI 1. The trial judge permitted the Crown prosecutor to show the balaclava MFI 1 to the witness. 
     
      
    56 Ms Thompson, without actually being asked a question, said “it’s very similar”. The following question and answer then occurred:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Are you able to say anything about what you’ve been shown? 
         
        A. Well, it’s the same style and exactly the same but I remember white stitching”. 
        
       
      
    57 Counsel for the appellant at the trial then said that he could see what the Crown prosecutor was about to do with the overalls MFI 2 and counsel raised a similar objection to the witness being shown the overalls, on the grounds that the description the witness had given of the overalls she had seen, which had included that the overalls were light blue and not stained, was inconsistent with MFI 2. 
     
      
    58 This objection was argued at length. The Crown prosecutor submitted that the description of the overalls the witness had given was consistent with MFI 2 in a number of respects, including that they were King Gee overalls, long sleeved and with a collar and that they were blue in colour, even though the description the witness had given was that they were light blue, rather than dark blue, in colour. Counsel for the appellant at the trial submitted that the description the witness had given of the overalls she had seen was inconsistent with the overalls MFI 2, in that the witness had described the overalls she had seen as being light blue in colour and not stained. Counsel for the appellant at the trial submitted that what the Crown prosecutor proposed should be done was similar to a dock identification and suffered from the same vices as a dock identification and amounted to an encouragement to the witness to recognise the item shown to her as being the same as the overalls she had seen and to change her evidence. 
     
      
    59 In the course of the argument it was pointed out that counsel for the appellant at the trial had not objected to Ms Connell or Ms Smith being shown MFI 1 and MFI 2. Counsel for the appellant at the trial replied that he had not objected “because the descriptions given by the witnesses in their evidence were consistent (with MFI 1 and MFI 2) and it was then a legitimate exercise to show them”. 
     
      
    60 The trial judge ruled that she would allow the Crown prosecutor to show the overalls MFI 2 to the witness and to ask the witness “what, if anything, are you able to say about this item?” 
     
      
    61 When the trial resumed in the presence the jury, the following questions and answers occurred:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. (Approached with leave) Mrs Thompson, would you mind having a look at this item, which is MFI 2? 
         
        A. Mmm mmm. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What if anything are you able to say about this item that I’ve just shown to you? 
         
        A. They look like the King Gee, but I thought they were – what I remember they were a bit paler than that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Are you able to say anything about this item? 
         
        A. They’re the same style. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And when you say the same style? 
         
        A. As with the buttoned – the press buttons up the top, and the collar, and the full length arms, and all the way down the legs”. 
        
       
      
    62 Ms Thompson gave further evidence relating to the cap and the tissue as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. After the offender left the premises, did you look at the floor area in front of the counter? 
         
        A. I first locked the door so nobody else could come in, and when I turned back towards the counter I saw a cap, a baseball cap, and a tissue in front of the counter. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And had you had occasion to see the floor area in front of the counter before this man entered the premises? 
         
        A. Yes I’d been over to the other building, and come back in about five minutes before. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you had noticed the cap? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And the tissue when you came back in? 
         
        A. No.” 
        
       
      
    63 In cross-examination Ms Thompson confirmed that she remembered white stitching around the eyes and mouth of the balaclava she had seen on 28 February 2002 and had seen no white stitching on the balaclava MFI 1. She confirmed that she had described the overalls as light blue and not stained. The following questions and answers occurred:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Definitely not those overalls? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You agree with that, definitely not those overalls? 
         
        A. They’re not navy either, they’re faded so they are a light blue. But I remember them a bit paler than that”. 
        
       
       
      Zbigniew Marszalek 
       
      
    64 Mr Marszalek was a member of the public who went to the Council chambers on 28 February 2002 to pay a bill.  
     
      
    65 While in the Council chambers he looked around and saw “a masked man with a gun…standing next to me, demanding money”. The man was wearing a red woollen balaclava over his whole head and “bluey grey overalls”. The overalls were not new, they were loose on the wearer’s body, long sleeved and with a collar.  
     
      
    66 Mr Marszalek saw the back of the man’s head when the man left the building and took the balaclava off and Mr Marszalek noted that the man had dark hair. 
     
      
    67 Mr Marszalek estimated the man’s height as pretty similar to his own height (175cms). The man was a bit slimmer than Mr Marszalek, who weighed about 80kgs.  
     
      
    68 Mr Marszalek heard the man demand money a number of times. The tone of his voice was quite calm. He had an Australian, not a foreign, accent. Mr Marszalek handed over the money which he had previously placed on the counter.  
     
      
    69 Without any objection being taken, Mr Marszalek was asked to look at the balaclava MFI 1. The following questions and answers occurred:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. I will just ask you to have a look at this item, please. (Handed). That is MFI 1. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Just have a look at both sides of that, please? What if anything can you say about that particular item? 
         
        A. Well, it’s like a red balaclava, from recollection that is basically what I think he was wearing. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What are you saying? 
         
        A. Well, it’s a red balaclava and I think that is the one, I have no idea but to me I think that is the balaclava. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What is it about that particular item that makes you think that? 
         
        A. Well the colour and the texture of the wool. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Anything else? 
         
        A. No, that’s all I can remember.” 
        
       
      
    70 Without any objection being taken, Mr Marszalek was asked to have a look at the overalls MFI 2. The following questions and answers occurred:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. I would like you to have a look at this item, MFI 2. (Handed). 
         
        A. Yeah, I see that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What if anything can you say about the item I have just shown to you? 
         
        A. That’s exactly how I remember it, it is the type of overalls he wore. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you say the type? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What is it? 
         
        A. Well, the sort of faded appearance. I remember that. The overalls seemed faded and the style. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you say style, what are you referring to in particular? 
         
        A. Well, like the clipped button and the collar and pockets.” 
        
       
      
    71 In cross-examination Mr Marszalek said that, although he had looked closely at the balaclava he had been shown in his evidence in chief, he had not noticed, as was the fact, that it was inside out.  
     
      
    72 Mr Marszalek said in cross-examination that he had not observed anything white on the balaclava he had seen on 28 February 2002. 
     
      
    73 When Mr Marszalek was shown the overalls MFI 2 again, Mr Marszalek said that “I work in an industry where we get heavily stained. That’s not stained by my criteria”, although he conceded it was “very likely” that the overalls MFI 2 had a grease or oil stain. The colour of the overalls MFI 2 was what Mr Marszalek would describe as “bluey grey”.  
     
      
       
      Nasim Samad 
       
      
    74 Nasim Samad was an employee of the Council who was working in the Council Chambers on the afternoon of 28 February 2002. 
     
      
    75 Mr Samad overheard words spoken by Patricia Smith, who was working alongside Mr Samad, and someone else, including Ms Smith saying that she had no money. The man with whom Miss Smith had been speaking turned towards Mr Samad, pointed a gun at him and asked Mr Samad to hand over money. Mr Samad “just froze”. The man said “I’m serious. I need serious money”. 
     
      
    76 Laura Gleeson, who was the customer service manager, walked across and said to Mr Samad, “Nasim, do as he says”. Mrs Gleeson provided some money to the man. 
     
      
    77 After the man left the chamber Mr Samad saw a baseball cap and a white tissue on the floor, which had not been there previously. 
     
      
    78 Mr Samad described the man as 5 feet 2 inches tall, the same height as himself, and “skinny”. His head was covered by a balaclava, with only two eyeholes and a hole for the nose. 
     
      
    79 Mr Samad was asked to describe the balaclava. He said that “it had some red and black, or some — I can’t remember the colours correctly but it was pulled down up to his neck”. 
     
      
    80 The man was wearing overalls which were deep blue in colour. Mr Samad was asked to describe the overalls in more detail and he said that they had buttons in the front and long sleeves. 
     
      
    81 Mr Samad said that the man had had an “Anglo Saxon” accent. 
     
      
    82 Mr Samad was shown, without any objection, the balaclava MFI 1. He was asked what, if anything, he could say about it. Mr Samad answered that it was “more or less similar” to the balaclava he had seen, in that it had two eyeholes and a hole for the nose. When asked “anything else?”, Mr Samad said “nothing more”. 
     
      
    83 Mr Samad was shown, without objection, the overalls MFI 2 and was asked what, if anything, he could say about them. Mr Samad replied, “It seems more or less to the description I’ve given”, in that it had buttons and full sleeves “and I can’t remember any more. Just the colour seems to me very faded here. This one (balaclava MFI 1) seems to be very faded.”. 
     
      
    84 In cross-examination Mr Samad agreed that in the statement he had made on 28 February 2002 he had described the overalls as “bright blue overalls slightly soiled”. He agreed that the overalls MFI 2 were not bright blue. 
     
      
    85 Mr Samad also agreed that in his statement he had described the balaclava as “red with some white”. In the statement he had said that he could not recall whether the balaclava had a hole for the mouth. 
     
      
      Laura Gleeson 
       
      
    86 In February 2002 Mrs Gleeson was employed by the Council as the customer service co-ordinator.  
     
      
    87 Mrs Gleeson gave evidence as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A. A person walked in through two glass doors, which is right diagonally opposite where I was standing, and had a red balaclava on. And when they started walking in, I didn’t think about what I was saying, I asked the person to take off their balaclava, and they just kept walking towards me. I said “Excuse me”. I said “Can you please take off your balaclava”. And the next thing I got told, “This is serious. Give me your money.”. Nasim, who was the cashier at the time, who was standing at the actual terminal serving somebody, had froze, and the guy said, “Give me your money. This is serious. Give me your money”. I took the keys, I opened up the drawer, gave the money to the person, triggered the alarm, and I said, “I’ll go and check the other drawer. I think it’s locked but I’ll check it”. I walked over, pulled the drawer, and it was locked, triggered the other alarm, and I said, “That’s all we got, nothing else”. And he said, “Yes I’m sure it is.” And (he) turned around and walked out.” 
        
       
      
    88 Mrs Gleeson was asked to describe the balaclava in more detail. She replied:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A. It was red. Had an eye and a nose cut out. The eyes you couldn’t see in because he had dark sunglasses on. And that was pretty much it. I remember it was frayed.” 
        
       
      
    89 Mrs Gleeson said that the balaclava looked like a wool balaclava but she would not know the exact material. It had not looked like an expensive balaclava. It was a thinner knit. She could not remember anything else about the balaclava. 
     
      
    90 Mrs Gleeson described the overalls the man was wearing as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “He had King Gee overalls on. And they looked fairly new. Because normally when you see them stained, the stains stick out because it’s like a watermark. But they were quite new. …. Like the overalls were from wrist down to his ankles.” 
        
       
      
    91 Mrs Gleeson added that the overalls were long-sleeved, they had a logo on the left side, “there were buttons but I can’t remember, they were blue King Gee – a darker blue, not a pale blue”. 
     
      
    92 Mrs Gleeson gave evidence that she had put the Asian gentleman’s (Mr Huang’s) money under the counter and after the man had left she had given Mr Huang his money back. 
     
      
    93 Mrs Gleeson had had a second job at a liquor outlet and in that job had been trained in how to proceed, if a hold-up occurred. Mrs Gleeson described the man’s voice as very slow, very dull and very calm. She had not detected any accent but when the man said “this is serious”, it almost came over as “sherious”. 
     
      
    94 Mrs Gleeson believed the man to be 180 cm tall because she saw him walk past a marker on a door. He was “very slender”, ”the overalls were a little bit baggy on him”. 
     
      
    95 After Mrs Gleeson had put the money in the man’s bag, he turned around “and something fell out of his bag and at the time I didn’t know what it was but I watched the path he walked ………………… he had a real relaxed walk ………………… just bouncing, walking out”. 
     
      
    96 After the man had left the chamber Mrs Gleeson got Lesley Thompson to lock the door, the area was sealed off and a direction was given that no one was to walk there.  
     
      
    97 After the man had left Mrs Gleeson saw the cap and the tissue on the floor.  
     
      
    98 Mrs Gleeson was shown, without objection, the balaclava MFI 1 and was asked what, if anything, she could say about it. Apparently the balaclava MFI 1 was inside out, when shown to Mrs Gleeson. Mrs Gleeson observed that MFI 1 was inside out and said that the balaclava the man had been wearing had not been inside out on 28 February 2002, because Mrs Gleeson had not seen a tag. The balaclava MFI 1 was the same sort of knit as the balaclava the man had been wearing on 28 February 2002 but there was nothing else she could comment on. 
     
      
    99 Mrs Gleeson was shown, without objection, the overalls MFI 2 and was asked what, if anything, she could say about them. She said that the overalls MFI 2 were “a dirtier pair of overalls”. She remembered the overalls she had seen on 28 February 2002 as being clean. She was asked “apart from the colour, are you able to say anything else about them?”, and she replied “no”. 
     
      
    100 In cross-examination Mrs. Gleeson agreed that in the statement she had made to police shortly after the incident she had stated “he had Key G Workware overalls on, that were yellow in colour”. Mrs Gleeson said in cross-examination that “Key G” was a typographical error for “King Gee” and that in her own copy of the statement she had corrected “yellow” to blue and had added the words “yellow logo”. Mrs Gleeson said that at the time she signed her statement “I was not taking notice of anything on it”. 
     
      
    101 In her statement Mrs Gleeson had said that the overalls worn by the man must have been a new pair, because the logo on the left hand pocket stood out. The sleeves of the overalls were rolled down and there were no stains on the overalls. 
     
      
    102 In cross-examination Mrs Gleeson agreed that the overalls MFI 2 were “nothing like the pristine, clean, not stained, must have been new, overalls that you saw on the robber that day”. 
     
      
    103 In cross-examination Mrs Gleeson agreed that the only similarities between the balaclava MFI 1 and the balaclava the robber had worn were that they were red in colour and a similar knit and that in other respects the two balaclavas were quite dissimilar. 
     
      
    104 In her statement Mrs Gleeson had described the man’s walk as, “he walked like he was a black guy in those home-boy movies”. She agreed “It’s a sort of swagger style of slow walk”. 
     
      
    105 In cross-examination Mrs Gleeson agreed that in her statement she had not mentioned seeing anything fall out of the man’s bag or of seeing any items on the floor after the man left. However, she continued to maintain that she had seen something fall out of the man’s bag. 
     
      
       
      Bo Quin Huang 
       
      
    106 Mr Bo Quin Huang was a member of the public who went to the Council chambers on 28 February 2002. Mr Huang gave evidence through an interpreter. 
     
      
    107 In the chamber Mr Huang heard someone behind him yell “give me money.” and he turned around. Mr Huang’s evidence continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I saw a person, a man. He was about 1.7 metres high. He had some sort of a hat but his face was covered. He was wearing overalls, blue in colour. The overalls were long sleeves, and his whole arms were covered by the sleeves. He held a bag in his left hand. In his right hand he had a gun. That gun was in the colour of brown. He was yelling, “give me the money”. I took money out. And I saw two other people behind me who were waiting in the queue, they also took their money out. So I took my money out as well. I left the money on the counter. The lady who was at the counter brushed my money to the side and took some money from the drawer. The man then left. And after that the lady gave me my money back. “ 
        
       
      
    108 As a result of this evidence from Mr Huang (and certain other evidence) the third count in the indictment was amended to a charge of assault with intent to rob.  
     
      
    109 Mr Huang was asked what the man had been wearing on his head. He replied “It was kind of a winter sort of hat. It’s a balaclava. Only the eyes and mouth were exposed”. The balaclava was woollen. When asked what colour the balaclava was, Mr Huang replied, “I think it was blue” and added “my recollection of his balaclava is not as strong as his overalls”. 
     
      
    110 The following questions and answers occurred in relation to the overalls the man had been wearing:- 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Can you describe the overalls in some detail? 
         
        A. The same sort of type I always see at the panel beater shop. That kind of overall people wear. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you remember what colour they were? 
         
        A. Blue. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can you describe the shade of blue? 
         
        A. Dark blue. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you remember if they had short or long sleeves? 
         
        A. Long sleeves. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you remember if they were V-neck, round neck, or collared? 
         
        A. I think there was a collar. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you notice how the overalls would do up? 
         
        A. I did not pay attention to that detail, but I think it was done up to the neck.” 
        
       
      
    111 When asked to describe the man’s voice, Mr Huang said it was “not very loud”. 
     
      
    112 Mr Huang did not pay any attention to the floor of the chamber. 
     
      
    113 Mr Huang was shown, without objection, the overalls MFI 2. He said that the overalls the man had worn on 28 February 2002 “looked newer, brighter than this one. This one appears to be very dirty and old”. He could not say anything else about the overalls that the man had been wearing. 
     
      
    114 Mr Huang was not shown the balaclava MFI 1.  
     
      
    115 In cross-examination Mr Huang said that the overalls he had been shown were the same style as the overalls the man had been wearing. He agreed that the style was “the only thing about the overalls you see today compared with the overalls you saw in Strathfield”. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal  
       
      
    116 I will now proceed to consider the various grounds of appeal against conviction. 
     
      
       
      1. The trial miscarried as a result of the trial judge allowing the prosecutor to show the eyewitnesses to the robbery a balaclava and pair of overalls seized from the home of the appellant and ask them to comment on the items. 
       
      
    117 All of the witnesses Connell, Smith, Thompson, Marszalek, Samad and Gleeson were shown by the Crown prosecutor both the balaclava (MFI 1, exhibit M) and the overalls (MFI 2, exhibit O). The witness Huang was shown only the overalls and was not shown the balaclava. Presumably, the Crown prosecutor did now show Mr Huang the balaclava, because of Mr Huang’s evidence that he thought that the balaclava worn by the robber was blue in colour and that his recollection of the balaclava was not as good as his recollection of the overalls. 
     
      
    118 The procedure generally adopted by the Crown prosecutor in questioning the witnesses was to ask a witness to describe the balaclava or the overalls the witness had seen the robber wearing, to have exhibit M or exhibit O shown to the witness, and then to ask the witness to comment on the object which had been shown to the witness. 
     
      
    119 In most cases in which exhibit M or exhibit O was shown the witness was expressly asked by the Crown prosecutor to comment on the object. After the trial judge had overruled the objection to Ms Thompson being shown the overalls and had permitted the Crown prosecutor to ask a question in the form, “what, if anything, are you able to say about this?” the Crown prosecutor, in asking a witness to comment generally asked a question in that form. The questions seeking comment which the Crown prosecutor had asked the earlier witnesses were similar in form. In a few cases the witness, having been shown exhibit M or exhibit O, immediately made some comment, without the Crown prosecutor having expressly asked any question. 
     
      
    120 It is apparent that the Crown prosecutor’s purpose in showing exhibit M or exhibit O to a witness and asking the witness to comment was, not to obtain evidence of identification, that is evidence that the object shown to the witness was the object which the witness had seen the robber wearing on 28 February 2002, but to obtain evidence that the object shown was similar, at least in some respects, to the object which the witness had seen on 28 February 2002. 
     
      
    121 It is noteworthy that the only witness in respect of whom any objection was made to exhibit M or exhibit O being shown to the witness and the witness being asked to comment was Ms Thompson. No objection was made by counsel for the appellant at the trial to any other witness being shown either object or being asked to comment on either object. 
     
      
    122 Counsel for the appellant at the trial objected to Ms Thompson being shown exhibit M, because part of the description given by Ms Thompson of the balaclava worn by the robber was not consistent with exhibit M, in that Ms Thompson described the balaclava worn by the robber as having had white stitching. 
     
      
    123 Counsel for the appellant objected to Ms Thompson being shown exhibit O, because part of the description given by Ms Thompson of the overalls worn by the robber was not consistent with exhibit O, in that Miss Thompson described the overalls worn by the robber as having been light blue, not dark blue, in colour and as not being stained. 
     
      
    124 The objection by counsel for the appellant to exhibit M being shown to Ms Thompson was summarily overruled by the trial judge. However, the objection to Ms Thompson being shown exhibit O was argued at considerable length, before it was ultimately overruled by the trial judge. 
     
      
    125 The trial judge did not give any separate judgment stating her reasons for overruling the objection to exhibit O being shown to Ms Thompson but it is apparent from a remark made by the trial judge towards the end of the argument, that “there are certain consistent points of identification”, that her Honour considered that there were a sufficient number of respects in which the description given by Ms Thompson of the overalls worn by the robber was consistent with exhibit O that it was permissible for the exhibit to be shown to the witness and for the witness to be asked what, if anything, she could say about the exhibit. 
     
      
    126 The principal submission made by counsel for the appellant in support of the first ground of appeal was that showing a single object to a witness and asking the witness to comment was similar to a dock identification, that is an identification by a witness in the court room of the accused person in the dock as being the offender, and suffered from the same vices as a dock identification. Counsel referred to Davies, Cody v The King (1937) 57 CLR 170 especially at 182 where the court said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Similarly, if a witness is shown a single person and he knows that that person is suspected of or charged with the crime, his natural inclination to think that there is probably some reason for the arrest will tend to prevent an independent reliance upon his own recollection when he is asked whether he can identify him. This tendency will be greatly increased if he is shown the person actually in the dock charged with the very crime in question.” 
        
       
      
    127 Counsel for the appellant also referred to R v Clout (1995) 41 NSWLR 312. 
     
      
    128 I accept that showing a witness a single object of the same general kind as an object observed by the witness at the scene of the crime and asking the witness to comment can be objectionable, as tending to influence the witness to give evidence which is not solely based on the witness’s own independent recollection.  
     
      
    129 Section 37 of the Evidence Act provides that, subject to certain exceptions, a leading question is not to be put to a witness in examination-in-chief or in re-examination. In Part 1 of the dictionary at the end of the Act “leading question” is defined, so far as is relevant, as meaning a question asked of a witness that directly or indirectly suggests a particular answer to the question. 
     
      
    130 A question of the kind I have described could suggest to a witness that the object shown to the witness is identical with, or similar to, the object observed by the witness at the scene of the crime. 
     
      
    131 In the present case I consider that the extent to which the questions asked of the witnesses were leading was reduced, if not completely eliminated, by a number of factors. 
     
      
    132 Each witness was asked to describe the balaclava or the overalls the witness had seen on 28 February 2002, before the corresponding exhibit was shown to the witness. According to the Crown prosecutor, none of the witnesses had previously been shown either of the exhibits. 
     
      
    133 The descriptions given by the witnesses in their evidence in the courtroom were not the first descriptions they had given of the objects they had seen on 28 February 2002. On 28 February 2002 all, or most, of the Council employees had completed a Council offender description form in which they had described the robber, so far as they were able, and, within a couple of hours of the robbery occurring, all of the witnesses had made statements to the police in which they described the robber. 
     
      
    134 In these circumstances, if a witness asserted that an object shown to the witness was similar to an object worn by the robber, the witness could be effectively cross-examined on inconsistencies between the descriptions of the object the witness had given and the features of the object shown to the witness and could also be cross-examined on any absence from the descriptions the witness had given of any features which the witness asserted in his or her evidence were points of similarity between the object worn by the robber and the object shown to the witness. 
     
      
    135 As already indicated, the questions the witnesses were asked were not in a leading, or at least were not in a seriously leading, form.  
     
      
    136 From my survey of the evidence of the witnesses I am satisfied that, when the whole of the evidence of each witness is taken into account, the witnesses were not in fact led into giving evidence which did not reflect their own recollection. Even Mr Marszalek, who initially claimed that he thought that the balaclava he was shown was the balaclava the robber was wearing, qualified that evidence by saying “I have no idea but to me I think that is the balaclava” and ultimately conceded that all he could remember about the balaclava was the colour and the texture of the wool. 
     
      
    137 Each of the witnesses was cross-examined by counsel for the appellant at the trial and a number of concessions were obtained, which were forensically advantageous to the appellant. For example, Mrs Gleeson conceded that the overalls shown to her were “nothing like” the new, unstained overalls which she had seen the robber wearing and that the only respects in which the balaclava shown to her and the balaclava the robber had been wearing were similar were the colour and the kind of knit and that in other respects the two balaclavas were quite dissimilar. 
     
      
    138 I would not accept that, in the circumstances of this case, the Crown prosecutor was required to show each witness a number of balaclavas or a number of pairs of overalls, rather than a single balaclava and a single pair of overalls. 
     
      
    139 I also consider that the Crown prosecutor was not precluded from showing a witness exhibit M or exhibit O, merely because the description already given by the witness of the balaclava or the overalls worn by the robber was in some respects inconsistent with the exhibit, provided that there were some points of similarity between the description and the exhibit. The description given by Ms Thompson of the balaclava worn by the robber was inconsistent with exhibit M in that Ms Thompson remembered white stitching on the balaclava but the description given by Ms Thompson was consistent with exhibit M in a number of respects, including that the balaclava was red and had openings for the eyes, nose and mouth. 
     
      
    140 The description given by Ms Thompson of the overalls worn by the robber was inconsistent with exhibit O, in that Ms Thompson said that the overalls had been light blue, and not dark blue, in colour and had not been stained, but the description given by Ms Thompson was consistent with exhibit O in a number of respects, including that the overalls were King Gee overalls, blue, long sleeved, with a collar and press stud buttons. 
     
      
    141 It would be open to a jury, particularly in the light of the evidence of the other witnesses, to conclude that Ms Thompson’s recollection could have been mistaken in the respects in which her recollection was inconsistent with an exhibit. Even in those respects in which Ms Thompson’s recollection was apparently consistent with an exhibit, it would be relevant to know whether, when actually shown the exhibit, Ms Thompson maintained that the exhibit was, in those respects, similar to what she had observed the robber wearing. 
     
      
    142 Counsel for the appellant referred to R v Clout and particularly the judgment of Kirby ACJ. However, Clout was a case concerning the directions which should have been given by the trial judge and was not a case on the admissibility of evidence.  
     
      
    143 I conclude by saying that I do not consider that the trial miscarried for the reasons asserted in the first ground of appeal. As regards Ms Thompson, I would reject the first ground of appeal. As regards all the other witnesses, I would grant leave to argue the ground of appeal but would reject the ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      2. The trial judge erred in failing to exclude evidence from the eyewitnesses commenting on the balaclava and the overalls, the tender of the balaclava and overalls themselves and evidence of the search of the appellant’s home where they were found. 
       
      
    144 This ground of appeal contains a number of parts relating, respectively, to:- 
     
      
       
        
        1. the evidence of the eyewitnesses commenting on the balaclava and the overalls. 
         
         
        2. the admission into evidence of the balaclava Exhibit M and the overalls Exhibit O. 
         
         
        3. the evidence of the search of the appellant’s home. 
        
       
       
      I will deal with these parts in turn. 
       
      
    145 1. In the course of the argument on the appeal it became clear that the error which it was asserted the trial judge had made extended to not excluding the showing of the balaclava and the overalls to the witnesses, as well as not excluding the evidence of the comments made by the eyewitnesses.  
     
      
    146 As I already noted earlier in this judgment, counsel for the appellant at the trial did not, at the time the evidence was adduced, make any objection to any of the witnesses, apart from Ms Thompson, being shown the balaclava exhibit M or the overalls exhibit O and being asked to comment on them. After all of this evidence had been admitted, an application was made at the trial to have the evidence excluded.  
     
      
    147 In making the application for the exclusion of the evidence, counsel for the appellant at the trial described the application he was making as “a renewal” of an application he had made earlier. However, this was a misdescription of the application counsel for the appellant was making. The application which counsel had made earlier in the trial had been limited to an application that the video recording of parts of the execution of the search warrant at the appellant’s home should not be admitted into evidence. 
     
      
    148 It was submitted at the trial that the evidence of the showing of the balaclava and the overalls and the evidence of the comments of the witnesses should be excluded, on the grounds that the evidence was irrelevant or, if it had any relevance, it should be excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act, because any probative value it had was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. It was submitted that the evidence was irrelevant, because the evidence, considered in its totality, demonstrated that the balaclava and the overalls found at the appellant’s home which had been shown to the witnesses were not the balaclava and the overalls worn by the robber on 28 February 2002. 
     
      
    149 It was submitted by the Crown prosecutor that the evidence was relevant as showing that, at the time of the robbery, the appellant had had access to a balaclava and a pair of overalls which were consistent with the descriptions given by at least a number of the witnesses of the balaclava and the overalls worn by the robber. It was further submitted by the Crown prosecutor that, when the whole of the evidence in chief and the cross-examination of the witnesses was taken into account, there was no danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. 
     
      
    150 After protracted argument and discussion occupying more then 50 pages of the transcript of the trial, the trial judge said that she was “against” counsel for the appellant and that she had drafted reasons which she would not give immediately but would give later in the trial. However, the trial judge never did give any judgment on this application.  
     
      
    151 Although the trial judge did not give any judgment on the application I consider that it can readily be inferred from remarks made by her Honour in the course of the hearing of the application that she concluded that the evidence was relevant and that there was little or no danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. 
     
      
    152 I do not consider that this part of the second ground of appeal should be upheld. Much of what I have written in rejecting the first ground of appeal is applicable to this part of the second ground of appeal. Except in the case of the showing of the objects to Ms Thompson and the asking of Ms Thompson to comment, no objection was made to the adducing of the evidence at the time the evidence was adduced. A trial judge should not readily accede to an application that evidence which has already been given and which counsel did not object to when the evidence was given, should be excluded from the evidence before the jury.  
     
      
    153 In my opinion, the evidence sought to be excluded had some relevance for the reasons given by the Crown prosecutor at the trial and I also accept that, when the whole of the evidence was taken into account, including the concessions favourable to the appellant made in both evidence in chief and cross-examination, there was little danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. 
     
      
    154 2. The balaclava which had been marked for identification 1 and the overalls which had been marked for identification 2 were admitted into evidence as exhibits M and O during the evidence of a police officer, Constable Swift, who was the officer-in-charge of the investigation into the robbery, and he gave evidence about inter alia the finding of the balaclava and the overalls at the appellant’s home on 30 December 2003. At the time the balaclava was tendered counsel for the appellant at the trial said “your Honour is aware of my position” and I accept the trial judge would have accepted that counsel for the appellant at the trial objected to the tender of both the balaclava and the overalls. I infer that the trial judge was satisfied that the objects were relevant and that their probative value was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. 
     
      
    155 For similar reasons to those I have given in rejecting the first ground of appeal and the first part of this ground of appeal, I do not consider that the trial judge erred in finding the balaclava and the overalls were relevant and, having regard to the totality of the evidence, there was little or no danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. 
     
      
    156 I would reject this part of the second ground of appeal. 
     
      
    157 3. At the beginning of the trial counsel for the appellant made an application for the exclusion of certain evidence which the Crown proposed to lead of the search of the appellant’s home on 30 December 2003. However, the application was limited to the excluding of the parts of the audio/video recording of the search which recorded the locating of the balaclava in the bedroom, the locating of the stock of balaclavas in the basement and the locating of the pair of overalls in the laundry. These were the only parts of the recording of the execution of the search warrant which the Crown prosecutor wish to show to the jury. 
     
      
    158 Counsel for the appellant said that he would not object to evidence being given, by a means otherwise than by the playing of the recording, of the locating of the items and of what was said by the appellant and police when the items were located.  
     
      
    159 The ground on which counsel for the appellant sought to have the audio/video evidence excluded was that, if the jury saw the video evidence, the jury would infer that the police had gone to the appellant’s home, so long after the robbery was committed on 28 February 2002, because information had been received pointing to the appellant as having been the robber. It was submitted that the likelihood of such an inference would give rise to a danger of unfair prejudice within s 137 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    160 The trial judge gave a brief judgment referring to ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act, in which she refused the application. 
     
      
    161 I do not consider that it has been shown that the trial judge erred in holding that the evidence should not be excluded under either s 135 or s 137 of the Evidence Act and I would reject this part of the second ground of appeal. 
     
      
    162 I have now rejected all parts of the second ground of appeal and accordingly I reject the ground of appeal generally. 
     
      
       
      3. The trial miscarried as a result of the dressing of the appellant in exhibits and an item which was not in evidence in the trial, the direction that he repeat the words of the robber and that he walk up and down in front of the jury. 
       
      
    163 As noted earlier in this judgment, the appellant was asked by the Crown prosecutor during cross-examination to put on the balaclava exhibit M. Counsel for the appellant at the trial objected but his objection was overruled and the appellant put on the balaclava.  
     
      
    164 The appellant was then asked by the Crown prosecutor to put on a pair of sunglasses which the Crown prosecutor had produced and then to put the balaclava on, over the sunglasses. Counsel for the appellant objected on grounds including that there was no evidence about the provenance of the sunglasses. 
     
      
    165 It is correct that no evidence had been given about the sunglasses which the Crown prosecutor produced. The Crown prosecutor later informed the Court that the sunglasses were her own old skiing sunglasses. 
     
      
    166 The Crown prosecutor handed up to the trial judge a copy of the judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Kirby (unreported 2000 NSWCCA 330). Having consulted the judgments in Kirby, the trial judge ruled that the Crown prosecutor would be permitted to “invite (the appellant) to go ahead with the demonstration”.  
     
      
    167 In compliance with the invitation by the Crown prosecutor, the appellant put on the sunglasses and then the balaclava. The appellant complied with requests by the Crown prosecutor that he face the jury and then turn side on to the jury. 
     
      
    168 The Crown prosecutor asked the appellant to say the words “give me the serious cash” and “I want the serious cash”.  
     
      
    169 Counsel for the appellant objected on the grounds that it was not a voice identification case, that the saying of the words by the appellant would not serve any useful forensic purpose and that asking the appellant to speak as if he was a robber would be prejudicial. The trial judge overruled the objection and the appellant said both sets of words.  
     
      
    170 Later in the cross-examination the appellant was asked to put on the overalls exhibit O. Counsel for the appellant objected and said that he had already “ventilated” his objection. The trial judge overruled the objection. The circumstances in which the appellant then put on the overalls gave rise to part of the sixth ground of appeal against conviction which I will deal with later in this judgment.  
     
      
    171 In accordance with a request from the Crown prosecutor, the appellant, dressed in the overalls, walked up and down in the courtroom in front of the jury box.  
     
      
    172 A general submission was made by counsel for the appellant that all of the things the appellant had been asked to do and had done, that is the putting on of the balaclava and the overalls, the putting on of the sunglasses, the saying of the words and the walking up and down in the courtroom were all “demonstrations” falling within s 53 of the Evidence Act. If s 53 of the Evidence Act applied, it had not been complied with, in that no application had been made as required by sub-s (1) and the trial judge, in deciding whether to order each demonstration, had not taken into account the matters she was required to take into account under sub-s (3). Counsel referred to Scott v Numurkah Corporation (1954) 91 CLR 300, a decision on views at common law.  
     
      
    173 It is, in my opinion, clear that, if s 53 of the Evidence Act was applicable, her Honour failed to take it into account. However, all the things the appellant was asked to do, and did, were done by him in the courtroom and the question arises whether s 53 of the Evidence Act applies to demonstrations in the courtroom or whether it applies only to demonstrations outside the courtroom. 
     
      
    174 Section 53 of the Evidence Act is headed “Views” but this word is not used in the section itself. The section itself speaks of “demonstration, experiment or inspection”. None of these terms is defined in the section or elsewhere in the Act. As the submission made by counsel for the appellant was that each of the things the appellant was asked to do and did was a “demonstration”, I will focus on the word “demonstration” in s 53. 
     
      
    175 There are not in s 53 any express words limiting the application of the section to demonstrations outside the courtroom. Apparently founding on this aspect of the drafting of the section, Odgers Uniform Evidence Act (seventh edition) at 1.2.5580 expresses the opinion that “although the ALRC (the Australian Law Reform Commission) was considering out of court inspections etc, this provision applies to any ‘demonstration, experiment or inspection’ whether in court or out of court”.  
     
      
    176 On the other hand, Anderson Hunter and Williams the New Evidence Law note at p 121 that “section 53 does not expressly limit its operation to out of court contexts, though it is clearly assumed to be the sphere of its operation”. 
     
      
    177 In my opinion, notwithstanding the absence of express words limiting its operation, s 53 of the Evidence Act is limited to demonstrations, experiments or inspections taking place outside the courtroom.  
     
      
    178 As already indicated, Odgers refers to the proposals by the Australian Law Reform Commission on which s 53 is based (The Law Reform Commission Report No 26 1027-1029 “Views demonstrations and experiments”). 
     
      
    179 As Odgers accepts, it is clear that the Commission was limiting its consideration of “views demonstrations and experiments” to views demonstrations and experiments occurring outside the court.  
     
      
    180 Paragraph 1027 of the Report commences with the words:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The judge or jury may leave the court to observe places or objects that cannot be brought or reproduced successfully in the court.” 
        
       
      
    181 Section 53 is headed “views” and, although this word is not used in the section itself, it is legitimate to have regard to it in interpreting the section. In the absence of any definition in the Act of the word “view”, one can have regard to the meaning of the word “view” at common law. At common law a “view” was a view of a place or object outside the courtroom. An example of a view at common law is Scott v Numurkah Corporation, to which counsel for the appellant referred. 
     
      
    182 Although not conclusive, there are indications in some of the terms of the section that the section is intended to apply only to demonstrations, experiments or inspections outside the courtroom. The conditions that an order should not be made unless the parties will be given a reasonable opportunity to be present and that the judge, and if there is a jury, the jury will be present would be unlikely to be necessary in the case of demonstrations, experiments or inspections taking place inside the courtroom during a trial. 
     
      
    183 Section 53 enacts a quite elaborate procedure to be followed. An application for an order must be made. A judge is not to make an order unless the judge is satisfied that the conditions in sub-s (2) are satisfied and the judge is required to take into account all of the matters in sub-s (3). In R v Milat (NSWSC Hunt CJ at CL 12 April 1996) it was held that a judge must comply with sub-ss (2) and (3), even though the parties are in agreement that an order should be made. 
     
      
    184 However, demonstrations by witnesses in the course of giving evidence occur in a great number of criminal trials and often a number of times in the same criminal trial. For example, a witness is asked to demonstrate how a particular object such as a knife or gun was held or how a particular part of the human body was moved, for example in striking or punching. Expert witnesses are asked to demonstrate, for example where a particular part of the body is situated or what kind of blow might have inflicted a particular kind of injury.  
     
      
    185 In my opinion, it is not to be supposed that the elaborate procedure in s 53 is required to be applied, whenever a witness in giving evidence in court is asked to engage in a demonstration. 
     
      
    186 In Kirby the accused was asked in cross-examination to put on a hat which he had agreed was similar to a hat worn by the offender as seen on video stills of the commission of the offence. This incident was referred to by the Court of Criminal Appeal as a “demonstration” but there is no reference anywhere in the judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal to s 53 of the Evidence Act. Wood CJ at CL who delivered the leading judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal referred to such demonstrations as being “a common place event” (par 47).  
     
      
    187 Counsel for the appellant referred to FD v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 31. In FD the accused during cross-examination was asked by the Crown prosecutor to demonstrate how he had pulled away a knife. The Crown prosecutor offered to participate himself in the demonstration. Counsel for the accused objected to what was proposed on the grounds that anything that happened would be difficult to record in the transcript. The Crown prosecutor referred to s 53 of the Evidence Act and the trial judge permitted the demonstration to occur. In his summing-up the trial judge told the jury that there was no way that the Crown prosecutor in his wig and gown and the accused could replicate whatever had happened at the scene of the alleged offence.  
     
      
    188 The grounds of appeal taken in Kirby were that the jury should not have been in court during the argument about the propriety of the proposed demonstration and that the demonstration had caused some impermissible prejudice. There was no ground of appeal that the procedure in s 53 had not been followed. I conclude that FD is not an authority in the Court of Criminal Appeal that an in-court demonstration falls within s 53 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    189 I have held that s 53 of the Evidence Act does not apply to demonstrations, experiments or inspections in the courtroom. However, if a proposed demonstration, experiment or inspection to be held in the courtroom is objected to, some of the matters set out in sub-s (3) of s 53 may well be relevant in determining whether what is proposed should be permitted or should be rejected, for example pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    190 Quite apart from s 53 of the Evidence Act, it was submitted on behalf of the appellant, both at the trial and on appeal, that it was unfairly prejudicial to the appellant for the trial judge to permit the Crown prosecutor to ask the appellant to put on the balaclava and the overalls, when it had not been established that the balaclava or the overalls the appellant was asked to put on were the balaclava or the overalls worn by the robber or were even similar to the balaclava or the overalls worn by the robber. 
     
      
    191 In my opinion, it was not unfairly prejudicial to the appellant to ask the appellant to put on the balaclava and the overalls which, according to the evidence of at least some of the eyewitnesses, were similar to the balaclava and the overalls worn by the robber, so that the appearance of the appellant in the courtroom wearing the balaclava exhibit M and the overalls exhibit O could be compared by the jury with the security video and the still photographs derived from the security video showing the robber in the balaclava and the overalls he was wearing. The respects in which the balaclava exhibit M and the overalls exhibit O might have differed from the balaclava and overalls worn by the robber, as described in the descriptions by the eyewitnesses, had been explored in the examination and cross-examination of the eyewitnesses. 
     
      
    192 The conclusion I have drawn derives some support from the decision of this Court in Kirby, where the accused was asked to put on a hat found at the accused’s house so that the jury could compare the appearance of the accused wearing the hat with the appearance of the offender in the still photographs. The Court of Criminal Appeal rejected submissions that the procedure was unfair on the basis that it was akin to a dock identification.  
     
      
    193 As regards the sunglasses, I accept that the appellant should not have been asked to put on sunglasses which had not been admitted into evidence, which had not been shown to any witness and which were produced for the first time when the prosecutor asked the appellant to put them on.  
     
      
    194 I consider that it was permissible for the Crown prosecutor to ask the appellant to say sentences including the word ”serious”. There was no tape recording of the offender’s words saying the word “serious”. However, the witness Mrs Gleeson had given evidence that, when the offender said the word “serious”, it almost sounded like “sherious”. The Crown prosecutor was entitled to ask the appellant to say the word “serious” in a sentence, for the purpose of determining whether the appellant had the same speech idiosyncrasy. 
     
      
    195 As regards asking the appellant to walk up and down in front of the jury, the witness Mrs Gleeson had given evidence that the offender had “a real relaxed walk”, “a bouncing walk”, “a sort of swagger style of slow walk”.  
     
      
    196 It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that any walking by the appellant in the courtroom in front of the jury would be unlikely, even if he was the offender, to replicate the movements of the offender walking at the crime scene. There is some force in this submission but I do not consider, in the light of Mrs Gleeson’s evidence, that the trial judge should be held to have erred in permitting this demonstration.  
     
      
    197 I upheld the third ground of appeal in so far it relates to asking the appellant to put on the sunglasses. Otherwise, I reject the third ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      4. The failure to of the trial judge to direct the jury as to the dangers of the use of the evidence relating to the clothing, walk and voice demonstration occasioned a miscarriage of justice. 
       
      
    198 After the closing addresses had been given, the trial judge discussed with counsel what directions she should give in her summing-up. The trial judge commenced part of this discussion by saying that, on one view, some, if not all, of the evidence could be described as “identification evidence”. Counsel for the appellant at the trial then submitted that “your Honour would give the usual warnings about the dangers (of identification evidence)”.  
     
      
    199 After further discussion, the trial judge said that no witness had given evidence of visual identification of the appellant as being the offender. Counsel for the appellant remarked “nobody ever says “that’s him””. 
     
      
    200 The trial judge then said that, as there was no evidence of visual identification, it would be “inappropriate” to “give all those usual directions”. Counsel for the appellant did not dissent from the view expressed by the trial judge but submitted that there was a need for the jury to be directed to “exercise caution”. The Crown prosecutor submitted that the evidence of the witnesses about the balaclava and the overalls should be described as “resemblance” evidence and not “identification” evidence and directions of the kind given where there has been evidence of identification should be modified. 
     
      
    201 Towards the end of this part of the discussion the trial judge said, without any dissent from counsel, that the Crown prosecutor had been correct in telling the jury in the prosecutor’s opening address that the primary issue in the trial was whether the appellant was the robber and that some of the evidence could be described, in one sense, as being “identification evidence” but not in the sense in which that expression is used in the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    202 In the part of her summing-up which is recorded at pp 45-50 of the transcript of the summing-up the trial judge gave the jury certain directions. At p 45 her Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Now the next direction I give you is a direction in relation to identification. As I have said earlier today that really is what this case is all about, this trial. Members of the jury, I say to you immediately that there is what is called visual identification before you in the sense that it is normally used, namely that people come along and say that they were present and sighted the person or persons in the particular case and are able to give if not a positive identification – when I say positive, they go beyond saying that it looks similar or something of that nature. 
        
       
       
        
        In this case, this case is devoid of that sort of visual identification and that is why we have spoken mainly about circumstantial evidence in the Crown case. Nevertheless you do have evidence from a number of witnesses describing the appearance of the person who came into the council demanding money on 28 February ’04 and you do have witnesses who describe the wearing apparel and you have also got the security video and the stills, the still photographs. And when the accused gave evidence he was asked to do certain things in relation to exhibits M and O, that was to put on the red balaclava and the pair of overalls so a comparison could be made between the person described as the robber by the various witnesses and the accused.” 
        
       
      
    203 Her Honour then referred to other parts of the Crown case and then continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “…although I have said to you there is no visual identification in the ordinary sense of the word but I am still bound to give you a direction which in effect is a special caution about identification evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        I say to you at the outset that in the case of identification evidence the warning of a need for special caution before accepting of identification is one which is given in every case in which such evidence is disputed by the accused. It is not given because of any particular view which I may have formed concerning the reliability of – when I say that I am not really giving you this direction at the moment. I am telling you this is the sort of direction that is given in every case and the principal reason for it being given is because of the nature of this type of evidence and I will direct you now specifically that the type of evidence that you have heard in this case here which goes to the identification in the Crown case which is led for the purpose of or the foundation of its submission in the evidence is of such a type that you could safely act on it providing you are satisfied yourselves about the evidence and you accept the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    204 In this part of the summing-up the trial judge subsequently twice repeated the need for the jury to exercise “special caution” in considering this evidence.  
     
      
    205 Her Honour continued at p 48 of the transcript of the summing-up”- 
     
      
       
        
        “There are however a number of matters in this case which I propose to draw to your attention which are relevant to the reliability of the evidence that has been given and my direction is that you are bound to consider those matters in determining whether you will accept that evidence as reliable. I do not say that you must regard all of any of them as necessarily undermining the reliability of the evidence and I repeat that I do not express any opinion myself as to whether they should lead you to reject that evidence as unreliable. My purpose in referring to these matters is only to assist you in your task by pointing them out as warranting your attention. Now as I said I do not intend to go through them in any detail. The first one that I will refer you to is the limited time that the witnesses were giving evidence, the limited time with which they had to make observations, also the fact that they have in the particular circumstances of the events taking place they can affect or influence the ability of the person to make the observations and here, I think it is apparent from the evidence of a number of the witnesses that they reacted to the presence of a gun being held by the person who was on the premises that day. 
        
       
       
        
        There has been in the evidence of what I will call the lay witnesses, that is the employees at the council and also the customers. There has been in respect of some matters a different description given, particularly in relation to the age of the person and also to the build and the height of the person said to be the description of the robber on 28 February 2002.” 
        
       
      
    206 At the conclusion of the summing-up, the Crown prosecutor submitted that the trial judge had not given the jury a direction about the need for special caution in considering the resemblance evidence of the witnesses about exhibits M and O.  
     
      
    207 Counsel for the appellant did not himself seek any further direction and did not support and actually opposed, the submission made by the Crown prosecutor. Counsel for the appellant said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “My understanding of the caution your Honour did give was applied to the descriptions of the person, and apparel, that is as I have heard the caution your Honour gave, it was applicable to both the description of the person and the apparel.” 
         
        
       
       
      No further relevant direction was given by the trial judge. 
       
      
    208 On this appeal it was submitted that the directions the trial judge had given were inadequate, particularly in regard to the comparison the jury had been invited to make between the video and still photographs showing the robber and the appearance of the appellant wearing exhibits M and O. It was further submitted that the trial judge had weakened the effect of such directions as she had given by repeatedly saying that she was required to give the directions and that the directions were not being given because of any view of the facts she herself had formed and by the direction her Honour gave to the effect that the jury could safely act on the evidence, provided that they were satisfied that they should accept the evidence. 
     
      
    209 It was submitted by the Crown on this appeal that the present case was not a case in which “usual” identification directions were required or in which voice identification directions were required, that the directions the trial judge had given were sufficient, that no complaint had been made by counsel for the appellant at the trial about any of the directions the trial judge had given and no request had been made by counsel for the appellant for any further direction. 
     
      
    210 The expression “identification evidence” as used in the Evidence Act is defined in part 1 of the dictionary at the end of the Act as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Identification evidence means evidence that is:  
         
        (a) an assertion by a person to the effect that a defendant was, or resembles (visually, aurally or otherwise) a person who was, present at or near a place where:  
         
         
          
          (i) the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted was committed, or  
           
          (ii) an act connected to that offence was done, 
          
         
         
        at or about the time at which the offence was committed or the act was done, being an assertion that is based wholly or partly on what the person making the assertion saw, heard or otherwise perceived at that place and time, or  
         
         
        (b) a report (whether oral or in writing) of such an assertion. 
         
        
       
      
    211 It is clear that no witness at the trial made any assertion that the appellant was the robber. It is also clear, in my opinion, that no witness at the trial made any assertion to the effect that the appellant resembled the robber. Accordingly, there was no evidence given at the trial which fell within the definition of “identification evidence”. It is unfortunate that the trial judge in directing the jury referred to evidence which had been given in the trial as being “identification evidence”. 
     
      
    212 Because no evidence had been given in the trial which was “identification evidence” within the definition in the Evidence Act, the trial judge was not required to give directions of the kind prescribed by s 116 or s 165 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    213 Nor was there any evidence given in the trial which could be described as voice identification evidence. There was no recording of the voice of the offender and, therefore, there could be no attempt by the jury to undertake a comparison of the voice of the offender and the voice of the appellant to determine whether the voices were identical. Consequently, the decision of the High Court in Bulejcik v The Queen (1994-1995) 185 CLR 375, a case referred to by counsel for the appellant was not relevant or, at least, not directly relevant. All that the jury could essay or were invited to essay was to determine whether the appellant’s voice and accent was consistent with the very general descriptions of the offender’s voice and accent given by the witnesses and whether the appellant had the speech idiosyncrasy which Mrs Gleeson had observed in the offender of pronouncing the word “serious” as if it was “sherious”.  
     
      
    214 In Kirby the jury had been invited to compare the appearance of the accused wearing the hat which the prosecutor had asked him to put on with still video photographs of the offender which showed the offender wearing a hat. Wood CJ at CL, who delivered the leading judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal, held that the jury were not being asked to make an identification from their own memories but to make a comparison between two parts of the evidence. Consequently, no directions had been required to be given pursuant to s 116 or s 165 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    215 However, Wood CJ at CL proceeded to hold that, independently of s 165, a warning should be given to a jury which is invited to make a comparison of the kind the jury were invited to make in Kirby. 
     
      
    216 In the present case the jury were invited to make a somewhat similar comparison between the appearance of the appellant wearing the balaclava exhibit M and the overalls exhibit O and the appearance of the offender wearing a balaclava and overalls in the video and the still photographs derived from the video. 
     
      
    217 In Kirby Wood CJ at CL said that the warning to the jury should be “appropriate to the circumstances of the case”, that “each case must depend upon its own facts” and that “there is no universal formula”. Notwithstanding a number of criticisms which were made of the directions given by the trial judge in Kirby, Wood CJ at CL held that the directions given, which were quite brief, were sufficient. 
     
      
    218 I have already set out the relevant parts of the trial judge’s summing-up in the present case. What the trial judge said could clearly have been improved on, both in its expression and in its content. However, I have concluded that, in the absence of any request for any further direction by counsel for the appellant at the trial, what the trial judge said should be regarded as sufficient. 
     
      
    219 In her summing-up the trial judge referred to the evidence by the witnesses describing the appearance and the apparel of the robber and to the video and the still photographs showing the offender and told the jury a number of times that there was a need to exercise special caution in considering that evidence. The trial judge referred to some specific factors which could have adversely affected the witnesses’ ability to accurately observe the offender and to the presence of differences in the descriptions given by the witnesses of the offender. 
     
      
    220 It would have been preferable if the trial judge had not referred so often to the directions she was giving as being directions of a kind always given by trial judges in case of this sort and as not reflecting any views of the facts her Honour herself had formed. Nevertheless, I do not consider that these references diminished the force of the warning her Honour gave or reduced the warnings to a mere matter of routine. See KNP v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 213. The particular direction criticised by counsel for the appellant could have been better expressed but was unexceptional.  
     
      
    221 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      5. The trial miscarried owing to the trial judge refusing to waive the notice requirements relating to alibi evidence and refusal to allow evidence of alibi in the trial. 
       
      
    222 In the appellant’s evidence in chief at the trial the following questions and answers occurred:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Can you tell the members of the jury now where you say you were on the afternoon of 28 February 2002? 
         
        A. With any certainty I can’t be sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you have any routine duties that you performed on a Thursday and I ask you to assume that 28 February 2002 was in fact a Thursday? 
         
        A. On Thursdays it was a specific duty of mine to prepare the limousines for display on a Thursday night basis. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What was involved in preparing the limousines for display? 
         
        A. Well, I have to wash them and prepare them, detail them, start the engines, make sure they were – everything was right, clean the glasses in the back, things like that; black the tyres and then they were driven down to the display area in the main street next to a bridal shop we had an association with. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What time did they go on display? 
         
        A. From about five. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What time of the day were you involved as a routine in the preparation of the cars for display? 
         
        A. Early to mid afternoon, probably until they were fixed up from say two to three till 5 o’clock at a minimum. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was that something that you did every Thursday or just the odd Thursday? 
         
        A. No, every Thursday especially at that time of the year. It was just after Valentine’s Day which is like the hire car season.” 
        
       
      
    223 In cross-examination the appellant said that there were no records of when vehicles were displayed. The appellant that he did not know where he had been on the afternoon of 28 February 2002 and about the only thing he did know was that he had not been at Strathfield. 
     
      
    224 At the next adjournment the Crown prosecutor submitted that the evidence given by the appellant which I have quoted was evidence of alibi but no notice of alibi had been given in accordance with s 150 of the Criminal Procedure Act. The Crown prosecutor said that she would cross-examine the appellant on the evidence of alibi the appellant had given but that she would object to any evidence of alibi being given by any other witness. 
     
      
    225 Counsel for the appellant did not, at this stage, concede that the giving of the evidence had involved any contravention of s 150 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Counsel said that the appellant’s brother and father were outside the courtroom waiting to give some evidence and that he had no objection to the Crown interviewing them.  
     
      
    226 On the next day of the hearing counsel for the appellant at the trial told the trial judge that he conceded that the evidence the appellant had given was evidence of alibi and that a notice of alibi should have been given. No notice of alibi had been given.  
     
      
    227 Counsel for the appellant sought leave, retrospectively, under s 150 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Act for the appellant to give the evidence he had already given and sought leave, prospectively, under s 150 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Act for the appellant’s brother and father to give evidence in support of the alibi. Counsel for the appellant said that neither the appellant’s brother nor the appellant’s father could remember where the appellant had been on 28 February 2002 but each could give evidence that there had been a usual practice that on Thursday afternoons the appellant would prepare for display the vehicles in the appellant’s brother’s business.  
     
      
    228 The Crown prosecutor opposed the granting of any leave. The Crown prosecutor pointed out that statements of the Crown witnesses, which had been served on the defence ten months earlier as part of the Crown brief, referred to “Thursday 28 February 2002”. A subpoena for production of documents issued on behalf of the appellant showed that the defence had previously investigated the possibility of an alibi. The Crown prosecutor said that she would not ask that the evidence of alibi already given by the appellant be withdrawn. 
     
      
    229 During the argument the trial judge said that she did not think that it was within her power to grant leave, unless the Crown consented to the granting of leave.  
     
      
    230 Counsel for the appellant submitted that the proper course would be for the trial judge to grant leave and then to adjourn the trial for such period as might be necessary for the Crown to make inquiries about the alibi. Counsel said that the appellant’s brother and father would be giving evidence and the jury would anticipate that each would give evidence confirming the evidence of alibi given by the appellant. If such evidence was not given by the appellant’s brother and father, the jury would be likely to draw an inference adverse to the appellant.  
     
      
    231 The trial judge refused to grant leave for evidence in support of the alibi to be given by the appellant’s brother and father. The trial judge also refused the application for retrospective leave, even though the Crown prosecutor had said that she would not seek to have the evidence of alibi already given by the appellant withdrawn from the jury and the appellant’s own evidence remained before the jury. 
     
      
    232 When the appellant’s brother Allan Evans was called as a witness, he gave evidence about his business of operating a limousine and car hire service and about the appellant helping him in the maintenance and upkeep of the vehicles. The appellant’s brother said that he did not remember where he had been or what he had been doing on 28 February 2002.  
     
      
    233 The appellant’s father gave evidence about his son Allan operating a hire car and limousine hire service and also a jewellery business. When asked whether he could remember where he had been on 28 February 2002, the appellant’s father said that he would have been at the jewellery shop, because that was where he would normally have been. 
     
      
    234 The Crown prosecutor submitted to the trial judge that the leading of this evidence from the appellant’s brother and the appellant’s father about Mr Allan Evans’s limousine and car hire business amounted to a contravention of the ruling the trial judge had made refusing leave for evidence of the alibi to be given. The trial judge accepted the Crown prosecutor’s submission and made a ruling prohibiting counsel for the appellant from asking any further questions connecting the appellant’s father or the appellant with the operation of the car hire business. 
     
      
    235 Counsel for the appellant submitted that the exercise by the trial judge of her discretion under s 150 of the Criminal Procedure Act had miscarried. Various reasons were given by counsel for the appellant and counsel for the appellant referred to Skondin v Regina [2005] NSWCCA 417. 
     
      
    236 In my opinion, the exercise by the trial judge of the discretion under s 150 of the Criminal Procedure Act did miscarry. 
     
      
    237 Her Honour did not give any judgment stating her reasons for refusing to grant leave under s 150 and the only material before this Court is the transcript of the discussion and argument on the application for leave.  
     
      
    238 As already noted, the trial judge said that she did not think it was within her power to grant leave, unless the Crown consented to the granting of leave. In making this remark her Honour clearly misdirected herself.  
     
      
    239 In Skondin v Regina Studdert J, who delivered the leading judgment, said at par 47:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A court should be slow to refuse a leave application under s 150(2) unless prejudice arises such as is incapable of being addressed without significant disruption of the trial”. 
        
       
      
    240 The same principle would apply to a leave application under s 150 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Act. There is no indication in the transcript of the discussion and argument that her Honour applied this principle in reaching her decision.  
     
      
    241 It would seem unlikely that, if leave had been granted, there would have been any significant disruption of the trial. Counsel for the appellant had offered to make the appellant’s brother and father available to be interviewed by the Crown. Each later gave evidence that he had no actual recollection of where he had been on 28 February 2002. The appellant had given evidence before the jury that there were no records of when vehicles in his brother’s business had been displayed. 
     
      
    242 I consider this ground of appeal should be upheld. Although I have upheld the ground of appeal, the question remains whether such limited evidence as the appellant’s brother and father could have given, to the effect that the appellant usually prepared vehicles for display on Thursday afternoons, could have had any real significance.  
     
      
       
      6. The trial miscarried by the failure of the trial judge to discharge the jury following the admission into the trial of evidence and conduct which was unfairly prejudicial to the appellant and incapable of cure through directions. 
       
      
    243 Several matters were relied on by counsel for the appellant in support of this ground of appeal.  
     
      
    244 Police officer Const Swift gave evidence about the execution of the search warrant at the appellant’s home on 30 December 2003. In evidence in chief, Constable Swift was asked by the Crown prosecutor whether he had been accompanied by certain police officers, who the Crown prosecutor named. Constable Swift answered in the affirmative and added “two other constables were there as well, two dog handlers”. 
     
      
    245 At the next adjournment counsel for the appellant said that it had been agreed between the Crown prosecutor and counsel for the appellant that evidence would not be given about the two dog handlers but the witness had then volunteered that there were two dog handlers. Counsel said he would take instructions when his solicitor arrived at the court. 
     
      
    246 In further evidence in chief Constable Swift said that there had been quite difficult conditions during the search. The following question and answer then occurred:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ Q. You were falling over each other because of the sheer number of-- 
         
        A. No, there were a large number of uncapped syringes in the premises and that proved --“ 
        
       
      
    247 Counsel for the appellant made an application for the discharge of the jury on the grounds that unfairly prejudicial evidence had been placed before the jury, namely that two dog handlers had joined the other police executing the search warrant and that there were a large number of uncapped syringes at the appellant’s home. It was submitted that this evidence would lead the jury to infer or speculate that the appellant had had a connection with drugs.  
     
      
    248 The Crown prosecutor submitted that the attendance of the dog handlers was equally consistent with the police suspecting that there might be a firearm on the premises and that any prejudice from the evidence about syringes could be cured by eliciting evidence that one of the occupants of the house was a diabetic. 
     
      
    249 The trial judge refused the application for a discharge of the jury. She was asked by counsel for the appellant to give reasons for her decision “at some stage” and her Honour agreed to do so. However, no reasons were subsequently supplied. The trial judge that it was up to the Crown prosecutor whether or not she asked Constable Swift in re-examination any question about a person in the house being a diabetic. 
     
      
    250 In re-examination of Constable Swift by the Crown prosecutor the following questions and answers occurred:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You mentioned some syringes being found in the premises but you were informed they were because an occupant suffered diabetes -  
        
       
       
        
        PULLINGER: I object to any further mention of syringes. It’s not a relevant part of this trial. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: I think what the Crown is seeking to do is to put some evidence in its right and proper context. I’ll allow it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were told that they belonged to somebody who was a diabetic? 
         
        A. I can’t recall the explanation given, I’m sorry.” 
        
       
      
    251 Accordingly, the witness having been asked a leading question in re-examination, the answer to which might have alleviated any problem arising from the mention of syringes, failed to give the answer suggested by the question. 
     
      
    252 Having regard to the fact “that the attempted cure just didn’t arrive” counsel for the appellant renewed the application for a discharge of the jury. The trial judge adhered to her original decision refusing to order the discharge of the jury. In adhering to her original decision the trial judge relied on information from the Crown prosecutor that the Crown prosecutor would adduce further evidence from another witness, Constable Hayden.  
     
      
    253 In the evidence in chief of Constable Hayden the following questions and answers occurred:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Constable, during the course of the search of Mr Evans’ premises, were there some syringes located? 
         
        A. Yes, there was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were informed that they belonged to the accused’s girlfriend who was a diabetic? 
         
        A. Yes, that’s correct.” 
        
       
      
    254 A further matter on which counsel for the appellant sought to rely was that during the trial the appellant was, in the presence of the jury, “taken down” from the dock in the courtroom thereby disclosing to the jury (it was submitted) that the appellant had been refused bail and was in custody. 
     
      
    255 The first occasion on which this happened was when the appellant, while being cross-examined, was asked to put on the overalls exhibit O. The appellant himself said “perhaps I can go down the stairs and do it”.  
     
      
    256 Shortly afterwards, after the appellant had put on the overalls and had walked up and down in front of the jury, his counsel asked whether the appellant could change out of the overalls. The trial judge told the appellant he could step down and “perhaps at this stage you could go downstairs with the officer and then come back up”.  
     
      
    257 Counsel for the appellant applied for a discharge of the jury because “in the presence of the jury he (the appellant) was taken down from the dock indicating to the jury that he was a person in custody and again an indication of bad character”. 
     
      
    258 The Crown prosecutor opposed the application on the grounds that the jury would have seen Corrective Services officers sitting in court throughout the trial, that the jury would expect that a person charged with an armed robbery with a firearm would be held in custody pending trial, that the appellant had been the first to suggest that he go down the stairs to change and that the jury would simply think that there was a convenient place underneath the courtroom where the appellant could change in and out of the overalls.  
     
      
    259 The trial judge gave a judgment in which she refused the application and relied on the submissions which had been made by the Crown prosecutor. 
     
      
    260 I do not consider that the various matters complained of, taken individually or in combination, required the trial judge to discharge the jury. 
     
      
    261 I do not consider that the brief reference by Constable Swift to two police dog handlers being part of a large group of police who executed the search warrant would have conveyed to the jury the sinister implication feared by counsel for the appellant. Dogs are used by police in a number of different kinds of operations.  
     
      
    262 The reasons given by the Crown prosecutor and adopted by the trial judge in her judgment were a sufficient basis for rejecting the application for a discharge, insofar as it was based on the appellant being “taken down” from the dock. In any event, I consider it likely that there is an awareness among jurors that the bail laws have become increasingly stringent and that a person standing trial on a charge involving the use or threatened use of violence with a firearm is quite likely to be in custody, bail refused. 
     
      
    263 The evidence given by Const Swift about there having been a large number of uncapped syringes at the appellant’s home which had made the execution of the search warrant more difficult is more troubling. However, evidence was ultimately given by Const Hayden to the effect that the syringes belonged to the appellant’s girlfriend who was a diabetic and this evidence would have reduced any prejudicial effect of the earlier evidence. 
     
      
    264 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      7. The failure to the trial judge to give any or adequate reasons in the trial created procedural unfairness to the appellant. 
       
      
    265 During the trial, the trial judge was required to make a number of rulings on disputed issues. 
     
      
    266 On a few occasions the trial judge, after reaching a decision on such an issue, gave a brief judgment. An example is a judgment her Honour gave in refusing the application for a discharge of the jury because the appellant had, allegedly, been “taken down” from the dock in the presence of the jury.  
     
      
    267 However, on a number of occasions, her Honour did not give any judgment in which she stated her reasons for refusing an application by counsel for the appellant. For example, her Honour did not give any judgment in deciding to refuse the application by counsel for the appellant for a discharge of the jury on the basis of the evidence given by Const Swift about two dog handlers being included in the police who went to the appellant’s house on 30 December 2003 and about there being a large number of uncapped syringes in the premises. 
     
      
    268 On some of the occasions on which her Honour did not give reasons her Honour was expressly requested by counsel for the appellant to provide reasons and her Honour undertook to do so. This Court was informed that on those occasions where her Honour did not give reasons at the time of making her ruling she has not subsequently provided any reasons for her rulings. 
     
      
    269 Counsel for the appellant informed the Court that attempts have been made to communicate with her Honour for the purpose of requesting reasons for her rulings but that these attempts have been unsuccessful. 
     
      
    270 Counsel for the Crown on this appeal suggested that the legal representatives of the appellant should have attempted to utilise the procedure under s 11 of the Criminal Appeal Act, whereby a trial judge, if requested by the Chief Justice, is obliged to furnish to the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal a report giving the judge’s opinion upon any point arising in the case. However, s 11 of the Criminal Appeal Act does not provide any direct remedy for an appellant and I would not hold it against the appellant that, apparently, no request has been made to the Chief Justice to exercise the Chief Justice’s power under s 11 of the Criminal Appeal Act. 
     
      
    271 The various rulings her Honour made were significant rulings and the appellant was entitled to have reasons given by her Honour for her rulings, particularly where reasons were requested and her Honour undertook to provide reasons. See Harris v Regina NSWCCA (2005) 432 at par 21 per Studdert J on behalf of the Court. 
     
      
    272 Her Honour was remiss in not stating, even if quite succinctly, her reasons for a number of her rulings. However, I do not consider that her Honour’s failure to state her reasons in separate judgments amounted, as was submitted by counsel for the appellant, to such a fundamental procedural irregularity as to warrant setting aside the appellant’s convictions. All, or almost all, of the applications by counsel for the appellant at the trial were argued at considerable length. The competing submissions of the parties were stated and, indeed, often repeated a number of times. The views the trial judge was forming on each application were revealed by frequent remarks made by her in the course of the argument. I consider that in the present case it can be inferred from the transcript of the argument what were her Honour’s reasons for making each of her rulings and it is possible for this Court to determine whether her Honour erred in making the rulings. 
     
      
    273 Counsel for the appellant referred to Fleming v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 250. However, Fleming, while of some indirect relevance, was a case of a trial by a judge alone.  
     
      
    274 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      8. The trial miscarried as a result of the impropriety of the prosecutor.  
       
      
    275 It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that what in the earlier grounds of appeal were alleged to have been miscarriages of justice had resulted from improper conduct on the part of the Crown prosecutor at the trial. Accordingly, whether this ground of appeal could succeed would depend on this Court upholding some of the earlier grounds of appeal. However, I have rejected almost all of the earlier grounds of appeal and I have therefore rejected almost all of the foundation for the present ground of appeal. The only respect in which I would consider the Crown prosecutor’s conduct is open to criticism is in her producing, and asking the appellant to put on, her own sunglasses, which had not been the subject of any evidence.  
     
      
    276 It was submitted that the Crown prosecutor had acted improperly in making some of the submissions she made to the trial judge. However, even if the prosecutor’s submissions were to be regarded as not well-founded, there was no impropriety in the Crown prosecutor making the submissions that she did about the directions the trial judge should give in summing-up to the jury and in opposing the application by the appellant for leave to rely on the alibi evidence.  
     
      
    277 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      9. The verdict of the jury was unreasonable. 
       
      
    278 The principles to be applied by the Court of Criminal Appeal in considering such a ground of appeal are now well settled. See M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-495: MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606; Niass v Regina [2005] NSWCCA 120 per Hunt AJA at paras 6,7,8. These principles include that the Court of Criminal Appeal is required to make its independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt.  
     
      
    279 Earlier in this judgment I summarised the Crown case at the trial and also the defence case.  
     
      
    280 Having made by own independent assessment of the evidence I consider that it was clearly open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt. 
     
      
    281 The evidence about the cap provided powerful evidence of the appellant’s guilt. Each of the Crown witnesses Thompson, Samad and Gleeson gave evidence that immediately after the robbery they observed the cap on the floor of the Council chambers, the cap not having been there before the robber entered the Council chambers. In his evidence the appellant said that the cap was “vaguely familiar”. It was open to the jury to reject as lacking any plausibility the submission made by counsel for the appellant that the cap had been deliberately left by a robber who was not the appellant so as to incriminate the appellant.  
     
      
    282 If the jury were satisfied that the cap had been left by the robber and had been dropped, not planted, by the robber, then the DNA evidence about the matter lifted from the cap provided powerful evidence of the appellant’s guilt. The other parts of the Crown case could then be added to the evidence about the cap. 
     
      
    283 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Proviso 
       
      
    284 I have allowed part of the third ground of appeal in that I have held that the appellant should not have been asked to put on the Crown prosecutor’s sunglasses and I have allowed the fifth ground of appeal in that I have held that the trial judge should have granted the application for leave to adduce evidence in support of the alibi from the appellant’s brother and father. In these circumstances the question arises whether the proviso to s 6 (3) of the Criminal Appeal Act should be applied in favour of the Crown. 
     
      
    285 I would not regard either of the flaws I have found in the trial as having significance.  
     
      
    286 The prosecutor’s sunglasses were wraparound sunglasses of a kind which, according to the evidence of a number of witnesses, the robber had been wearing and the appellant was asked to put on the balaclava over the sunglasses, so that what the jury saw on the appellant’s head was the balaclava worn over the sunglasses.  
     
      
    287 The evidence the appellant himself gave in support of the alibi was not withdrawn from the jury. There were no records to support the alibi. Neither the appellant’s brother not the appellant’s father could have given positive evidence of where the appellant was on 28 February 2002. They could only give evidence of a general practice of which the appellant had already given evidence. Both the appellant’s brother and the appellant’s father were able to give some evidence about the nature of the appellant’s brother’s business. 
     
      
    288 Applying the principles stated by the High Court in Weiss v The Queen (2005) 80 ALJR 444 especially at par 31-41, I have made my own independent assessment of the whole record and, after making due allowance for the limitations that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding on the record, I am satisfied that the evidence properly admitted at the trial proved the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt and that there is no reason why the appeal should, nevertheless, be allowed.  
     
      
    289 I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
    290 HIDDEN J: The defects in the conduct of this trial identified by James J are troubling. Nevertheless, the case is one in which it is appropriate to apply the proviso.  
     
      
    291 I agree with James J. 
     
      
    292 HOEBEN J: I agree with James J.

      2315/2005 Regina v Mark Edward Norman 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT: On admissibility of telephone intercepts (see p 437 of transcript) 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The accused were tried before me for the murder of a solicitor at his office in Petersham on 6 April 2004. The accused Olivieri was alleged to have shot the deceased that evening. The accused Norman was charged as an accessory before the fact to the murder.  
     
      
    2 Mr Austin, for the accused Olivieri, objected to the evidence of a number of intercepted mobile phone conversations to which his client had been a party. I allowed the evidence, and the recordings of the relevant conversations were admitted as calls D, E, F, H, I, J, K, L, N, O, P and Q of exhibit CC. These are the reasons for that ruling.  
     
      
    3 All the calls were made after the publication of an article about the shooting of the deceased in the Sydney Daily Telegraph on 10 June 2004. That article followed a press release by the police, together with the release of an image said to be that of a man seen acting suspiciously in the area near the deceased’s home at the relevant time. The clear implication of the press release, and of the article, was that that man was suspected to have been the gunman. I received the press release, the article, and an article to the same effect in the Sydney Morning Herald of 11 June 2004, as exhibit G on the voir dire. 
     
      
    4 After the shooting the deceased’s widow had helped police compile a COMFIT image and a FACE image of the gunman, whom she had seen running from the office where her husband had been shot. The image released by the police for publication on 10 June was neither of those. It was a photograph of Mr Olivieri, modified to give the appearance of a computer generated image. What the newspaper articles conveyed to the reader was that that image had been able to be compiled by a witness or witnesses who had seen such a man in the area at the time of the shooting. 
     
      
    5 This was false, to the knowledge of the investigating police. It was a subterfuge for which they sought and obtained authority under s8 of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997. I received a copy of that authority as exhibit F on the voir dire. Telephone intercepts on the mobile phones of Mr Olivieri and his co-accused, Mr Norman, were in place before the issue of the press release. The purpose of the subterfuge, no doubt, was to engender phone conversations in which the accused made statements implicating themselves in the murder.  
     
      
    6 On 10 June Mr Olivieri, then in Queensland, had two telephone conversations with a friend, Ray Johnson, in Sydney: calls D and E of exhibit CC. Mr Johnson told him about the Telegraph article and, in particular, of the publication of an image bearing a startling resemblance to him. Mr Olivieri expressed concern a number of times about this development, even saying (in call E) that he thought that he was “gone”. Later that same day there was a call between the two accused (call F), in which the matter was discussed and Mr Olivieri said that he would “have to go away for a while …”. 
     
      
    7 The remaining calls were made over the period of about two weeks thereafter. There is no need to refer to each of them. They contain further references to the newspaper article and disclose a continuing interest in the development of the investigation into the murder. Mr Olivieri on several occasions asserted that he was in Queensland at the time of the shooting, and he and Mr Norman discussed witnesses who might have given evidence to that effect. However, he also expressed concern that police who searched the property in Queensland where he had been living might find items from a motel in Sydney at which he had been staying at the time of the shooting.  
     
      
    8 Put briefly, the Crown Prosecutor relied on the calls as evidence of knowledge on the part of Mr Olivieri of the murder such as to suggest that he was involved in it, and a concern about the newspaper article and the continuing police investigation born of a fear that his involvement might be detected. She proposed to put to the jury that his apparent protestations of innocence on the basis that he was in Queensland at the time were in fact part of a process of concocting with his co-accused a false account to be given to the police. 
     
      
    9 Some of the calls contain discussions between the two accused about the payment of money by Mr Norman to Mr Olivieri. Mr Austin did not object to that material, accepting that it was admissible as evidence of their continuing relationship. Otherwise, the first basis of his objection was that the calls were irrelevant because they contained no statement by Mr Olivieri which could constitute an admission of involvement in the murder. He relied upon s88 of the Evidence Act, and I accept that that section extends to the question whether a representation is capable of constituting an admission. I would respectfully adopt the view of Greg James J in R v Hall & Ors [2001] NSWSC 827 at [27] – [29]. 
     
      
    10 True it is that no explicit admission of involvement in the murder is to be found in any of the calls. Indeed, as already referred to, some of Mr Olivieri’s statements amounted on their face to protestations of innocence. Otherwise, Mr Austin argued, what was said was at most ambiguous and was consistent with the state of mind of a man wrongly suspected of a serious crime. However, I took the view that the significance of the calls was a matter for the jury and that they were fairly open to the interpretation for which the Crown Prosecutor had contended. That being so, they could be said to contain admissions, being representations adverse to the accused’s interest in the outcome of the proceeding: see the definition of “admission” in Part 1 of the Dictionary to the Evidence Act. In any event, however they might be classified, I considered that the calls were relevant as part of the Crown’s circumstantial case.  
     
      
    11 Mr Austin’s second and alternative argument was that, if the calls did contain admissions, they should be rejected upon the basis that to admit them would be unfair to the accused, within the meaning of s90 of the Evidence Act, or for reasons of public policy under s138. Thirdly, he argued that, even if the evidence were found to be admissible otherwise than as admissions, it should still be rejected under s138. 
     
      
    12 He submitted that the situation was analogous to that of police making a false or misleading representation to a suspect in the course of an interview, in the hope of inducing an admission: cf. s138(2)(b) of the Evidence Act. It was said that the evidence should not be allowed as admissions because it would be unfair to the accused to do so and because, in any event, the balancing act required by s138(1) should lead to its rejection. Mr Austin emphasised that the argument was only by way of analogy, acknowledging that the evidence was not the product of a police interview (or of “official questioning”, as that expression is used in Part 3.4 of the Evidence Act). 
     
      
    13 The arguments are related, and both require consideration of the fact that the misleading article in the Telegraph was published pursuant to an authority under the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act. This is not the occasion to consider the rationale and legislative history of that Act, or to examine its provisions in any detail. Section 16 provides that an activity engaged in under an authority under s8 “is not unlawful, and does not constitute an offence or corrupt conduct, so long as it is authorised by, and is engaged in in accordance with, the authority for the operation”. “Corrupt conduct” is defined as bearing the meaning it has in the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988. 
     
      
    14 Whether the issue of the misleading press release in the present case was “unlawful”, or could constitute “an offence or corrupt conduct”, is far from clear. No basis on which it might be considered to be unlawful or to amount to corrupt conduct was articulated in argument. The question remains whether it might amount to an “impropriety” within the meaning of s138 of the Evidence Act and, if so, whether an authority under the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act is effective to deprive it of that character.  
     
      
    15 Another provision of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act which might have a bearing in the present case is s3A, relevant parts of which are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        3A  
        Act not to affect certain matters 
         
          
          (1) This Act does not affect, and is taken never to have affected, the existence or exercise of any discretions (including any administrative or judicial discretions) that, apart from this Act, may lawfully be exercised in relation to the commencement, conduct or conclusion of legal proceedings. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (2) Without limiting subsection (1), the discretions referred to in that subsection include the following: 
           
          (a)… 
           
          (b) any discretion as to whether or not evidence should be admitted in legal proceedings, 
           
          (c)… 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ……… 
          
         
        
       
      
    16 The ambit of s3A and s16 was raised, but not developed, in argument. The matter was not the subject of research and full argument, and it would be inappropriate for me to express any concluded view about it. I took the view that the evidence should not be rejected under s90 or s138 even if it were assumed, without deciding, that the publication was improper and that it was not validated by its authority as a controlled operation. 
     
      
    17 The view I took of the balancing exercise under s138 was the same, whether or not the evidence was relevant as a series of admissions or otherwise as part of the Crown’s circumstantial case. Having regard to the matters set out in s138(3), I assessed the evidence as important and as having substantial probative value. I did not consider any impropriety to be grave, noting that it was neither deliberate nor reckless. Indeed, there was nothing to suggest other than that the investigating police, and the senior authorising officer, saw the issue of the press release as a legitimate investigative tool, appropriately authorised as a controlled operation.  
     
      
    18 As to s90, I saw no relevant unfairness to the accused. There is no true analogy with a misrepresentation by police to a suspect under interrogation. Certainly, the evidence might be seen as the product of a subterfuge but, like it or not, subterfuge is an accepted part of police investigation, particularly of serious crime. It is, for example, an inherent part of every undercover operation. To the extent that it led to relevant and significant evidence in the present case, it was not unfair to use it against Mr Olivieri. 
     
      
    19 Mr Austin also relied upon s137 of the Evidence Act but, for the reasons I have already given, it could not be said that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice to his client. I should add that that argument was directed primarily to a particular matter which, in the event, was not pressed because Mr Austin decided not to adduce evidence on the voir dire about it.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Vernon Chillie is twenty-nine years old. For more than a decade he has been getting into trouble. The first entry in his criminal history is a notification of revocation of parole and an observation of him being returned to his former custody on 9 January 1995. Presumably these are matters relating to the Children’s Court that account for him being in “former custody”.2 His offences are primarily offences of dishonesty. He is a recidivist break and enter criminal. Several of the break and enter offences are aggravated instances of the offence, in that people are on the premises when he breaks into them.3 Mr Chillie has pleaded guilty to two aggravated break and enter offences that occurred whilst he was on parole for similar offences. His parole has now been revoked. He has been in custody since his arrest on 25 October 2005. There is a related charge of attempting to take and drive a conveyance that he also asks to be taken into account. That offence appears on a Form 1. 4 As sentencing judge, it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for these two offences before this Court, committed by this offender against these victims in this community (see The Queen v Gladue [1999] 1 SCR 688 at [81]). My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offences before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender (subjective matters). The starting point for such assessments requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to the offence and to the offender. 5 The offender rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed, even if looking through a glass darkly. Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, totality, whether the offence attracts a standard non-parole period, as these two do, and the length of the parole period and finally, of course, the ultimate length of the term of imprisonment or other penalty that is to be imposed. 6 None of these can be commenced until the primary facts are determined. What weight needs to be given to all these matters, against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community, will also need to be determined (see The Queen v Cuthbert, The Queen v Rushby and The Queen v Hayes).Facts7 An agreed statement of facts has been tendered. At about 4am on 25 October 2003 the offender entered the premises of Lana Mahoney at 448 Glenmore Road, Edgecliff. She is a sixty-one year old female living alone in those premises. The premises are two-storey terrace type premises. Ms Mahoney was sleeping in an upstairs bedroom. Chillie entered several rooms throughout the premises, including her bedroom, while she was sleeping. From the downstairs kitchen he removed her wallet and car keys. He had inspected drawers and cupboards in the various rooms throughout the premises. He exited the premises by unlocking a rear courtyard door. Taken from the premises was, as I say, the victim’s wallet and her car keys, and included in the bag was her credit card. 8 When he left those premises, very shortly afterwards he entered a set of premises four houses down at 440 Glenmore Road. He manipulated a locking mechanism on a rear ground floor window. Again, these premises were two-storey terrace type premises, with a husband and wife asleep upstairs. He located downstairs a set of car keys belonging to a Subaru, a black wallet containing credit cards and one hundred and seventy-five dollars in cash, and a thirty-eight inch plasma television, said to have been valued at seven thousand dollars. 9 Chillie unlocked and opened the rear ground floor door and found the Subaru on Walker Street, which must be a street that intersects with Glenmore Road. He had with him at the time the television set and he put the TV set on the rear seat of that vehicle. He returned to 440 Glenmore, proceeded upstairs, entered an upstairs study where he located six hundred dollars. He went to the bathroom, turned on the bathroom light, and was looking through the cupboards in the bathroom when one of the victims, the woman of the house, awoke and entered the bathroom. Not surprisingly, she began to scream, and again not surprisingly, the accused decamped through the rear door.10 At 4.20am the police arrived. They saw the offender, in the front yard of the premises he had first gone to. They pursued him. Ultimately after a substantial chase he returned to the Subaru. He opened the driver’s side front door, sat in the driver’s seat, placed the key in the ignition of that vehicle and sought to start it. Police ran to the driver’s side front door and called upon him to surrender. He was placed under arrest, taken to the Waverley Police Station and charged.Objective Criminality11 From the facts, as he finds them to be, the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offences as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of an offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the two offences before me with the criminality of offences of the same genre. It is in that way that the seriousness of the criminality of these offences can be evaluated. The objective criminality, not surprisingly, has an impact on the overall sentence to be imposed.12 The criminal justice system places great store upon the sanctity of a person’s home. For example, police and other government authorities must seek the Court’s permission before they enter the most humble person’s abode. Any analysis of s 112 and s 113 of the Crimes Act, that is offences dealing with breaking and entering, would yield the inescapable fact that these sections focus upon the crime of breaking and entering the personal space of an occupant as one of a two-pronged aspect of the crime. In this case, the second aspect is the commission of a serious indictable offence, namely the larceny. Larceny, standing on its own, carries a maximum penalty of five years, but if you add to that the breaking and entering of personal space of a person it carries fourteen years. If you add to that the fact that the personal space that you have invaded also has the person in it, the offence carries twenty years. That is, four times what it would have carried had it been but a simply larceny. So the essence of the criminality in this offence is not just the stealing but more importantly the intrusion into the space of people and particularly the intrusion into space of people when they are present.13 The items taken from 448 Glenmore Street included the victim’s handbag, containing her credit card, wallet and car keys. His victim was a single, sixty-one year old female. Mr Chillie’s entry into her home and, in particular, into her bedroom whilst she was asleep represents a serious invasion of her personal space, a place in which she was entitled to believe her privacy, safety and personal security were secure. She presents as a more vulnerable victim than the other two because she was alone. However, there is no evidence that the offender knew that she was alone. The value of the items taken is not given in evidence. Of real significance, however, is the importance the wallet, credit card and car keys place in the daily lives of people. Of course, it also provided this offender with the means to commit further criminal offences. 14 Whilst I am punishing for the commission of this offence only, any likelihood of the offender committing other offences that the theft of these items suggests a level of sophistication that I am entitled to take into account in assessing the objective seriousness of this offence. Again, the taking of the car keys, particularly bearing in mind that car keys these days have buttons that open the cars and thereby identify them, also suggests a level of sophistication and future planning, that is, planning particularly for an escape such as was attempted in the second offence.15 In the second offence the theft of seven hundred and seventy-five dollars, the Subaru car keys and the thirty-eight inch plasma TV represents a greater haul than was the case at the first home. The offender’s return to the premises represents a continuation of the offence. I am satisfied he intended to use the Subaru for a quick escape, that shows sophistication of his criminal act and, as it were, planning whilst committing the acts. S112(2) Offences and the Mid- range of Seriousness.16 It is important to determine where these offences fall within a midrange of seriousness for offences encapsulated by s 112(2) of the Crimes Act. S 112(2) prohibits the commission of a serious indictable offence in circumstances where an offender has broken into a dwelling house. 17 A serious indictable offence is one punishable by life, or for a term of five years or more imprisonment. In this case the serious indictable offence committed is one of stealing. That is, an offence which carries a maximum of five years imprisonment. The range of offences available within s 112(2) encompasses far more serious indictable offences and can extend through to malicious wounding, sexual assaults and, in theory, up to murder. That this offence involves stealing as distinct from a more serious indictable offence sees this offence as one towards the lower end of range of offences available within s 112(2). The offence committed is one that, as it were, just qualifies as a serious indictable offence. Consequently, that fact pushes the offence towards the lower range of s 112(2) offences available to be considered for midrange of seriousness for s 112(2) offences. 18 While I am dealing with the midrange of seriousness, particularly as it impacts upon the presence of people in the premises, there is no evidence that suggests that the first victim was aware of the presence of the offender. When confronted by a victim in the second instance there was no threat or abuse, as it would seem, shouted at the victim by the offender. What appears to have happened is the offender has decamped immediately, and it would appear, no physical contact made. 19 The value of goods taken from the first break and enter is towards the lower end. The value of goods taken from the second offence is greater; a significant sum of money, and a TV set having replacement value of seven thousand. As events turned out there was no permanent loss of these goods to the owners. It would appear, and I certainly have inferred, they were all recovered upon the arrest of the offender. 20 The return to the premises of the second burglary, as I said, aggravates that offence. The offender brought considerable skill, although there is no evidence of any planning, to both of these offences. Whilst the second offence is significantly more serious it still falls well below the midrange of seriousness for offences covered by s 112(2) as evaluated on its objective criminality.21 The attempt to take and drive offence, which is on the Form 1, was committed in circumstances where the offender was seeking to effect an escape. His original plan was that it would be used for purposes of transporting the stolen booty. It was an offence that showed scant regard for a valuable asset of the owner of the vehicle. For many, if not most people, assuming they own their own house their motor vehicle is their second most significant asset. Although he rushed to the car in order to escape I am satisfied it was always part of his plan to use that vehicle to transport the stolen TV.Subjective Matters22 I now turn to the subject factors. I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for a criminal offence but also I am sentencing this offender for it. Each offender coming before the Court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to the offender may offer to the Court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by this offender or some reason why a more, or less, sentencing outcome is appropriate.Relationship and family background23 Vernon Chillie’s early history comes from an undated letter written by the late Father Ted Kennedy. He says 
     
      
     “I have known Vernon Chillie since he was an infant. His parents, Vernon Chillie senior, and Joy Waldon, came from Queensland where his father had been a State basketball champion. During the time that they were living in Redfern his father was convicted of killing his mother. At that time Vernon was a child of four years old. He and his sisters [there were three of them] were then virtually orphaned and Mrs Shirley Smith, a renowned aboriginal activist in Sydney, fostered them. Vernon and his siblings were thus triply deprived. Not only did they lose their mother through death and their father through incarceration but also their whole family network of relationships in Queensland. Tragically, a series of circumstances led to a loss of contact between the children and their father.” 24 It is these series of circumstances that clearly indicate a seriously deprived childhood. He is the younger of the four children. He came to Sydney, aged four, from Doomaje, an aboriginal reserve on the Gulf of Carpentaria. He left “Mum Shirl’s” care age fourteen or fifteen. He lived with an aunt for time, but also spent some time on the streets and in juvenile institutions. He made some contact with his father upon the father’s release. The father lived in the Gosford region after his release from gaol. 25 Whilst this offender was in custody on this occasion he has organised his father funeral service.26 Aged sixteen he commenced a relationship that lasted for two years. His second relationship commenced when he was nineteen. He is still supported by his partner Vanessa. She has been to court on each occasion he has been before me.Education, Employment History and Work Skills27 The offender left school in Year 7, then aged fourteen. It is said he has adequate literary skills, although he claimed to have difficulty with his peers and has but a couple of friends. In his evidence he was articulate, engaging and competent. He gave a reasonable account of himself both in July and this morning. 28 He has completed short courses in carpentry and printing whilst in custody. He professed some interest in cabinetmaking and says that he would like employment in this field. That seems to be modified on this occasion to carpentry which is, in my view, a much more sensible area because there is more work available in it. 29 He has sporting skills, but frankly it is unlikely he would gain employment from any sporting skills. He has given his age as now twenty-nine. However these skills may provide him with a basis of making contact, say, with a football or basketball team on his release and give him a wider network of social contacts on release. Participation in sport at a social level may also improve his self image.30 So far as can be discerned from appearances, he appears to be in good physical health. He is interested in sport and presents as a fit man aged - I have got twenty-eight this time, I must have worked it out at twenty-eight, is that twenty-eight right? Mental health issues31 He has suffered severe trauma, particularly following the violent death of his mother at the hands of his father. He has also suffered the consequential loss of his father who was incarcerated for the crime. There may still be some legacy from these issues that should occupy the attention of counsellors. His anger and aggressive behaviour in the past would seem to indicate such a position. Drug Abuse Issues32 Vernon Chillie commenced drinking at the age of thirteen, to a point of being intoxicated at least weekly and sometimes twice weekly. Significantly, following a conviction for a serious assault when he was about sixteen and very intoxicated, he has reduced his consumption of alcohol to an occasional basis only. The assault matter saw the offender deprived of victim compensation entitlement accruing to him from his mother's death, as his compensation award was channelled to the victim of his own assault. 33 Chillie has smoked cannabis regularly until the age of eighteen. He claims to have smoked it only occasionally since then, however the cannabis was replaced with an entrenched heroin addiction which has lasted for several years and was still ongoing at the time of his arrest. For the past four years it would seem he has been a poly-drug abuser, injecting cocaine as well as heroin and using ecstasy and ice. There was an attempt at rehabilitation in 2003 when he entered a program known as the Subutex Program. 34 Since incarceration he has become highly motivated to achieve rehabilitation. The author of the Pre-Sentence report says: 
     
      
      “He has indicated that he is determined to break the nexus between his abuse of drugs and his offending behaviour. Those who have seen the cycle of offending and incarceration in the past have indicated that Mr Chillie’s current attitude is very much more positive than previously and have confidence in his plan to rehabilitate himself via the Bridge Program.” 
      
    35 His drug and alcohol counsellor says in a report dated 16 June 2006 at page 4: 
     
      
       
      “He has been known to the writer since his first adult custody in 2000 and his presentation and attitude this time is considerably different. The positive comments from staff about his behaviour and secondly the lack of “in-house” charges over the past eight months I believe strongly reflects his more confident attitude and approach to change.” 
      
    36 She continues: 
     
      
       
      “It appears also that Mr Chillie’s decision to detach himself from the gaol politics and allow himself the time to appreciate his family support has resulted in a more responsible and confident young man. He did also state to the writer that he has come to realise that he does not have to follow the mob to gain respect from his peers... I believe there is more to Mr Chillie than his past record demonstrates and he is capable of moving forward if he maintains his current positive attitude.” 
      
    37 The facts tendered before the Local Court magistrate noted that he used heroin every day. (That must have been for the bail hearing.) Past Criminal History38 Vernon Chillie’s criminal antecedents show that he has been in trouble with the law since 1995. Early in 1995 he was before the Children’s Court for break, enter and steal, assault, stealing and resisting police. He was first before the District Court for maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent, in December 1995. This is the offence of violence I earlier referred to that occurred when the offender was in his teenage years. 39 He appears to have remained out of trouble for four years thereafter. His next period of offending is towards the end of 1999 and into 2000. Again his offending included break, enter and steal and aggravated break, enter and steal. Several of these offences were dealt with in the District Court. 40 Soon after his release from prison in 2003 he was again committing aggravated break, enter and steal offences. For this last aggravated break, enter and steal he was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of five years. The offence that I am dealing with occurred during the two and a half year parole period. The commission of offences during parole period aggravates the criminality of that offending conduct. I am satisfied his predilection for committing break, enter and steal offences is related to his ongoing drug abuse and his need for funds to support his drug addiction. 41 He told W John Taylor, well known clinical and forensic psychologist, this both in general terms and in dealing with the particular offences that I am dealing with. In order to break what is becoming a cycle of offending, imprisonment, further offending, and further imprisonment, there is a need to address the causes of his offending conduct provided that can be done without endangering the community.Attitude to the offence42 This offender recognises that his motive for committing these offences was to obtain money so that he could purchase illegal drugs. He claimed to be heavily under the influence of cocaine and heroin at the time of the offending conduct. He told John Taylor: 
     
      
       
      “I don’t know why I keep doing it. It isn’t nice to go into people’s homes. There’s no excuse, the drugs control you.” 
      
    43 It may be from that last comment he could be thought to be seeking to avoid responsibility, however I have heard him in the witness box. He has impressed me as being willing to accept full responsibility for his criminal acts. I am fortified in this view by his early plea of guilty. Since his incarceration he appears genuinely committed to resolving his drug abuse problems consistent with a recognition of a significant factor in his criminal conduct.44 I am satisfied he is genuinely contrite. Further, I am satisfied he is genuinely seeking rehabilitation.45 He pleaded guilty before the Local Court. While that will impact upon any sentencing outcome it is also important in assessing his offending conduct and his prospects of rehabilitation. It is one of the factors I have taken into account in his favour in determining to impose a sentence for these offences which is capable of being suspended, subject to some serious conditions to which I will come shortly.46 The plea of guilty not only supports his contrition but amounts to acceptance by him of responsibility for his acts. He should be entitled to a benefit for his plea of guilty. Usually that benefit is expressed as a discount, however it is not confined strictly to discounts, it can in fact impact upon the nature of the penalty imposed. The administration of criminal justice is served by guilty pleas and particularly so far as the utilitarian value of the pleas are concerned I make the following comments; court time is saved; witnesses time, legal expenses and the like are freed so that they can be devoted to other cases; a guilty plea reduces considerably, almost to the point of entirely, the likelihood of contest in an appeal on the issue of guilt in respect of the offences I am dealing with. These are important utilitarian factors insofar as the administration of criminal justice is concerned. The interests of criminal justice are also advanced through the public acknowledgment by an offender of guilt. In that sense, pleas of guilt by offenders sustain the community confidence in the administration of criminal justice by maintaining the confidence of the community in the investigation of crime and the community’s expectation that those guilty of crime will be held accountable for it.Rehabilitation Prospects47 This is a case in which sentences since 1995 of three years, three years, and five years, have not brought about any change in this offender’s conduct. Upon each release in the past the community has again been endangered by his predilection to break, enter and steal. In the absence of any rehabilitation the cycle of the past ten years is, it seems to me, doomed to repeat itself. Some effort to maximise rehabilitation prospects is surely called for in this case at this time. I say at this time because those who are closely connected with the supervision of the offender whilst he is in gaol seem to record a change in his motivation. Such a change is not going to last forever. 48 On the other hand, some realistic assessment of Vernon Chillie’s rehabilitation prospects is a vital step in assessing the appropriate rehabilitation path. As earlier remarked, the ultimate concern of any sentencer must be the protection of the community. While rehabilitation may advance that goal it is equally important the community’s protection must be considered whilst that rehabilitation is being achieved. This assessment is predicated upon the conditions of the s 12 bond that I intend to impose and in particular (1) that he be of good behaviour and (2) that for the first ten months or so he accept full time residential drug treatment, specifically in the Bridge Program. Were that condition to be avoided there is no way that I can see that his rehabilitation can be advanced with some modicum of safety to the community. The positive rehabilitation factors include: 
     
     Vernon Chillie’s positive behaviour whilst in custody including contact with his drug and alcohol worker, his withdrawal from methadone, his changed attitude on this occasion and his rejection of past prison associates. 
     
     
     His willingness to enter a full time rehabilitation program, and as significantly, his acceptance as a suitable candidate by the Bridge Program.  
     
     
     His insight into the role drug abuse has played in his past criminal conduct.  
     
     
     The strong and ongoing support by his partner and presumably his child, offering continued personal and emotional comfort to him.  
     
     
     His willingness to seek support post release, including from the Ex-Inmates Program being established and conducted by John Taylor and a number of ex-inmates, and by assessments from professionals, including, it would seem, although I understand it would not be binding, by expressions of support from the Parole authorities.  
    49 Two documents that have been tendered lead me to a sense that the Parole Board support the path being proposed. R A Cosman, Acting Director and Secretary of the New South Wales State Parole Authority said: 
     
      
      “Given Mr Chillie’s contact with the drug and alcohol worker, his positive behaviour in custody, and post release plans regarding the rehabilitation program his release to parole on 24 October 2006 would appear to be a reasonable proposition, particularly if there is a favourable report from the Probation and Parole Service.” 
      
    50 There was also, although it is hearsay, but the strict rules of evidence do not apply in sentencing proceedings, (see s 4 of the Evidence Act) a further quote from Ms Debijenko is in these terms: 
     
      
       
      “I have spoken to Parole and they are going to support but will recommend a s 12 and not a s11.” 
      
    51 That is a facsimile addressed to the offender’s advocate, Mr Barber, from the drug and alcohol worker, Rhonda Dabigenko.52 There are a number of negative indicators, including: 
     
     He has been assessed as having a high to moderate likelihood of recidivism. 
     
     
     To the extent that his past criminal conduct is a predictor of future conduct he has a history of recidivism. 
     
     
     He is assessed as having poor impulse control. 
     
     
     There are a number of unresolved issues arising from a traumatic childhood still plaguing him. 
     
     
     There is an entrenched history of drug abuse that is to be beaten. 
     
     
     There are a number of anti-social characteristics in his current personality adjustment.  
    53 One should understand that any personality profile such as Mr W John Taylor as undertaken is to be understood as a snapshot of how you presently are. As with any snapshot of people, they change with time, and a snapshot of personality can also change with time; more particularly with work and dedication on aspects where one seeks to reform it.54 A rehabilitation program needs to deal with, and if possible impact positively upon, the negative indicators. Assuming Vernon Chillie is genuine in his desire to reform, and I have found him so to be, a program such as the Bridge Program, run by the Salvation Army, with drug and alcohol testing, counselling and general counselling seems a suitable vehicle that could achieve much. Custodial History55 This offender has been in custody since his arrest on these matters. That arrest was effected on the date of the offences, 25 October 2005. His parole has been revoked since 10 November 2005. As I have said, the Parole Board are mindful of the progress made by Chillie in the nine or ten months period of incarceration.Overview of the Subjective Circumstances 56 There is nothing in the subjective circumstances that requires any assessment that the offender falls within the midrange of seriousness. 57 There is much in the subjective circumstances pointing towards the time being ripe to attempt to advance Vernon Chillie’s rehabilitation. That rehabilitation, as I say, may be advanced in circumstances where the risk to the community is minimised. That risk can be minimised by the imposing of appropriate conditions on the offender. 58 Any sentence that I set initially must be set without regard to whether the sentence is to be suspended or not. It is clear from the remarks that I have made thus far that I am strongly impressed by the subjective circumstances of the offender and in particular the prospect that his rehabilitation can be achieved in circumstances where hithertofore it has not been achieved. He is still young enough for rehabilitation to be an important factor in sentencing. I do not regard as an aggravating feature of his criminality, his prior record. True it is that record does not necessarily entitle him to leniency, all other things being equal. But in my view in this case they are not, because there has been this significant change so far as rehabilitation is concerned.59 I would also give him a benefit of s 12 and while I hope it does not amount to double counting, it seems to me that the benefit can be one of both recognition of the appropriateness of a s 12 sentence and a recognition that he can be properly dealt with otherwise by a sentence of two years incarceration for both offences.60 The Crown has advanced an argument that in the light of the past history there is a strong case for personal deterrence and there is a case for deterrence generally. He does not present any figures to me as to the difference of impact that a sentence of imprisonment suspended would have against a sentence of imprisonment of full time incarceration on the general community. Nor is it likely that the general community will have general knowledge of this offence, all things being equal. I do accept the argument that personal deterrence is important and it seems to me that the needs of personal deterrence are adequately met with this sentence, because in the event of a breach of his rehabilitation program, he will be back to full time custody. I do not intend to find special circumstances and I am motivated not to find them particularly on the basis of the need for personal deterrence.61 I can indicate now that it is my intention, should the Parole Board grant this gentlemen parole, to impose a term of imprisonment of two years in respect of each matter, taking into account the Form 1 matter. I can indicate that it will be my intention that there will be a non-parole period of twenty months and a balance of term of four months. I do not propose to sentence him today. I do propose to refuse him bail. I propose to adjourn this matter to a date in late October pending the outcome of the Parole hearing. ******

     Judgment 
    1 McCOLL JA: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed by Shadbolt DCJ on 13 May 2005 in the Sydney District Court.2 The applicant pleaded guilty before Shadbolt DCJ at Bathurst District Court to four counts on an indictment dated 8 March 2005 being: 
     
      
      (1) Dangerous driving occasioning death in contravention of s 52A(1)(c) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 – maximum penalty ten years imprisonment. (Count 1) 
       
       
      (2) Dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm (three counts) in contravention of s 52A(3)(c) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 – maximum penalty seven years imprisonment. (Counts 2 - 4) 
      
    3 He also pleaded guilty before Shadbolt DCJ to a count of “make false accusation” in contravention of s 314 of the Crimes Act 1900 – maximum penalty seven years imprisonment set out in a second indictment dated 22 April 2005. 4 Although there were two indictments, the offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty all arose from one incident: a fatal car crash on 22 August 2003 which killed one person and gravely injured three others.5 The applicant challenges the following sentences, which I have extracted from the Particulars of Trial: 
     
      
      First Indictment 
      (1) Count 1 - Imprisonment for four years and four months to commence 22 April 2006 and expire 21 August 2010 with a non-parole period of three years to commence 22 April 2006 and expire 21 April 2009.(2) Counts 2 - 4 - On each, imprisonment for four years to commence 22 April 2006 and expire 21 April 2010 with a non-parole period of three years to commence 22 April 2006 and expire 21 April 2009. 
      
     Second indictment 
     
      
      (3) Imprisonment for a fixed term of twelve months to commence 22 April 2005 and expire 21 April 2006. 
      
    6 The Crown has properly drawn the Court’s attention to the fact that while it appears the sentencing judge intended to impose these sentences, his Honour did not formally pronounce sentence in respect of the s 314 offence. Accordingly the Crown concedes that for this, if for no other reason, the Court will have to intervene to correct that omission. Presumably, although it did not say so, the Crown sought to invoke s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; see Erceg v District Court of New South Wales; Virgin v District Court (NSW) [2003] NSWCA 379; (2003) 143 A Crim R 455 (at [103] - [104]). Mr R Sutherland of Senior Counsel, who appeared for the applicant, did not contest that this was, in the circumstances, a proper course. Indeed, he conceded that “notwithstanding the somewhat ‘opaque’ expression of reasons by the sentencing judge, the effective sentence was, as identified by the Crown in the Particulars of Trial.” 
     
      
      Factual Background 
      
    7 On 22 August 2003 at approximately 4.30pm the applicant was driving his 1998 Holden Commodore east along Duckmaloi Road near Oberon. With him in the car were his de facto wife, Kelly Mobbs, and her cousin, Lucas Mobbs. Lucas Mobbs was in the front seat.8 The applicant was driving behind a vehicle driven by a Mr Freebody. At a straight section in the road the applicant manoeuvred his vehicle across the broken lane separation line running down the middle of the road no doubt intending to overtake Mr Freebody’s vehicle. However, this placed the applicant’s vehicle directly in the path of a vehicle driven by Mr Simon Gray resulting in a head-on collision. Mr Gray’s car careered down a gully. Mr Gray was killed instantly, Mrs Gray, his wife, was seriously injured as, too, were his daughters, Kayla, aged eleven and Rhiannon, aged thirteen.9 The applicant and Lucas Mobbs suffered minor injuries. Kelly Mobbs suffered, among other injuries, a fractured vertebra in her back which required hospitalisation.10 Immediately after the accident Lucas Mobbs assisted the applicant and Kelly Mobbs from the vehicle. Mr Freebody had stopped his vehicle and returned to the scene of the accident. Lucas Mobbs asked him to go to a nearby house to call emergency services, a task he then undertook.11 In the meantime Lucas Mobbs approached Mr Gray’s vehicle and realised he had died and, apparently, that the other occupants of the vehicle were seriously injured. He then returned to the roadway where the applicant and Ms Mobbs were lying and informed the applicant that he would say he was driving the vehicle. The applicant agreed with this proposition. Mr Mobbs also told the applicant that the driver of the other vehicle was deceased. Mr Mobbs then placed his green “P” plate on the rear of the applicant’s car to support his assertion he had been the driver.12 In due course police, ambulances and emergency services arrived. Lighting was set up. A helicopter arrived to airlift the critically injured child, Rhiannon, while the other surviving occupants of both vehicles were conveyed to various hospitals by ambulance.13 The applicant was aware that police and ambulance officers were asking Lucas Mobbs at the scene who had been driving their vehicle. He told ambulance officers at the scene, and later police and hospital staff, that Lucas Mobbs had been driving his car. Samples were taken of Lucas Mobbs’ blood in compliance with, and for the purposes of, s 20 and s 23 of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999. Blood samples were taken from the applicant for hospital pathology services only.14 At 9.10pm on the day of the accident Constable Glenn Rose attended Bathurst Hospital with Constable Brian Cashen and spoke with the applicant. The applicant informed Constable Rose that Lucas Mobbs had been driving saying, “Yeah, he was driving because I drive trucks and I was driving all day and I was tired”. He gave a detailed statement to Constable Rose. It is unnecessary to refer to the detail of that statement. Suffice to say it elaborated upon the lie. 15 The following morning, 23 August 2003, Lucas Mobbs telephoned Bathurst Police Station and left a message for Detective Ian Nightingale that he wished to change his statement. On 25 August 2003 the applicant rang police and informed them that he had been the driver of the vehicle. Earlier on that day the police had requested a drug test be undertaken on Lucas Mobbs’ blood, indicating that at that time the investigation was still focused on him as the driver.16 On 27 August 2003 the applicant and Lucas Mobbs were separately interviewed by way of ERISP and made admissions. On 4 September 2003 the police interviewed Ms Mobbs, who had also given a statement to the police on the evening of the accident in which she had informed them that the driver at the time was Lucas Mobbs.17 In his ERISP the applicant informed the police he had drunk a couple of mouthfuls of beer on 22 August 2003 after returning from work and before driving. He informed police he did not consume any liquor after the collision.18 The applicant was first charged with the counts under s 52A of the Crimes Act and with one count of pervert the course of justice pursuant to s 319 of the Crimes Act and one count of hinder investigation pursuant to s 315 of the Crimes Act. Lucas Mobbs and Kelly Mobbs were also each charged with one count of pervert the course of justice pursuant to s 319, Crimes Act and one count of hinder investigation pursuant to s 315, Crimes Act.19 All three originally pleaded not guilty to all charges. A trial date was set for 7 March 2005. The indictment dated 8 March 2005 prepared for presentment at that trial included a count under s 315 of the Crimes Act against each of the applicant, Lucas and Kelly Mobbs to which they pleaded guilty. The s 319 charge had apparently been abandoned. On the same day the applicant also pleaded guilty to the s 52A charges. On 22 April 2005 he was given leave to withdraw his plea of guilty to the s 315 charge. He was then indicted on the indictment dated 22 April 2005 in respect of the offence under s 314 of the Crimes Act to which he pleaded guilty. The Crown advised the court there would be no further proceedings in relation to the s 315 count against him. 20 Proceedings on sentence against the applicant, Lucas and Kelly Mobbs commenced on 22 April and continued on 13 May 2005 on which day the sentencing judge passed sentence on all three offenders. 21 Lucas Mobbs was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment with an additional term of three months which was reduced, on appeal, to a fixed term of four months: R v Mobbs [2005] NSWCCA 371. Kelly Mobbs was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment with an additional term of three months to be served by way of periodic detention but, on appeal, her sentence was reduced to a term of imprisonment of six months and eleven days to be served by periodic detention: Mobbs v R [2005] NSWCCA 438. 
     
      
      Remarks on sentence 
      
    22 The sentencing judge sentenced the applicant and the two Mobbs at the same time. He delivered one set of remarks on sentence, adapted as appropriate to deal with each offender’s individual circumstances and, of course, their sentences. He summarised the effect of the accident upon the Gray family as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the event Mr Gray was killed instantly and Mrs Gray seriously injured with facial lacerations, fractured sternum, fractured ribs, and ligamentous damage to her right hand which required plastic surgery. She was unable to use her hand for twelve months. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Kayla Gray, aged thirteen at the time of the accident, received crushed vertebrae, ribs, lacerated spleen, a bruised kidney and a fractured right arm. She was in intense pain and on a morphine drip and has found since her discharge from hospital that the door to her promising and burgeoning sporting life has been closed irrevocably upon her.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Rhiannon Gray, aged eleven at the date of the accident, was brain damaged and rendered comatose for six weeks. She was so badly injured that it was not expected that she would live, but she recovered sufficiently to be discharged from hospital after six months. She now suffers hemiparesis and dysarthria, which has caused her to be confined to a wheelchair. Her brain damage is regarded as permanent. She is unable to speak properly and although she can now write to some degree it is at a level years below her chronological age. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Each of the survivors has suffered deep psychological damage as could, under the circumstances, be prognosticated and understood. Mrs Gray has, therefore, been left not only widowed with deep emotional scars but in a position where her suffering is now compounded by her responsibility towards her two seriously injured daughters. These responsibilities are even further compounded by the fact that she has lost the principal wage earner of the family and her own capacity to earn income and is now reliant upon a reluctant insurer.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Further, there are two other daughters from a previous marriage, now in their twenties, who must, in these circumstances, be regarded as direct victims. They have now to live under the shadow of this tragedy. They, too, have been deeply disturbed by what has occurred to their mother and half sisters. The young daughters, for their part, have not only been rendered fatherless, but have had their lives utterly shattered. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The prisoner [the applicant] has, by his criminal action, killed one and ruined the lives of three. Even by this brief recitation of what can be found in the Victim’s Impact Statement it can be seen that what befell this family was utterly catastrophic.” 
        
       
      
    23 After referring to the fact that the applicant had pleaded guilty to the charges, his Honour set out the circumstances which gave rise to the offence, made the observations about the effect of the accident on the occupants of the other vehicle I have recounted, outlined the factual background to the circumstances in which Lucas Mobbs professed to have been driving the vehicle, then said (ROS 4): 
     
      
       
        
        “If the intention of the Mobbs was to shield Richards from investigation, either in regard to his driving record, or his state of sobriety at that time, they were successful. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The police conducted further interviews, recorded in a video in which the two Mobbs resiled from the falsehoods and Richards was charged under s 52A (1) which carries ten years rather than the aggravated offence which carries fourteen.” 
        
       
      
    24 His Honour described the crimes committed by the applicant as being “so serious as to demand imprisonment” and referred to his criminal history (a conviction of common assault and, since 1999, six convictions for speeding, one for not wearing a seatbelt and one for negligent driving) which he described as “not a record which would permit this Court to extend to him any leniency.”25 He referred to evidence the applicant had given which maintained, in substance, a version of the accident which his Honour plainly rejected, then said (ROS 6): 
     
      
       
        
        “Richards gave some mumbled apology for his actions, which lacked both conviction and any display of empathy for the damage which he had inflicted. Even allowing for his inarticulateness it was a platitudinous recitation. I gained the strong impression that the first time tears have been shed over this incident by these three was when I refused bail on the adjournment on the plea in mitigation. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The offence itself, while it displays no prior course of dangerous conduct, is a piece of driving of a very dangerous nature. It was without any need and appears to have been utterly wanton and reckless. All those matters being aggravating factors set out in  
        Whyte’s 
         case**, the extent of the injuries incurred, the number of people put at risk, and the degree of speed, certainly militate against the offender Richards. It is the kind of reckless conduct that places it within the band of those cases where moral culpability is very high.”

    26 His Honour then referred to the mitigating factors upon which the applicant relied, Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 21A(g) (unlikelihood of re-offending), (h) – (good prospects of rehabilitation) and (i) – (showing remorse for the offence by making reparation for any injury, loss or damage or in any other manner), and said he did not accept those matters. He also referred to the applicant’s reliance upon s 21A(k) - (plea of guilty) without comment. He noted the Crown relied on s 21A(g) (injury etc. caused by offence was substantial) and (m) (offence involved multiple victims).27 Next, his Honour referred to the maximum sentence for the s 52A(1) offence of ten years and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “….which in effect is seven and half years with a two and a half year additional term. This must, of course, be reserved for the worst type of driving undertaken, or bad driving by a repeat offender, or following conviction by a jury.  
        A plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity would reduce that sentence to one of seven and a half years with a non-parole period of five years eight and a half months. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        In my view, this is a case which would call for four years imprisonment of a total sentence of five years and four months. That must be served at the conclusion of the one year for the offence under s 314 of the  
        Crimes Act 
        . Making in all a sentence of five years. I find special circumstances resulting from accumulation and I will reduce the sentence of imprisonment to one of four years of a total sentence of five years and four months. To reduce it further would be to ignore  
        Simpson’s 
         case (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [63]**. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        In regard to the dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, each offence carries seven years imprisonment and the offender is sentenced to three years of a total sentence of four years.  
        Because of the nature of the incident, each of these sentences will be concurrent with each other and concurrent with the sentence imposed under s 51A(1) 
         but cumulative upon the sentence imposed for the offence under s 314.” (emphasis added)

      Grounds of appeal 
      
    28 The applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
      (1) The learned sentencing judge erred in not making any reference to the applicant’s plea of guilty, its timing and its influence, if any, on his sentencing decision.  
       
       
      (2) With respect to the offence pursuant to s 314 of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900, the sentencing judge erred in sentencing the applicant upon the basis of findings which would have given rise to the more serious offence of perverting the course of justice. 
      
     
     
      
      (3) The learned sentencing judge erred in not finding that the applicant expressed and evinced contrition.  
      
     
     
      
      (4) In all the circumstances the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
      
     
     
      
      Submissions 
      
    29 The first and second ground sought, in part, to rely upon the success of similar grounds of appeal in Lucas Mobbs’ appeal.30 The applicant’s first complaint is that because the sentencing judge did not refer to s 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act or to the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty, had not expressly quantified a discount for his plea nor determined whether it was entered at the earliest opportunity, error was disclosed: cf R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383.31 The Crown conceded that the sentencing judge did not, as he ought have, refer to the utilitarian value of the plea in his Remarks on Sentence. The Crown contended, however, that the sentencing judge’s remarks during the proceedings on sentence, (13 May 2005, t/s 23.14) that “they have each pleaded guilty, they get the full discount for that”, indicated he had acknowledged each offender, including the applicant, was entitled to a discount of 25 percent.32 The Crown also drew attention to the sentencing judge’s observations, which I have earlier extracted, albeit expressed in general terms, that a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity would reduce the maximum sentence for the s 52A(1) charge from seven and half years with two and a half year additional term to one of seven and a half years with a non-parole period of five years eight and a half months and his observation that this was a case calling for a total sentence of five years and four months with four years imprisonment. It contended that this demonstrated his Honour had allowed a discount of 25 percent on the s 52A offences, albeit that he had taken it off the maximum sentence. It submitted that it should not readily be concluded that a senior experienced judge, as there is no doubt his Honour is, would have overlooked such a significant aspect of the sentencing exercise as the application of a discount for a plea of guilty.33 The Crown submitted, in any event, that the applicant’s plea was late, having been entered only on the day the trial was to commence, and, accordingly, had diminished utilitarian value. 34 Finally, the Crown submitted the sentence of twelve months for the s 314 offence was clearly subject to a 25 percent discount, drawing attention to R v Pearson [2005] NSWCCA 116 in which this Court dismissed an appeal against a head sentence of eighteen months after a discount of 20 percent for an offence under s 315(1)(a) and s 345, Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum sentence was also seven years.35 The applicant submits that the sentencing judge’s reasons disclosed his view that he had lied about the driver’s identity in order to escape liability for the more serious offence of aggravated dangerous driving which carries the prospect of a more severe penalty, imprisonment for fourteen years: s 52A(2), Crimes Act. Accordingly, his second ground of appeal is that this Court ought to conclude that in sentencing him in respect of the s 314 offence, his Honour erred in ascribing the intent applicable to the more serious offence of perverting the course of justice to him, contrary to R v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; (1981) 147 CLR 383. He relies, in part, upon the fact that this conclusion was reached in R v Mobbs (at [23] – [33]), and urges this Court to reach the same conclusion.36 In the event his De Simoni argument fails, the applicant also submits that the s 314 offence to which he pleaded guilty fell in the lower range of such types of offence, bearing in mind that his false accusation was to accuse Lucas Mobbs of the offences of driving dangerously (in substance) in contravention of s 52A in circumstances where Lucas Mobbs had identified himself as the driver. 37 The Crown submitted that there had been no breach of the De Simoni principle. It submitted that this Court should revisit that issue rather than following R v Mobbs. It also sought to distinguish the case from Lucas Mobbs’ appeal by drawing attention to evidence which was not before the Court in that case. 38 Thus, whereas Johnson J accepted in R v Mobbs (at [25]) that there was no evidence the applicant had consumed alcohol prior to the collision, the Crown drew attention to the applicant’s record of interview in which he admitted that on the day of the collision he had drunk a couple of mouthfuls of beer just before he got into the car (ERISP Q 322-325). Secondly, the Crown sought to explain the evidentiary gap to which Johnson J referred in Lucas Mobbs’ appeal (at [25]) by contending blood was taken from the applicant for hospital pathology purposes and after the lie was exposed, a warrant was executed on 5 September 2003 on the hospital to obtain the applicant’s blood but by then it had been destroyed.39 The Crown submits the sentencing judge’s remarks upon which the applicant relies was an expression of his Honour’s assessment of the factual outcome of the actions of the applicant and his co-offenders in diverting the police investigation from the course which would properly have followed had they been informed of the true identity of the driver, namely testing the applicant’s blood in accordance with the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act. It contended it did not follow, however, that the sentencing judge treated that conclusion as evidence of an intention to pervert the course of justice. The Crown argued that the sentencing judge’s observation was expressed in hypothetical terms (“if the intention etc”) not as a factual finding of intention.40 The Crown also submitted the sentencing judge was clearly aware of the difference between the offences of hinder investigation and pervert the course of justice as demonstrated by the following exchange between the sentencing judge and counsel for the applicant in the course of the proceedings on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “HH: What the combination of 315 on behalf of two and 314 on behalf of him was to deprive the police of an opportunity to properly investigate the matter. 
         
         
        Rosser: Yes. 
         
         
        HH: Now you are not saying that? 
         
         
        Rosser: No but I am saying that that’s not – 
         
         
        HH: What they would have found out would be a matter of mere speculation. 
         
         
        Rosser: Certainly. 
         
         
        …. 
         
         
        HH: Well what they did was to deprive them of the chance of finding out. 
         
         
        Rosser: Yes. 
         
         
        HH: Of confirming one way or the other, what his state was.” 
        
       
      
    41 The Crown also relied, in this respect, upon the sentencing judge’s observation (ROS 9.2) that the Mobbs’ “… lies were, in the first instance accepted and … seriously hindered [the police] in their investigation.” 42 Finally, the Crown submitted the sentence imposed on the applicant for the offence pursuant to s 314 was well within the range, and arguably at the lower end of the range, bearing in mind that the maximum penalty was seven years imprisonment. The Crown contends the applicant’s s 314 criminality was more serious than Lucas Mobbs’, as it was he who had most to gain by diverting the police investigation. The Crown submitted that as the driver of the vehicle at fault, in full knowledge that a man had died and his wife and children were critically injured, the applicant chose to engage in deception of both the police and medical personnel. The Crown drew attention to the applicant’s answers in his ERISP that he was aware that “they test for alcohol when you are involved in an accident”, that he knew at the scene that the driver of the other car had died and that he was at fault and could be charged. 43 The third ground of appeal is that the sentencing judge erred in concluding the applicant was not contrite about his conduct. The applicant submits that the sentencing judge formed a particularly adverse view of the credit of the three offenders he was sentencing and that errors in relation to Ms Mobbs, derived from the failure of her counsel to assist his Honour with respect to erroneous matters which were taken into account adverse to her credit, had a flow-on effect in relation to the applicant. 44 The applicant was called to give evidence on 22 April 2005 concerning his feelings and attitude to the victims and survivors of his crime and gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Just before going on with that, you have also read the large volume of material provided by Dr Gwen Latimore in the form of a Victim’s Impact Statement. 
         
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. When you read that material, how did that make you feel? 
         
         
        A. Not real good, fairly sad that I’d hurt them people the way I did, and their – for their – they lost their husband and father. And it doesn’t make me feel real good. 
         
         
        Q. Well, from the day when this accident occurred and you became aware of the death of one and the serious injury to others caused by the accident, what were your feelings and reactions about that? 
         
         
        A. It was hard to believe it had happened. I didn’t think that would ever happen to someone and I would be involved in it. It’s just something you don’t think about. It’s a – I don’t know, it shouldn’t have happened like, but -  
         
         
        Q. You’ve heard Mrs Grey (sic) read her statement for the Court today? 
         
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. How did that make you feel? 
         
         
        A. Terrible really, I just – I can’t imagine how’d she feel. If it was me, I – if it was my family, if – like, if it was the other way round and it was Kelly, I would – I would just - I can’t imagine how they’d feel. I would never want it to happen to me. It’s -  
         
         
        Q. Would you like to tell them today that you’re sorry? 
         
         
        A. I am sorry, very sorry. I didn’t mean for it to happen.” 
        
       
      
    45 The applicant submits that the expressions of remorse and contrition given in this evidence which were not challenged in cross-examination by the Crown were further buttressed by the pre-sentence report relating to him and evidence that Ms Mobbs and he had taken steps to “try and help these people and they had done such things as held garage sales and donated the money through this family’s friends….”.46 In such circumstances, the applicant submitted that the sentencing judge’s findings that he had not demonstrated contrition and remorse were harsh and not fairly open. In particular, notwithstanding the advantage held by an “observational judge”, the applicant submitted that his expression of contrition and remorse was not fairly described as “a platitudinous recitation”.47 The Crown accepted that the applicant’s evidence of contrition had not been challenged in cross examination, but drew attention to the fact it had submitted the sentencing judge would have some concerns about the applicant’s genuineness, his evidence having focused on what was happening to him as opposed to expressing contrition and remorse for what he had done. 48 The final ground of appeal is that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Mr Sutherland accepted that the sentences on the s 52A offences were within the range (Appeal Transcript 7). He submitted, however, that the accumulation of the s 52A sentences on the s 314 sentence warranted the Court’s intervention to reduce the effective non-parole period. (AT 8). He also argued the s 314 sentence should be reduced to be consistent with the reduced sentences each of the Mobbs had received on appeal.49 The Crown submitted that the applicant had not demonstrated that a lesser sentence was warranted and should have been passed (s 6(3), Criminal Appeal Act) but that in view of the errors made by the sentencing judge, all of which favoured the applicant, should the Court re-sentence the applicant the aggregate sentence should be no less than that imposed by his Honour, so that the overall term and non-parole period remained the same: Ian Gobbet v R [2006] NSWCCA 46.50 The Crown submitted the sentencing judge had erred in imposing concurrent terms imposed in respect of counts 2 - 4 on the first indictment. This, it contended, failed to recognize that those counts involved three separate offences which should have been reflected in the sentences: see R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219 (at [38]) per Simpson J (Barr and Latham JJ agreeing); R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 288 (at [21] – [23]); (2005) 44 MVR 328. 51 Accordingly, the Crown contended the applicant’s overall sentence was arguably too lenient, if not manifestly inadequate, because the sentencing judge imposed no discrete punishment for the second, third and fourth offences on the first indictment. The Crown contended his Honour should have partially accumulated the sentences on counts 2 - 4 to impose a period of custody attributable to each offence. The Crown argued that his Honour’s failure to accumulate the sentences for these offences, at least partially, may well be seen as a failure to acknowledge the harm done to Kathy Gray, Kayla Gray and, in particular, Rhiannon Gray which was substantial and an aggravating feature of the offence: R v Whyte. It argued that the injury caused to the victim of an offence under s 52A, Crimes Act, was a major consideration in determining the degree to which retribution and general deterrence were relevant: R v Dutton [2005] NSWCCA 248. 
     
      
      Criminal Appeal Act s 7(1A) 
      
    52 Although the Crown submitted that if the applicant established error on the s 314 sentence, the Court should adjust the sentence to ensure the overall outcome was not changed, the Crown’s written submissions did not address the source, or ambit, of the Court’s power to achieve that outcome. Accordingly, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Court asked the parties for additional submissions as to its powers under s 7(1A), Criminal Appeal Act which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1A) If on an appeal against a sentence under section 5 (1), 5D, 5DA or 5DB, the court quashes or varies the sentence passed at trial on any count or part of an indictment, the court may quash or vary any other sentence passed at the trial:  
         
          
          (a) in relation to any offence charged in any other count or part of the same indictment, or  
          (b) in relation to any offence charged in any count or part of any other indictment, or  
          (c) in relation to any offence dealt with under section 105 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 , or  
          (d) in relation to any back up offence or related offence dealt with under section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 ,  
          
         
        and pass such sentence,  
        whether more or less severe 
        , in substitution for the other sentence as the court thinks proper, and as may be warranted in law, in respect of the offence.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    53 The Crown’s additional submissions argued the Court should adopt the approach taken in R v Amurao [2005] NSWCCA 32 in which Hulme J (with whom Ipp JA and Hislop J agreed) applied s 7(1A) in circumstances where he had concluded that the sentencing judge had failed to apply Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 and had reflected in the sentence imposed for one count, the applicant’s criminality in relation to all, or at least others, of the six counts on which he had stood for sentence. Hulme J then examined all six sentences and adjusted them to reflect his view of the maximum effective sentence which should have been imposed. 54 The Crown also submitted the Court may exercise its powers pursuant to s 7(1A) where error is demonstrated, to adjust the sentences with the effect of maintaining the overall sentence, even if some of the individual sentences are reduced.55 Mr Sutherland drew attention to the fact that in some cases, the application of s 7(1A) had resulted in a reduction in the overall sentence: R v Amurao; R v Smith [2005] NSWCCA 339. In two others, R v Ohar [2004] NSWCCA 83; (2004) 59 NSWLR 596 and R v Bottin [2005] NSWCCA 254, notwithstanding the identification of error which could have warranted s 7(1A) intervention, the Court applied s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act to conclude no less severe sentence would be warranted in law.56 Mr Sutherland submitted, however, that in circumstances where the Crown had not appealed from the adequacy of the sentence, nor had submitted that a sentence of four years four months in respect of count 1 was manifestly inadequate or excessively lenient, it would be unfair, if the applicant successfully challenged his sentence in respect to the s 314 offence, that he not receive the benefit of some reduction in the sentence passed in that respect. He submitted that a reduction was called for particularly where the s 314 criminality was discrete from the manner of driving. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
      
    57 The obligation that a sentencing judge expressly refer to the manner in which a plea of guilty has been taken into account is consonant with the judicial obligation to give reasons for sentence as “a manifestation of the fundamental principle of the common law that justice must not only be done but must manifestly be seen to be done”: R v Thomson per Spigelman CJ (at [42]). His Honour added, in observations which are of particular relevance to this case (at [45]): 
     
      
       
        
        “In some cases, the weight given to a plea becomes of particular significance to the sentencing process. This may be the case, for example, in assessing the issue of parity between co-offenders. An express reference is of particular significance in such a case.” 
        
       
      
    58 Sentencing judges are to quantify the effect of the plea if appropriate by reference, inter alia, to contrition, witness vulnerability and utilitarian value. The sentencing judge is generally to assess the utilitarian value in the range of 10-25 per cent discount on sentence: Thomson (at [160]). A sentencing judge’s failure to refer to how a guilty plea has been taken into account on sentence leads to an inference that the plea was not given weight: Thomson (at [52], [160]). 59 It is not to point, therefore, in my view, for the Crown to point to remarks in the proceedings on sentence indicating the sentencing judge’s acknowledgement of the necessity to give weight to the plea of guilty. Nor does it avail the Crown to point to the indubitable fact that the sentencing judge referred to the plea of guilty in his Remarks on Sentence. His Honour did not make express reference to the utilitarian value of the plea. While he referred to his assessment of the applicant’s contrition, that remark was not made in the context of assessing the effect of the guilty plea. It must, therefore, be inferred that the applicant’s plea was not given weight.60 In R v Mobbs, Johnson J (with whom Simpson and Adams JJ agreed) also concluded the sentencing judge had failed to give Mr Mobbs any discount on account of his plea and held (at [42]) it ought to have attracted a significant quantified discount. His Honour appears to have reached this conclusion partly by application of the parity principle - because he concluded (at [43]) that Kelly Mobbs had been given a discounted sentence by virtue of her plea - and also because (at [44]) Lucas Mobbs’ admissions demonstrated remorse and contrition which ought to have been taken into account, in addition to the utilitarian elements. 61 The Thomson argument was advanced in Kelly Mobbs’ appeal but McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Studdert and James JJ agreed) concluded her appeal could be determined on other grounds: Mobbs v R (at [25] - [28]).62 This case differs from R v Mobbs in that Mr Mobbs pleaded guilty to only one count whereas the applicant pleaded guilty to four counts under s 52A as well as the s 314 count. This is not a case, in my view, in which the applicant’s pleas of guilty ought to have attracted a significant discount. It might be accepted, having regard to the fact the Crown did not proceed with the s 315 count against the applicant, but proceeded against him on the s 314 count, that his plea to that charge might be regarded as having been entered “early”, in a relative sense. However he did not plead guilty to the s 52A offences until, in effect, the morning of the trial. He had admitted the essential elements of all offences in his ERISP. Accordingly, the utilitarian value of his plea was slight and any discount should, in my view, have been at the lower end of the range indicated by Thomson. I would not have allowed more than 10% discount for that factor.63 The applicant’s second ground of appeal also sought to rely upon the Court’s treatment of a like ground of appeal in Lucas Mobbs’ case. I have earlier referred to the passage in the Remarks on Sentence in which the sentencing judge identified the Mobbs’ possible motive in lying about the identity of the driver.  In his appeal Lucas Mobbs argued successfully that these passages infringed De Simoni. In allowing that ground of appeal, Johnson J said: 
     
      
       
        
        23 Reference should be made to s 52A  
        Crimes Act 
         1900. His Honour referred to the aggravated offence under that section which carries 14 years imprisonment. That is a reference to ‘circumstances of aggravation’ under s 52A(7) which, in this case, relates to circumstances where:  
         
         
          
          (a) the driver had the prescribed concentration of alcohol present in his blood at the relevant time: s 52A(7)(a); or 
           
           
          (b) the accused’s ability to drive was very substantially impaired by the fact that the accused was under the influence of a drug (other than intoxicating liquor) or a combination of drugs (whether or not intoxicating liquor was part of that combination): s 52A(7)(d). 
          
         
        24 If the learned sentencing judge had s 52A(7)(a) or (d) in mind, as appears to be the case, then his Honour considered that Richards was liable to prosecution for the aggravated s 52A(7) offence but for the intervention of the Applicant and his cousin.  
        25 I return to the two errors which are said to arise under this ground. The first argument is that there was no evidence which permitted a finding that Richards had consumed alcohol or a drug prior to the collision. The evidence before his Honour did not support such a finding. Indeed, there was direct evidence from Richards that he had not been drinking. For reasons which could not be explained at the hearing in this Court, the blood sample taken from Richards was not analysed, although the police learned on 23 August 2003 that Richards had been the driver.  
        26 Secondly, it is submitted that even if there was evidence that Richards would have been liable for prosecution for the aggravated offence under s 52A, but for the hindrance of the Applicant, this was not a factor which the sentencing judge could take into account in passing sentence for an offence under s 315(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900.  
        27 That offence involves a person doing anything, intending in any way to hinder the investigation of a serious indictable offence committed by another person. The offence is to be contrasted with that under section 319 Crimes Act 1900 of perverting the course of justice. That offence involves a person doing any act or making any admission intending in any way to pervert the course of justice. That offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. The meaning of ‘pervert the course of justice” appears in s.312 Crimes Act 1900 which states:  
         
          
          ‘A reference in this Part to perverting the course of justice is a reference to obstructing, preventing, perverting or defeating the course of justice or the administration of the law.’ 
          
         
        28 Ms Francis referred to  
        R v Selvage 
         (1982) 1 QB 372, where it was held that, for the purposes of the common law offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice, the relevant intention required that the accused must either know that judicial proceedings are on foot, or that they are imminent or might occur. The Applicant submits that the finding made by his Honour was not open on the facts and was not, in any event, permissible on the  
        De Simoni 
         principle.  
        29 The Crown submits that the consequence of the hindrance by this Applicant was that an investigation was actually interfered with for 24 hours and that his Honour did not err in the manner alleged by the Applicant.  
        30 The offence under s 315(1)(a) lies within a statutory scheme in Part 7 of the Crimes Act 1900 which abolished the common law offences of perverting the course of justice or attempting or conspiring to do so (s 341). Accordingly, care must be taken in considering authorities concerning the common law offences such as Selvage or The Queen v Rogerson (1992) 174 CLR 268 where the scope of those offences was considered in the context of interference with a police investigation.  
        31 The offence under s 319 is regarded by the legislature as being more serious than an offence under s.315. As Howie J observed in R v Hamze [2005] NSWSC 136 at paragraph 24, insofar as the maximum penalty for a s 315 offence reflects Parliament’s assessment of the conduct giving rise to the offence, a maximum penalty of seven years is ‘a relatively modest one’. In passing sentence for a s 315 offence, it is necessary to keep in mind the different elements and penalties referable to offences under ss 315 and 319. A sentencing judge must not attribute to an offender conduct which would constitute a more serious offence that that for which he is to be sentenced: De Simoni; R v El-Zeyat [2002] NSWCCA 138 at paragraph 46.  
        32 An offence under s 315(1)(a) involves action by the offender with the intention to hinder the investigation of a serious indictable offence committed by another person. The relevant intention is not that required for the more serious offence under s 319 being an intent to obstruct, prevent, pervert or defeat the course of justice or the administration of the law. A finding that, but for the actions of a s 315 offender, another person would have been prosecuted for a more serious offence appears to me to move beyond the elements of a s 315 offence to a s 319 offence so as to infringe the De Simoni principle.  
        33 I have concluded that it was not open to his Honour on the evidence to find that, but for the intervention of the Applicant, Richards would have been charged with an aggravated offence within s 52A(7) which carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. That is sufficient to result in the first ground being upheld. However, even if such evidence was present, the finding would not be available by application of the De Simoni principle.”  
        
       
      
    64 The Court referred to, but did not determine, the same ground in Kelly Mobbs’ appeal, McClellan CJ at CL again being of the view (at [24]) that her appeal could be determined on other grounds.65 It is not apparent to me that the sentencing judge’s remarks concerning the Mobbs’ intention which attracted favourable consideration in Lucas Mobbs’ appeal tainted his Honour’s consideration of the s 314 offence. His Honour’s remarks about the Mobbs’ intentions which attracted the Court’s attention in Lucas Mobbs appear to have been linked to his later observation (ROS 8 – 9) in which he made it plain he was not sentencing them in relation to the motor vehicle accident but for: 
     
      
       
        
        “Their guilt is…in lying to the police…to protect Richards” 
        
       
      
    To which he added: 
     
      
       
        
        “Silence is a right, but to wilfully place an obstacle in the way of an investigation must be dealt with very severely. The more serious the crime the more serious is the offence under s 315. This was a very serious offence. Their lies were, in the first instance, accepted and the police, in this respect, seriously hindered in their investigation.” 
        
       
      
    66 Even if the applicant was given the benefit of the doubt in this respect having regard, in particular, to the absence elsewhere in the Remarks on Sentence to any consideration of the objective criminality of the s 314 offence, that would not, in my view, attract this Court’s intervention when regard is had to the objective criminality of his offence. It was, as the Crown submits, far greater than that of either of his co-offenders.67 Section 314 of the Crimes Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “314  
        False accusations etc 
          
        A person who makes an accusation intending a person to be the subject of an investigation of an offence, knowing that other person to be innocent of the offence, is liable to imprisonment for 7 years.” 
        
       
      
    68 Section 314 appears in Pt 7 of the Crimes Act which is concerned with Public Justice Offences. Part 7 was inserted in the Crimes Act by the Crimes (Public Justice) Amendment Act 1990 in order to “… rationalise and reform the law concerning offences involving interference with the course of justice”: Second Reading Speech, New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 17 May 1990 at 3691. As the Attorney-General, The Hon John Dowd MLA said, in moving the Bill which became the Act: 
     
      
       
        
        “Offences that damage the administration of justice strike at the very heart of our judicial system. It is fundamentally important that confidence is maintained in our system of justice, and to this end it must be protected from attack. Those who interfere with the course of justice must be subject to severe penalties. Not only do offences concerning the administration of justice affect individuals, but the community as a whole has an interest in ensuring that justice is properly done.” 
        
       
      
    69 The applicant knew almost immediately after the accident that the driver of the other car was dead, that his vehicle was at fault and that the driver of the motor vehicle would be charged as a result of the collision. (ERISP Questions 666–676.) The only explanation he gave for falsely accusing Lucas Mobbs of being the driver was that he had gone along with Lucas Mobbs’ suggestion, in effect because he did not want to be asked questions at the time (ERISP Q 554, 562 are indicative of this response). Although he claimed he wanted to tell the truth (ERISP Q 554) he did not contact the police to change his story until after he had been discharged from hospital (ERISP Q 662–665).70 If the applicant had admitted from the outset that he had been driving the vehicle, his blood would have been sampled and tested for the presence of alcohol or drugs: ss 20, 23 Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act. As I have indicated the material before this Court differs from that before the court in Lucas Mobbs’ appeal to the extent that there is some evidence that the applicant had been drinking prior to the accident and, too, according to the Crown, when the police sought access to the applicant’s blood to test it for the presence of alcohol, the blood samples taken from him had been destroyed – presumably by the hospital. Mr Sutherland did not dispute the latter proposition. It would not be proper to speculate what the outcome would have been had the applicant’s blood sample been tested. It is appropriate, however, in assessing the objective criminality of the s 314 offence to identify a critical respect in which the police investigation was diverted.71 The inference is plainly open that the applicant’s motive in falsely accusing Lucas Mobbs of driving was to ensure he would not be charged with the offences he knew would arise from the motor vehicle accident. He said as much in his record of interview. The proposition that the objective criminality of his offence was reduced because Lucas Mobbs falsely admitted to being the driver need only be stated to be rejected. It could hardly reduce the objective criminality of the applicant’s offence to say that his co-offender was also breaching the law, in this case s 315 of the Crimes Act.72 This case involved a serious interference with the administration of justice. It diverted the police investigation into the cause of a catastrophic motor vehicle accident. In such a case general deterrence must play a particularly important role in determining the appropriate sentence: see R v Taouk (1992) 65 A Crim R 387 at 392. The offence called for a denunciatory sentence to make clear the seriousness with which the courts regard interference with the course of justice.73 Turning to ground 3, I can see no substance in the applicant’s submission that the sentencing judge erred in finding he lacked true contrition. The sentencing judge saw the applicant give evidence. He was in the best position to determine his demeanour when giving evidence going to this issue. I cannot discern any flow-on effect, as the applicant submitted, in the view the sentencing judge formed of Kelly Mobbs to that he formed of the applicant. This ground of appeal should be rejected.74 I turn finally to the applicant’s submission that, in all the circumstances, his sentence was excessive.75 I have already indicated my view of the objective criminality of the s 314 offence. In my view the objective criminality of that offence was greater than that of his co-offenders. He stood to gain most whilst they, particularly Lucas Mobbs, stood to suffer. This is not, therefore, a case which attracts the parity principle in respect of the s 314 offence. Insofar as the s 52A offences are concerned, Mr Sutherland only challenged the fact they were cumulative on the s 314 sentence. In my view that was an appropriate course having regard to the fact the sentences were for discrete offences.76 The applicant has, therefore, identified error in respect of the failure to discount the sentence for his guilty plea and I am prepared to extend him the benefit of the doubt on the De Simoni point77 Do the errors which have been established, or assumed, in the applicant’s favour, call for intervention?78 It was also, as the Crown submits, an error on the sentencing judge’s part to impose concurrent sentences in relation to the three s 52A(3)(c) offences. His Honour’s failure to accumulate those sentences, at least partially, appears to have been a failure to acknowledge the harm done to the individual victims: R v Wilson (at [38]); R v Janceski (at [21–23]). It would also have been appropriate, in my view, to accumulate, at least partially, the sentence on count 1 on the first indictment on the remaining three counts.79 I have had regard to the applicant’s submission that having regard to the cases in which s 7(1A) of the Criminal Appeal Act has been applied, having identified error on the part of the sentencing judge he ought receive some reduction in his overall sentence. However an applicant for leave to appeal against sentence must always be conscious of the possibility that even if error is discerned, the Court may dismiss the appeal because it forms the view that no lesser sentence is warranted in law: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 80 I accept the Crown’s submission that the sentences imposed upon the applicant should not be any less than that imposed by the sentencing judge. I have taken into account, in this respect, that his Honour clearly had regard to the totality principle and also found special circumstances resulting from accumulation and, accordingly, reduced the applicant’s imprisonment to four years.81 In my view, having regard to the total criminality of the applicant and the leniency demonstrated by the sentencing judge’s failure to accumulate the s 52A sentences, the overall sentence was appropriate and no less severe punishment is warranted: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act; cf R v Bottin (at [37]) per Studdert J (with whom Kirby and Howie JJ agreed).82 Having regard to the sentencing judge’s failure to impose the s 314 sentence on the applicant it is necessary to deal with that matter and having regard to other submissions made by the Crown concerning the uncertainty with which the other sentences were pronounced I propose the following orders pursuant to s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in order to formalise the sentences the sentencing judge plainly intended to impose: 
     
      
      (1) Quash the sentences imposed by Judge Shadbolt in respect of counts 1, 2, 3 and 4 on the indictment dated 8 March 2005 and the count on the indictment dated 22 April 2005. 
      (2) In respect of count 1 on the indictment dated 8 March 2005 sentence the applicant to imprisonment for four years and four months to commence 22 April 2006 and expire 21 August 2010 with a non-parole period of three years to commence 22 April 2006 and expire 21 April 2009. 
      (3) In respect of counts 2 - 4 on the indictment dated 8 March 2005 sentence the applicant to imprisonment on each for four years to commence 22 April 2006 and expire 21 April 2010 with a non-parole period of three years to commence 22 April 2006 and expire 21 April 2009. 
      
      
      (4) In respect of the count on the indictment dated 22 April 2005, sentence the applicant to twelve months imprisonment to commence on 22 April 2005 and expire on 21 April 2006. 
      (5) Grant leave to appeal. 
      
     (6) Dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
      Obligations of the Crown 
      
    83 It should be noted that at the end of his remarks on sentence before he formally imposed the sentences on the three offenders, the sentencing judge asked the Crown Prosecutor whether there were any matters to which he ought to refer. The Crown Prosecutor then asked his Honour to particularise the dates from which the sentences dated. The Crown Prosecutor did not, however, draw his Honour’s attention to the fact that he had made no reference to how, if at all, he had taken the applicant’s plea of guilty into account. Nor, did the Crown Prosecutor refer to the proposition that the sentences in respect of counts 2 - 4 on the first indictment should reflect the fact three separate offences had been committed, a matter which should be reflected in the sentences by, at least, partial accumulation.84 A Crown Prosecutor is obliged to inform the court of any relevant authority bearing on the appropriate sentence and should assist the court to avoid appealable error on the issue of sentence: r 71(b) and (c), New South Wales Barristers’ Rules; Erceg v District Court of New South Wales; Virgin v District Court (NSW) (at [176]). Any error should be corrected by the Crown so that the sentencing judge can consider the consequence upon the sentence he or she has determined to impose before it is imposed: R v Shankley [2003] NSWCCA 253 (at [20]) per Howie J (with whom Greg James J and Smart AJ agreed). 85 The obligation to deal expressly with the effect of a plea of guilty has been entrenched in this State since, at least, R v Thomson. It is regrettable that sentencing judges appear to overlook it. It is even more regrettable that Crown Prosecutors charged with the responsibility of giving the court all assistance in the sentencing process overlook such an obvious omission.86 ADAMS J: I agree with the orders proposed by McColl JA and with her Honour’s reasons for dismissing the appeal so far as the offences under s 52A(1)(c) and s 52A(3)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900 are concerned. Although I agree that there should be no variation in the sentence imposed for the offence under s 314, I wish to make some comments of my own concerning the outcome of the appeal in respect of that offence.87 Section 314 provides that a person who knows that another is innocent of the offence and makes an accusation intending that person to be the subject of an investigation, commits an offence carrying a maximum of seven years imprisonment. In this case the applicant pleaded guilty to this offence, having in substance admitted it when he was first interviewed by the police after the false accusation was brought to their attention. 88 In assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, the extent to which the investigation was deflected is material. In the circumstances here, the identified problem concerned the failure to investigate at an early stage whether the applicant had been affected by alcohol when he was driving. In his interview with the police the applicant said that he had consumed a “couple of mouthfuls of beer” about 20 minutes before he got into the car. He said that, when he came home from work, “there was no drink or nothin’ in the fridge and Kelly (his partner) had a beer open [and] I just grabbed it and had a couple of mouthfuls before I went and got changed…”. He added, “It was hardly, like, it wouldn’t have been half a glass, it would have been just a little mouthful”. The applicant was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q594 OK, when you were on the ground prior to being taken to hospital, were you aware that you’d most likely have a blood alcohol sample or a blood sample taken for testing for blood, being the driver. A. I didn’t even think about it, no. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q595 OK, did anyone else mention that? A. No. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q640 [Having said that he knew there was beer in the car], do you know where the beer was kept? A No. It didn’t worry me ‘cause I wasn’t drinking it, so I didn’t ask.” 
        
       
      
    89 The applicant informed the police when he was interviewed that a sample of his blood had been taken at the hospital on his initial admission after the accident, at a time when he knew that it could have been tested for alcohol. In my view, it should be inferred that the police could have obtained that sample for the purpose of testing. It appears that they did not do so until after the sample had been destroyed. Although it is true that, had the applicant immediately informed the police that he was the driver, a blood sample would have been taken and, in that sense, his assertion that he was the passenger was a contributing cause of the resulting lack of testing, the fact that he corrected the misinformation at a time when the sample already taken by the hospital could have been obtained for testing significantly reduces the objective seriousness of the offence.90 In his interview the applicant explained how he came to make the false accusation. He said:  
     
      
       
        
        “…[When] it did happen, Luke Mobbs told everyone he was driving like. Just, he’d got out of the car and – but I was driving and I got out of the car and ‘cause I was hurt and that, he just told everyone that sorta come out that he was driving it. He didn’t want…he said he didn’t…just wanted to leave me alone ‘cause I was on the ground. And he didn’t realize the seriousness…of it…And then, when the police in Bathurst come and seen me that night in hospital, I knew Luke had been tellin’ everyone he was driving… 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q464 Ok, what was the purpose of him saying he was driving? A I don’t know, I’m not sure. I said, ‘Don’t….just tell them the truth….No, just tell them I was driving….I dunno, he just, ‘cause we were both….and he just….I’m not real sure why he….It just seemed the easiest thing to do at the time. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q473 Can you recall much of what happened after the accident? When the accident happened and the car stopped on the road, can you describe what happened after that point step by step?---A Luke got out of the car first and went round to Kelly. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q474 Where was Kelly?---A In the seat behind me, the driver’s, behind the driver’s seat. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q475 Behind you?---A Yeah. And I just had to struggle to get out because my foot was caught and….when I got out, I got out by his door and by that time -- 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q476 So you went out whose door?---A Out Luke’s door, out the passenger door. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q477 Do you’ve climbed out over the console…onto the near side of the car to get out, yes?---A Yeah. And when I got out Kelly was layin’ back behind the car on the road….side of the road. I tried to sort of walk on my foot and it was hurtin’ too much, so I just went and laid down next to Kelly to make sure she was all right. And then I couldn’t get up then ‘cause it was too sore and Luke was, Luke was talkin’ to the other bloke in the car, the bloke in the car we were trying to pass. He was saying something to him about phone….one was askin’….had a phone or something to ring up the police or whatever. And….after that I think the bloke drove off. I’m not sure where he went. And Luke was just down in the, at the other car just takin’ his shirt and all that off and wrappin’….hands or whatever….cut hands or somethin’. He was with them tryin’ to help them. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q478 Did, did Luke say anything when he came back up from the car, the one that…went over the embankment?---A He said….he said, ‘Don’t worry”. I, I was sorta stressin’ out about what happened. He said, ‘Don’t worry…. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q479 What’s his reasoning behind that?---A I dunno, just to leave me behind I s’pose. I dunno…Probably so that, I dunno….I’m not real sure actually. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q481 So you ---?---A I said, ‘No, just tell them I was….’ He said, ‘No, we’ll just tell them I was….’ I think it was just so people would leave me alone….” 
        
       
      
    91 The applicant was then asked about the circumstances of the accident and the questioning moved on to when he had first spoken to Kelly after the accident. This occurred at the hospital on the night after the accident at about 9 pm. 
     
      
       
        
        “Q509 Did you talk to her about the collision between [sic] that time?---A Yeah, I just, I said, I said to her, I said, ‘Did you know Luke was sayin’ I was drivin’? She said, ‘Yeah’…[511] And I just said, ‘Well…he tellin’ the truth or….I dunno what he’s tryin’ but he’s just tryin’ to….I dunno, a mate I s’pose and help me out but its no good him takin’ the rap for somethin’ he didn’t do….just tell them the truth’. So that’s what….she knew he said it, like she knew that he was sayin’ it and she wanted me to tell the truth and I wanted to tell the truth anyway, so.” 
        
       
      
    92 The interviewer then took the applicant to the statement he made to police at the hospital at about 9 pm on the evening of the accident. The applicant read it and agreed that it was his, including the statement nominating Lucas Mobbs as the driver. 
     
      
       
        
        “Q561/2 As you said, your intention in doing that was what?---A ….I just, I wanted to see what Luke had been sayin’, like telling everyone he was drivin’….I don’t know, actually, know why I went along, just why I said that. I can’t even really remember making the statement, you know. I was on morphine….” 
        
       
      
    93 It appears to be undisputed that the applicant had sustained a number of comparatively minor injuries in the accident, including torn ligaments in his right foot, soreness to his right hip, grazing across his stomach from the seat belt and a slightly bruised shoulder. That he was in some pain, perhaps considerable pain, from the injured foot can be accepted, especially since he was given morphine at the hospital. 94 It is not disputed that the applicant and Lucas Mobbs agreed on the morning after the accident that the police must be informed of the fact that the applicant was the driver. Lucas Mobbs called the police station to talk to the relevant officer, Detective Nightingale, to arrange to bring the applicant down to see him but he was not there. Lucas spoke to a person he identified as Jo and left a message identifying himself, saying that he was the person in the car accident and that he and the applicant “needed to see him about some change in the statements that were made on Friday night”. He left his mobile number. I think that it should be accepted that, had Detective Nightingale been able to take the call, the identification of the applicant as the driver would have been immediately made. Detective Nightingale was made aware of this call shortly afterwards. He said that he spoke by telephone to the appellant at about 1pm on Monday, 25 August 2003 and that the appellant told him that he was the driver, not Lucas Mobbs and gave a brief description of the accident. The applicant attended at the Oberon Police Station on 26 August 2003, for a detailed interview. In the end, the evidence demonstrates that the applicant intended to inform the police that he was the driver on the morning after the accident. This did not occur because Lucas Mobbs did not speak to Detective Nightingale. Police were given the new information at about 1pm on 25 August 2003. 95 The extent to which the investigation was deflected is, of course, relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence. It was for the prosecution to establish the objective circumstances that enabled this assessment to be made and thus, in the present context, the extent to which the investigation was deflected and how that occurred. The only significant result of the misinformation was that, by the time police were aware of the driver’s identity, it was too late to take a blood test of any value in determining whether the applicant had been affected by alcohol at the time of the accident and, if so, to what extent. Even had the lie been corrected on the Saturday morning, as intended by the applicant and Lucas Mobbs, it would have been too late to take a blood sample. Police sought the sample on 5 September but by that time it had apparently been destroyed. There is no evidence as to when it was destroyed but it cannot be inferred that it was too late to obtain the hospital sample on 25 or 26 August. It seems to me likely that the sample was then still in existence and it is difficult to understand why police did not immediately ask the hospital to preserve it. The correction of the lie, at least, appears to have provided the police with an opportunity to “turn back the clock”. I would not be prepared to infer, adversely to the applicant, that there was no such opportunity. This is a significant factor in the fair evaluation of the objective gravity of the offence. Of course, the fact the applicant lied was a substantial cause of the failure to obtain his blood sample and the assessment of the gravity of the offence must give appropriate weight to this consideration but, at the same time, due weight should be given to his attempt to correct the lie.96 It must be accepted that, but for the misidentification of the appellant as a passenger, a breath test and, if it were positive, a subsequent blood test would have been conducted. This did not happen because of Lucas Mobbs’ lie, of which the appellant was aware. The appellant had also lied to an ambulance officer on his way to hospital. However, it seems virtually certain that this was not brought to the attention of investigating police until much later in the investigation.97 The chronological account of events cannot be allowed to disguise the fundamental question, which must focus on the acts of the appellant in committing the offence charged and, in particular, the time when it was committed. The indictment specifies 22 August 2003 as the date of the relevant accusation. The crucial time for assessing the objective seriousness of the s314 offence is as at the time when the offence occurred, namely, when the appellant made his dishonest statement to the police at the hospital at about 9 pm on 22 August. It is this statement that is identified by the Crown prosecutor as the relevant accusation. It was put to the learned sentencing judge that this statement “prevented” the police from taking a blood sample from the appellant. The statement certainly led the police not to have a sample taken but it is clear from s20 of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 that it could not have prevented the taking of a sample. As it happened, however, a blood sample had indeed been taken by the hospital, presumably under that provision, it being evident that the applicant’s injuries were relatively minor. The police did not become aware of it, however, until the interview with the appellant on 26 August, when it was brought to the attention of police by the appellant. It seems to me to follow, therefore, that the objective fact that the police did not breath-test the appellant at the scene cannot make his offence more serious. That deflection of the investigation cannot be laid at his door.98 The circumstances of the offence committed by the applicant were, unfortunately, not referred to by the learned sentencing judge. Nor were the circumstances of his disclosure. To my mind this matter is of considerable, indeed crucial, significance in assessing the objective culpability of the applicant. It was given at a time when he was aware that the hospital had taken a sample of his blood. In the result, the false accusation was alive for something less than three days and was brought to an end voluntarily by the applicant at a time when it might have been possible to have remedied the deflection. Nor is it disputed that the applicant had not instigated the offence: he went along with the foolish gesture of Lucas. The evidence does not permit the conclusion that his failure at the scene to dissent from Lucas’ assertion was motivated by a fear of being breathalysed or that this was the motive for his subsequent statement at the hospital that Lucas was the driver, although I accept that there are grounds for suspecting that this might have been the case. Had the applicant told the truth at the hospital, a blood sample might have been taken at police direction but in fact a blood sample had been taken at all events. I think that it was most unlikely, in these circumstances, that the applicant lied in order to avoid having his blood tested for alcohol.99 The applicant’s ultimate account of the course of events to police was, essentially, supported by those of Kelly and Lucas Mobbs. Nor was the applicant cross-examined at the sentencing hearing to suggest that what he told the police was untrue.100 In my respectful view, the sentence of twelve months imprisonment for a false accusation that lasted less than three days and was voluntarily corrected could only be justified in the circumstances here, if at all, by a conclusion that the purpose was to pervert the course of justice. I have concluded, with respect, that it was this characterisation of the intention of the applicant that led the learned sentencing judge to impose the sentence. This is a significant error of law.101 I have also formed the view that the sentence was manifestly excessive. The objective seriousness of the offence did not justify a sentence of twelve months imprisonment, let alone a sentence of which twelve months was the non-parole period. The applicant had pleaded to an offence under s 315. Since this offence required that the hindering relate to offences committed by another person, this charge was plainly inappropriate, though perhaps by artificial reasoning it might have been thought that the principal offender was Lucas and the applicant was his accomplice. The Crown prosecutor conceded to the learned sentencing judge that the charge was a mistake and the applicant was permitted to withdraw his earlier plea and plead guilty to the correct offence. Having regard to the applicant’s admissions, I am of the view that this plea was indeed made at the earliest practicable opportunity and thus that the maximum utilitarian discount should have been extended to him in respect of this offence. 102 The Crown prosecutor submitted in this Court that, since the sentences for the s 52A offences should have been accumulated to some degree to reflect their overall objective gravity, even if the sentence for the s 314 offence was excessive, this Court should not interfere, citing s 7(1A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and, inter alia, R v Bottin [2005] NSWCCA 254. Section 7(1A) is in the following terms –  
     
      
       
        
        “(1A) If on an appeal against a sentence under section 5 (1), 5D, 5DA or 5DB, the court quashes or varies the sentence passed at trial on any count or part of an indictment, the court may quash or vary any other sentence passed at the trial: 
         
          
          (a) in relation to any offence charged in any other count or part of the same indictment, or 
          (b) in relation to any offence charged in any count or part of any other indictment, or 
          (c) in relation to any offence dealt with under section 105 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, or 
          (d) in relation to any back up offence or related offence dealt with under section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, 
          
         
        and pass such sentence, whether more or less severe, in substitution for the other sentence as the court thinks proper, and as may be warranted in law, in respect of the offence.” 
         
        
       
      
    103 I notice that, in Bottin, the sentence in respect of which error had been identified was, although high, held not to be outside the available discretionary range. Studdert J, with whom Kirby and Howie JJ agreed said:  
     
      
       
        
        “[37] Section 6(3) of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act  
        is to be read, where appropriate, in conjunction with s 7(1A) of that Act. There is a need to consider the total criminality of the applicant, and when this is done, it seems to me that the overall effect of the sentences passed, namely a non parole period of seven years and an available parole period of four years, affords appropriate punishment for the offences committed. In my opinion, punishment no less than that was warranted, and I would therefore not be disposed to interfere with the sentences as structured: see  
        R v Carr 
         [2002] 135 A Crim R 171 at para 35 and  
        R v Shankley 
         [2003] NSWCCA 253 at para 20.” 
        
       
      
    104 I do not think that this case is authority for the proposition that s 7(1A) can be used to refuse reduction of an excessively heavy sentence merely because it is one of a number of sentences passed at the same time and the overall sentence is, despite the excessively heavy sentence, within range or, in the absence of a Crown appeal in respect of one or more of the other sentences, excessively lenient. The reference by Studdert J to totality and the structure of the sentences makes it clear that his honour did not have in mind so general an application of the provision. 105 The, or at least one, purpose of the Victorian equivalent to s 7(1A) was discussed in R H McL v R [2000] HCA 46; (2000) 203 CLR 452. At [2000] HCA [32], Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Callinan JJ cited with approval the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Ryan v the Queen (1982) 149 CLR 1 at 22-23: 
     
      
       
        
        ""When an accused person is convicted on two or more counts regularly joined, the trial judge is entitled to assess an appropriate overall sentence having regard to the entire course of criminal conduct which constitutes the several elements of the offences of which the accused is convicted. If the offences are founded on the same facts, it is necessary to ensure that the appropriate penalty for the same act or omission is not imposed twice; if the offences are part of a series, the entirety of the criminal conduct of the same or similar character, rather than the several acts or omissions constituting the separate offences, may determine the appropriate overall sentence to be imposed. In pronouncing sentence, however, the trial judge imposes separate sentences in respect of the several offences of which the accused has been convicted, effecting the appropriate overall sentence by adjusting the severity of the separate sentences and, when custodial sentences are imposed, by ordering that they be served either concurrently or cumulatively.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        On appeal against conviction, if the conviction upon one or more counts is quashed but the conviction upon another count or other counts stands, the sentences in respect of the quashed convictions must be set aside while the sentences in respect of the other convictions stand. The overall sentence may thus be altered, and the alteration may prove to be anomalous.  
        Section 569 
        (1) of the  
        Crimes Act 1958 
          
        allows the correction of such an anomaly. It empowers the Full Court to alter the sentence when a conviction on one count in an indictment is quashed and a conviction on another count stands."" 
        
       
      
    106 Although s 569(1) of the Victorian Act is directed to the same matter as that dealt with in s 7(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, and thus this passage does not deal with an equivalent of s 7(1A), it seems to me that the legislative purpose of the latter provision is fundamentally the same as that with which the former sub-section is concerned. It is, I think, directed to the situation that arises where the other sentences were adjusted at first instance either in length or extent of accumulation because of totality and that calculus is significantly changed because one or more of the sentences under appeal is taken out of account by the quashing of the underlying conviction or the making of significant variation. 107 In the present case, the learned sentencing judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view this [offence under s 52A(1)(c)] is a case which would call for four years imprisonment of a total sentence of five years and four months. That must be served at the conclusion of the one year for the offence under s 314 of the Crimes Act. Making in all a sentence of five years, I find special circumstances resulting from the accumulation and I will reduce the sentence of imprisonment to one of four years of a total sentence of five years and four months… 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        In regard to the dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, each offence carries seven years imprisonment and the offender is sentenced to three years of a total sentence of four years. Because of the nature of the incident, each of these sentences will be concurrent with each other and concurrent with the sentence imposed under s 52A(1) but cumulative upon the sentence imposed for the offence under s 314.” 
        
       
      
    108 It will be seen that the sentence for the offence under s 52A(1)(c) was reduced because it was accumulated on the sentence imposed for the s 314 offence. The extent of the adjustment would obviously have been less if the sentence for the s 314 offence had been significantly lower. However, the other sentences were made concurrent because they arose out of the same criminality as that which led to the offence under s 52A(1)(c). They were not adjusted, either as to length or starting point by reference to the sentence passed on the s 314 offence. Even accepting that the orders making the s 52A sentences concurrent was an application of the principle of totality, it was unconnected with and independent of the sentence for the s 314 offence. I do not think that, absent a Crown appeal against the leniency of the s 52A(3)(c) sentences, the mere fact that the sentence for the s 314 offence is reduced should lead to the reconsideration of those sentences, whose incidents or elements were not adjusted because of the s 314 sentence. Amongst other things, the very substantial delay in the sought upward variation would militate strongly, perhaps decisively, against the Court exercising its discretion in favour of the Crown. I am troubled by the notion that, if it is inappropriate to vary the other sentences, their apparent leniency can nevertheless be used to refuse to reduce a sentence found to be manifestly excessive, even though that leniency does not result from downward adjustment because of the application of the principle of totality to the scheme of sentences including the impugned sentence. 109 In my view the variation contemplated by s 7(1A) is one that is necessary because the sentences not subject to appeal were calculated by taking into account the sentence that is removed or reduced, so that one or more of them become inappropriately lenient by removal or reduction of that sentence and adjustment is necessary to restore the appropriate balance. (Indeed, I note that in the present case, the Crown does not seek to vary the concurrency of the sentences passed under s 52A.) It seems to me that s 7(1A) does or ought not to provide a mode of back-door or derivative Crown appeal but is ancillary to the exercise of the Court’s powers under the specified sections in relation to the sentence which is the subject of the appeal. That being so, I do not think that it is appropriate to take into account the posited leniency of sentences that happen to be passed at the same time as the appealed-from sentence but which were not adjusted by virtue of that sentence. Where there is no Crown appeal against the other sentences and they were passed independently of the impugned sentence, I cannot see that s 7(1a) is material to the disposition of the appeal concerning the impugned sentence. To take those sentences into account is, to my mind, contrary to the fundamental principle stated in Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 623, per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ: 
     
      
       
        
        “To an offender, the only relevant question may be ""how long"", and that may suggest that a sentencing judge or appellate court should have regard only to the total effective sentence that is to be or has been imposed on the offender. Such an approach is likely to mask error. A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality…” 
        
       
      
    I venture to suggest that, in the circumstances of the present case, it would be as much an error for this Court to ask “how long” by reference to the s 52A(3)(c) offences when considering the appropriate disposition of the s 314 sentence, which was independently imposed.110 It is evident from the passage I have quoted above from the reasons for sentence of the learned sentencing judge that the sentence on the s 52A(1)(c) offence was reduced by a year because of the sentence on the s 314 offence. Any reduction in the latter sentence raises the question whether an upward adjustment would need to be made in the former sentence. Although this Court, if exercising its discretion under s 7(1A), must come to its own view about the appropriate adjustment that should be made, if any, and is therefore not required to adopt the calculation (if it is evident) of the court at first instance, the sentence that his Honour would have imposed but for totality could not be said to be excessive. 111 It is sufficient, I think, to say that, in my opinion, any reduction in the severity of the s 314 offence would require there to be an upward adjustment in the sentence for the s 52A(1)(c) offence. After such adjustments, there should not be, in the circumstances of this case, a lesser overall sentence. It follows that s 6(3) requires the appeal to be dismissed. 112 LATHAM J: I agree with McColl JA.

    SENTENCENON-PUBLICATION ORDER ON NAMES OF ALL PARTIES1 HIS HONOUR: Children who are less than ten years of age are entitled to expect their father will protect them, nurture them, comfort them and help them. The offender was the father of an eight year old girl and far from protecting her, nurturing her, comforting her and helping her, he had penile sexual intercourse with her on two occasions, penetrated her vaginal area with a finger on one occasion and over twelve months engaged in acts of this type on about twenty or thirty occasions.2 There is no specific evidence of any physical or mental harm being caused to this girl, but there is evidence that she was showing behavioural problems to her mother that caused her mother to investigate. When her mother investigated the facts about the episodes of sexual abuse became known.3 Sentencing this offender presents a number of problems. He is a man of good character who has always worked and has always supported his children financially. Apart from his sexual abuse of his daughter he treated her well and treated her brother well. A number of people have spoken positively on him on the basis they believe him to be an innocent man. He appears to have a close relationship with his mother and with other members of his family.4 He maintains his innocence and thus I must regard him as showing no contrition and no remorse. Notwithstanding the report of Dr Lennings I am unable to form any view that he is likely to rehabilitate himself. This is because he continues to maintain his innocence. He has given no evidence before me at any time and I simply lack any evidentiary basis for coming to the conclusion that he is likely to rehabilitate himself.5 Dr Lennings has expressed the opinion there was a low likelihood of a risk of re-offending. His opinion is based on his application of a test known as Static 99. I have no confidence in the accuracy of this test and I am unable to accept that Dr Lennings expertise as a psychologist enables him properly to express an expert opinion about re-offending.6 In my opinion it is not possible to determine whether the offender is likely to offend again. Certainly it is unlikely he would ever be able to offend against his daughter, she lives in another state and she will be an adult before he is released from gaol. There is no evidence to suggest he has any general interest in abusing young girls or that he has ever previously done so.7 I have come to the conclusion that the two acts of penile penetration must be regarded objectively as being at least of a mid range of seriousness. The offence of digital penetration, whilst serious, is properly to be regarded as being one that falls below the mid range of seriousness. These findings in my opinion require me to impose sentences of considerable severity.8 The only mitigating factor which I could find proved was that apart from these offences the offender should be regarded as a person of good character. He gave no evidence at the trial and gave no evidence at the sentencing proceedings. He was entitled of course to decline to give any evidence but his electing to take this course has meant that I know nothing about his motivation in committing these offences and I can form no opinion about rehabilitation.9 I must sentence the offender in my opinion on the basis that he committed three serious sex offences against his eight year old daughter and that he has no contrition for what he has done. Furthermore these crimes were committed during a period in which he did similar things to his daughter on about twenty or thirty occasions.FACTS10 The offender and TLS the mother of the child K had a relationship of a sexual type during her teenage years and K was born but at the time of the birth the offender and TLS were no longer in a relationship. When K was about one year old TLS contacted the offender and told him that he was the father of a girl. Commendably he accepted responsibility for this and resumed the relationship with TLS. As a result of the resumption of this relationship TLS had another child, a little boy C. The four of them lived as a family until K was five years old and C was two years old. The parties then split up again and the offender went back to live in Narrabri. From this time until 5 October 2004 both parents shared the custody of the children. This meant that the children would go to live with the offender at his place of residence in Narrabri on occasions and with their mother in Shellharbour on other occasions. In 2003 the little boy C went to live with his father on a more or less full time basis.11 In February 2004 the father of the offender died in Narrabri and TLS took the two children to Narrabri to be with their father at the funeral. She left them in Narrabri for a few days and it was during this time that the first offence was committed by the offender. On the day of the funeral the offender and members of his family went to the funeral and to the wake. It would appear that the offender and others in his family were drinking heavily. That night the offender and the two children stayed at the house of one of the offender’s brothers.12 I am satisfied that the evidence establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the two children went to bed in a double bed and they were joined there quite late at night by their father, the offender. He slept between the two children. K was asleep but she felt her father pulling her pants down the side of her legs. He then placed his penis between her legs from the back into her vulva opening. She felt it go up and down, felt his pubic hair and noticed that she was “yucky” and “wet inside” the vulval opening. She then got up from the bed, went to the kitchen, had a drink and then went to sleep in another bed. Her father said nothing to her about this nor did she say anything to him. After a few days the two children went back to their mother and stayed with her until May of that year. TLS drove the two children back to Narrabri in May and they remained with their father until later in the year.13 The second offence of which the offender was convicted occurred in late August 2004. The child K was able to say that this offence occurred just before a named teacher commenced at her school in Narrabri. It was agreed by the accused that the named teacher came to the school on 30 August 2004.14 During May to August the children and their father lived with his mother in a house some distance from Narrabri. One night when K was in bed and the offender was there too he stuck his hands down her pants and pushed his fingernail into her vaginal opening. This caused her pain.15 The third offence of which he was convicted again occurred when she was in bed with him. This was probably in September of the same year. On this occasion he pulled her on top of him so they were facing each other and he moved her up and down on his penis a number of times. He did not ejaculate, she fell off on the ground and hit her head. She said in evidence that similar sexual episodes occurred on twenty or thirty occasions and that she made notes in a diary by marking the days when these events occurred. Despite a search by police the diary was not found. However in my opinion the complainant K was a truthful, reliable and impressive witness. She was intelligent and definite in her evidence. It is obvious the jury have the same opinion.16 It follows that I must sentence the offender on the basis that he penetrated the body of his eight year old daughter with his penis on two occasions and forced his finger into her vagina on one occasion, that he committed these acts during a period in which he did similar things to her on twenty or thirty occasions. The acts of penile penetration are worse in my opinion than the act of digital penetration and must receive more severe sentences. The first act since it was one where he ejaculated in her in my opinion is worse than the other act of penile penetration.17 The offender was interviewed by police on 6 October 2004 and denied committing any sexual acts against his daughter. The jury considered those denials but rejected them. I am certain the jury was correct in coming to that conclusion.18 These events came to light on 5 October 2004 when the little girl K was at the home of a friend of her mother and was showing unusual behavioural signs. When her mother enquired further K told her what had been going on. Police were contacted and she made a video interview with police on 6 October 2004. At the trial she was asked why she did not speak of these events before 6 October 2004 and she said that she was scared.19 Having seen her give evidence and having considered all the other evidence and in particular the evidence of TLS I am sure that K was fond of her father, enjoyed being with him but was disturbed by his abuse of her which was something she could not understand. Because of the nature of the offences the offender has not seen her or spoken to her since 5 October 2004 and he will probably never see her again. Certainly there is little chance of that occurring during the remainder of her childhood since the sentences which I impose will mean that she is well and truly an adult before his release from custody.FACTS CONCERNING THE OFFENDER20 The offender was born on 4 July 1974. The only blemishes on his good character come from two drink driving convictions. For the purpose of this sentencing exercise I propose to treat him as a man of prior good character. He grew up in the Narrabri area after attending school in that area and as I would understand it he has been normally an employed person following occupations that are at best semi-skilled. In his earlier life he acted responsibly in agreeing to care for his daughter.21 It seems obvious to me that his relationship with his daughter, apart from his sexual activities, was a good one. As I have said before he has given no evidence and what I can glean about him comes from what he told Dr Lennings and what a number of character witnesses have said about him. A number of people came to court and spoke very well of him. Normally I would give a great deal of weight to that, however each of them gave this evidence of his good character on the basis that each of them believed him to be an innocent man. Necessarily I can give less weight to that evidence than I would give if they knew and accepted he was a guilty man. But I accept that he was apparently a good worker and has good relationships with members of his family and other people who know him. Dr Lennings is of the opinion there is little risk of his offending again.22 As I have said before I am not prepared to come to the same conclusion because he has given no evidence and the test which Dr Lennings applied obviously involved the assessment of a number of subjective factors. I do not have the same confidence in his as is expressed by Dr Lennings. In his report Dr Lennings asserts that: 
     
      
      “It is probably the case that Mr A’s situation is a product of a heightened opportunity to offend and in the man such opportunity can be addressed by appropriate supervision strategies.” 
      
    23 I am unable to accept that this is a valid assessment of the situation at all. The offender chose the bed in which his children slept and he chose deliberately to sleep in that bed and to sexually abuse his daughter. A normally protective parent would not have engaged in conduct of this type.ASSESSMENT OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE CRIMES24 Each of the offences has a standard non-parole period of fifteen years with a maximum sentence of twenty five years. This is a very high non-parole period compared to the maximum sentence, but Parliament fixed this period and I must accept that Parliament has concluded that this offence is so reprehensible that an offence in the middle range of seriousness warrants a fifteen year minimum gaol term.25 If I determine that any of these offences are in the middle range of seriousness then s 54B of the Crime Sentencing Procedure Act 1999 obliges me to set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence, unless I determine that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period and the only reasons to which I can have regard in doing this are set out in s 21A of the same Act.26 Of the matters mentioned in s 21A I am of the opinion there are some aggravating factors, namely the offender has abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim and that the victim was vulnerable because she was very young. The only mitigating factor which I can take into account is that he was a person of good character. Because of a lack of evidence I am unable to make any conclusions about his prospects of rehabilitation. He has shown no remorse for the offences.27 I also take into account the fact that these three offences were committed during a period in which he committed against the victim twenty or thirty other similar offences. These offences cannot be regarded as isolated offences. I have come to the conclusion that the two offences of penile penetration, having regard to the aggravating factors and the context of there having been committed against the victim, along with twenty or thirty other similar offences, means that each of them is at least a middle range offence. 28 Whilst I consider, for reasons which I have already given, that the first such offence was worse than the other, I am unable to conclude that this means that the offence is greater than a middle range offence. These offences are middle range offences because they are committed by a father against his daughter. 29 The wilful invasion for sexual purposes of the body of a child who is less than ten years old is one of the most appalling crimes that could be committed. In my opinion, it is much worse when it is committed by a father. The offence of digital penetration is a serious one but in my opinion is not a middle range offence, even though it is committed by a father on his daughter. Penetration by a finger was very unpleasant but it is a lesser offence than penetration by a penis. 30 Since the offender has never previously committed any serious offence and since he was, in many respects, a good father and a good citizen, I am of the opinion that I can impose a lesser non-parole period for the two middle range offences. In imposing any sentence, I must have regard to the maximum sentence and I must form an opinion, after carefully reviewing the consequences of the imposition of any sentence, as to what the appropriate period should be for the overall sentence. 31 In my opinion, each of the major offences requires me to impose a sentence of a non-parole period of thirteen years with a third offence requiring me to impose a non-parole period of seven years. There should be some accumulation of sentences so that the effective non-parole period will be sixteen years and the total sentence will be twenty-one years. I impose these sentences after considering sentencing statistics and the decision of Regina v AGP [2004] NSWCCA 434. SENTENCES32 Count 1. I sentence the offender to a non-parole period of thirteen years. The balance of the term will be four years and four months. The non-parole period commences on 18 August 2006 and expires on 17 August 2019. The balance of the term commences on 18 August 2019 and the sentence concludes on 17 December 2023. 33 Count 3. I sentence the offender to a non-parole period of seven years. The balance of the terms will be two years and four months. The non-parole period commences on 18 August 2013 and concludes on 17 August 2020. The balance of the term commences on 18 August 2020 and the sentence concludes on 17 December 2022. 34 Count 4. I sentence the offender to a non-parole period of thirteen years. The balance of the term will be five years. The non-parole period commences on 18 August 2009 and concludes on 17 August 2022 on which day the offender is eligible for parole. The balance of the term commences on 18 August 2022 and concludes on 17 August 2027 on which day the offender is to be released from custody. He should now go with the officers. My remarks can be distributed to counsel.35 OUTRAM: Your Honour one thing before the offender goes. I must draw to your Honour’s attention the provisions of s 562BE which enables your Honour if your Honour is so minded to make a apprehended violence order. In this instance your Honour I would only ask that your Honour consider that but because of the sentences imposed become unnecessary.36 HIS HONOUR: I really don’t think it’s necessary that I impose such an order.37 OUTRAM: I agree your Honour and I would not ask your Honour to do it, except to consider it.38 HIS HONOUR: So I consider that but I decline to do it. Thank you for drawing it to my attention.

    JUDGMENT[SUBJECT TO APPEAL]1 HIS HONOUR: On 12 June 2005 the appellant was travelling east bound in the M5 Motorway at Bardwell Park. There are speed cameras situated in the Motorway. One of those speed cameras took a photograph of Volkswagen NXF-768 as it was travelling through the tunnel. There is no dispute the appellant was driving this vehicle at the time it was photographed. Some time after the photograph was taken the appellant received a traffic infringement notice (at least I have assumed that) alleging he was travelling at 93 kilometres per hour in the M5 Motorway on 12 June, in circumstances where the speed limit was 80 kilometres per hour. The appellant opted to have the matter heard in the Local Court.2 In the Local Court, the Prosecution tendered certificates pursuant to s 46 and 47(5) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act, s 230 of the Road Transport (General) Act and s 221 of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act and another certificate pursuant to s 248(4) of the Road Act 1993 and three photographs from the speed camera containing various images of a portion of the tunnel, various motor vehicles and encrypted pieces of information.3 The evidential value of the material so tendered by the Prosecution is very much in dispute in these proceedings. The learned magistrate regarded the material as establishing evidence upon which he could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had exceeded the speed limit by less than 15 kilometres per hour. The appellant has appealed from the learned magistrate’s decision.4 The appellant’s case is that the learned judge below fell into error because he incorrectly applied the provisions of s 46 and 47 of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act of 1999. The appeal before me is not, of course, an appeal against error but rather a hearing de novo on the transcripts and such other fresh evidence as is allowed by leave. 5 Before me, the exhibits and transcript before the magistrate were tendered. The Prosecution tendered a further certificate by consent. That certificate, pursuant to s 230(2) Road Transport (General) Act 2005, certifying the Security Indicator of thirty-two letters, numbers and symbols on the photographs had been produced by MD5 algorithm. It was marked exhibit J.6 The Court’s task is to determine whether the RTA has proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt by reliance upon information contained in the certificates and photographs tendered. 7 The defence case is that the Prosecution cannot rely upon the certificates in circumstances where evidence contrary to the material adduced in the documents is adduced in the defence case. The defence case is that such contrary evidence has been adduced in its case. 8 The Crown position is that the evidence adduced by reliance upon s 46 and 47 of the Road Transport (Safety and Management) Act survives even where evidence to the contrary is adduced. The Crown concedes that such evidence to the contrary may, in some circumstances, raise a reasonable possibility that the alleged offender did not commit the offence alleged, but says that could only occur in circumstances where the evidence possessed the relevant cogency, quality and believability.9 In such cases as these, the Prosecution relies on the use of approved speed measuring devices and approved digital camera recording devices. Digital camera recording devices are attached to approved speed measuring devices. By interaction of the two devices the RTA claims to be able to record on the photograph of a speeding vehicle the speed at which the vehicle is travelling, the date, time and location at which the photograph is taken, the direction in which the vehicle is travelling and the applicable speed limit.10 It is agreed between the parties that approved digital camera recording devices are to be inspected monthly and must be found to be operating correctly before any certificate relying upon evidence contained in the photographs of that approved digital camera recording device is admissible. The relevant digital camera recording device in this case was inspected on 9 June 2005 and found to be operating correctly. 11 Likewise, it is agree between the parties that the approved measuring speed device is to be inspected annually and passed as accurate and operating correctly before evidence of the accuracy or reliability of the speed measuring device is admissible. In this case, the relevant speed measuring device was tested for accuracy and functional requirements on 13 December 2004. It was certified the device was then operating properly and accurately.12 The Prosecution tendered a photograph of the rear end of the appellant’s motor vehicle, NXF-768, and the encrypted information contained in the photograph. There was no dispute the photograph and encryptions related to an occasion the appellant was driving his vehicle home from Canberra on 12 June 2005. So far as is relevant the encrypted information incorporated into the photograph included:“Location code: 9551. Location: M5 Motorway Bardwell Park, east bound direction: away operator: 055.Frame number -7Speed limit: 080kph. Vehicle Speed: 093kph. Lane: 1. REDFLEX Sunday 12 June 2005 17:19:52. Security Indicator:”; then 32 digits and letters thereafter follow.13 The photograph also reveals, as I say, the rear end of a VW where the licence plate NXF-768 is clearly visible.14 The appellant tendered in the Court below a “Site Maintenance Log History” for the relevant digital camera recording and speed measuring devices for the period 12 December 2004 to 27 February 2006. On eleven occasions during this fifteen month period the log showed there were maintenance issues relating to one or other or both devices. Of particular relevance is a maintenance issue first reported on 4 May 2005. The date that particular maintenance issue was rectified is recorded as 1 July 2005. The particular maintenance issue for the period is described as “unable to eject DVD or restart computer”. The DVD was apparently replaced and “tested all okay”. It was monitored for the “next few sessions”. There was a recurrence of symptoms on 23 June 2006. 15 Of course the relevance of the maintenance issue is that the maintenance issue was alive on 12 June 2006 when the photograph of the appellant’s car was taken. Because of the encryptions recorded on the photographs and the existence of three different photographs I am satisfied the computer responsible for all photographs being taken and encryptions appearing thereon was operational on 12 June 2006.16 The defence also sought to rely upon the eleven separate maintenance issues during the fifteen months period as evidence that the speed measuring device and digital camera recording was so dysfunctional as to amount to “evidence to the contrary” of the particulars certified in the certificates and photographs. That submission is rejected. 17 The defence also relied upon sworn oral evidence given by the appellant. For purposes of this judgment I refer to three portions of his evidence: Transcript 7/3/06 page 18 line 47: 
     
      
      “I was sitting on, I think, the speed limit was 80 and I was doing about six or seven ks less than the speed limit and there was a car sitting on the outside of me the whole time and I was, you know, trying to do the speed limit because I wanted to switch to the right hand lane to pass the car in front of me but I couldn’t because the car beside me was doing exactly the same as I was which was significantly less than the speed limit. This occurred for the full length of the tunnel because I was discussing it repeatedly with my wife, saying you know “It's a bit frustrating that I can’t even do what the speed limit is because this guy’s sitting on the outside of me the whole time ‘And that’s why the situation for the full length of the tunnel was so clear to me because we had this continuing discussion the whole way through the tunnel...’ 
      
     
     
      
      P25 commencing at line 33: 
       
      “Yeah, but it sticks clearly in my mind because of the conversation I had with my wife the whole way through the tunnel. You do only have my word for it but my wife and I were discussing it, not just once but several times through the tunnel and that’s why I am so acutely aware of what speed I was doing and you know I go through that tunnel once every six months or whatever it is, so it’s not a trip I make regularly that I can get confused with another trip.” 
      
     
     
      
      And elsewhere on the same page at line 49: 
       
      “No, the situation of the traffic was that I had to hold my position in the traffic and I wasn’t doing the speed limit and that was the topic of discussion and it was a repeated topic of discussion like two to three times through the tunnel because it was a continuing circumstance the whole way through. That’s why when I got the photo I was so amazed, when I got the photo, that I was speeding because I wasn’t, and I wasn’t just one or two ks over. Like I’m talking six or seven ks over it (as said) and that’s why I was so amazed.” 
      
    18 I am satisfied that when the appellant said, “I was sitting on, I think, the speed limit was 80”, that the words “I think” were not any equivocation but rather a mannerism in his speech. I am also satisfied that when he said, “I wasn’t just one or two ks over, like I’m talking six or seven ks over it” he did not mean “over it”, he meant “under it”. That is, “under it” being the speed limit. To read those remarks as a concession that he was over the speed limit would make no sense of his evidence at all. He was in Court denying that he had been over the speed limit.19 On the Prosecution case, evidence is given of a measurement of speed of the appellant’s vehicle at approximately 5.20pm on 12 June 2005. That measurement of speed, on the Prosecution case, was obtained by use of an approved measuring device. That evidence is to be found on exhibit H, photograph 2. The evidence is that the measured speed was 93 kilometres per hour. S 47 Road Transport (Safety and Management) Act so far as is relevant, provides as follows: 47 Photographic evidence of speeding offences 
     
      
      (1) In proceedings for an offence of driving at a speed in excess of a speed limit imposed by or under this Act or Regulations evidence may be given of a measurement of speed obtained by use of an approved speed measuring device and recorded by an approved camera recording device. 
      
     
     
      
      (2) In proceedings in which such evidence is given: 
       
        
        (a) The provisions of section 46 relating to the accuracy or reliability of the approved speed measuring device apply, and  
         
        (b) subsections (3)-(5) apply in relation to the approved camera recording device, and  
         
        (c) evidence that a photograph taken of an approved digital camera recording device bears a Security Indicator of a kind prescribed by the regulations is evidence (unless evidence to the contrary is adduced) that the photograph has not been altered since it was taken. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (3) A photograph tendered in evidence as a photograph taken by an approved camera recording device on a specified day at a specified location: 
       
        
        (a) is to be accepted as having been so taken (unless evidence to the contrary is adduced), and  
         
        (b) is evidence (unless evidence to the contrary is adduced) of matters shown or recorded on the photograph... 
        
       
      
    20 It is to be noted that s 47 provides that the provisions of s 46 also apply. The relevant portions of s 46 Road Transport (Safety and Management) Act are these: 46 Certificates concerning use of approved speed measuring devices 
     
      
      (1) In proceedings for any offence in which evidence is given of a measurement of speed obtained by the use of an approved speed measuring device, a certificate purporting to be signed by the appropriate officer certifying that: 
       
        
        (a) the device is an approved speed measuring device within the meaning of this Act, and  
         
        (b) on a day specified in the certificate (being within the time prescribed by regulations before the alleged time of the offence) the device was tested in accordance with the regulations and sealed by an appropriate officer, and  
         
        (c) on that day the device was accurate and operating properly, is admissible and is evidence(unless evidence to the contrary is adduced) of the particulars certified in and by the certificate. 
        
       
      
      
      (2) If any such certificate is tendered in proceedings for an offence, evidence of the accuracy or reliability of the approved speed measuring device is not required in those proceedings unless evidence that the device was not accurate or not reliable has been adduced... 
      
    21 It is important to understand the day referred to in s 46(1) is 13 December 2004. However the position is less clear as to the date in subsection (2). 22 Subsection (2) creates a presumption of the continued accuracy of the speed measuring device on the day and at the time of the measurement of excessive speed, unless evidence that the device was not accurate or not reliable has been adduced. Given the Prosecution needs to prove beyond reasonable doubt speed in excess of a speed limit on the day and at the time of the alleged offence the evidence of unreliability or inaccuracy on the day of the alleged offence and at the time would be relevant evidence.23 23.In RTA v Nichols unreported [2005] NSWSC 946 22 September 2005 Hoeben J puts it wider than I have: 
     
      
       
      “17. Subsection 46(2) provides that once such a certificate is tendered in proceedings no further evidence as to the accuracy or reliability of the speed measuring device is needed unless evidence that the device was not accurate or not reliable has been adduced. Implicit in that qualification is that the inaccuracy or unreliability has to have occurred within the period [of the device] under consideration, ie after the date of testing, which in this case was 13 January 2004.” 
      
    24 As I earlier mentioned, the date in the instant case that I am dealing with is 13 December 2004. Thus evidence of unreliability or inaccuracy of the speed measuring device on the day of the offence would negate the presumption of continued accuracy and reliability of the approved speed measuring device created by the opening words of s 46(2) “if any such certificate is tendered for an offence evidence of the accuracy or reliability of the approved measuring device is not required...”25 In these circumstances for the Prosecution to succeed it would need to prove beyond reasonable doubt accurate measurement of the speed of the alleged offending vehicle. Accuracy of the approved speed measuring device at a point which may be as many as eleven months twenty-nine days previously would, in my view, hardly be adequate. On the other hand accuracy of the approved speed measuring device two or three days previously may be given more weight. In this case the time lapse, as I said, is six months. In my view the evidence for the purposes of proving the accuracy of the speed measurement is inadequate to satisfy a court beyond reasonable doubt in those circumstances.26 I turn now to consider s 47(3). S 47(3)(a) and (b) create what Adams J describes as a “default position”. The relevant default position in this case can be summarised thus, the photograph taken by the approved digital camera recording device is evidence of the matters shown or recorded on it. Those matters include the date, time, location, speed limit, and excessive speed recorded. However, the “default position” is negated when “evidence to the contrary is adduced”.27 In RTA v Mitchell [2006] NSWSC 194 22 March 2006 at paragraph 15 Adams J says:” 
     
      
       
      “15. The argument focuses upon the significance of the phrase “unless evidence to the contrary is adduced”. That appears in each of the paras 47(2)(c), 47(3)(a) and 47(3)(b). It is important at the outset to note that in order to remove what I might call the “default position”, all that is necessary is that evidence to the contrary be adduced. The statute does not require that evidence to be of any particular quality. Even slight or unconvincing evidence “to the contrary” would satisfy the negating requirement.” 
      
    28 Significantly, for the purposes of this case, his Honour gives, in paragraph 16, an example of the type of evidence that would constitute “evidence to the contrary” for the purposes of s 47(3)(b).  
     
      
      “16...A consequence of this reading of the paragraphs is that when evidence (say) from a defendant is given that he or she was not driving at the speed shown on the photograph the photograph and, perhaps more significantly, the text on it (including the speed) is  
      not 
       evidence of what is depicted. Moreover, this would be so even if the evidence of the driver was disbelieved.” 
      
    29 The example given by Adams J does not amount to direct evidence that the speed measuring device is not accurate or not reliable. But it challenges the accuracy and reliability of the speed measuring device to the point where the speed claimed by the driver (in the instant case 74 kilometres per hour) could not stand against the accuracy of the speed recorded by the speed measuring device. One is clearly inconsistent with the other if the Tribunal were to accept the evidence of, in this case, the appellant. The inference that would need to be drawn is that the speed measuring device was inaccurate.30 Evidence that the appellant was driving at 74 kilometres an hour is evidence contrary to the information shown or recorded on the photograph that the speed of the vehicle was 93 kilometres per hour as to the speed of the vehicle. That being so the photograph does not provide evidence of the speed.31 The Prosecution sought to argue that the provisions of s 46 and 47 were provisions facilitating proof of measurement of speed and other matters shown or recorded on the photographs. That submission is best answered by reference to remarks earlier made by Adams J in Mitchell’s case. 
     
      
      “2. In the present context it is clear that legislation attempts to strike a balance between evidence which for all practical purposes any reasonable person would accept gives rise to a reasonable level of certainty about particular facts and yet gives to a defendant an opportunity to test that assumption and in a particular case show that the assumption ought not to lead to an adverse decision in a context where the test of guilt is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 
      
     
     
      
      3. So far as the experience of the Courts is concerned it is evident that the legislation has had the effect or removing from the lists the vast majority of cases which might otherwise have been fruitlessly contested. The number of contested cases is tiny and of those only very few raise substantive factual issues suggesting that the forensic reliability of the equipment used to identify vehicles exceeding the speed limit is in question.” 
      
    32 It is a fundamental concept in our criminal law that the burden of proving guilt rests with the Prosecution. It makes sense where the reliability of equipment used is not in issue, to facilitate the proof of matters that are not in contest. However, where matters are in contest the norm is that the Prosecution shoulders the burden of proving guilt. S 46(2) and 47(3)(b) are to be understood as acknowledging that proposition in circumstances where “evidence to the contrary is adduced”.33 As earlier noted, Adams J observed, and it is worth repeating: 
     
      
       
      “To remove what I might call the “default position” all that is necessary is that evidence to the contrary be adduced. The statute does not require that the evidence be of any particular quality. Even slight or unconvincing evidence “to the contrary” would satisfy the negating requirement.” 
      
    34 The phrase where “evidence to the contrary is adduced” is not a requirement that the defendant establish as a reasonable possibility that he was travelling at a speed less than the speed appearing on the photograph. If that was the intention of parliament, it no doubt would have relied upon legislation not dissimilar to that found in s 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 where clearly an onus is placed upon the accused to negate a proposition.35 The provisions expressed in s 46(2) and 47(3)(b) are so expressed, to relieve the defence of shouldering any burden of proof. It follows from all this that the issue of speeding being contested, in this case by evidence contrary to the evidence contained in exhibit H2, a burden fell upon the Crown to prove the accuracy of the speed it was alleging. In the circumstances of this case it would have needed to do so by running a case in reply. It did not do so. 36 The wash-up is that the Crown allegations are contested. There is evidence that the appellant was travelling at something less than the speed limit through the tunnel. There is no evidence from the Prosecution establishing the speed as measured was the speed as travelled (see s 46(2) and s 47(3)(b) of the Road Traffic (Safety and Management) Act). In the event, the Prosecution has failed. 37 My formal orders are these. The conviction appeal is upheld. The conviction recorded by the learned magistrate is quashed. The fines and costs imposed by the learned magistrate are also quashed.

     PETER JOHN SHARPE v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Johnson J. 
     
      
    2 JOHNSON J: The Appellant, Peter John Sharpe, was convicted in the Sydney District Court after trial before Morgan DCJ and a jury in respect of two offences: 
     
      
       
      (a) aggravated break, enter and steal (in company): s.112(2)  
      Crimes Act 1900  
      (maximum penalty: 20 years’ imprisonment); 
       
       
      (b) aggravated use of an offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension (in company): s.33B(2)  
      Crimes Act 1900  
      (maximum penalty: 15 years’ imprisonment). 
       
      
    3 On 20 April 2004, the Appellant was arraigned with Troy John Roberts before Morgan DCJ at the Sydney District Court. The indictment alleged that the Appellant committed the following offences: 
     
      
       
      (a) on 15 January 2002 at Kelso in the State of New South Wales, break and enter the warehouse known as Harvey Norman Bathurst and then in the said warehouse commit a serious indictable offence, namely steal electrical items, the property of Elebat Pty Limited trading as Harvey Norman Electrical, Bathurst, in circumstances of aggravation, namely whilst he was in company with other persons Troy John Roberts and Ryan Vincent Patterson (s.112(2) count); 
       
       
      (b) on 15 January 2002 at Kelso in the State of New South Wales, whilst in the company of Troy John Roberts and Ryan Vincent Patterson, threaten to use an offensive weapon with intent to prevent the lawful apprehension of himself (s.33B(2) count). 
       
      
    4 The Appellant was convicted following trial on 29 April 2004. On 18 November 2004, the Appellant was sentenced by Morgan DCJ in respect of the s.112(2) count to imprisonment for four years and three months to date from 29 January 2005 and to expire on 28 April 2009 with a non-parole period of two-and-a-half years to date from 29 January 2005 and to expire on 28 July 2007. In respect of the s.33B(2) count, the Appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of two years to date from 29 April 2004 and to expire on 28 April 2006 with a non-parole period of 18 months to date from 29 April 2004 and to expire on 28 October 2005. Accordingly, the Appellant’s overall sentence was one of five years’ imprisonment to date from 29 April 2004 with a non-parole period of three years and three months to date from 29 April 2004 and to expire on 28 July 2007. 
     
      
    5 The Appellant appeals against conviction upon the s.33B(2) count. He has abandoned his appeal against conviction in relation to the s.112(2) count. He seeks leave to appeal against sentence with respect to the s.33B(2) count. He has abandoned his sentence appeal upon the s.112(2) count except to the extent that any adjustment to the commencement date arises from his appeal concerning the s.33B(2) count.  
     
      
    6 The co-accused, Mr Roberts, was convicted on the s.112(2) count but the jury could not agree as to a verdict on the s.33B(2) count. 
     
      
       
      The Conviction Appeal 
       
      
    7 There is a single ground of appeal against conviction with respect to the s.33B(2) count. The ground contends that the jury’s finding in respect of this count is not supported by the evidence. 
     
      
    8 To place this ground into context, it is appropriate to refer concisely to the Crown case against the Appellant.  
     
      
       
      The Crown Case 
       
      
    9 The Crown case on the s.33B(2) count relied almost entirely upon the evidence of Henry Mahara, a licensed security guard. Mr Mahara gave evidence that, shortly after 4.00 am on 15 January 2002, he attended the Harvey Norman store at Kelso in his work vehicle after receiving a notification from his base. The work vehicle bore the sign “security” and carried roof lights, strobe lights and flashing lights. Mr Mahara was wearing his work uniform which consisted of a pair of dark navy trousers, a blue short-sleeved shirt, epaulettes and the name badge of the security firm. He was armed with a hand gun for work purposes. He was clearly identifiable as a security officer. Upon arrival, Mr Mahara went to the rear of the premises. He had his lights on full beam and the spot lights were illuminated as well. He noticed the airconditioning unit ripped out of the wall at the side of the building. Mr Mahara saw three men jumping out of a hole in the wall. At that stage, he could not say what they were wearing or give any other description of them. 
     
      
    10 The men appeared to see Mr Mahara and ran away from him down the fence line towards the Great Western Highway. Mr Mahara reversed his vehicle and headed down the side of the warehouse towards the highway. As he reversed his car, he called the base for back-up and for the police. Mr Mahara next saw the men at the front of the warehouse. This area was quite well lit, but Mr Mahara still could not observe anything in relation to the men’s clothing or give any other description of them. Mr Mahara said that, once the men reached the Great Western Highway, they headed towards the gates and ran onto vacant premises next door to the Harvey Norman premises.  
     
      
    11 Mr Mahara entered this area with his spot light on and observed the men against the bushes. At this point, from about eight to 10 metres away, he noticed that all three of the men were wearing balaclavas. At about this time, Mr Mahara called out for the first time “Security, stop”. He repeated these words several times thereafter. Two of the men ran away whilst one of them turned towards Mr Mahara, who opened the driver’s side door of his vehicle, emerged and commenced to chase the men.  
     
      
    12 The men ran away from him, out the gate, back up the Great Western Highway towards a caravan park. Mr Mahara was in pursuit, gaining on the men. They were heading towards the Gold Panner Motel.  
     
      
    13 The man at the rear turned around and produced a crow bar. He appeared to threaten Mr Mahara with it. Mr Mahara told him to “drop it”. When the man did not put the crow bar down, Mr Mahara fired a shot which missed the man. The man with the crow bar then turned and ran towards the other two men.  
     
      
    14 The three men stopped at the gateway to the Motel. Mr Mahara ran towards the men. As he did so, all three of them raised their arms, carrying bars, similar to the crow bar or jemmy bar he saw with the first man. When he was about seven metres away from the men, something was thrown at Mr Mahara, but he did not know what it was. None of the men said anything to Mr Mahara, but he gave evidence that he felt from their actions that they were threatening him with the bars. He asked the men to drop the bars, but when that did not happen, he fired a second shot which struck the Appellant.  
     
      
    15 After he fired the second shot, Mr Mahara approached the Appellant and saw the other two men take off. The Appellant screamed and was rummaging through his jacket as he was lying face down. Mr Mahara said that, at the time, he thought the Appellant was reaching for a firearm, so he approached him from behind and had his own firearm pointed at the Appellant from behind. He said to the Appellant “show me your hands now or I will shoot you”. When the Appellant showed his hands, Mr Mahara saw that he did not have a firearm. However, the Appellant was holding a small portable radio and he was talking to someone on the radio. Whilst this happened, the other two men came back down the driveway towards Mr Mahara and the Appellant. Mr Mahara held his firearm towards the men and told them to stop. They did so, then turned and ran.  
     
      
    16 Mr Mahara handcuffed the Appellant. The Appellant was wearing thick gloves. Mr Mahara pulled the balaclava off the Appellant’s head. The police arrived a few minutes later. A jemmy bar was located on the ground near the location where the Appellant was arrested. 
     
      
    17 Given the issue raised in the conviction appeal, reference should be made to the statement of Dr Neil Boyce Meulman which, by consent, was read to the jury (Exhibit U, T19, 22 April 2004). Dr Meulman is a general surgeon. He examined the Appellant at about 5.00 am on 15 January 2002 in the Emergency Department at Bathurst Base Hospital. He observed a one-inch triangular wound laterally on the Appellant’s left leg, approximately 15 centimetres above the knee and a one-centimetre wound posteriorly on the left thigh at about the mid-thigh level. There was a large haematoma in the line joining the two wounds. There was no apparent neuro-vascular compromise and a CT revealed multiple metallic fragments. Dr Meulman expressed the opinion that the Appellant had been struck by a high-velocity projectile which had fragmented during its passage through his left thigh and concluded that “the wounds are consistent with an entry and exit wound but I am uncertain as to which is which” (Exhibit U, paragraph 5). 
     
      
       
      The Appellant’s Case 
       
      
    18 The Appellant gave evidence at the trial. Put shortly, he asserted that he had an innocent reason for being in the vicinity of the warehouse and was caught up innocently in the events that followed upon the security guard’s discovery and pursuit of the burglars. The Appellant said that, after the security guard had fired the first shot, he turned and ran and soon after a second shot was fired which hit him in the back of the leg (T17-18, 23 April 2004). He denied that he had participated in the burglary and denied holding a crow bar or jemmy and brandishing it towards the security guard. 
     
      
    19 Dr Richard Byron Collins, forensic pathologist, was called as a witness in the Appellant’s case. Dr Collins did not physically examine the Appellant at any time. He examined the hospital notes, x-ray reports and a number of photocopied coloured photographs of the Appellant’s leg injuries together with the statement of Dr Meulman. Having undertaken that task, Dr Collins expressed the opinion that the entry wound was at the back of the Appellant’s thigh and the exit wound was on the outside or lateral aspect of the thigh (T27, 23 April 2004).  
     
      
       
      The Appeal Against Conviction 
       
      
    20 The sole ground of appeal against conviction is that the jury’s verdict in respect of the s.33B(2) count is not supported by the evidence. The Appellant does not assert any error in the conduct of the trial nor in the summing up.  
     
      
    21 The Crown submitted that this ground of appeal falls to be determined by application of the principles in R v Merritt and Roso (1985) 19 A Crim R 360 at 372-373; R v Kyriakou (1987) 29 A Crim R 50 at 60-61; R v O’Donoghue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397 at 401, namely that it is for the Appellant to establish that there was no evidence to support a particular finding, or the evidence was all one way and that a miscarriage of justice has resulted. The principles arising from these cases have application where challenge is made to a trial judge’s findings of fact. However, the conviction ground here contends that the verdict of the jury cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. Section 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides that this Court should allow an appeal if it is of the opinion that the verdict of a jury cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. I will approach this ground of appeal in accordance with the principles in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-495 and MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606 at 614-615, 621, 623-624 which were summarised recently in the following way in Seymour v R [2006] NSWCCA 206 at paragraph 58. The Court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence and then consider whether, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there was evidence to sustain the jury’s verdict, it was nevertheless open to the jury on the whole of the evidence to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty, paying full regard to the circumstances that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining the issue of guilt and that they have the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. This Court must be satisfied that the evidence on which the Crown case relied was cogent and unequivocal, and that it was not inherently implausible. Where the evidence appears on a reading of the record to contain discrepancies, display inadequacies, or lack probative force, its apparent lack of credibility may in many cases be explained by that advantage enjoyed by the jury. But, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, this Court is entitled and obliged to act on its own assessment of the nature and quality of the evidence if it is satisfied that, even making full allowance for the advantage enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted.  
     
      
    22 Mr Stratton SC, for the Appellant, submits that the evidence of Dr Collins, which was not challenged in cross-examination, supports a conclusion that the Appellant was facing away from Mr Mahara at the time when the second gun shot was fired which struck the Appellant. Based upon this evidence, it was submitted that it was not open to the jury to accept Mr Mahara’s evidence that the three men, including the Appellant, stood facing Mr Mahara and brandishing crow bars or jemmies before the second shot was fired. It was submitted that the conviction of the Appellant for the s.33B(2) offence required acceptance of Mr Mahara’s evidence to this effect. The fact that, according to the evidence of Dr Collins, the bullet entered the rear of the Appellant’s leg supported a conclusion that the Appellant was facing away from Mr Mahara at the time when the shot was fired. On this analysis, it was submitted that it was not open to the jury to convict Appellant of this offence. 
     
      
    23 It was common ground that the Crown did not rely upon joint criminal enterprise with respect to the s.33B(2) count and that the jury had been so directed (T1-2, 29 April 2004). To convict the Appellant of the s.33B(2) count, it was necessary for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant, whilst in company of other persons, threatened to use an offensive weapon and did so with the intention of preventing his lawful apprehension. In the circumstances of this case, it was necessary for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant brandished a crow bar or jemmy in the manner described by Mr Mahara before the second shot was fired.  
     
      
    24 The Crown submitted that there was ample evidence to support the conviction for the s.33B(2) count in this case. This was so even if Dr Collins’ evidence was accepted concerning the entry wound in the Appellant’s leg. In support of this submission, the Crown referred to portions of the evidence given by Mr Mahara concerning this part of the incident.  
     
      
    25 In examination in chief, Mr Mahara said that, following the first gun shot, each of the three men was holding a bar which each of them raised towards him (T29-30, 20 April 2004). When the three men were about seven metres from Mr Mahara, he “asked them to drop them and they didn’t drop so I fired the shot, the second shot” (T30.52, 20 April 2004). Mr Mahara had aimed for the legs of “the closest one” who turned out to be the Appellant (T31.11, 20 April 2004).  
     
      
    26 Trial counsel for the Appellant cross-examined Mr Mahara concerning events immediately prior to the second gun shot (T57.53, 20 April 2004): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Now the circumstances surrounding my client being shot you say, do you, immediately prior to Mr Sharpe being shot -- 
         
        A. Mm hmm. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. -- and correct me if I’m wrong, that the persons raised their bars and you fired a second shot? 
         
        A. That’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So are you saying that all three persons raised their bars? 
         
        A. That’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you fired the second shot? 
         
        A. That’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You shot my client in the back of the leg, do you agree with that? 
         
        A. Well I heard eventually, at the end, yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So he wasn’t facing you at the time that -- 
         
        A. They were facing me at the time. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well how do you explain he was shot in the back of the leg? 
         
        A. Dark place, could’ve tripped, anything could’ve happened, it happened pretty quick. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well were you looking at him when you shot him? 
         
        A. I certainly was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well he wasn’t facing you? 
         
        A. They were facing me at the time. When I had my firearm out pointed at him they were facing me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you agree you’ve come to find out that he was shot in the back of the leg? 
         
        A. Yes, that’s right, I found out later. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I’m putting to you that Mr Sharpe was running away from him (as said) because you were running at him screaming and you shot him whilst he was running away -- 
         
        A. I was running, I was screaming at them at the time to stop and put down the bars they had and they wouldn’t so I let a second shot go. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you’re certain it was when he was facing you? 
         
        A. I’m positive. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now when you did shoot Mr Sharpe you approached him, is that correct? 
         
        A. Yes that’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you did not remove a balaclava? 
         
        A. I ripped it off, I did.” 
        
       
      
    27 Later in cross-examination, counsel for the Appellant asked Mr Mahara (T4.48, 21 April 2004): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Now Mr Sharpe, after you had shot him and you approached him and after he went into his jacket and appeared to be speaking on this radio --- 
         
        A. Yep. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He did not have on his person at that time a crowbar, did he? 
         
        A. I can’t recall that, no, I’m not too sure on that one. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He didn’t have on his person at any time when you saw him a crowbar or a jemmy bar?  
         
        A. Before I shot him, yes, he did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well where did it go? 
         
        A. I don’t know. Don’t know. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You see I’m putting to you that you’re mistaken about that? 
         
        A. No, positive. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You saw these other persons with crowbars and in the frenzied activity of that particular incident you made an assumption? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Because indeed you didn’t take from Mr Sharpe a crowbar, did you? 
         
        A. No, didn’t see no crowbar after I shot him, nothing. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That’s right, and he fell where you shot him immediately, didn’t he? 
         
        A. No, he scrambled a couple more metres, tried to run and then fell.” 
        
       
      
    28 A jemmy bar was located on the ground near the location where the Appellant was arrested. 
     
      
    29 The Crown submitted that the jury was entitled to convict the Appellant of the s.33B(2) count based upon Mr Mahara’s evidence that the Appellant (and the two co-offenders) each brandished a crow bar or jemmy towards Mr Mahara prior to the second gun shot. It was submitted that the jury was entitled to find that this conduct involved a threat by the Appellant to use an offensive weapon with the intention of preventing his lawful apprehension and that this act occurred whilst the Appellant was in company. It was the continuing brandishing of the jemmies or crow bars by the three men towards Mr Mahara that led him to discharge the firearm a second time. Accordingly, the Crown submitted that a clear foundation existed for the jury to convict the Appellant of this offence. Under cross-examination, Mr Mahara did not accept that there was an inconsistency between his evidence and the suggested entry point of the bullet in the Appellant’s leg.  
     
      
       
      Resolution of Competing Submissions on Conviction Appeal 
       
      
    30 The evidence of Mr Mahara supported a clear prima facie case against the Appellant for the s.33B(2) count. Clearly, the Appellant was in company with two other persons. Against the background of an ongoing incident in which Mr Mahara had identified himself as a security officer, had called upon the three men to stop and had discharged his firearm, the three men, on his evidence, confronted Mr Mahara with each of them brandishing a crow bar or jemmy. Clearly, it was open to the jury to conclude that the conduct of the Appellant constituted a threat to use an offensive weapon and that this was done with the intention of preventing his lawful apprehension by Mr Mahara. 
     
      
    31 Accordingly, as a matter of law, there was evidence to sustain the jury’s verdict. It is necessary for this Court to make its own independent assessment of the evidence and to consider whether it was open to the jury on the whole of the evidence to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty, paying full regard to the advantages of the jury in exercising its function at the trial.  
     
      
    32 Mr Mahara maintained that each of the three men was brandishing a crow bar or jemmy prior to the discharge of the second shot. It was this conduct on the part of the three men which explained how he came to discharge his firearm a second time. On his account, the s.33B(2) offence was complete prior to the time when the second shot was fired. Under cross-examination, the Appellant’s trial counsel invited Mr Mahara to explain how the Appellant could come to be shot in the back of the leg on his account. In response, Mr Mahara indicated that the Appellant could have tripped. He left open the scenario that the Appellant himself had changed his position prior to the time when the bullet struck him in the leg. Accordingly, there is no irreconcilable inconsistency between Mr Mahara’s evidence concerning the actions of the Appellant prior to the second shot being fired and the hypothesis advanced by Dr Collins that the entry point was in the back of the Appellant’s leg. 
     
      
    33 Morgan DCJ reminded the jury in the summing up of the evidence concerning the point of entry of the bullet in the Appellant’s leg from Dr Meulman and Dr Collins. It was a matter for the jury to consider that issue in the light of Dr Meulman’s direct examination of the Appellant soon after the incident and Dr Collins’ assessment based on reports, photographs and x-rays made some time after the event. 
     
      
    34 It was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant had brandished a crow bar or jemmy towards Mr Mahara, but that the Appellant had moved or commenced to move shortly prior to the second shot being fired. The bullet passed through the Appellant’s leg.  
     
      
    35 The Appellant was wearing a balaclava and gloves, consistent with his part in the burglary offence. After falling to the ground, the Appellant used the two-way radio which he was carrying to contact one or other of his co-offenders. A jemmy was found on the ground in the vicinity and it was open to the jury to conclude that this had been the item held by the Appellant. 
     
      
    36 It was understandable that the jury rejected the Appellant’s implausible account that he was present at the scene of the burglary innocently and that he became an innocent victim of the incident. The Appellant’s evidence concerning his actions prior to the second gun shot would have carried little or no weight in the eyes of the jury, and rightly so. 
     
      
    37 This is not a case where acceptance that the entry point of the wound was in the rear of the Appellant’s leg undermined the jury’s verdict on the s.33B(2) count. In my view, the evidence of Mr Mahara was not inherently implausible. The jury had the advantage of observing Mr Mahara give evidence. I am satisfied that it was open to the jury on the whole of the evidence to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the Appellant was guilty of the s.33B(2) offence. The verdict of guilty on this count can be supported having regard to the evidence: s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912; M v The Queen; MFA v The Queen; R v Chahine [2006] NSWCCA 99 at paragraphs 23-25. 
     
      
    38 I would reject the sole ground of appeal against conviction. 
     
      
       
      Application for Leave to Appeal Against Sentence 
       
      
    39 The Appellant abandoned his appeal against severity of sentence imposed with respect to the s.112(2) offence apart from any adjustment in dates which may flow from his appeal against conviction and sentence on the s.33B(2) count.  
     
      
    40 It is appropriate to refer to the Appellant’s background and subjective circumstances and a number of the findings made by Morgan DCJ on sentence. 
     
      
    41 The Appellant was born on 20 October 1968 and was 33 years old at the time of the offences. Morgan DCJ recounted the Appellant’s criminal history which commenced in 1988 and included entries for break, enter and steal (in 1991), for accessory after the fact to break, enter and steal (in 1992) and for kidnapping and maliciously destroying property by fire (in 1994). For the 1994 offences, the Appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for seven years with a non-parole period of five years. The non-parole period expired on 18 August 2001, some five months before the commission of the present offences. 
     
      
    42 According to a pre-sentence report dated 28 July 2004, the Appellant had been unemployed since 1993. He was placed on a disability support pension in 1999 following a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. He left school in 1985 and held employment in a variety of fields, including sales, security and as a forklift operator. The Appellant had a close relationship with his mother until her death in May 2003. She was a paraplegic who relied heavily on her family for support.  
     
      
    43 The diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder was said to arise from the custodial sentence imposed upon the Appellant in 1994 and subsequent treatment and harassment experienced by him whilst in custody. The Appellant is homosexual and, according to a report of Ms Katie Seidler, psychologist, dated 12 July 2004, this aspect of his life has given rise to difficulties whilst in custody.  
     
      
    44 Morgan DCJ had regard to the issues of accumulation, concurrence and totality in accordance with the principles in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. There was partial accumulation, with the sentence for the s.112(2) offence commencing on 29 January 2005, some nine months after the commencement date for the s.33B(2) offence.  
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal Against Sentence 
       
      
    45 The Appellant relies upon five grounds of appeal with respect to the sentence imposed on the s.33B(2) count. They are: 
     
      
       
      (1) her Honour erred in taking into account the use of a weapon as an aggravating feature under s.21A  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
      ; 
       
       
      (2) her Honour erred in treating the Appellant’s criminal record as an aggravating factor under s.21A  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
      ; 
       
       
      (3) her Honour failed to make allowance for assistance rendered by the Appellant as allowed for by s.23(2)(b)  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
      ; 
       
       
      (4) her Honour failed to take sufficient account of extra-curial punishment inflicted upon the Appellant in the form of a gun shot wound; 
       
       
      (5) the penalty imposed in all the circumstances was too severe. 
       
       
      Ground (1) - The Use of a Weapon as an Aggravating Factor 
       
      
    46 In her remarks on sentence, Morgan DCJ said (ROS 19.5): 
     
      
       
        
        “In deciding the appropriate sentence to impose on the offender I have regard to section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and the aggravating factors, the second offence upon which the offender was found guilty by the jury involved the use of a weapon and the offender has a record of previous convictions. I also consider the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity and that the offender was the prime mover, together with the man Multari.” 
        
       
      
    47 Mr Stratton SC submits that the learned sentencing Judge has erred in treating as an aggravating factor the use of a weapon for the purposes of s.21A(2)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 when the threat to use an offensive weapon is an element of the offence under s.33B(2) Crimes Act 1900. Accordingly, it was submitted that the Court ought not to have additional regard to such an aggravating factor in sentencing given that the factor is an element of the offence: s.21A(2).  
     
      
    48 The Crown conceded that it would be erroneous to have additional regard to the threatened use of a weapon (under s.21A(2)(c)) where that feature was an element of the offence under s.33B(2). In this case, there was a bare reference by her Honour to the use of a weapon as an aggravating factor for the s.33B(2) offence. Even if error was demonstrated in this regard, the Crown submitted the Court would not intervene as no lesser sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    49 It would be impermissible to have additional regard to the threatened use of a weapon as an aggravating factor in this case given that the threat to use an offensive weapon is an element of a s.33B(2) offence. Her Honour appears to have used s.21A as a type of check list in which all aspects of the case which may be considered to be aggravating or mitigating factors are noted in passing. There was a bare reference to the threatened use of a weapon in the s.21A context. Her Honour did not elaborate upon this statement nor identify or quantify the manner in which the factor was taken into account in the fixing of an ultimate sentence.  
     
      
    50 It would be erroneous to have additional regard to this factor in these circumstances. It is not clear to me, however, that her Honour did have additional regard to the use of a weapon in a manner prohibited by s.21A(2) of the Act. As indicated, there was a bare passing reference to the weapon in the passage under challenge. If error occurred (and it is not clear to me that it has), an issue remains whether a lesser sentence is warranted and should have been passed. I will return to this question later in this judgment. 
     
      
      Ground (2) - Use of the Appellant’s Criminal Record as an Aggravating Factor 
       
      
    51 In the passage from the remarks on sentence set out in paragraph 46 above, Morgan DCJ identified the Appellant’s record of previous convictions as an aggravating factor, apparently for the purposes of s.21A(2)(d) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Mr Stratton SC submits that, in taking this course, her Honour fell into error.  
     
      
    52 The principle of proportionality requires the upper boundary of a proportionate sentence to be set by the objective circumstances of the offence, which circumstances do not encompass prior convictions: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242 at paragraphs 24-25. The reference to prior convictions in s.21A(2)(d) should be interpreted as referring to the use of that consideration in a manner consistent with the proportionality principle: R v McNaughton at paragraphs 30-33. 
     
      
    53 There is no doubt that the Appellant had a significant history of convictions for serious offences. These included burglary, kidnapping and arson offences. He was sentenced to a lengthy term of imprisonment in 1994 and had completed his parole period only three months before the commission of the present offences in January 2002. This is a criminal record which does not operate to assist the Appellant on sentence for the present offences.  
     
      
    54 There is nothing to suggest that her Honour applied the Appellant’s prior record as an “objective” circumstance of the offence, nor is there anything to suggest that this factor was applied to expand the bounds of the sentence beyond that proportionate to those circumstances: R v McNaughton at paragraph 35. Her Honour’s remarks, properly understood, do not suggest any infringement of the principle of proportionality established in Veen v The Queen (No. 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465; R v McNaughton at paragraph 41. The Appellant’s prior convictions were pertinent to where, within the boundary set by the objective circumstances, a sentence should lie by reference to his attitude of disobedience towards the law and increased weight to be given to retribution, personal deterrence and the protection of society: R v McNaughton at paragraph 26.  
     
      
    55 I am not satisfied that any error has been demonstrated. I reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground (3) - Failure to Make Allowance for Assistance to Authorities 
       
      
    56 An affidavit of assistance sworn by Detective Superintendent Mark Henney on 24 September 2004 was tendered on the Appellant’s behalf on sentence. Annexed to that affidavit was a report from Detective Sergeant Sinberg dated 22 September 2004 which set out certain information provided by the Appellant in February 2004 concerning the criminal activities of another person. As Morgan DCJ noted (ROS 18.5), it was the evaluation of Detective Sergeant Sinberg that the Appellant’s assistance was somewhat helpful although the full value of the assistance could not be tested due to his incarceration. Detective Sergeant Sinberg expressed the view that the Appellant was motivated to give this information to police with the view to receiving a letter of assistance. 
     
      
    57 Morgan DCJ noted that a mitigating factor to be taken into account in the Appellant’s favour under s.21A(3)(m) and s.23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 was the Appellant’s assistance to law enforcement authorities (ROS 19.8). Her Honour considered the matters referred to in s.23(2) of the Act and concluded that the only one which was relevant in this case was the probability that the Appellant would suffer harsh custodial conditions as a consequence (s.23(2)(g)). Accordingly, her Honour determined the appropriate discount for assistance as being in the order of 15% (ROS 20.2).  
     
      
    58 It was submitted for the Appellant that her Honour had failed to make allowance for the assistance given by the Appellant by reference to the significance and usefulness of the Appellant’s assistance to the authorities in accordance with s.23(2)(b) of the Act.  
     
      
    59 The Crown submitted that no error was revealed in this approach and that, even if error was demonstrated, no lesser sentence is warranted.  
     
      
    60 In describing the evidence concerning the Appellant’s assistance to authorities, her Honour referred to the tentative and guarded assessment concerning its value as offered by investigating police. Nevertheless, her Honour had regard to the terms of s.23 of the Act and identified that a 15% discount ought be extended to the Appellant upon the basis of one statutory factor in s.23(2). In my view, it was open to her Honour to conclude that only that factor, in the circumstances of the case, ought give rise to a discount on sentence. However, even if it might be concluded that some allowance should have been made for the significance and usefulness of the assistance for the purpose of s.23(2)(b) of the Act, it is difficult to see how, given the evidence concerning the assistance, any total discount for assistance could have reasonably extended beyond 15%. I am not satisfied that this ground has been made good. 
     
      
       
      Ground (4) - Failure to Take Sufficient Account of Extra-Curial Punishment 
       
      
    61 The Appellant complains that the learned sentencing Judge fell into error in failing to takes sufficient account of extra-curial punishment inflicted upon him in the form of the gun shot wound to his leg inflicted by Mr Mahara on 15 January 2002. Morgan DCJ noted the defence submission that regard should be had to the injury sustained by the Appellant when he was shot by the security guard (ROS 19.2). It was submitted, however, that her Honour did not expressly take this factor into account in passing sentence.  
     
      
    62 The Crown submitted that the Appellant was shot as a natural and direct consequence of his offending. There was no evidence of ongoing disability on the Appellant’s part following his discharge from hospital on 17 January 2002. In these circumstances, the Crown submitted that this factor did not operate to mitigate sentence and that no error had been demonstrated on the part of the sentencing Judge. 
     
      
    63 Conduct which constitutes a form of extra-curial punishment of an offender has been taken into account in an offender’s favour in passing sentence: R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 at 567. Sometimes, such extra-curial punishment takes the form of acts of retribution directed to the offender for having committed the offence: Allpass at 566; R v Daetz and Wilson (2003) 139 A Crim R 398 at 402ff; Sharwood v R [2006] NSWCCA 157 at paragraphs 65-67; R v Cunningham [2006] NSWCCA 176 at paragraph 67. On occasions, acts of retribution occur soon after the offence: Daetz and Wilson. At other times, they occur at a time more remote from the offence: Allpass; Sharwood.  
     
      
    64 Where serious injury has been sustained by an offender in the course of an offence, it has been submitted that the extra-curial punishment principle should be invoked in the offender’s favour on sentence: R v Webb [2004] NSWCCA 330 at paragraphs 22-24; R v Azar [2004] NSWSC 797 at paragraphs 31-33. In Webb, the offender was shot five times by police in the course of being arrested. Significant and ongoing disabilities were demonstrated as flowing from these injuries. The injuries were taken into account in the offender’s favour on sentence. In Azar, injuries were sustained by the offender when he was repeatedly struck with a pistol by another person immediately after shooting dead a third person. Kirby J observed that it was not suggested that the actions of the person who struck the offender with a pistol were unreasonable. The offender received a number of blows to the head. However, the consequences were short-lived and there was no permanent injury. Kirby J observed that, whilst it was a matter that should perhaps be taken into account, it should be given little weight (paragraph 33). 
     
      
    65 In the present case, there was limited evidence concerning the consequences of the gun shot wound to the Appellant. He was hospitalised for four days and was then released. The pre-sentence report and psychologist’s report tendered on sentence did not refer to any ongoing physical disability. The psychologist noted that the Appellant reported that he was again experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his being shot at the time of these offences. The Appellant did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. Very little weight could be given to evidence of alleged symptoms presented through the psychologist's report only: R v Qutami (2001) 127A Crim R 369 at 377, 380; R v Palu (2002) 134 A Crim R 174 at 184-185. 
     
      
    66 In my view, it could not be suggested in this case that the actions of Mr Mahara were unreasonable. He was acting in the discharge of his duties as a security officer. He was confronted by the Appellant and two other men armed with crow bars or jemmies who had just broken into business premises. Mr Mahara was alone in a country town before dawn. The discharge of his firearm on the first occasion had not led to the surrender of the three men nor their retreat. Consistent with the jury’s verdict, the Appellant brandished a weapon towards Mr Mahara with the intent of avoiding arrest by him. In this context, he fired his gun a second time. Thirteen bullets remained in the firearm. As the Crown pointed out, Mr Mahara restrained himself from any further discharge of the firearm. 
     
      
    67 In the circumstances of this case, I am not satisfied that the injury sustained by the Appellant was such as ought to have led to a discount in sentence by way of extra-curial punishment. Apart from hospitalisation for four days, there was no reliable evidence of any disability resulting from the injury. The injury sustained by the Appellant as a result of the gun shot involved a passing physical injury with a suggestion, unsupported by any satisfactory evidentiary foundation, of post-traumatic stress disorder (which condition appears to relate principally to the Appellant’s incarceration). Even if these circumstances attracted the extra-curial punishment principle, this evidence would provide very little assistance to the Appellant on sentence. I am not satisfied that this ground has been established. 
     
      
       
      Ground (5) - The Sentence Imposed was Manifestly Excessive  
       
      
    68 Mr Stratton SC submitted that the sentence imposed for the s.33B(2) offence was manifestly excessive. This was especially so, it was submitted, when appropriate credit was given to the Appellant for the matters touched upon in Grounds (3) and (4) above. 
     
      
    69 The Crown submitted that the sentence was not manifestly excessive having regard to the maximum penalty prescribed by law and the circumstances of the particular offence and of the offender.  
     
      
    70 This Court has observed that offences against s.33B are to be regarded extremely seriously: R v Hamilton (1993) 66 A Crim R 575 at 581; R v Barton (2001) 121 A Crim R 185 at 191. These observations have been made in the context of s.33B offences committed against police officers. In Hamilton, Gleeson CJ observed at 581 that it was incumbent upon the Court in dealing with offences of this nature to show an appropriate measure of support for police officers who undertake a difficult, dangerous and usually thankless task.  
     
      
    71 In the present case, the s.33B offence was committed against a security officer who was attempting, in the discharge of his duties, to effect the lawful apprehension of the Appellant and his co-offenders. Of course, s.33B is not confined to apprehension by police officers. The security officer in this case was in uniform and was driving a marked vehicle. From his words and conduct, it was apparent to the Appellant that Mr Mahara was seeking to exercise his lawful functions with respect to persons who had been caught in the act of committing a serious crime. In my view, the serious approach adopted by the courts with respect to s.33B offences committed against police officers extends to such offences committed against security officers in the exercise of their lawful duties.  
     
      
    72 General deterrence must play a significant role in the sentencing of offenders for offences contrary to s.33B: R v Perez (NSWCCA, Gleeson CJ, Kirby P and Campbell J, 11 December 1991, BC9101351 at page 21). 
     
      
    73 The Appellant was convicted of the aggravated offence under s.33B(2) given that the offence was committed in company and thus the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 15 years. In my opinion, the imposition of a term of imprisonment of two years with a non-parole period of 18 months was well within the available range of sentence having regard to the circumstances of the offence and the offender.  
     
      
    74 I would reach the same conclusion even if the Appellant had demonstrated error in any or each of the ways complained of in Grounds (1) to (4) concerning sentence. I am not satisfied that any lesser sentence is warranted and should have been passed: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    75 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (a) the appeal against conviction is dismissed; 
       
       
      (b) leave to appeal against sentence is allowed, but the appeal is dismissed. 
       
      
    76 LATHAM J: I agree with Johnson J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: The appellant was convicted of two counts of aggravated sexual assault in company and two counts of aggravated sexual assault after a trial by jury. The Crown relied on a joint criminal enterprise between the appellant and the co-offender John Carroll, in relation to each of the counts of sexual assault. The appellant had also been charged with one count of kidnapping under s 90A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (the Crimes Act). The jury was unable to reach a verdict in respect of that count, which was count 1 on the indictment.  
     
      
    2 The two counts of aggravated sexual assault in company, which were counts 2 and 3 on the indictment, were charged under s 61JA of the Crimes Act. A person convicted under s 61JA is liable to imprisonment for life. However, a lesser sentence is authorised by the operation of s 21 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). The Crown case in respect of counts 2 and 3 was that the appellant had forced the complainant to perform fellatio upon him. The aggravating circumstance in relation to count 2 was a threat by Carroll to inflict actual bodily harm upon the claimant with an offensive weapon, namely an electrical drill, which was described as an ""impact"" or ""industrial"" drill.  
     
      
    3 The aggravating circumstance in relation to count 3 was the malicious infliction of actual bodily harm by Carroll, in punching the complainant in the face.  
     
      
    4 Counts 4 and 5 were charged under the provisions of s 61J of the Crimes Act, being counts of aggravated sexual assault. A person convicted under s 61J is liable to imprisonment for 20 years. It was the Crown's case in respect of count 4 that the complainant was forced to perform fellatio on Carroll and in count 5 that Carroll had penile-vaginal intercourse with the complainant. The aggravating circumstance in relation to those two counts was that they were each were committed ""in company"".  
     
      
       
      Background facts 
       
      
    5 The complainant was working as a prostitute on Canterbury Road, Bankstown on the evening of 20 October 2001 and into the early hours of 21 October 2001. At about 1.30am on 21 October she was approached by the appellant and Carroll who were in a van, the appellant being the driver. There was a discussion between Carroll and the complainant about her prices and he handed her $100.00. He told her to get into the van through the back sliding door, which she then did. The complainant told Carroll that she had her own place and preferred to go there. Carroll said they wanted to go back to their place. The complainant explained that she only worked at home and when Carroll again indicated that they would go back to their place, the complainant asked them to stop the van, as she did not feel safe. Carroll then handled her roughly, pushing her down onto the floor of the van. 
     
      
    6 The appellant drove to an industrial area. He opened the door of the van and Carroll grabbed the complainant by the wrist and pulled her out of the van in an aggressive manner. The appellant walked up a flight of stairs to a unit above a workshop and the complainant followed, with Carroll behind her, holding her hand halfway up her back.  
     
      
    7 The appellant opened the door of the unit, and the three went inside. Carroll threw the complainant onto to the lounge and she hit her chest on the wooden arm. At that time, Carroll said something to the effect, ""I know I’m going to have some real fun"", and that he was going to have anal intercourse with the complainant. The appellant then sat in an armchair and was dozing off. Carroll then punched the complainant and dragged her into the bedroom, tying her hands behind her back with nylon rope. He threw her on the bed and had penile-vaginal intercourse with her (count 5). The door of the bedroom was open and the complainant could see the appellant still in the armchair. The appellant, in a statement to police dated 24 October 2001, said that he went into the bedroom and observed that the complainant was giving Carroll oral sex. This was count 4 in the indictment.  
     
      
    8 Count 2 in the indictment related to an act of oral sex performed on the appellant when the appellant grabbed the complainant by the head and pushed her head down. At that stage, her hands were still tied, but it appears that at some stage the appellant loosened the rope. It was during this period that Carroll came into the room with an industrial drill. He plugged the drill into the wall and put it against the complainant's head. He turned the drill on and he told her he was going to put it through her skull. This occurred whilst the complainant was performing oral sex on the appellant.  
     
      
    9 There was other aggressive conduct engaged in by Carroll towards the complainant, including cutting her jacket up with a knife, which was about 300mm long. He also threatened to chop her up, wrap her in plastic and dump her in the Blue Mountains. The appellant was lying on the bed in the room with her when these things were being said and did nothing.  
     
      
    10 The offence being count 3 on the indictment occurred after the complainant had been to the toilet and when, on her return, Carroll tied a noose around her neck, tying the end of the rope to a pole which was hanging out of the wall. Whilst the noose was around her neck, the appellant forced the complainant to perform oral sex on him. It appears that the complainant was begging to be taken home for about 20 minutes, during which at some stage the noose was taken off. Eventually, the appellant agreed to take the complainant home. 
     
      
    11 The appellant was arrested at his home on 22 October 2001. During the record of interview, the appellant said that Carroll had ripped the complainant's jacket. However, he said he only knew Carroll as an acquaintance and only by the name ""John"". That was not correct. The appellant also denied witnessing an incident involving the drill. He otherwise admitted other aspects of the incident, including the fact that the complainant had been tied up with a rope. During the search of the appellant's premises, the police took possession of a drill, the remnants of the complainant's black jacket, and three separate lots of rope.  
     
      
    12 In a statement provided to police on 24 October 2001, the appellant made a statement regarding evidence that he would be prepared to give against Carroll. In that statement, he admitted knowing the co-offender for some three years, and also admitted to seeing Carroll hold the drill to the complainant's head. He denied, however, that the drill was ever turned on.  
     
      
    13 The appellant appeals against his conviction and also seeks leave to appeal against sentence.  
     
      
       
      Appeal against conviction 
       
      
    14 The appellant has raised two grounds on his appeal against conviction. First, he contends that the trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury as to the particular counts upon which they may apply the alleged 'lie' said to give rise to a consciousness of guilt. The lie was his denial in the record of interview that he had seen Carroll produce a drill in the course of the sexual activity. 
     
      
    15 Secondly, the appellant contended that the trial judge had erred in failing to direct the jury as to the doctrine of extended joint criminal enterprise when directing them as to the features of aggravation in respect of counts 2 and 3.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1: failure to give proper direction in relation to the lie 
       
      
    16 The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury as to the particular count or counts upon which they could apply the alleged lie said to give rise to a consciousness of guilt.  
     
      
    17 The lie upon which the Crown relied arose from the appellant's answer in an electronically recorded record of interview on 22 October 2001, in which he denied any incident involving the drill. 
     
      
    18 His Honour referred to the question of lies early in his summing-up to the jury. His Honour correctly directed the jury as to how a lie could indicate a consciousness of guilt. His Honour also distinguished between two lies told by the appellant in his record of interview, the lie relating to the extent of his acquaintanceship with the co-accused, and the lie in relation to the drill. His Honour pointed out that people lie for many reasons and that innocent people lie, including to the police. His Honour directed the jury that it was therefore necessary that lies told to an investigating officer: 
     
      
       
        
        ""…must be demonstrated by the Crown as being told for the sole purpose of deflecting the police investigation if they are to be used to demonstrate a consciousness of guilt. 
         
         
        There are four matters which the Crown must demonstrate to your satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt, before you can regard a lie, and there is only one that the Crown points to in this case, as being told in the consciousness of guilt. Firstly, that assertion must be contrary to the truth. Secondly, it must be deliberate. Thirdly, it must relate to a material issue, one that is important to the case, and fourthly, it must be told solely from the motive of the realisation of guilt and the fear of truth emerging in relation to the offence. Only when there can be no other reason to tell lies, but to stop the truth emerging, because of the realisation of guilt, can you use that lie as demonstrating the consciousness of guilt."" 
        
       
      
    19 The appellant recognises that these directions were correct: see Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193 at 210-211. He contends, however, that the trial judge did not direct how, that is, in respect of what offence, the jury might use the lie alleged as consciousness of guilt. It was submitted that this failure amounted to a misdirection which caused a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    20 The Crown submitted that the lie in relation to the drill not only related to the offence charged in count 2, being the very matter of aggravation in relation to that offence, but was also relevant to whether the complainant consented to the acts of sexual intercourse that were charged against the appellant and also to whether the appellant knew that the complainant was not consenting. The Crown submitted, therefore, that the lie was relevant to each of the offences and that no further direction on the part of his Honour was called for. 
     
      
    21 In my opinion, this submission is correct. The appellant does not complain that his Honour failed to give a direction that the lie was relied upon as a consciousness of guilt in relation to all of the offences. Perhaps it would have been better had that been clarified. But in any event, the appellants counsel at trial did not seek a redirection on this point. Thus, leave is required pursuant to the provisions of r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules before that matter can be raised. Before the Court will grant leave under r 4, it needs to be satisfied that the appellant has an arguable case that there was an error of law on the part of the trial judge or that the conviction was otherwise a miscarriage of justice: see Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 per McHugh J at 319. 
     
      
    22 For the reasons I have given there was no error of law, nor was there otherwise a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, I would dismiss this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: failure to direct the jury as to the doctrine of extended common purpose 
       
      
    23 The appellant complained that at no time during the trial did the Crown produce evidence of an agreement between him and Carroll to sexually assault or harm the complainant. He said that there was no evidence to support a view that there had been any planning, that there was no dispute that the appellant and Carroll had engaged the complainant in an act of prostitution and that she had consensually entered the vehicle for the purposes of being driven to the premises where sex was to take place. He further submitted that the jury ""in their finding of not guilty on count 1"" agreed with the appellant's proposition that he was unaware of any physical restraint in the vehicle or whilst entering the premises.  
     
      
    24 The appellant submitted that those circumstances made it imperative for the trial judge to direct the jury very carefully. In particular, he submitted that the jury should have been given directions based upon the factual example given in R v Lowery and King (No 2) [1972] VR 560. (In R v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545 Hunt CJ at CL had said that Lowery provided a good example to use when directing a jury on a charge of joint criminal enterprise.)  
     
      
    25 I will return to the trial judge’s directions to the jury shortly. Before doing so, there are a number of factual errors in this part of the appellant’s submission that ought to be dealt with immediately. In the first place, the jury did not bring in a not guilty verdict in respect of count 1. Rather, the jury was not able to reach a verdict. Secondly, there is no basis for the assertion that there was no dispute that the complainant agreed to enter the vehicle for the purposes of being driven to premises where sex was to take place. The complainant's evidence was that she requested to be driven to her place and that she did not agree to go to the appellant's premises. The fact that the jury was not able to agree upon a verdict in respect of count 1 does not establish that the complainant agreed to be taken to the premises where she was assaulted, or that the appellant was unaware of any physical restraint upon the complainant in the vehicle or whilst entering the premises.  
     
      
    26 The appellant’s particular complaint on this ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury as to the doctrine of extended joint criminal enterprise, when directing them as to the features of aggravation in respect of counts 2 and 3. It will be remembered that counts 2 and 3 related to the acts of fellatio which the appellant forced the complainant to perform upon him and that the aggravating circumstance in relation to count 2 was the threat by Carroll to inflict actual bodily harm with the drill, and the aggravating circumstance in relation to count 3 was the infliction of actual bodily harm by Carroll punching the complainant in the face.  
     
      
    27 The appellant contended that the trial judge should have directed the jury that to find him guilty in respect of counts 2 and 3, they needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant contemplated the possibility that, in the event that they accepted beyond a reasonable doubt that an agreement existed to sexually assault the complainant, that in this context, Carroll may have produced the drill (count 2) and may have committed an assault (count 3). It was submitted that his Honour erred in failing to give a direction in accordance with the extended definition of the doctrine of joint criminal enterprise cited by Hunt CJ at CL in Tangye.  See also McAuliffe v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 108.  
     
      
    28 The facts in Tangye are themselves useful in understanding what is comprised in a joint criminal enterprise. In that case, the Crown relied upon the fact that a large group of men moved around a smaller group and commenced assaulting the men in the smaller group. Hunt CJ at CL pointed out, at 558, that the fact that they were all present together, doing the acts at the same time, indicated: 
     
      
       
        
        ""that there was an understanding amounting to an agreement between them that they would strike (or assault) the members of that small group"".  
        
       
      
    29 His Honour said that those who had previously been in the larger group had no doubt come to that understanding at the time they ran towards the smaller group and began to fight them. In Tangye, the Crown was not able to establish that the appellant was in the larger group at that time. However, it was established that he had joined the group and commenced punching one of the victims at the same time as another victim was being punched. His Honour said (at 558): 
     
      
       
        
        ""There could have been no doubt in this case that what had been agreed was to engage in a street fight with the smaller group, the only issue being whether the appellant was participating in that joint criminal enterprise"". 
        
       
      
    30 Hunt CJ at CL continued: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Thus, although the appellant did not himself physically inflict grievous bodily harm upon Grant [the second victim referred to above], he was at that time participating in the joint criminal enterprise to strike or assault the members of the smaller group. He was – by his presence, knowing that others were similarly being assaulted by others, and assisting by assaulting one of the men in the group himself – equally guilty of the attack upon Grant even though he did not physically attack him himself"". 
        
       
      
    31 In Tangye, Hunt CJ at CL pointedly distinguished between a straightforward joint criminal enterprise and the extended concept of joint criminal enterprise based upon common purpose. His Honour pointed out at 556-557 that the Crown needs to rely upon the extended concept of joint criminal enterprise based upon common purpose only where the offence charged is not the same as the enterprise agreed. His Honour then indicated the direction that needed to be given where a straightforward joint criminal enterprise was concerned. His Honour said those directions should be along the following lines: 
     
      
       
        
        ""(1) The law is that, where two or more persons carry out a joint criminal enterprise, each is responsible for the acts of the other or others in carrying out that enterprise. The Crown must establish both the existence of that joint criminal enterprise and the participation in it by the accused.  
         
         
        (2) A joint criminal enterprise exists where two or more persons reach an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between them that they will commit a crime. The understanding or arrangement need not be express, and its existence may be inferred from all the circumstances. It need not have been reached at any time before the crime is committed.  
        The circumstances in which two or more persons are participating together in the commission of a particular crime may themselves establish an unspoken understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement formed between them then and there to commit that crime 
        .  
         
         
        (3) A person participates in that joint criminal enterprise either by committing the agreed crime itself or simply by being present at the time when the crime is committed, and (with knowledge that the crime is to be or is being committed) by intentionally assisting or encouraging another participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit that crime. The presence of that person at the time when the crime is committed and a readiness to give aid if required is sufficient to amount to an encouragement to the other participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit the crime.  
         
         
        (4) If the agreed crime is committed by one or other of the participants in that joint criminal enterprise, all of the participants in that enterprise are equally guilty of the crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission."" (Emphasis added; footnote omitted) 
        
       
      
    32 The directions suggested by Hunt CJ at CL were based upon the High Court's decision in McAuliffe. These directions were also endorsed by McHugh J in Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 316 at 341-343; [1998] HCA 75 at [70]-[73]. In that case, McHugh J referred to the category of a person being a principal in the first degree, being the person who commits the act which forms the whole or part of the actus reus of a crime, and persons who are liable as accessories before the fact, being those who aid the commission of a crime and whose liability is derivative. His Honour then referred to the category of joint criminal enterprise. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""72 … where a person was not only present at the scene with the person who committed the acts alleged to constitute the crime but was there by reason of a pre-concert or agreement with that person to commit the crime … the liability of each person present as the result of the concert is not derivative but primary. He or she is a principal in the first degree. In that category each of the persons acting in concert is equally responsible  
        for the acts 
         of the other or others."" (Footnotes omitted) 
        
       
      
    33 His Honour indicated that it was advisable in explaining a joint criminal enterprise to give to the jury an example of facts that involved different circumstances than the enterprise relevant to the matters with which the accused has been charged. His Honour indicated that, in the case of a spontaneous type of joint criminal enterprise, that is, one which in effect arises coincidentally when the accused person joins in the criminal activity spontaneously, an appropriate example is one based upon the decision of the Victorian Supreme Court in Lowery. 
     
      
    34 The direction in Lowery was: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[T]hree men are driving along at night and they see a house in darkness with a lot of newspapers and milk bottles at the gate and one says to the others: ‘That looks as if it would do.’ The car pulls up, two of the men get out, and one of them stays in the car behind the driving wheel with the engine running. The other two go to the front door and there one of them breaks a glass panel beside the door, puts his hand through and unlatches the door and throws it open. The third man goes inside and collects valuables and comes out while the man who opened the door goes back to the gate to keep watch, and never enters the house at all. Now in law each of those three men can be found guilty of the crime of house-breaking, the elements of which are breaking, entering and stealing, yet obviously the man who sat throughout behind the driving wheel outside ready to drive the other two away when they had got the goods did not break anything, and he did not enter anything, and he did not with his own hands steal anything, and the man who broke the glass never touched the goods. But in law if a jury is satisfied that the three were acting in concert under an understanding that they had reached - communicated between them more by actions than by words - an understanding under which, between them, they were to commit this house-breaking, then in law they are all guilty of the offence and it does not matter which part each played in the commission of the offence. You can imagine that cases can often arise in which, in circumstances such as I have described, the Crown is not able to prove which man did which act. It may not even be able to prove which was the man behind the wheel. Now that is an illustration of the operation of this doctrine of acting in concert.” 
        
       
      
    35 In his summing up, the trial judge said to the jury that he was sure that they would understand from the addresses that the doctrine of joint criminal enterprise was relied upon. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""When several persons set out to commit a criminal offence, although they may play separate parts, each is responsible for the actions or utterances of the other, made in furtherance of the common criminal design."" 
        
       
       
      His Honour then gave an example based upon  
      Lowery 
      . His Honour continued: 
       
       
        
        ""But as counsel has said to you, mere presence is not enough to bring this doctrine … into play.  
        There must be an agreement 
        . Now, there is no need for formality. Burglars acting in concert rarely go to a solicitor and have a deed of agreement drawn up. It might even be that none speaks to the other. They all three understand that they are out on a job that night. Merely the one saying, 'That place, that is the one', would be sufficient under certain circumstances for all of them to be caught by common purpose. So, although mere presence is not enough and there must be a prior agreement, that agreement need not be formally spoken and certainly not formally written."" 
        
       
       
      His Honour referred to the circumstances upon which the Crown relied, including the conduct within the unit, and the appellant's "" 
      inaction in the face of assaults 
      "", so that the common purpose was to have sexual intercourse with the complainant and at the same time to inflict physical injury upon her and to threaten her. 
       
      
    36 In this case, in both counts 2 and 3, the appellant was engaging in a sexual assault upon the complainant. At the same time, his co-offender was physically assaulting and/or threatening her. In my opinion, that was evidence of a joint criminal enterprise as explained by Hunt CJ at CL, set out at [30] above. In short, the appellant and his co-offender “participating together in the commission of a particular crime”, which was sufficient to “establish an unspoken understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement formed between them then and there to commit that crime”. It is apparent from the jury’s verdict of guilty that they accepted that to be the case.  
     
      
    37 Accordingly, his Honour correctly directed the jury on joint criminal enterprise. His Honour did not err in failing to direct the jury on the meaning of extended joint criminal enterprise as it was not relevant to do so. Indeed, in Tangye, his Honour indicated that it would have been confusing to have directed the jury on the extended definition of the doctrine of joint criminal enterprise based upon common purpose.  
     
      
    38 In addition, trial counsel for the appellant did not seek any further direction by the judge. Accordingly, leave is also required to raise this ground of appeal: see Criminal Appeal Rules, r 4. For the reasons I have given I would refuse leave.  
     
      
    39 Even if leave was granted, either in respect of this ground or the first ground, I do not consider that the appellant had an arguable case on either ground of appeal. There was no wrong decision on any question of law nor any miscarriage of justice such as to warrant allowing the appeal: see s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). 
     
      
       
      Extension of time 
       
      
    40 That leaves one other matter for consideration, namely, whether the appellant should be given an extension of time within which to appeal. 
     
      
    41 The appellant was found guilty on 13 November 2002 and was sentenced on 26 November 2002. On 26 March 2004, he filed a notice of intention to appeal, which, after being given an extension of time, expired on 31 December 2004. The appellant's notice of appeal dated 10 January 2006 and his notice of application for extension of time dated 28 March 2006, were filed in this Court on 5 April 2006.  
     
      
    42 The Crown submits that time ought not to be extended, there being no evidence to support the application for extension of time. This was raised with the appellant during the course of the hearing. The appellant indicated that he had not appealed within time because he was not aware that he could do so and only subsequently ascertained that he could, as a result of information he obtained whilst in custody. 
     
      
    43 That may explain the appellant's initial failure to appeal within time. However, according to the Crown, an extension of time has previously been granted and that in itself was not complied with. This second application therefore is a further one year and ten days out of time from the time previously extended, and in all the application is just over three years out of time. The time taken for the appellant to bring his matter before the Court is such that usually I would consider it to be sufficient of itself to refuse the application. However, as the Court has heard the argument on the appeal I would extend the time until 5 April 2006 but dismiss the appeal.  
     
      
       
      Application for leave to appeal against sentence 
       
      
    44 The trial judge sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for seven years commencing on 13 November 2002 and expiring on 12 November 2009, and set a non-parole period of four years to commence on 13 November 2002 and to expire on 12 November 2006 in respect of each offence. His Honour ordered that the sentences be served concurrently. His Honour indicated that he would have sentenced the prisoner to ten years' imprisonment, but reduced that sentence by three years for his co-operation in that he had agreed to give evidence against the co-accused Carroll.  
     
      
    45 His Honour stated that he broke the ""statutory nexus of 75 per cent of the non-parole period"" because of the appellant's previous good character, his age, the fact that this was his first time in custody and because he was giving evidence on behalf of the Crown and was likely to serve the greater part of the sentence under protection.  
     
      
    46 His Honour had regard to the matters that he was required to consider under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. He considered the case was one of the worst of its type, but recorded, as the Crown conceded, that the appellant played a lesser part. His Honour referred to the lack of contrition, the need for deterrence, both personal and general, and the need for adequate punishment. His Honour, however, considered that there were good prospects of rehabilitation.  
     
      
    47 His Honour also observed that the legislature had seen fit to increase the penalty for offences under s 61JA to life imprisonment, and noted the observations of Gleeson CJ in Regina v Tomi Petteri Hartikainen (NSWCCA, unreported, 8 June 1993), that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Those amendments manifested an intention on the part of parliament substantially to increase the penalties attached to certain sexual offence. This action of parliament must be taken by the courts to have reflected community standards. It is incumbent upon the courts to give effect to the concerns manifested by parliament"". 
        
       
      
    48 The appellant does not point to any particular error in the sentencing process. Rather, he claims that the sentence is manifestly excessive, which, if established, is itself indicative of error.  
     
      
    49 Pursuant to s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) the Court may only quash a sentence if some other sentence is warranted in law. In R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704; [2001] NSWCCA 534, Spigelman CJ stressed at [79] that unless the Court forms a positive opinion that some other sentence is warranted, then:  
     
      
       
        
        “… the essential pre-condition for the exercise of the power to ‘quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor’ is not satisfied”.  
        
       
       
      Sully J also drew attention to this requirement at [100], noting that: 
       
       
        
        “[e]rror once demonstrated, it does not follow automatically that this Court will, without more, intervene in fact and resentence … [the Court must first] be persuaded … that some other sentence is ‘warranted in law’”. 
        
       
      
    50 In my opinion, the sentences were within an appropriate discretionary range and I can only record my agreement with his Honour’s observation that this case was one of the worst type. If anything, the sentences in respect of the s 61JA offences might be considered to be lenient. The Crown submitted that by ordering that the sentences be served concurrently, his Honour in effect contravened the principle in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610; [1998] HCA 57 at [45], and that his Honour failed to properly take into account the total criminality of the offences. There is no Crown appeal, and as I understand it, these submissions are made to emphasise that rather than being excessive, the sentences are lenient. I have already expressed my view that that is so.  
     
      
    51 In my opinion, nothing has been shown to indicate in this case that lesser sentences were warranted in law and should have been imposed.  
     
      
    52 The appellant needed both an extension of time to bring the application for leave to appeal and leave to appeal. For the reasons I have expressed I would extend the time in which to bring the application for leave to appeal. I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal.  
     
      
    53 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Extend the time within which to file a notice of appeal and an application for leave to appeal to 5 April 2006; 
       
       
      2. Appeal against conviction dismissed; 
       
       
      3. Leave to appeal against sentences granted; 
       
       
      4. Appeal against sentences dismissed. 
       
      
    54 Hulme J: I agree with Beazley JA. 
     
      
    55 Hislop J: I agree with Beazley JA.

     Jamal CHARARA v THE QUEEN 
    Sections 18 and 19 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 provide:18 Appeals against conviction to be by way of rehearing on the transcripts of evidence 
     
      
    (1) An appeal against conviction is to be by way of rehearing on the basis of certified transcripts of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings, except as provided by section 19. 
     
      
    (2) Fresh evidence may be given, but only by leave of the District Court which may be granted only if the Court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that the fresh evidence be given. 
     
      
    (3) The parties to an appeal are each entitled to be provided with one free copy of the certified transcripts of evidence relevant to the appeal and, if fresh evidence is given, one free copy of the transcript of the fresh evidence. 
     
      
    19 Circumstances in which evidence to be given in person 
     
      
    (1) The District Court may direct a person to attend and give evidence in proceedings on an appeal against conviction if it is satisfied:  
     
      
       
      (a) in the case of an appeal that relates to an offence involving violence against that person, that there are special reasons why, in the interests of justice, the person should attend and give evidence, or 
       
       
      (b) in any other case, that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the person should attend and give evidence. 
       
      
    (2) An application for such a direction may be made by a party to the proceedings in relation to a particular person only if notice of the party’s intention to make such an application has been served on each other party to the proceedings within such period as the District Court may direct. 
     
      
    (3) If an application for such a direction is refused, the District Court must give reasons for the refusal. 
     
      
    (4) A direction may be withdrawn only on the application, or with the consent, of the appellant. 
     
      
    (5) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the determination of special or substantial reasons for the purposes of subsection (1). 
     
      
    (6) Without limiting subsection (5), in determining whether special or substantial reasons exist, the District Court must have regard to whether or not the appellant was legally represented for the whole or any part of the original Local Court proceedings.” 
     
      
    HELD:(1) (Per Mason P, Kirby J and Hoeben J agreeing) An appeal under s 18 is a rehearing on the certified transcripts of evidence, obviously as supplemented by reference to exhibits tendered in the Local Court, and not an appeal de novo. ([14]-[16])Gianoutsas v Glykis [2006] NSWCCA 137 at [24]-[31], followed.(2) Principles governing appeals from judges sitting without a jury apply; the appellate judge is to form his or her own judgment of the facts while recognising the advantage enjoyed by the magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses called in the lower court and observing the natural limitations stemming from proceeding wholly or substantially on the transcript record. ([17]-[22])Bell v Stewart (1920) 28 CLR 419 at 424-425; Fox v Percy (2003) 214 CLR 118; Da Costa v Cockburn Salvage and Trading Pty Ltd (1970) 124 CLR 192 at 208-209, followed.(3) Whilst the magistrate’s reasons are certainly not part of the certified transcripts of evidence referred to in s 18(1), recourse may be had to them since the appellate function could not properly take place without reference to them. ([23]-[24])(4) A judge in such an appeal may call a witness of his or her own motion only in highly exceptional circumstances, subject to the judge being satisfied it was in the interests of justice to do so. ([26])The Queen v Apostolides (1984) 154 CLR 563, applied.(5) Section 19 addresses the oral testimony of individual witnesses only if the prior mandates of s 18 have been met; consideration occurs on a witness-by-witness basis and not en bloc. ([27])ORDERS: Answer to case stated in the affirmative. Orders made by District Court quashed. Proceedings remitted to District Court.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 MASON P: A case stated by His Honour Judge Delaney comes to this Court pursuant to s5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    2 On 1 April 2005 police stopped the appellant and indicated that a road side speed device had checked his speed at 107km per hour in a 70km per hour stretch of roadway. The appellant was issued with a traffic infringement notice. The appellant was convicted and sentenced on 4 August 2005 after a hearing in the Local Court.  
     
      
    3 The appellant exercised his right of appeal to the District Court, stating as his ground of appeal (cf Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (the Act), s14 (2)): 
     
      
       
        
        ""BECAUSE I AM NOT GUILTY"". 
        
       
      
    4 The matter came before Judge Delaney for mention on 18 August 2005. His Honour set the appeal down for hearing before himself and directed that it was to proceed by way of the witnesses giving evidence before him.  
     
      
    5 The subsequent hearing before his Honour resulted in orders confirming the conviction, fine and licence suspension imposed in the Local Court.  
     
      
    6 The transcripts of the mention and appeal proceedings were placed before us, without objection. I have had regard to them only for the purpose of confirming my understanding of the facts stated by his Honour in the Case Stated with reference to the scope of the orders and procedure summarised therein. The judge records the following: 
     
      
       
        
        (f) I set the matter down for hearing before me and directed that the appeal was to proceed by way of the witnesses giving evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        (g) At the time I gave the direction there was no application by either the Appellant or the Respondent Director of Public Prosecutions for a direction pursuant to the provisions of section 19 of the Act. 
        
       
       
        
        (h) I heard the appeal by witnesses giving evidence before me. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    7 The transcripts confirm that (f) is to be understood as a direction that any testimonial evidence in the appeal would be received in the District Court by the calling of oral testimony in that Court, whether or not the witness had already given evidence in the Local Court and to the exclusion of any transcript of the witness’s testimony in the Local Court. (Liberty to apply was reserved to the Crown if it had a “problem with” its witnesses.)  
     
      
    8 The transcript of the appeal in the District Court further confirms that (h) is to be understood as indicating that the appeal was heard and decided by his Honour on the basis of his assessment of the totality of the evidence given before him. That evidence included the testimony of the main Crown witness who was called afresh in the District Court, as well as the testimony of the appellant himself, who elected to give evidence in the District Court, not having done so in the Local Court. 
     
      
    9 The Case Stated poses the issues as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        3. APPELLANT’S CONTENTIONS 
        
       
       
        
        The appellant contends: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          a. my direction made on 18 August 2005 and my proceeding to hear the matter by way of witnesses giving evidence before me was erroneous in point of law 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        On the ground that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          a. I made the direction when there was no application before me pursuant to the provisions of section 19 of the Act. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
        4. QUESTION OF LAW 
        
       
       
        
        The question to be determined by the Court is: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          a. Did I err in law when I directed that the appeal was to proceed by way of the witnesses giving evidence at a time when there was no application by either the Appellant or the Respondent Director of Public Prosecutions for a direction pursuant to the provisions of section 19 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001. 
          
         
         
        
       
      
    10 Sections 18 and 19 of the Act provide: 
     
      
       
        
        18 Appeals against conviction to be by way of rehearing on the transcripts of evidence 
        
       
       
        
        (1) An appeal against conviction is to be by way of rehearing on the basis of certified transcripts of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings, except as provided by section 19. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Fresh evidence may be given, but only by leave of the District Court which may be granted only if the Court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that the fresh evidence be given. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The parties to an appeal are each entitled to be provided with one free copy of the certified transcripts of evidence relevant to the appeal and, if fresh evidence is given, one free copy of the transcript of the fresh evidence. 
         
         
        19 Circumstances in which evidence to be given in person 
        
       
       
        
        (1) The District Court may direct a person to attend and give evidence in proceedings on an appeal against conviction if it is satisfied:  
         
          
          (a) in the case of an appeal that relates to an offence involving violence against that person, that there are special reasons why, in the interests of justice, the person should attend and give evidence, or 
           
          (b) in any other case, that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the person should attend and give evidence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) An application for such a direction may be made by a party to the proceedings in relation to a particular person only if notice of the party’s intention to make such an application has been served on each other party to the proceedings within such period as the District Court may direct. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) If an application for such a direction is refused, the District Court must give reasons for the refusal. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) A direction may be withdrawn only on the application, or with the consent, of the appellant. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the determination of special or substantial reasons for the purposes of subsection (1). 
        
       
       
        
        (6) Without limiting subsection (5), in determining whether special or substantial reasons exist, the District Court must have regard to whether or not the appellant was legally represented for the whole or any part of the original Local Court proceedings. 
         
        
       
      
    11 ""Fresh evidence"" in relation to such appeal proceedings is defined in s3 of the Act to mean ""evidence in addition to or in substitution for the evidence given in the proceedings from which the appeal proceedings have arisen"". 
     
      
    12 Sections 18 and 19 substantially reenact ss132-133 of the Justices Act 1902, provisions inserted by the Justices Legislation Amendment (Appeals) Act 1998. The Attorney-General’s speech upon the second reading of the Bill for that Act explained the policy behind the repeal of the old law relating to “all grounds” appeals to the District Court which involved “a full de novo hearing before the District Court requiring the court to rehear all the available evidence in relation to the matter” (New South Wales Parliamentary Debates, Legislative Council, 17 September 1998, p7595). The Bill arose out of concern about the amount of time the District Court was having to allocate to the hearing of appeals from decisions of Magistrates. There was also concern that, because of the delay in dealing with all-ground appeals, by the time they were heard the prosecution often had trouble obtaining the witnesses to reappear and give evidence again before the District Court. 
     
      
    13 The Attorney explained that the government had therefore decided to limit appeals to the District Court to a rehearing on the depositions of the Local Court, with provision for fresh evidence to be given by leave. (This policy was embodied in the provision now found in s18.) However, the Law Society and the Bar Association had argued that parties to appeal proceedings should continue to be able to recall witnesses on appeal who earlier gave evidence before the Local Court. Accordingly, the predecessor of s19 (ie s133 of the Justices Act) was inserted “to permit the parties to recall witnesses who gave evidence in the earlier proceedings before the Local Court if similar criteria to those set out in section 48E of the Justices Act, which applies in relation to the calling of witnesses in committal hearings, can be satisfied. (Section 48E has its present counterparts in ss91 and 93 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.) 
     
      
    14 These reforms have altered the manner in which appeals from the Local Court to the District Court are to be conducted, apparently more significantly than may be generally appreciated. Before 1998, Part 5 Div 4 of the Justices Act 1902 allowed an appeal to the District Court against conviction. Section 126 of that Act permitted the deposition of any witness called and examined at the hearing before the justice to be read as evidence for either party at the hearing of the appeal if the other party consented or if certain prescribed conditions were fulfilled. Subject to those provisions, however, the evidence was taken afresh. The power of the District Court judge hearing an appeal under Div 4 of Pt 5 was set out in s125. The Court’s obligation was to determine the matter of the appeal afresh. 
     
      
    15 This “all grounds” appeal was often referred to as being by way of rehearing (see eg Sweeney v Fitzhardinge (1906) 4 CLR 716 at 728, 730), but always in a context explaining that the District Court (as successor to the Quarter Sessions) was obliged to hear the matter de novo. In R v Longshaw (1990) 20 NSWLR 554, Gleeson CJ (at 561) described Sweeney as holding that “the appeal was by way of re-hearing, in the widest sense of the term, that is to say a hearing de novo”. 
     
      
    16 Appeals to the District Court are no longer of this nature. Recently, in Gianoutsas v Glykis [2006] NSWCCA 137, this Court held that the clear language of s18 precludes the District Court from treating an appeal of this nature as a hearing de novo (see the reasoning of the Chief Judge at Common Law at [24]-[31]).  
     
      
    17 The appeal is to be by way of rehearing on the Local Court transcripts (s18(1)), obviously supplemented by reference to any exhibits tendered in the Local Court. Fresh evidence may be given by leave, subject to the District Court being satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that this should occur (s18(2).  
     
      
    18 The District Court is then required to apply the principles governing appeals from a judge sitting without a jury. The Judge is to form his or her own judgment of the facts so far as able to do so, ie recognising the advantage enjoyed by the magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses called in the lower court (Bell v Stewart (1920) 28 CLR 419 at 424-5, Paterson v Paterson (1953) 89 CLR 212, Fox v Percy (2003) 214 CLR 118).  
     
      
    19 The nature of an appeal “by way of rehearing” has been discussed in many cases. The procedure to be adopted, powers to be exercised and function to be performed must first be sought in the language of the particular statute. One thing, however, is clear. “The ‘rehearing’ does not involve a completely fresh hearing by the appellate court of all the evidence. That court proceeds on the basis of the record and any fresh evidence that, exceptionally, it admits” (Fox at 118[22] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ). Referring to the “requirements, and limitations, of such an appeal”, their Honours continued (at [23], footnotes omitted): 
     
      
       
        
        … On the one hand, the appellate court is obliged to “give the judgment which in its opinion ought to have been given in the first instance”. On the other, it must, of necessity, observe the “natural limitations” that exist in the case of any appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record. These limitations include the disadvantage that the appellate court has when compared with the trial judge in respect of the evaluation of witnesses’ credibility and of the “feeling” of a case which an appellate court, reading the transcript, cannot always fully share. Furthermore, the appellate court does not typically get taken to, or read, all of the evidence taken at the trial. Commonly, the trial judge therefore has advantages that derive from the obligation at trial to receive and consider the entirety of the evidence and the opportunity, normally over a longer interval, to reflect upon that evidence and to draw conclusions from it, viewed as a whole. 
        
       
       
      
    20 In Da Costa v Cockburn Salvage and Trading Pty Ltd (1970) 124 CLR 192 at 208-9 Windeyer J described the difference between an appeal by way of rehearing on the one hand and a retrial or hearing de novo on the other in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        The rule … provides that all appeals shall be ‘by way of rehearing’. This does not mean that the appeal is a complete rehearing as a new trial is. It means that the case is to be determined by the Full Court, its members considering for themselves the issues the trial judge had to determine and the effect of the evidence he heard as appearing on the record of the proceedings before him, but applying the law as it is when the appeal is heard not as it was when the trial occurred….[A power to draw inferences of fact and to give any judgment that ought to have been given] does not … curtail the recognition or respect that an appeal should accord to the decision of a trial judge. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    21 These principles apply equally to an appeal by way of rehearing in a criminal matter where the appeal court has not seen the witnesses (Bell, Barendse v Comptroller-General of Customs (1996) 93 A Crim R 210 at 219-220). 
     
      
    22 The appellate role of the District Court in the present context is further reinforced by the references to “appeal” in ss18 and 19 and by the power, conferred by s20, to determine the appeal against conviction by setting aside the conviction or by dismissing the appeal. It is true that the Court moves to the disposition of the appeal by considering the totality of the material before it, including any “fresh evidence” that has been admitted, and making up its own mind on the critical issue of guilt. The prosecutor continues to carry the onus (Gianoutsos at [42]-[43]). But, as indicated in the passages quoted from Fox and Da Costa, the District Court must of necessity observe the “natural limitations” stemming from proceeding wholly or substantially on the transcript record. 
     
      
    23 Howie and Johnson, Criminal Practice and Procedure NSW state [4-s 19.10(g)] that the reasons of the magistrate for finding the offence proved are not “evidence” and that the District Court may not have regard to those reasons unless the parties consent to that course. The point has not been argued before us, but I wish to express my doubts as to the correctness of this opinion of the learned authors. District Court judges traditionally and understandably refrained from reading the reasons of the Local Court when the appeal was do novo. But the nature of an appeal by way of rehearing on the transcript indicates to me that this approach is no longer justified. The magistrate’s reasons are not part of the “certified transcripts of evidence” referred to in s18(1) any more than the exhibits tendered in the Local Court. Nevertheless, as I see it, the District Court is impliedly directed to consider the reasons because the stated appellate function could not properly take place without reference to them.  
     
      
    24 The Local Court reasons will doubtless include an explanation why the conviction was entered at first instance, including an assessment of the credibility issues touching any factual dispute. Without reference to the reasons the District Court would be driven to speculation or deciding the issue entirely afresh. Neither such course would be consonant with the statutory scheme. In civil appeals, the court of appeal is not entitled to ignore the reasons in which findings based on credibility are to be found (Paterson at 222-4). There is no basis in principle for a different approach in the criminal law. 
     
      
    25 Judge Delaney embarked on a hearing de novo and the orders in the District Court confirming the appellant's conviction, fine and licence suspension proceed from this erroneous point of departure. For this reason alone, the question posed by his Honour must be answered in the affirmative. The appropriate order for this Court to make is that the orders made by the District Court are quashed and the matter remitted to that Court to be dealt with in accordance with the reasons of this Court. We have jurisdiction, if appropriate, to quash the conviction entered by the judge (see s5B(2) and Carcosa Pty Ltd v Czerwaniw (1997) 93 A Crim R 287). 
     
      
    26 The particular question of misapplication of s19, upon which the case stated focuses, points to additional but derivative aspects of the jurisdictional error into which His Honour fell. It is largely academic, when it is borne in mind that receiving any ""fresh evidence"" is exceptional (under s18(2)) and when the adversary principles discussed in The Queen v Apostolides (1984) 154 CLR 563 are kept in mind. It would only be in the rarest of cases that a judge should be considering calling a witness of his or her own motion in an appeal and this would only happen in light of what occurred in the appeal itself. Whether s18(2) permits the judge to give leave in those circumstances is an interesting question unlikely to happen very often. I am inclined to think that it would be open to do so, subject of course to the judge being satisfied that it was in the interests of justice for this to occur. But s18(2) is not available for the blanket trumping of s18(1). Subsection (2) is the exception rather than the rule, and the judge must turn his or her mind to the particular “fresh evidence” whose nature attracts the exceptional grant of leave. In light of Apostolides, this would have to take place in the context of an application by the party seeking to rely on “fresh evidence”, save in the highly exceptional situation where the judge decided to summon the “fresh evidence” on his or her own motion.  
     
      
    27 On the particular topic of s19, I think it sufficient to point out that that provision addresses the oral testimony of individual witnesses if and only if the prior mandates of s18 have been complied with. Section 19 also requires the judge to consider its separate requirements on a witness by witness basis. If, which I doubt but find it unnecessary to resolve, s19 allows a judge to give a direction of his or her own motion, it can only be done in accordance with the specific regime prescribed in the latter section. The section does not allow the overriding of the earlier section or permit treating all witnesses en bloc. Its gateways of “special reasons” and “substantial reasons” (s19(1)(a) and (b)) require even sharper attention to the interests of justice component than s18(2).  
     
      
    28 The Case Stated does not disclose whether s19(1)(b) was considered in its terms. I infer that it was not, given that the blanket direction about the appeal proceeding by way of the witnesses giving evidence was given when the case was first mentioned in the District Court. 
     
      
    29 The written submissions ranged over a somewhat different range of issues, but at the end of the hearing there was really no dispute but that the judge had erred and that orders should be made in the appellant's favour. Neither party suggested that it was appropriate for this Court to put itself in the position of the District Court and decide the appeal for itself on the Local Court transcript. No criticism is thereby implied. 
     
      
    30 Orders for quashing and remitter will enable the matter to be addressed afresh. I note that the appellant has indicated through his solicitor that he maintains the position that the appeal to the District Court should be determined on the certified transcript from the Local Court, without the calling of any “fresh” evidence. 
     
      
    31 I therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Answer the question: Yes, for the reasons given by the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
       
       
      2. Quash the orders made in the District Court. 
       
       
      3. Proceedings remitted to the District Court to be determined in accordance with the reasons of the Court of Criminal Appeal.

      SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 19 June 2006 Faheem Khalid Lodhi (“the offender”) was found guilty by a jury in respect of three of the four charges on which he had been indicted. The three charges were as follows. First on or about 3 October 2003 at Sydney, the offender collected documents, namely two maps of the Australian electricity supply system, which were connected with preparation for a terrorist act, namely bombing part of the system, knowing the said connection. 
     
      
    2 Secondly, a charge that the offender, on or about 10 October 2003 intentionally did an act in preparation for a terrorist act, namely he sought information concerning the availability of materials capable of being used for the manufacture of explosives or incendiary devices. 
     
      
    3 Thirdly, a charge that on or about 26 October 2003, the offender possessed a document containing information concerning the ingredients for and the method of manufacture of poisons, explosives, detonators and incendiary devices connected with the preparation for a terrorist act, knowing the said connection. 
     
      
    4 The first and third of these charges carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. The second charge carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. 
     
      
    5 As I have indicated earlier, there was a fourth charge namely, a charge that on or about 24 October 2003 the offender made a set of aerial photographs of certain Australian Defence establishments. The jury found that the accused was not guilty in respect of this charge. 
     
      
    6 It is now necessary for me to make findings of fact in relation to each of the charges in respect of which the offender has been found guilty. Those facts must reflect and be consistent with the jury’s verdict. Since these are Commonwealth offences, it is also necessary for me to have regard to the matters set out in Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Commonwealth) and, more specifically, to the matters set out in s 16A of the Act. There are other provisions of the Crimes Act that I must also take into account. 
     
      
    7 I have had the advantage of comprehensive submissions made by Mr Maidment SC and Mr Bellew for the Crown. I have had the advantage as well of equally comprehensive submissions from Mr Boulten SC and Mr Lange for the offender. 
     
      
       
      The facts relative to the offences 
       
      
    8 In mid-May 2003 a French citizen, one Willie Brigitte, arrived in Australia. This man, I accept, had trained at a Lashkar-e-Taiba paramilitary training camp in Pakistan in late 2001. One of his fellow trainees, Yong Ke Kwon, gave evidence in the trial about his own training at the Lashkar-e-Taiba camp and his meeting there and relationship with a man he knew as Salahudin. He identified Salahudin from a photograph of Willie Brigitte shown to him in November 2003. The organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba has now been prescribed as a terrorist organisation by the Australian Government and it is also regarded in this light by the Government of Pakistan. Its primary focus is on the removal of Indian security forces from India controlled Kashmir. But it has a broader interest in terrorism generally and may, perhaps, have had some links with the terrorist organisation al-Qaeda. It is clear, however, that military and religious training occurred in the Le-T camp attended by both Brigitte and Kwon; and that the training related not only to the local situation but was intended to aid in the battle against oppression of Muslim communities elsewhere. 
     
      
    9 There is very little detailed evidence about Willie Brigitte’s activities while he was here in Australia. This much however is clear: a few days before he arrived in Australia, the offender set up a mobile phone service in a false name. It has been referred to throughout the trial as the “Sam Praveen” telephone service. Two calls were made from Willie Brigitte’s phone in France to the Sam Praveen telephone service. The first occurred on 7 May 2003, a day or so after the offender had obtained the service. The second of these calls was made on 13 May 2003, the day before Brigitte left France for Australia. There was also evidence to show that, although the offender had never met Willie Brigitte, arrangements had been made for him to meet and collect him on the day of his arrival in Sydney. This is, in fact, what happened and two the men spent most of the day together. 
     
      
    10 The connecting link between the offender and Willie Brigitte appears to be a somewhat shadowy figure in Pakistan known to both men. His name was “Sajid”. The offender said he met him in Pakistan at a mosque during visits there in 2002 and 2003. The offender said it was Sajid who asked him to look after Willie Brigitte on his arrival in Australia. I have no doubt that this was so. I do not accept, however, that the relationship between the two men was an innocent one, as the offender endeavoured to explain it. His version was that he gave assistance to Willie Brigitte as a matter of courtesy to a stranger travelling in a new country; and that he did so at the behest of a mutual friend who had asked that such courtesy be extended. In my view, the evidence establishes that Sajid was endeavouring to co-ordinate a liaison between the offender and Willie Brigitte in Sydney so that, in general terms, the prospect of terrorist actions in Australia could be explored. 
     
      
    11 I should say immediately that there is no evidence to indicate precisely what Brigitte’s role was to be in relation to any terrorist activity. There is no evidence to indicate, for example, that he himself was to be involved in the commission of any of the three offences in respect of which the offender has been found guilty. But there was a continuing association between the offender and Willie Brigitte during his short stay in Australia. This is exemplified by a number of calls made by an Australian Mobile phone service associated with Brigitte (again in a false name, known during the trial as the “John Huck” telephone service) to the “Sam Praveen” telephone service. 
     
      
    12 There is also evidence that Willie Brigitte’s French telephone service made approximately nineteen telephone calls to Sajid in Pakistan before Brigitte left for Australia. After Willie Brigitte’s detention and deportation from Australia, there was evidence that the offender telephoned Sajid’s telephone number from a public phone box in Campsie. This occurred after the offender had been at an Internet Café with one Abdul Rakib Hasan. Hasan, who worked in a Halal butcher’s shop at Lakemba, also knew Brigitte. 
     
      
    13 There was also evidence that the offender and Hasan visited Brigitte at his flat at Boorea Avenue, Lakemba on at least two occasions. Although the evidence does not enable me to discover the details of what transpired between the offender and Willie Brigitte, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the relationship was not an innocent one. I am also satisfied that the connecting link between the two men was their joint interest in contemplating and discussing the possibility of some type of terrorist activity in Australia. This association came to an abrupt end in October 2003 in circumstances that achieved considerable notoriety in the Australian media. French authorities had notified Australian Intelligence that Brigitte had a substantial connection with terrorism and this, so it appears, led to his sudden detention and swift deportation from Australia to France. It seems that he is still in France awaiting determination as to whether he is to face terrorism charges under the laws in that country relating to his activities in France or elsewhere. Brigitte gave no evidence in the trial. 
     
      
    14 A little under a week before Brigitte’s detention took place, the offender obtained a desk map and a wall map of the electrical supply system from Energy Supply at Level 6, 208 Pitt Street Sydney. He told Ms Bakla, who worked for the organisation, that he was starting a business and that he wanted to place a wall map in his office. The offender was asked to fill out a form giving his name, address and company name. The name he wrote down was “M Rasul”. His position was given as “partner”; and the company name as “Rasul Electrical”. The postal address given was “Post Office Box 2359 Smithfield”. The telephone number, which was altered by Ms Bakla to include an additional 9, was 9230.051. 
     
      
    15 There was no contest at trial that it was, in fact, the offender who made these enquiries and that it was he who was supplied with the maps. The offender explained before the jury that his obtaining of the maps had nothing whatsoever to do with terrorist related activities. In fact, he said that he wanted them for a business of an electrical nature he was proposing to establish. The offender expressly disclaimed any intention that these maps were connected with, or in any way involved in or part of any plot, to carry out a terrorist act against the Electricity Supply System. The offender also explained why he filled out the application form in the way he did. The Post Office Box address and the telephone number were simply errors. The name “Rasul” or “Mohamed Rasul” was to be part of the name he proposed to give the electrical company when it was established. 
     
      
    16 Consistently with the jury’s verdicts, I find that these explanations and excuses were untrue. The real reason the offender gave a false name, telephone number and address was that he did not want his own identity to be known. This was because his plain purpose in securing the maps related to an intention he held at the time to use the maps in connection with a proposal for an enterprise that would involve bombing part of the Australian Electricity Supply System.  
     
      
    17 Not only did the offender intend to use the maps for this purpose when he collected them, it was also his intention that any bombing of the electrical system by the detonation of a homemade explosive or incendiary device would be done to advance the cause of violent jihad and be carried out so as to intimidate the Government of Australia and the Australian public. 
     
      
    18 The offender’s association with Willie Brigitte and the man Sajid in Pakistan were not the only matters relevant to the existence of these intentions. There was also found in his possession a significant amount of material which threw considerable light on his intentions in relation to these offences. The material included a CD-Rom which was described, throughout the trial, as the “jihadi CD”. This was a virtual library containing exhortations to violent jihad, justifications for suicide bombings (called “martyrdom” in the text of the material), and which extolled the virtues of those who had given their lives to the murder of innocent civilians and others in the name of extremist Islam. Much of the material exhorted the reader or listener to follow, or at least support violent jihad. In addition to this CD, there were two volumes of the Lion of Allah, other material and Chechnyan videocassette glorifying those who had given their lives in the fight between Chechnya and Russia.  
     
      
    19 The offender told the jury that he had never seen the “jihadi CD” and that he could not explain its presence in the material found near his computer at home. Although he acknowledged the existence of some of the other material I have mentioned, he explained that he had either not seen it or, if he had seen it, it was only in part and that he had generally little to do with the contents. 
     
      
    20 I do not accept these explanations. Nor do I accept the offender’s attempts to distance himself from the material so obviously found in his possession. Rather, I think the truth is that all this material makes it clear that the offender is a person who has, in recent years, been essentially informed by the concept of violent jihad and the glorification of Muslim heroes who have fought and died for jihad, either in a local or broader context. The material is eloquent as to the ideas and emotions that must have been foremost in the offender’s mind throughout October 2003 and later, at least until the time of his arrest. 
     
      
    21 Although these specific intentions were, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, at the forefront of the offender’s mind when he collected the maps, it seems clear that he had not at that stage necessarily made a final determination as to the precise target, or the precise area of the target, that was to be hit. Indeed, the maps themselves would not have given sufficient information to the offender. Nor would they, of themselves, have given sufficient insight into how such an attack upon the electrical system could be maintained. They were, however, a starting point for a terrorist related enterprise potentially of some considerable magnitude.  
     
      
    22 Of further relevance to this first offence, and indeed, to each offence found proven against the offender, was the material located at his workstation during the execution of a search warrant on 26 October 2003. This comprised 15 pages of carefully written out handwriting in the Urdu language, or at least in the Urdu script. It was not disputed that this document was in the handwriting of the offender. He explained that, many years earlier, he had seen this material written in English on a computer he was using at University during the course of his studies. Although he maintained that the information was of no special interest to him, it is obvious that he must have spent several hours writing out the material he selected from the computer screen. He then kept it in his possession for a considerable time afterwards. The offender maintained that he had forgotten about this material and that it had found its way to his workplace by accident, as it were.  
     
      
    23 I reject the offender’s explanation for the possession of this document. Moreover, I find that its contents were central to his thinking and state of mind at least during 2003 and thereafter. The offender’s attempt to explain or justify his possession of this material was simply incredible. 
     
      
    24 These 15 pages were fairly described by the Crown in its submissions before the jury as “a terrorism manual for the manufacture of homemade poisons, explosives, detonators and incendiary devices”. Although the recipes were not particularly sophisticated or scientific, they included formulas for homemade grenades, petrol bombs and, relevantly for this present purpose, an explosive device containing an explosive known as urea nitrate. This particular explosive could be easily made, as the evidence of Dr Spears and Mr Taylor showed during the trial. Once detonated, it had the capacity for significant damage to property and for substantial loss of life for those who may have been in the vicinity when the explosion occurred. This situation, of course, would depend on the size of the urea nitrate parcel detonated. 
     
      
    25 Throughout the trial, a central issue for the jury’s determination had been the state of mind or the intentions of the offender. The contents of these documents, Exhibit “G” and its English translation Exhibit “H”, make it plain beyond reasonable doubt that, when he collected the wall maps from Ms Bakla at Energy Supply, the subject of homemade bombs or explosives was likely to have been at the forefront of his thinking. 
     
      
    26 I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, however, that the offender had at any time made up his mind that it would be he who would carry out the bombing of the Australian Electrical Supply System. Indeed, I am perfectly satisfied that the proposal had not reached the stage where the identity of a bomber, the precise area to be bombed or the manner in which the bombing would take place, had been worked out. The obtaining of the electrical maps was at a very preliminary stage indeed, a matter, which the Crown accepted throughout the presentation of its case to the jury. 
     
      
    27 The day after Willie Brigitte’s detention commenced, the offender exchanged faxes with one Melissa Phelps. She was an employee of Deltrex Chemicals. Here again, he used a false name and a fictitious address. The fax-headed sheet he created was this time that of a non-existent business called “Eagle Flyers”. It had a Post Office box “2286 Smithfield”. This was a fictitious business identity in all respects although, of course, the fax number of the firm of Thomson Adsett Architects was given to Ms Phelps. It is also of interest to note that the offender, in making the enquiry, spelt his first name differently from its usual spelling; and he signed his name with a signature which was not his usual signature.  
     
      
    28 The offender told Ms Phelps that he was going to start up a detergent business. He gave Ms Phelps a list of the chemicals he wanted. Ultimately a price list for certain chemicals was sent by Ms Phelps to “Fahim” at Thomson Adsett. It became Exhibit “J” in the trial. The price list contained and included chemicals which were to be found on the Urdu document Exhibit “G”. In particular, the list gave prices for minimum quantities of urea and nitric acid, the components for a urea nitrate homemade bomb. 
     
      
    29 Exhibit “J” was not however received by the offender. It found its way to Ms Kenny, his superior, at work. Ms Kenny confronted the offender. She asked him whether the document had anything to do with his work. He told her that it did not. It has to do, he said, with his family company. He explained to her that his fax was broken and he needed to use the work fax for “family company business”.  
     
      
    30 Before the jury, the offender gave a similar explanation. He explained that he had a proposal for exporting chemicals to Pakistan. Indeed, there was other evidence in the trial, from his family in Pakistan and other people, that at one stage he had contemplated some sort of business venture, which would involve the exporting of certain chemicals from Australia. 
     
      
    31 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, however, that the explanation given to the jury for the offender’s obtaining the price list of chemicals from Deltrex Chemicals was a false explanation. The truth of the matter was that he wanted the information to assist in his proposal for planning and carrying out a bombing enterprise within Australia as part of a terrorist act. Again, it is quite possible, as at 10 October 2003, that the offender may well have still had in contemplation the bombing of part of the Electrical Supply System. It is not possible to say, however, that when the enquiries were made of Deltrex Chemicals, the precise target had been selected. As before, it is clear that the planning was at a very preliminary stage. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intended that he himself would necessarily assemble the bomb or that he would be the bomb carrier when it came time to place it at or near the ultimate target. But I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his role in the enterprise was an important one. This is evidenced by the fact that it was he who was making the enquiry to Deltrex Chemicals, albeit using a false name. Once again the offender gave an explanation as to why he used the name “Eagle Flyers”. Once again, he claimed that a mistake had simply been made in the postal address. 
     
      
    32 I do not accept these explanations as true. To the contrary, I find that they were patently false. 
     
      
    33 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender’s intentions in obtaining the list of chemicals was in contemplation for an action that he intended would be carried out to advance the cause of violent jihad. The information was sought with the intention on his part to influence by intimidation the Government of Australia and to intimidate the public. 
     
      
    34 The third and final offence relates to the offender’s possession of the Urdu document Exhibit “G”. This was found, as I have said, at his workstation on 26 October 2003. The offender, as I have already recounted, endeavoured to distance himself from this document before the jury. It is quite apparent however, that the jury did not accept his explanation. Consistently with the jury’s verdict, I do not accept his explanation and reject it. Indeed, the offender’s explanation in relation to the way in which this document came into existence and the reasons for his possession of it through until October 2003 were, as I have said, simply unbelievable. 
     
      
    35 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender’s possession of this document reflected very clearly his intention to make use of its contents for the purpose of using the information to assist in an enterprise to assemble an explosive which would be used as part and parcel of the ultimate carrying out of an act of terror within Australia. I am satisfied that his intention or state of mind at the time it was found in his possession, and indeed prior to that time and well after, was that the material could be used to advance the cause of violent jihad in Australia. Moreover, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the offender’s intention that any such enterprise would be carried out to coerce, or influence by intimidation, the Government of Australia and to intimidate the public. 
     
      
    36 I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, however, that the offender had formulated any intention as at 26 October 2003 to poison any person or to cause the death of any person by the use of poison. Rather, I think the document Exhibit “G” reflected a range of options. Any one of these would have been available for the carrying out of an act of terror but, so far as the offender’s personal intentions were concerned, he favoured the use of an explosive or explosive device. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that in relation to each of the three offences, the offender contemplated that the ultimate act of terror would, at least, cause serious damage to property. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, at this very preliminary stage, a definite intention had been formulated to use an explosive to kill innocent people. I am satisfied, however, that the offender would have been aware, or at least would have contemplated, that, by using an explosive to damage property or infrastructure, there would have been a risk of serious physical harm to people who might be in the vicinity; and that even death might be occasioned to persons who happened to be close to the site of the explosion. 
     
      
       
      Objective seriousness of the offences 
       
      
    37 It is now necessary to evaluate the seriousness of the offences for which the offender has been convicted. In that regard, it is necessary to assess the level of criminal culpability involved in the offences both in relation to each particular offence and generally.  
     
      
    38 The Crown position may be stated briefly: It is that the Court should find that the criminal culpability involved in the commission of these three offences is at a very high level. The Crown maintains that, overall, the objective seriousness of the offences is close to, but not necessarily at, the worst-case level. The Crown has not sought the imposition of a life sentence in relation to count 2. 
     
      
    39 In this regard, the Crown has argued, first, that the jury verdicts require a finding by the sentencing court that what was involved here was a deliberate and pre-meditated course of conduct. I agree with this submission by the Crown. It is clear that the assembling of the 15 page Urdu document, that is the selection of the material that was to be copied, and the act of writing it out in the Urdu language, demonstrates beyond reasonable doubt a significant degree of pre-meditation and deliberation. In the same way, the efforts put into purchasing the electricity supply maps from the ESAA and the efforts involved in the enquiries to Deltrex Chemicals show the same kind of deliberation and reasonably carefully thought out pre-meditation. This is particularly so in the creation of false identities and particulars. Indeed, the same point may be made regarding the Urdu document. Clearly, one purpose in putting the contents of the document into that language was to make them difficult to identify, at least for a person other than one who spoke the Urdu language or who was able to read Urdu text. 
     
      
    40 Secondly, I accept the Crown position that the jury verdict must mean, in the light of the facts I have found, that at the time of the collection of the ESAA maps, and at the time of the enquiries made at Deltrex Chemicals, the offender had in mind an ultimate act which would involve the detonation of an explosive so as to cause at least very serious damage to property. There was no issue in the trial that the offender had obtained the electrical maps and that he had made enquiries of the chemical supply company. What was at issue, indeed, very much in issue, was his intention or state of mind at the time those events occurred.  
     
      
    41 It was clearly the jury’s conclusion that, at the relevant times, the offender intended to obtain the maps and the list of chemicals with a view to their use in a plot to cause the detonation of an explosive or explosives that would advance the cause of violent jihad and intimidate the government and the public. The explosion, however, was aimed essentially at property or infrastructure. 
     
      
    42 It was principally for this reason that the Crown, very fairly and properly, made its concession in relation to counts 1 and 2 that the objective seriousness of the offences, although very high, was not in the worst possible category. 
     
      
    43 The Crown, however, took a somewhat different view in relation to the circumstances revealed in relation to count 4. Here, the Crown argued that the contents of the Urdu document, Exhibit “G”, demonstrated that the offender intended or contemplated at least that he would be involved in a plot or proposal to administer poison to another person or persons. This involved, according to the Crown argument, an intention to kill or to cause at least serious physical harm to persons as opposed to serious damage to property.  
     
      
    44 I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt however, that the evidence establishes that the offender held, at any relevant time, an intention that he would be involved with an actual plot involving the use of poison aimed at causing the death of, or serious physical harm to, an individual or to individuals. There is really no evidence to suggest that this type of activity was contemplated beyond the fact that, in the various “recipes” in Exhibit “G”, there are several for making poisons. In the same way, although there is a formula for making an improvised hand grenade, there is no evidence in the case to suggest that the offender ever intended that there would be an enterprise involving the use of a hand grenade aimed at any individual, or for that matter, any building. Rather, I consider that, in this area, the submissions made by Mr Boulten SC on behalf of the offender are correct: there is, in the circumstances of all three offences, really one continuing uninterrupted course of conduct centring upon an enterprise to blow up a building or infrastructure.  
     
      
    45 The evidence establishes, for example, that the offender undoubtedly had in mind to damage some part of the electrical supply system. But there is no evidence from which one can conclude beyond reasonable doubt the precise nature of the ultimate target to be hit. The contents of the Urdu document considerably flesh out, colour and illuminate the offender’s intention in relation to the circumstances surrounding the obtaining of the ESAA maps and the enquiries he made of the chemical supply company. In the same way, those facts and circumstances, relating to counts 1 and 2, give illumination to his reasons for the possession of the Urdu document and flesh out the use he intended to make of it. I accept that Exhibit “G” was held by the accused in circumstances where he had an intention to make use of one or more of its recipes for purposes associated with his contemplated actions in relation to counts 1 and 2. But I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he, in fact, contemplated the use of a poison or poisons in any particular terrorist enterprise. An option to cause the death of someone by the use of poison no doubt was available to him. There is no evidence, however, from which I can infer that he had, even in the most preliminary of ways, selected such a course as an option to be in fact pursued. 
     
      
    46 The real dispute between the Crown and Mr Boulten SC related to the categorisation of the offences. As I have said, the Crown argued that the objective seriousness of the offences fell just below that of the worst category whereas Mr Boulten SC argued that the criminal culpability was at a low level. 
     
      
    47 Senior counsel for the defence provided a catalogue of reasons supporting his submissions. First, he argued that the accused held the requisite intentions for a very limited period of time. Either they were held for no longer than a period between 3 and 12 October 2003; or, alternatively, those intentions were held no longer than the period between 3 October and the date of seizure of the Urdu document. Mr Boulten based this submission on the fact that no criminal or terrorist related activity had been observed between 26 October 2003, and the date in late April 2004, when the offender was arrested. 
     
      
    48 I do not agree with this submission. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender maintained a general intention relating to terrorist activities at least up until the time of his arrest. It is clear that the offender knew, or at least suspected, that he was under surveillance following the seizure, as indeed he was. Both his office and his home had been thoroughly searched, indeed turned upside down by those authorised to do so under the relevant warrants. In addition, the offender was compulsorily detained and questioned in November 2003. It would have been an extraordinary situation had he been foolish enough to continue with any overt terrorist related activities after this confluence of events, all of which would have brought home to him most clearly that he was a person of considerable interest to the authorities.  
     
      
    49 On the other hand, there is not the slightest evidence to suggest that he had renounced his former intentions. They were, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, intentions he held with great vigour and firmness. They were the consequence of a deeply fanatical, but sincerely held, religious and worldview based on his faith and his attitude to the extreme dictates of fundamentalist Islamic propositions. It is hardly likely that a handful of searches and a bout of questioning, unnerving though they doubtless were, would have led him to renounce the views, so deeply held by him. 
     
      
    50 The remaining matters relied upon by Mr Boulten SC essentially focused upon the very early stage of planning any proposal had reached by the end of October 2003. Senior counsel pointed to the absence of precision in the selection of any target or targets; the lack of viability or effectiveness of any proposed plan due to the preliminary nature of the enterprise; the fact that the offender himself was not necessarily to be the person who would carry out any attack, and that no decision had been made as to who else might be involved in any such attack. Indeed, Mr Boulten SC argued that, although count 2 carries with it a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, the criminality involved in the circumstances surrounding count 2 was no greater than that demonstrated in, for example, count 1 where the maximum penalty is 15 years. 
     
      
    51 Once again, although I have endeavoured to pay due respect to the forceful arguments of learned senior counsel, I am unable to agree with these propositions advanced on the offender’s behalf. It is true that the actions carried out by the offender may properly be regarded as at a very early stage of any terror related enterprise. The obtaining of the maps from ESAA, for example, would have done little by itself to advance a terrorist plot to bomb part of the electrical supply system. In relation to the enquiry of Deltrex Chemicals, it is also true that a good deal more work and preparation would have been necessary to advance the construction of a physically assembled bomb capable of causing destruction to part of the electrical supply system. But, on the other hand, the legislation under which these offences has been created was specifically set up to intercept and prevent a terrorist act at a very early or preparatory stage, long before it would be likely to culminate in the destruction of property and the death of innocent people. The very purpose of the legislation is to interrupt the preparatory stages leading to the engagement in a terrorist act so as to frustrate its ultimate commission. An evaluation of the criminal culpability involved in any particular offence requires an analysis not only of the act itself, which may be relatively innocuous, but as well an examination of the nature of the terrorist act contemplated, particularly in the light of the intentions or state of mind of the person found to have committed the offence. 
     
      
    52 When the offender’s conduct is examined in that way, although it is correct to make allowance for the matters stressed by Mr Boulten in his submission, the position becomes quite clear: the offender’s culpability in relation to the commission of these three offences, viewed as they should be, in my opinion, in their entirety, since they do involve inevitably one uninterrupted course of conduct, is at a very high level. Objectively examined, these are very serious offences indeed. This is especially so because of the fact that the offender himself held the relevant intention in relation to each offence to cause very serious damage to property, to advance violent jihad and to do so to coerce the Australian Government and to intimidate the public generally. As I have said a number of times, these were the central issues that were left to the jury and the jury’s verdicts must mean that the level of criminality is, as I have said, at a very high level. In a practical context, it is my finding that the actions of the accused, in relation to each of the offences, displayed an intention on his part that a violent terrorist act or acts would be carried out in Australia. This was intended, in effect, to be a general attack on the community as a whole. It carried the obvious consequence that, if carried out, it would instil terror into members of the public so that they could, never again, feel free from the threat of bombing attacks within Australia. 
     
      
    53 Australia is in general terms a very safe country. It is far removed, physically, from the rest of the world. It is far removed from the turmoil and gross disturbances that beset so many parts of the inhabited globe. It is a country in which Australians have been able in the past, with some exceptions no doubt, to congratulate themselves on their easy going and tolerant way of life. Although we have not escaped being drawn into world affairs and world conflicts, and although our citizens have not been free from attack in other countries, Australia has, to this time, not been a country where fundamentalist and extreme views have exposed our citizens to death and destruction within the sanctuary of our shores. One has only to think of the consequences on the national psyche of a tragedy such as the Port Arthur massacre to realise how a major terrorist bombing would or could impact on the security, the stability and well being of the citizens of this country. 
     
      
    54 I venture to suggest that these observations, general though they be, are not out of place in contemplating the seriousness of the offender’s actions and, in particular, his intentions in relation to the offences which have been committed here. Those intentions were of course, thwarted at a very early stage. The actions he took were, in themselves, ineffective enough. It may well be that there was a general lack of viability and sophistication about his actions. It may well be that there was a degree of impracticability as to whether he would be able to carry out his criminal intentions. On the other hand, even the most amateurish and ill-conceived plot to cause mayhem by the use of explosions would be capable of causing considerable damage and even death amongst our community. 
     
      
    55 For these reasons, I accept generally the submissions of the Crown that the offender’s criminal culpability in the present matter is to be regarded at a high level, although falling short of the worst category of case. I am unable to accept that the offender’s culpability is to be regarded at a low level, as Mr Boulten submitted. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    56 I turn now to assess the offender’s subjective circumstances. The offender has no prior convictions either in this country or in his country of birth, Pakistan. He comes from a well-established family. He was born at Sialkot in the Punjab region of Pakistan and is presently 36 years of age. His father is in his 70’s and his mother is 68 years old. They continue to live in Sialkot where is father is now retired. The offender’s father was previously employed with the Pakistan airport and later worked as a trained legal practitioner in Lahore. 
     
      
    57 The offender has three sisters and two brothers. His 39 year old brother lives and works in Sydney as a teacher. He has an uncle, an electrician who also lives in the Sydney region. The offender completed his secondary schooling in Pakistan before training as an architect at Lahore University over a period of five years. He finished that degree at about the age of 24 and, after a brief period of indenture with an architect firm, he then commenced his own general practice in Lahore, which continued until 1997. After a brief visit to Sydney he decided to immigrate here and this occurred in 1998. 
     
      
    58 Upon arrival in Australia, the offender set about obtaining qualifications to enable him to practice as an architect in this country. He applied for registration with the New South Wales board of architects. He enrolled at the University of Sydney where, over the next eighteen months, he completed a number of additional subjects. This enabled him to be awarded a Bachelor of Architecture Degree from the University of Sydney. He graduated in 2000. The offender also undertook further training at the Ultimo College of TAFE where he obtained certificates in Quality Management and Total Quality Management. At the time of his arrest, he was in the process of completing a Masters Degree in Construction Management at the University of New South Wales. In addition to working with Thomson Adsett Partners he was employed in 2004 by Bishop Hitchcock & Irvine an Architect’s firm at Alexandria. He was working there at the time of his arrest in April 2004. 
     
      
    59 It clear that the offender has, throughout his life, demonstrated and maintained a solid and prodigious work ethic. 
     
      
    60 The offender was married in 1999. This was an arranged marriage and, in this context, it was not until 2000 that his wife was able to join him in Australia. She is a qualified medical practitioner in Pakistan and has currently been undertaking additional studies in order to obtain registration as a doctor in New South Wales. There are no children from the marriage but the offender’s wife has remained loyal to him and supportive of him. His wife, brother and uncle have frequently visited him in prison. 
     
      
    61 The offender informed Mr Tim Watson-Munro, a Consultant Forensic Psychologist, that he is a devout Muslim. He told the psychologist that his renewed interest in his faith occurred at about the time of his marriage. Prior to that, he claimed that his interest in religion had been “fairly laisez-faire”. The offender also stated to the psychologist that after his marriage, he felt a strong need to have a greater structure and focus in his life and it has been in this context that he has become more dedicated to the spiritual aspects of his life. From that time onwards, he regularly attended his local mosque and he did the same during his major visits to Pakistan after 2000. 
     
      
    62 Mr Watson-Munro concluded that there was nothing in the offender’s prior history, nor emerging from his discussions with him, to indicate a violent disposition nor were there any features of an anti-social personality. The offender told Mr Watson-Munro that he came to Australia to better his life and that at no time had he felt any antipathy towards this country. There were no symptoms of depression and no indications of depressive illness at the time of psychological assessment. Mr Watson-Munro said the task in determining whether the offender might pose a risk upon his release was a difficult assessment to make in the light of Mr Lodhi’s continued claim to be innocent, notwithstanding the jury’s verdict. The psychologist, however, said that there was no previous involvement with the police or courts; rather there was a history of a hard working devout man who was well supported by those of his family who were in Australia. All of these matters, Mr Watson-Munro considered, were positive prognostic indicators. 
     
      
    63 Finally, the offender told the psychologist of the difficult system of incarceration he was enduring, having regard to his classification as an AA inmate. Notwithstanding these difficulties, the offender appeared to be coping quite well with the situation. 
     
      
    64 I should add, that in addition to the thorough information contained in Mr Watson-Munro’s report, a number of family friends of the offender gave evidence during his trial. They all attested to his non-violent personality, his devotion to his work and his satisfactory relationship with other people. In particular, a number of witnesses said that he was non-political and not a violent person in any respect. All of these matters, it must be said, stand in stark contrast to the circumstances of the offences committed by the offender and the intentions, which I have found he possessed at the time of the commission of the offences. 
     
      
       
      The Sentence to be imposed - principles of sentencing 
       
      
    65 What principles then should govern the imposition of sentence on the offender? 
     
      
    66 The purposes of sentencing in this matter include a number of well known considerations: overall, there is a need to protect the community from the consequences of serious crime of the kind involved here. This in turn requires the Court to pay particular heed to deterrence, both general and particular; to rehabilitation and to retribution and denunciation. 
     
      
    67 There is as well a need to have regard to a number of matters arising specifically under the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914. There is no need for me to mention all the matters arising under the legislation but they include the presence of contrition or remorse; the character antecedents and cultural background of the offender; the need to impose a sentence that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offences; and the need to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offences. 
     
      
    68 At the outset I should say that I am satisfied that, in relation to each of the offences, no sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances other than a sentence of imprisonment. This arises from the nature and circumstances of each offence, the level of criminal culpability involved and the will of the Commonwealth Parliament as expressed in the maximum penalties available. 
     
      
    69 Secondly, it is necessary for me to say that I consider that the offence committed under count 2 in the indictment is, a more serious offence than the offences in counts 1 and 3. This is so for a number of reasons. First, the offence in count 2 carries with it as I have earlier noted, a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Parliament considers it a more serious offence than each of the offences the subject of counts 1 and 3. Secondly, it is a more serious offence because, the act of preparing for a terrorist act is the carrying out of a preliminary action that is, by its nature, closer to the commission of the ultimate terrorist act than the offences contemplated in ss 101.4 and 101.5 of the Criminal Code. Thirdly, the offender’s actions in making the enquiries of Deltrex Chemicals in the present matter were, in fact, actions that brought him that much closer to the carrying out of an act of terror than did the other preliminary actions for which he has been convicted. For these reasons, the level of criminal culpability in relation to count 2 is greater than the culpability in the offences involving the collection of the ESAA maps and possession of the Urdu document. Having regard to these circumstances and the maximum penalty involved, it is my view that the sentence in relation to count 2 must carry with it a significantly greater penalty than the offences in count 1 and 3. 
     
      
    70 I am not satisfied, however, that there is any necessity in all the circumstances to impose sentences that are other than entirely concurrent. This flows from the reasons I have given earlier in this decision relating to the fact that the offender’s conduct might properly be viewed and, in my view, should properly be viewed as one uninterrupted and continuing course of criminal conduct over a relatively brief period of time. The offender’s criminal intention, although directed to the commission of three separate offences, was in essence a manifestation of the one continuing and uninterrupted intention. In my view, the criminality involved in the second count is sufficient to encompass the criminality of the other offences. The principle of totality in the particular circumstances does not permit me to inflict any additional punishment for those two offences. 
     
      
    71 May I now pass to a consideration of the subjective features of the offender. First, there is the undoubted fact that he is, by all accounts, a person who has hitherto led a blameless life. He is a person who comes from a favourable and strongly supportive family background and who has no criminal background or antecedents whatsoever. These features of the offender’s life and circumstances are clearly matters that may be brought to account in his favour for the purposes of the sentencing process. But I have to say that these favourable circumstances make it difficult to understand why a young man of excellent personal background, with a considerable professional work ethic, would have contemplated and carried out the very serious criminal actions that have brought him to his present position in these proceedings. 
     
      
    72 The offender has, of course, maintained his innocence throughout the trial and continues to do so during this sentencing hearing. I can gain no meaningful insight into the circumstances, which have transformed him from an otherwise respectable member of the community to a dangerous terrorist whose views are coloured by notions of the most extreme and fundamental kind. It may be that the offender’s deep embrace of religion about the time of his marriage resulted in his embracing extremist views. This is perhaps no more than speculation on my part but, even if it were true, it does not explain why or how the dangerous intentions underlying the offender’s actions were ignited.  
     
      
    73 It has always been my understanding that Islam does not enjoin the killing of innocent people. Moreover, violent warfare is regarded by true Islam as a matter of last resort. It is subject to rigorous conditions laid down by the sacred law. The term “jihad” literally means “struggle”. The greatest form of “jihad” is the inner struggle of the soul, which is to be waged against selfish desires for the sake of the attainment of inner peace. Indeed, these concepts were the very concepts of jihad espoused by the offender during his trial. But it is clear from the jury’s verdict and the findings I have made that they are not the true reflection of this man’s inner thoughts and beliefs. The extremist views, which he must in truth be taken to have espoused, are not representative of the true nature of his Islamic religion. Rather they are a distortion of it. 
     
      
    74 As I say, these reflections, made in an endeavour to gain insight into the reasons, which may have led a young man of previous excellent character into the path of serious criminal misconduct, are perhaps speculation. The truth is I can gain little, if any, insight into the offender’s mind in this regard. The consequence is, however, that I can make no allowance in his favour for remorse and contrition. There plainly is none. The offender was perfectly entitled to maintain his innocence both during the trial and thereafter. This does not mean that his penalty is to be in any sense aggravated or increased. But it does mean that I can make no allowance on his behalf for contrition and remorse. Equally, it makes it difficult for the sentencing court to form any view as to whether the imposition of a significant penalty on the offender will result in his reform and rehabilitation. 
     
      
    75 The best I can do is to repeat the opinion expressed in Mr Watson-Munro’s report suggesting that the absence of any previous violent disposition, the absence of any features of an anti-social personality, and the strongly supportive background of the offender’s family are positive factors in his favour. These matters entitle the Court to express some cautious hope that, in time, the offender’s extreme views may dissipate and that rehabilitation may not be beyond him. 
     
      
    76 It is now necessary to consider a discrete matter that was raised by Mr Boulten SC on behalf of the offender. This related to the conditions of the offender’s imprisonment prior to trial and the likely conditions of imprisonment following the imposition of sentence. It will be recalled that the offender was received into custody on 22 April 2004. At that time, he was placed in segregated custody and he remained in that situation for just under two months. He was classified as A2U (maximum security unsentenced). He was also designated as an Extreme High Security inmate. This remained the situation until 17 February 2005 when, as a consequence of new regulations, he was assessed for a new classification AAU (National Security Threat Maximum Security unsentenced). It seems to be the position that once the offender has been sentenced he will have his security classification re-evaluated by the Risk Assessment Evaluation team. It is likely that his classification will be in the AA category and this will remain so for at least some considerable time. It was the evidence given by the correctional officer, Mr Andrew McClintock that this classification would not, in effect, be set in concrete. Mr McClintock conceded that it was possible there would be at least a marked delay in his progress from the AA category to a less onerous classification.  
     
      
    77 During the offender’s time in custody, he has been segregated from other prisoners with the exception of a relatively brief period when he was placed into protection limited association. This enabled him to mix with one other prisoner but the association was brought to an end through no fault of the offender. 
     
      
    78 An initial management regime has been settled for inmates who possess the AA classification. This regime has paid particular attention to security issues raised by the new classification. In other respects, it did not restrict statutory requirements.  
     
      
    79 In practical terms, the offender’s history of incarceration has meant that, except for the relatively brief limited association period, he has been kept in segregated custody. Mr McClintock explained that the term “solitary confinement” is not used any more. Rather, the favoured expression at the present time is that the inmate is described as “one out”. Whatever the terminology, the reality is that this is solitary confinement. There is a small exercise yard outside his cell where he may exercise for a brief period each day. In practical terms, this period of exercise outside the cell varies on a daily basis. The variation may, on any particular day, involve an exercise period between one and a half to three hours. The offender is required to wear an orange set of overalls whenever he is out of his cell and moved to another part of the complex. On those occasions, he is shackled. The reason for these procedures is presumably related to security. 
     
      
    80 The offender is constantly monitored and filmed by a video camera. If he has visits with his family, the visits are monitored in the sense that the conversations are within hearing distance of a Corrective Services officer and the visit itself is video taped. All telephone calls the offender makes are recorded other than those to his lawyers. All of his mail is read. He is not allowed access to a computer. 
     
      
    81 Details of the custodial management plan were in evidence before me as part of Exhibit “A”. It is not necessary for me to give all the details of this program. Included in it are some of the matters I have already mentioned. In addition, the offender is to have a cell change every two weeks. His cell is to be searched daily. He may not be employed within the prison system unless approval in writing is given by the Governor. He is not allowed to be employed in a sweeper/domestic position. The offender is not permitted to use the gymnasium nor is he allowed access to the prison oval. Barring exceptional situations, he is not allowed to leave his cell after 15.30 hours and he must be secured in the cell from that time. The offender is not entitled to and not permitted to speak to an Official Visitor. 
     
      
    82 Mr Boulten SC has submitted that the Court should make some allowance in the sentencing process for the harshness of the conditions sustained by the offender while he has been awaiting trial. Secondly, an allowance should be made for the future since it is highly likely he will be classified AA after sentence and that this classification will stay in force for at least a reasonably long period of time. 
     
      
    83 Because the offender has been in prison since 22 April 2004, it will be appropriate in formulating a sentence to backdate it to the date on which he went into custody. I am also of the view that some allowance should be made for the strict conditions in which he has been confined up to the time of trial. (R v Mallah per Wood CJ at CL [2005] NSWSC 317 at para [87]). 
     
      
    84 As to the offender’s future incarceration, there is no doubt that the conditions of imprisonment, while ever he remains classified as AA, are harsh. Should the Court make allowance for this in the sentencing process? 
     
      
    85 In a Daily Telegraph Editorial published 30 June 2006, the editor captioned his article “Shed no tears for this terrorist”. In the body of the article, which related to the present offender, the writer said (dealing with the evidence of harshness of incarceration): - 
     
      
       
        
        “We’re now supposed to feel sorry for him as he languishes, friendless and alone in his prison cell? What? This bloke is our enemy.” 
        
       
       
      And later: - 
       
       
        
        “Aligned with the world’s worst butchers and psychopaths, Lodhi deserves only to be locked up for a very long time, away from the fellowship even of other prisoners, out of sight and out of mind. And if his gaol term is a torment to him, few will shed any tears for that”. 
        
       
      
    86 This somewhat vengeful attitude is a sorry reflection of the recent inroads made into our normally tolerant and decent society. The Court reflects no doubt, or it should do so, the attitudes of society when it imposes sentence on a serious offender. Our society, a free and democratic one, allows for a variety of attitudes in such a situation. No doubt, the Telegraph editorial reflects one such attitude. But it seems to me that, no matter how much we may deplore and disapprove of a particular offender, no matter how repulsive we may find his or her actions, we sacrifice our essential decency if we fail to treat him or her as a fellow human being.  
     
      
    87 If the vengeful attitude to which I have referred is allowed to override our traditional values, the war against terror will be over and we will have lost. Rather, I consider the position is well stated by the writer, Richard Ackland in his published comment in the Sydney Morning Herald on July 7, 2006. In a different context from the present, he spoke of “the sheer folly of sacrificing our decency in the name of fighting terrorism”. 
     
      
    88 In my view, the Court is entitled to make some allowance in the sentencing process for the conditions of imprisonment, which will be imposed on the offender here. This is particularly so because of the fact that those conditions of imprisonment are imposed by virtue of a classification following on conviction. It emerges from the terms of a regulation rather than by way of a detailed subjective assessment of his situation or any detailed analysis of the crimes he has committed. In the present matter, however, I do not consider that the allowance should be in any sense a substantial one, or even one that can or should be mathematically calculated. It needs to be borne in mind that the offender is in fact coping very well with his prison situation and that this is no doubt, at least in part, occasioned by his religious convictions. Secondly, it is clear that his classification is not set in concrete and that the possibility of a less onerous re-classification is by no means out of the question. As the sentencing Judge, I would recommend to the prison authorities that they ought not lose sight of the need to consider the re-classification of the offender at a relatively early stage during his prison term. 
     
      
    89 I now turn to consider the general sentencing considerations that, in my view, are the most prominent in the present sentencing exercise. I have, of course, given consideration to the offender’s subjective circumstances to the extent I am able to do so. Those matters, however, are to be given less weight in the present matter than the important principles of general deterrence and denunciation.  
     
      
    90 The offences in respect of which the offender has been convicted are offences that were brought into existence following upon the original anti-terrorism enactments of 12 March 2002. Those earlier enactments themselves were a package of legislation prepared in response to the changed security environment in existence, following the terrible events of September 11, 2001. At that time, the Attorney-General observed, “September 11 is a stark example of the horror and devastation that can be caused by acts of terrorism. Terrorism has the potential to destroy lives, devastate communities and threaten the national and global economy. For these reasons this Government has affirmed its commitment to combating terrorism in all of its forms. We join with the international community in condemning the 11 September attacks and other terrorist activities”. 
     
      
    91 The need for substantial sentences to reflect the principles of general deterrence are obvious in relation to crimes of this kind. Such crimes are hard to detect; they are likely to be committed by members of our own community and often by persons of prior good character and favourable background. One has only to consider the tragedy of the London bombings in 2005 to recognise this observation as a sad truism. Moreover, terrorism is an increasing evil in our world and a country like Australia, with its very openness and trusting nature, is likely to fall easy prey to the horrors of terrorist activities.  
     
      
    92 In those circumstances, the obligation of the Court is to denounce terrorism and voice its stern disapproval of activities such as those contemplated by the offender here. It may be argued that the imposition of stern penalties, in the context of firm denunciatory statements, will not in fact deter those whose religious and political ideologies are extreme and fanatical. But a stand must be taken. The community is owed this protection even if the obstinacy and madness of extreme views may mean that the protection is a fragile or uncertain one. In my view, the Courts must speak firmly and with conviction in matters of this kind. This does not of course mean that general sentencing principles are undervalued or that matters favourable to an offender are to be overlooked. It does mean, however, that in offences of this kind, as I have said, the principles of denunciation and deterrence are to play a substantial role. There is also a need to recognise that the imposition of a substantial sentence may have a personal impact as a deterrent on this offender so that upon his release he will, it is cautiously hoped, be unlikely or less likely to re-offend. In addition to general deterrence, the need to deter this man from future offences is a potent factor in the sentencing process. 
     
      
    93 These are new offences and there is little assistance in decided cases in Australia, which can give the Court guidance as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed. Mr Boulten SC referred me to a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Western Australia in Roach’s case [2005] WASCA 4. Jack Roach was charged with a conspiracy to commit an offence provided by the Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons) Act 1976 (Commonwealth), s 8(3C)(a). As particularised in the charge, this was the offence of intentionally destroying or damaging by means of an explosive, the premises of the Israeli Embassy in Canberra within intent to endanger the lives of internationally protected persons by that damage or destruction. The primary offence carried a liability to imprisonment to 25 years. This therefore was the maximum penalty available for the conspiracy charged.  
     
      
    94 The circumstances of the charge and trial were very unusual. Roach was engaged in the conspiracy between March and September 2000. His role in the conspiracy was essentially to carry out surveillance on the Embassy in Canberra and to send the material to Afghanistan for further planning. He was also asked to recruit members for an al-Qaeda cell in Australia. He did not have a role to play in the contemplated damage by means of explosive of the Embassy building. Roach embraced his role with enthusiasm at first. Shortly afterwards, however, he withdrew from the conspiracy and played no further part for over two years before he was taken into custody. It appears, so the trial Judge held, that Roach had lost enthusiasm for the conspiracy generally. Indeed, he attempted to make contact with ASIO and with other authorities but without success. Nothing further happened for about two years at which time he was arrested. Roach pleaded guilty at trial and the trial Judge found that there was no prospect that he would be involved in anything of this kind again. The trial Judge also expressed the view that Roach’s prospects of rehabilitation were good and that he was fully contrite for his involvement in the conspiracy. Moreover, he was given an allowance both for past co-operation and promised future co-operation. His guilty plea was recognised as well.  
     
      
    95 In the upshot, Roach was sentence to ten years imprisonment, reduced to nine years on account of promised future co-operation. A non-parole period of four and a half years was fixed. His sentence was backdated to the time of his arrest. The trial Judge made allowance for the plea of guilty and co-operation previously given to the AFP and ASIO. The trial Judge said he would have imposed a sentence two years greater had those circumstances not been present. 
     
      
    96 The Court of Criminal Appeal, by majority (Murray ACJ and Templeman J agreeing with McKechnie J in dissent) dismissed the Crown appeal, which had been brought alleging manifest inadequacy in the sentence imposed by the trial Judge. There was also an application for leave to appeal against sentence brought by Roach himself but leave was not granted. 
     
      
    97 Both the Acting Chief Justice and Templeman J mentioned in their separate decisions that an important factor in disposing of the appeal was the fact that it was a Crown appeal (see Murray ACJ at para 17; Templeman J at 63). McKechnie J in dissent would have allowed the Crown appeal and imposed a sentence of 16 years reduced by one year to take in account future co-operation. His Honour concluded that an appropriate period for parole would be one of nine years. 
     
      
    98 The facts I have outlined make it clear, in my view that Roach’s case is not of any great assistance in the present matter. The offence was a different one; the maximum penalty was 25 years and not life imprisonment as is the situation with count 2 here. In addition, the circumstances which led Roach to quit the conspiracy in which he was involved were highly unusual. Moreover, his assistance to the authorities, both past and future, stand in stark contrast to the situation of the present offender. Roach pleaded guilty whereas the offender here continues to maintain his innocence. Moreover, Roach’s involvement in the conspiracy was, according to the trial Judge and the majority in the Court of Criminal Appeal, quite limited as I have earlier indicated. 
     
      
    99 Mr Boulten SC also referred to a number of overseas “terrorist” cases. These included the Queen v Boutrab (2005) NICC 36; a Dutch case involving a defendant Lamrani who was charged with an offence of “recruiting for jihad and membership of a criminal organisation with terrorist intent” (February 2006); and R v Abu Mansha who was convicted of possessing information “likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism” (reported in Guardian Unlimited 29 June 2006). 
     
      
    100 So far as the “tariffs” reflected in these various European decisions, I find that they are of little or no assistance (R v Brownlow (2004) NSWCCA 465). The nature of the offences themselves, and the penalties applicable are, in the main, very different from the legislation underlying the convictions against the present offender. 
     
      
       
       
      Pronouncement of Sentence 
       
      
    101 What sentence then should be imposed on the offender for these offences? 
     
      
    102 It is necessary to state once again that although the overall criminal culpability of the offender is very high indeed, the Crown has properly conceded that these offences do not fall within the worst case situation. It is also necessary to repeat that the Crown has not sought the imposition of a life sentence in respect of count 2. As I have said earlier, I agree with the assumptions and propositions underlying these fair and appropriate concessions made on behalf of the Crown. 
     
      
    103 Nevertheless, the sentence to be imposed, especially for count 2, must be a substantial one to reflect the important principles of deterrence and denunciation. In relation to count 2 the appropriate sentence, in my view, is one of imprisonment for a term of 20 years. The sentence is to commence on 22 April 2004 and to expire on 21 April 2024.  
     
      
    104 In relation counts 1 and 3 in the indictment, an appropriate sentence in each case, in my view, is one of imprisonment for a term of ten years. The sentence is to commence in each case on 22 April 2004 and is to expire on 21 April 2014. As will be apparent, these two sentences are to be served entirely concurrently with the sentence to be imposed in relation to count 2. The structure of the sentence is intended to reflect the totality of the criminality in all three offences. 
     
      
    105 Section 19AB of the Crimes Act 1914 (Commonwealth) requires of the Court in the present circumstances that it fix a single non-parole period. The purpose of the non-parole period is to provide a mitigation of the punishment of the offender in favour of rehabilitation through conditional freedom. The non-parole period however must incorporate all the relevant sentencing principles including denunciation and deterrence. Prior to the enactment of s 19AG of the Crimes Act 1914 (Commonwealth) – see Item 1B of Schedule 1 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 2004 – the normal range for a non-parole period was between 60-66 per cent of the total sentence (R v Bernier (1998) 102 A Crim R 44), although a higher non-parole period, up to 75 per cent in the most serious cases, might be justified. The new legislation specifically applies to the present offences. It makes it obligatory for the Court to fix the single non-parole period at a percentage of at least 3/4 of the sentence. Where two or more sentences have been imposed on a person, the relevant percentage must relate to the aggregate of those sentences.  
     
      
    106 As a consequence of these legislative changes, the single non-parole period in the present matter must be for a period of at least 15 years. The Crown has, very properly, submitted that, although the Court is at liberty to impose a non-parole period which is in fact more than 75 per cent of the aggregate of the sentences, it does not suggest that the Court should do so in the present matter. 
     
      
    107 I have given particular consideration to the recent written submissions made by both the Crown and Mr Boulten SC. These relate specifically to the application of s 19AG. I do not however accept the submission made on the offender’s behalf that, because of the operation of s 19 AG, it is in some way necessary to fix a lower head sentence than might otherwise have been appropriate.  
     
      
    108 As a consequence, in the present matters, it is my conclusion that a non-parole period of 15 years should apply. This is consistent with the legislation and with the submissions made on behalf of the Crown. Moreover, I consider that both the head sentence and the proposed non-parole period I have selected reflect adequately and appropriately the application of the general sentencing principles I have stated. Any lesser sentence would not, in my view, adequately address those important sentencing principles in the case of this offender and would, in relation to the proportion between the non-parole period and the head sentence, be inconsistent with the terms of the legislation. 
     
      
    109 The non-parole will commence on 22 April 2004 and it will expire on 21 April 2019.  
     
      
       
      Faheem Khalid Lodhi, in relation to the second charge in the indictment presented against you in this matter, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 20 years commencing on 22 April 2004 and expiring on 21 April 2024. 
       
      
    110 In relation to count 1 in the indictment, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment for ten years. This sentence is to commence on 22 April 2004 and will expire on 21 April 2014. 
     
      
    111 In relation to the third charge in the indictment, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment for ten years. This sentence should commence on 22 April 2004 and expire on 21 April 2014. The sentences in respect of counts 1 and 3 are to be served concurrently with the sentence in relation to count 2 and with each other. 
     
      
    112 In relation to the three sentences, I fix a single non-parole period in respect of those sentences for 15 years commencing on 22 April 2004 and expiring on 21 April 2019. 
     
      
       
      Explanation 
       
      
    113 I am obliged to explain to the offender the effect of the orders I have made. 
     
      
    114 Faheem Lodhi, the sentences I have imposed means that you will be obliged to spend a minimum period in custody of 15 years. You will be eligible for release on 21 April 2019. 
     
      
    115 It will be a matter for the Attorney-General as to whether you will be released on that day and that may depend upon your behaviour in prison. It will also be a matter for the Attorney-General to determine whether any conditions should apply to you while you are at conditional liberty upon parole after 21 April 2019. If you are released on that day, you will remain on parole for a further period of five years. If you were to breach your parole, you may be required to return to prison to serve the balance of the term of your sentence.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court by Latham DCJ, as she then was (the Judge). On 19 November 2004 the applicant pleaded guilty to four counts on an indictment, being two counts of fraudulent misappropriation contrary to s 178A of the Crimes Act and two counts of obtaining money by deception contrary to s 178BA of the same Act. In respect of the s 178A offences the maximum penalty is imprisonment for seven years and in respect of the s 178BA the maximum penalty is imprisonment for five years. There was also before the court a Form 1 setting out seven offences, being three offences contrary to s 178A and four offences contrary to s 178BA. 
     
      
    3 On 17 February 2005 the Judge pronounced sentences to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Count 1: imprisonment for five years to date from 17 February 2005 with a non-parole period of three years to expire on 16 February 2008. 
         
         
        Count 2: imprisonment for three years to date from 17 February 2005 with no non-parole period. 
         
         
        Count 3: imprisonment for four years to date from 17 February 2007 with a non-parole of two years to expire on 16 February 2009. 
         
         
        Count 4: imprisonment for three and a half years to date from 17 February 2009 with a non-parole period of nine months to expire on 16 November 2009. 
        
       
       
      This is an effective sentence of imprisonment for seven and a half years with a minimum period to be served of four years and nine months. The applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 16 November 2009. 
       
      
    4 It is to be noted that the Judge did not specify that she had taken into account the matters on the Form 1 when sentencing for any of the counts on the indictment. However, the Judge had indicated during the sentencing proceedings that she was amending the Form 1 to specify that the matters were to be taken into account when sentencing for the offences committed on 18 November 2002, that is the third count on the indictment. The applicant was legally represented at the hearing and there was no objection to the Judge taking that course. The Judge in the sentencing remarks indicated that the applicant had asked her to take the matters into account on the third count. 
     
      
    5 On the back of the indictment the sentences are noted to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Count 3 (together with the matters on the Form 1): a sentence of imprisonment for five years to date from 17.2.2005 with a non-parole period of three years to expire on 16.2.2008. 
         
         
        Count 2: a sentence of imprisonment for three years fixed term to date from 17.2.2005 and to expire on 16.2.2008. 
         
         
        Count 1: a sentence of imprisonment for four years to date from 17.2.2007 with a non-parole period of 2 yrs to expire on 16.2.2009 
         
         
        Count 4: a sentence of imprisonment for three and a half years to date from 17.2.2009 with a non-parole period of nine months to expire on 16.11.2009. 
         
         
        The effective head sentence is seven and a half years with a non-parole period of four and a half years. 
        
       
      
    6 It is obvious that the sentences noted on the back of the indictment are inconsistent with the sentences as pronounced by the Judge in so far as counts 1 and 3 are concerned. However it is also obvious that the sentences as entered on the indictment, the record of the District Court, are in conformity with what the Judge intended, in that the longest sentence was going to apply to the third count taking into account the matters on the Form 1. The applicant conceded that this was so at the hearing before this Court. 
     
      
    7 The applicant appeared for himself for the purposes of this application. He originally relied upon six grounds of appeal and filed written submissions in support of them. At the hearing of the appeal, however, he abandoned the first two grounds as a result of what the Crown had written in response to them. The following grounds were argued by the applicant: 
     
      
       
        
         
        3. The sentencing judge's sentence was uncertain in that her Honour intended to sentenced the Appellant to a Non-Parole Period (""NPP"") of 4½ years, but the dates of the sentences culminate in a NPP of 4 years 9 months. 
         
         
        4. The sentence on Count 1 is manifestly excessive in that a 5 years sentence (or, a 4 year sentence) for fraudulently misappropriating $7,250 is inappropriate and not within the range of sentencing for the objective and subjective circumstances of the Appellant. 
         
         
        5. The sentence on Count 2 is manifestly excessive in that a fixed 3 year sentence for obtaining $10,000 by deception is inappropriate and not within the range of sentencing for the objective and subjective circumstances of the Appellant 
         
         
        6. The sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to the fact that 3 (Counts 2-5) of the 4 offences occurred over a period of only 5 months, and that the other offence (Count one) occurred in a period of time prior to the Appellant serving a custodial sentence. 
         
        
       
      
    8 The facts can be stated relatively briefly and are derived from an agreed statement of facts tendered before the Judge. The applicant was a former solicitor, his practising certificate being cancelled in April 1999 for dishonesty offences. He was at the time of the offences for which he was being sentenced subject to an order of the Supreme Court forbidding him from holding himself out to be a solicitor. 
     
      
    9 The applicant had known the victim of the first count on the indictment and the first matter on the Form 1, Mr Napoli, since 1997 and had acted for him as a solicitor in a number of matters. In March 2001 Mr Napoli consulted the applicant and was advised to set up a trust in respect of a unit he owned. Mr Napoli was informed that stamp duty of $11,240 was to be paid on the trust document. On 2 May 2001 Mr Napoli handed the applicant $7,250 on account of stamp duty and was given a receipt. The applicant showed him what purported to be a trust document. On 21 May 2001 Mr Napoli handed the applicant a further cash sum of $4000 and received another receipt. In June 2001 the applicant handed Mr Napoli what purported to be a stamped trust document showing that duty of $11,240 had been paid. Mr Napoli then signed the document. In October of that year Mr Napoli became concerned about the trust document and made inquiries with the tax office and the law society. He spoke to the applicant who said to give him the original of the document and he would take care of things. Mr Napoli gave him the document but thereafter was never able to make contact with the applicant again. The stamp on the document proved to be a forgery. Mr Napoli never recovered the money he had paid to the applicant. 
     
      
    10 The second count on the indictment related to the applicant’s dealings with Mr Zaher, an accountant. He required a solicitor because of difficulties arising with his landlord and was referred to the applicant. Mr Zaher spoke to the applicant by phone. The applicant advised him that he was aware of his problems and that Mr Zaher had a good case against the landlord. The applicant indicated that he was prepared to act for him and required $10,000 in legal fees and $2,000 court costs. On 7 August 2002 Mr Zaher attended on the applicant’s premises in Market Street and the applicant introduced himself as a solicitor. He advised Mr Zaher that he only handled trade and commercial disputes and operated from home. Mr Zaher was advised that the $10,000 would be held in trust and returned if he were unsuccessful in the legal proceedings. If that were the case, he would only be liable for the court fees. He also told Mr Zaher that he would charge $300 an hour up to a total of $3,000 if the matter were settled out of court. 
     
      
    11 Mr Zaher obtained a bank cheque for $10,000 and handed it to the applicant. In return he received a letter of agreement and a receipt for $12,000. Mr Zaher noticed the discrepancy in the receipt and was informed by the applicant that it was a mistake. On that date, 7 November, the cheque was paid into the applicant’s account with Crown Casino in Melbourne. On 14 August Mr Zaher spoke to the applicant about what action he had taken in his matter and at his request was sent a letter by the applicant on 15 August advising him that he had written to the landlord’s solicitors. In September 2002 the matter was resolved and on 25 November Mr Zaher spoke to the applicant requesting the return of his money. It was agreed between them that the applicant was be paid $500 for the letter he had written and the $10,000 returned. Mr Zaher sent the applicant a cheque for $500 but never received any money in return. When police spoke to the applicant about this complaint he told them it was a civil matter. 
     
      
    12 Count 3 and the fifth matter on the Form 1 related to the applicant’s dealings with Mr and Ms Afram who sought his assistance in the purchase of a house in Condell Park. Ms Afram informed the applicant that she wished to pay a deposit of 20 per cent but he advised her to pay 10 per cent to the agent and place the other 10 per cent together with an amount for stamp duty into his trust account. A little time later the applicant advised Ms Afram to pay the 10 per cent to the agent and this she did. A few days later the applicant told her to obtain two cheques, one for the balance of the deposit in the sum of $42,200 and one for stamp duty in an amount of $16,500. He also told her he wanted $1,500 in cash as his fees. He instructed her to make the cheques payable to him as they were to be banked into his trust account. 
     
      
    13 Ms Afram had a cheque drawn payable to the applicant for $16,500 and the applicant came to her house to collect it. The cheque was paid into an account at the Crown Casino. This amount gave rise to the matter on the Form 1. Ms Afram later drew a cheque for $42,200 payable to the applicant. Again the applicant came to her home and collected the cheque and was given $1,500 in cash as fees for acting on her behalf. That cheque was also paid into an account at Crown Casino. A few weeks later the applicant advised Ms Afram that the matter could not be settled because of a caveat on the title. Later he informed her that settlement would occur on 15 January 2003. However, the day before settlement the applicant advised that settlement was further delayed. Ms Afram and her husband indicated that they would not proceed further and the applicant told them they would have their money refunded. However, the vendor declined to cancel the contract, as there was no obstacle to settlement. The applicant assured Ms Afram that he was a solicitor and would sort out the problem. In September 2003 the applicant informed Ms Afram that he had used her money and was obtaining a loan to repay her. She and her husband never received any of the money paid to the applicant. 
     
      
    14 Count 4 and the sixth matter on the Form 1 related to dealings between the applicant and Mr and Mrs Germanos. They were interested in purchasing a unit in Concord, however, an offer was made by another purchaser. They were recommended to the applicant as a solicitor by a mutual friend. Ms Germanos contacted the applicant and was advised that, if they offered more money to the vendor, they might be successful. On 13 December 2002 she provided the applicant with a cheque payable to the applicant for $18,000. He later advised her that he needed a further $23,000 and on 20 December 2002 a cheque in this amount was given to the applicant as deposit for the purchase. He was also to be paid $1,000 in solicitor’s fees. The applicant issued a receipt for $40,000. When the unit was sold to the other party, Ms Germanos asked the applicant to return their money. On 4 February 2003 the applicant handed them a cheque for $41,000. However, they did not bank the cheque and requested the applicant deposit cash into their account. On 5 February the applicant deposited a cheque but it was later dishonoured. On 18 February a sum of $1,000 was banked into the account but Mr and Ms Germanos never received any other money from the applicant. The two cheques given to the applicant were banked into an account at Crown Casino. 
     
      
    15 As a result of the frauds committed by the applicant he received $82,000 in respect of the matters on the indictment and $140,000 from the Form 1 matters. The offences were committed over a period from 2 May 2001 to 24 January 2003. The offence in the first count on the indictment was committed while the applicant was on bail for dishonesty offences for which he was later gaoled. The other offences on the indictment and six of the matters on the Form 1 were committed while the applicant was on parole. 
     
      
    16 A pre-sentence report was in evidence before the Judge. It disclosed that the applicant, who was aged 44 years, immigrated from Lebanon in 1969 and became an Australian citizen in 1970. Since 2003 he has been in a de facto partnership and has a young child from that relationship. He told the officer preparing the report that he believed his partner and child helped him to refrain from offending. The officer thought that the de facto was very naïve as to the applicant’s criminal behaviour. The applicant has degrees in law and history. He was admitted as a solicitor in 1994. At the time of the report the applicant was working as a management consultant. 
     
      
    17 The applicant said that he expressed feelings of guilt and anguish for the offences. He told the officer that he used the money to play Baccarat at the Crown Casino in order to refund money he had stolen in the past. In a pre-sentence report prepared for the earlier offences it was noted that the applicant had a gambling addiction and the view had been expressed that he was not motivated to address the problem. The report prepared for the later sentencing proceedings indicated that the applicant was abstaining from gambling and that his attitude seemed more positive. 
     
      
    18 There was also in evidence a report from a psychiatrist, Dr Allcock. He reported that the applicant commenced gambling in 1997 at the age of 36. Eventually he was gambling $1,000 per hand and attending the casino every day. His gambling led to the offences for which he was gaoled in 2001 and for which he served a non-parole period of six months. On his release he fulfilled his promise of never attending Star City Casino again by switching to the Crown Casino. The applicant told the psychiatrist that he made the decision to cease gambling on New Years Eve 2003 after finding out that his partner was pregnant. He said that he had no urge to gamble in the future. The psychiatrist believed that he was unlikely to offend again. 
     
      
    19 The Judge gave the applicant the benefit of a discount of 10 per cent for the pleas of guilty coming on the first day of his trial for those offences. The Judge referred to Dr Allcock’s assessment of the likelihood of re-offending and indicated that this view must be “cautiously received” because of his re-offending while on parole. The Judge noted some evidence of contrition but added that it was “born of discovery”. Her Honour stated that the offences “call for considerable emphasis on the principles of general and specific deterrence, punishment and denunciation in the sentences to be imposed”. She also noted that the applicant had offended in breach of a position of trust that he had secured over the victims by holding out that he was a solicitor. 
     
      
    20 The applicant addressed this Court and it is clear from what he said and from his written submissions that he is a highly intelligent man. It is also clear that he is deeply distressed because of his current situation. He was accompanied by his partner, his child and apparently other members of his immediate family. He stressed to the Court that his gambling had been his downfall and that he had made a belated, but genuine, commitment to reform since committing the offences for which he was sentenced. 
     
      
    21 He sought to rely upon an affidavit detailing his plans to attend a programme offered by the Salvation Army to assist gamblers and outlining the progress he had made towards obtaining a degree in psychology from the University of Southern Queensland. The affidavit asks the Court to make orders permitting him to attend the Salvation Army course and then to suspend the balance of his sentence. However, it was made clear to the applicant, and he appeared to understand, that the Court could only consider this material if it became necessary to exercise its discretion in re-sentencing him. 
     
      
    22 The Crown conceded that the third ground of appeal had merit in that her Honour’s intention as stated on the back of the indictment was to impose an overall non-parole period of four and a half years but the sentences as imposed resulted in a non-parole period of four years and nine months. The Crown accepted that the applicant should receive the benefit of any doubt arising from this discrepancy and that the Court should readjust the sentences to lessen the total non-parole period by three months. 
     
      
    23 The applicant’s major complaint was that the sentences were manifestly excessive having regard to the amount of money involved in his frauds and the fact that he was suffering at the time from a pathological state so far as his compulsion to gamble was concerned. Although he accepted that his offending while on parole was a seriously aggravating factor, he pointed to the fact that he had been released to parole without the benefit of any guidance or counselling to assist in overcoming his gambling addiction. He noted that Dr Allnut believed that he was unlikely to re-offend particularly if he were given the support of counselling such as could be provided by the Salvation Army. 
     
      
    24 The applicant asked the Court to take into account that, because of his gambling addiction, he operated at the time of his offending under the illusion that he would be able to repay any money he obtained by his frauds from his further gambling winnings. Therefore, he argued, he never intended to permanently deprive any of his victims of their money and thus his moral and criminal culpability was significantly diminished. 
     
      
    25 The applicant asked the Court to consider making the sentences for the first three counts completely concurrent so that the non-parole period that her Honour intended to impose would be reduced by a further period of 12 months. He submitted that the sentence would then properly reflect his subjective circumstances and the pro-active steps he had taken to address his gambling and its consequential criminal behaviour. 
     
      
    26 There is in my view no error in the sentences imposed by her Honour or evidence from the remarks on sentence. The applicant must understand that this Court is only authorised to interfere if patent error can be shown or where the Court is satisfied that the sentence imposed is plainly unjust. Objectively the applicant’s offences were very serious. They were calculated frauds intended to obtain for him gambling funds by deceiving his victims into trusting in him as a solicitor who was acting in their best interests. They were all committed while he was on conditional liberty and the majority of them after he had served a period in custody for the very same criminal behaviour. 
     
      
    27 The applicant was apparently treated with considerable leniency by the Local Court in 2001. No doubt this was due in part because of his gambling habit and his promises of reform. The applicant acknowledged so much to this Court. Yet very shortly after his release to parole he set about defrauding ordinary members of the community of large sums of money by preying on their trust in a person who they believed to be a member of the legal profession. Although his gambling habit may explain his fall into such serious criminal conduct and give some hope of rehabilitation in the future, it has been held to be a rare case where an offender can seek mitigation of penalty based upon an addiction to gambling, even where it is pathological: R v Molesworth [1999] NSWCCA 43. In my opinion because of the fact that the bulk of these offences were committed while on parole for the very same type of criminal conduct and because the offences were premeditated and calculated to deprive people of substantial sums of money, they fall outside that rare case where significant allowance might be made for the applicant’s compulsion to gamble. 
     
      
    28 Although the amounts of money involved in the charges were not as substantial as, unfortunately, is sometime the case in frauds of this type, the amount of loss to the victim is only one of the relevant considerations in determining the seriousness of the offences and it is not necessarily decisive. It is important to recognise in this case that the offences on the indictment and in the Form1 represented a period of repeated offending in which the applicant set about achieving a fund of money that he could use for his gambling needs and at the same time promoting false expectations in the minds of his victims who came to him for his assistance as a trusted member of the legal profession. 
     
      
    29 Apart from arguing that the overall sentence was too harsh, the applicant could advance no reason why the Judge was in error in making the sentence for the first count partially cumulative with the sentence for the third count. Although the offence in the first count was committed prior to his receiving a gaol sentence in 2001, as has already been noted it was committed while on bail for those offences and was a separate and distinct act of serious criminality from both those matters and the other offences for which sentence was passed by her Honour. I am far from convinced that the total sentence imposed was disproportionate to the total criminality before the Judge. 
     
      
    30 I would propose that leave to appeal be granted and the appeal be allowed but only in so far as it is necessary to address the apparent discrepancy in the period of the overall non-parole period specified and the date given for the expiry of the non-parole period. Therefore, I propose that in respect of count 4 the non-parole period specified by the Judge be quashed and in lieu there be specified a non-parole period of 6 months to expire on 16 August 2009, the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole. 
     
      
    31 ROTHMAN J: I agree with Howie J.6 October 200632 THE COURT Since the Court delivered its judgment in this matter it has become apparent that the Court should make a further order as a consequence of reducing the non-parole period imposed in the District Court by Latham DCJ. This is necessary because on 4 March 2005 the applicant was sentenced in the Supreme Court to concurrent sentences consisting of a non-parole period of 3 months and a head sentence of 12 months in respect of charges of contempt. These sentences were to commence on 17 November 2009, that is the date upon which the non-parole period of the sentences imposed in the District court expired.Because the effective non-parole period of the sentences imposed by Latham DCJ will now expire on 16 August 2009, there is a gap between the expiration of that non-parole period and the commencement of the sentences for contempt. This problem can be cured by altering the commencement date of the contempt sentences by utilisation of the provisions of s 59 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.Accordingly the Court orders that the sentences imposed for contempt in the Supreme Court on 4 March 2005 are each to commence on 17 August 2009 and the non-parole period of 3 months is to expire on 16 November 2009 the date upon which the applicant is to be released to parole. The total term of each sentence is to expire on 16 August 2010.

     WOOD V. THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS & ORS. 
      
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: On 24 June 2005, Mr Thompson, Magistrate, heard proceedings in which the claimant was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The magistrate found the offence proved but dismissed the charge, conditional upon the claimant entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for twelve months pursuant to s.10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The claimant appealed to the District Court, and on 22 November 2005 his Honour Judge Black QC dismissed the appeal and confirmed the order and finding of the Magistrate. 
     
      
    2 The claimant has applied to this Court for an order in the nature of certiorari quashing those orders, and an order in the nature of mandamus directing the District Court to determine the claimant’s appeal according to law. The claimant’s appeal to the District Court was brought pursuant to part 3 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (the Act). Sections 18 and 19 of the Act as follows.  
     
      
       
        
        18 Appeals against conviction to be by way of rehearing on the transcripts of evidence 
         
        (1) An appeal against conviction is to be by way of rehearing on the basis of certified transcripts of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings, except as provided by section 19. 
         
        (2) Fresh evidence may be given, but only by leave of the District Court which may be granted only if the Court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that the fresh evidence be given. 
         
        (3) The parties to an appeal are each entitled to be provided with one free copy of the certified transcripts of evidence relevant to the appeal and, if fresh evidence is given, one free copy of the transcript of the fresh evidence. 
         
         
        19 Circumstances in which evidence to be given in person 
         
        (1) The District Court may direct a person to attend and give evidence in proceedings on an appeal against conviction if it is satisfied:  
         
        (a) in the case of an appeal that relates to an offence involving violence against that person, that there are special reasons why, in the interests of justice, the person should attend and give evidence, or 
         
        (b) in any other case, that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the person should attend and give evidence. 
         
        (2) An application for such a direction may be made by a party to the proceedings in relation to a particular person only if notice of the party’s intention to make such an application has been served on each other party to the proceedings within such period as the District Court may direct. 
         
        (3) If an application for such a direction is refused, the District Court must give reasons for the refusal. 
         
        (4) A direction may be withdrawn only on the application, or with the consent, of the appellant. 
         
        (5) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the determination of special or substantial reasons for the purposes of subsection (1). 
         
        (6) Without limiting subsection (5), in determining whether special or substantial reasons exist, the District Court must have regard to whether or not the appellant was legally represented for the whole or any part of the original Local Court proceedings. 
        
       
      
    3 In his judgment disposing of the appeal, the primary judge expressed the issue he was determining and his reasons for determining it as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        Now as far as I am concerned, it is not tor me to think what I might have done, because I did not hear the witnesses. It is for me to look at the material before the magistrate, and decide first of all whether there is material before him, justifying him reaching the conclusion which he did, and then further examining the material to see whether the magistrate applied any wrong principles, or reached a conclusion which no reasonable person on the material could conceivably have reached.  
         
         
        Well as I have already indicated, there was material entitled the magistrate to reach the conclusion that he did, namely to find that after the un-pleasantries were over, there was a further gratuitous insult from Mr Fittler whereupon, the appellant seized a piece of timber and turned and attacked Mr Fittler.  
         
         
        There have been careful submissions by Mr Donaghy as to why there would be no reason to accept the evidence of Mr Fittler. There has been reference to Mrs Fittler. I have considered those with care, but I am satisfied there was appropriate material before the magistrate entitling him to form the view that he did, which was to accept the evidence of Mr Fittler as to this particular aspect of the incident, and what he seems to have done was to give full effect to the conduct of Mr Fittler in giving rise to that situation in the nature of the sentence he felt appropriate.  
         
         
        As far as the finding of guilt is concerned, there was material entitling the magistrate to make the finding he did, and in those circumstances it is not for me to substitute anything that I think I might have done, even if I were minded to do so. 
        
       
      
    4 Since that decision was given, there have been two cases which authoritatively determine the correct approach to be taken towards appeals of this nature, those cases being Gianoutsos v Glykis [2006] NSWCCA 137, and Charara v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 244.  
     
      
    5 The former case establishes that in cases of appeals pursuant to s.8 of the Act, the issue for the District Court judge is not whether error is shown in the decision of the magistrate, but whether the District Court judge is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the claimant.  
     
      
    6 The following appears in paras [37] and [38] of that decision: 
     
      
       
        
        37 In  
        Allesch v Maunz 
         (2000) 203 CLR 172 the High Court considered the appeal provisions under the  
        Family Court Act 
        . In the course of the joint judgment of Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ their Honour’s said at 180: 
         
         
          
          “For present purposes, the critical difference between an appeal by way of rehearing and a hearing de novo is that, in the former case, the powers of the appellate court are exercisable only where the appellant can demonstrate that, having regard to all the evidence now before the appellate court, the order that is the subject of the appeal is the result of some legal, factual or discretionary error (see  
          CDJ v VAJ  
          (1998) 197 CLR 172 at 201-202), whereas, in the latter case, those powers may be exercised regardless of error.  
          At least that is so unless, in the case of an appeal by way of rehearing, there is some statutory provision which indicates that the powers may be exercised regardless of error. 
          ” (emphasis added) 
          
         
         
        38 In the present case, the legislation does indicate that the District Court’s appellate powers may be exercised regardless of error. Section 20 of the  
        Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001  
        (NSW) provides that on an appeal from a magistrate the District Court may either set aside a conviction (or in this case an APVO), or it may dismiss the appeal. The District Court is not limited to ordering fresh proceedings in the court below. Indeed, unlike the Supreme Court (see s 55(1)(b) of the  
        Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001  
        (NSW)), the District Court is given no express power to remit the matter back to the Local Court for redetermination in accordance with its directions. In  
        R v Kurtic 
         (1996) 85 A Crim R 57, Hunt CJ at CL noted that the power to determine an appeal otherwise than by ordering fresh proceedings would indicate that a court with such a power is not a court of error (at 59-60). 
        
       
      
    7 The latter case establishes that the principles set out in Fox v Percy (2003) 214 CLR 118, are still relevant, so that the judge has regard to the circumstances that he or she is deciding the case on a transcript and that the magistrate had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses. This case, nevertheless, leaves undisturbed the principles set out in Gianoutsos that the question to be addressed is not whether error is shown, but whether the District Court judge is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the claimant. 
     
      
    8 Having regard to those principles, it is clear from the passage I have quoted that the District Court judge in this case did not approach the question before him as required by law, and the claimant has not had the appeal which the statute provides.  
     
      
    9 In those circumstances, it is common ground that the orders sought by the claimant should be made.  
     
      
    10 For those reasons, I propose to make orders 1, 2 and 3 in the Amended Summons and an order that the first opponent pay the claimant’s costs of these proceedings. 
     
      
    11 IPP JA: I agree. 
     
      
    12 TOBIAS JA: I also agree. 
     
      
    13 HODGSON JA: Those are the orders of the Court.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    GROVE J:  
     
      
    1 I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Hislop J in draft. I agree with his Honour and with the orders which he proposes and I wish only to make some brief observations about some matters canvassed at the hearing of the appeal. 
     
      
    2 In this case it was open to conclude that there was no real distinction between the position of the applicant and the co-offender Li but that derives from the particular facts and not from any principle that the liability shared by the participants in a joint criminal enterprise translates in every case to an equality in culpability and equivalence in sentence assessment. 
     
      
    3 Although not strictly comprehended within the ground as expressed, it was contended that the proportion of non-parole period to total term (calculated as 70.31%) did not give effect in any real sense to the sentencing judge’s finding of special circumstances. Analogy was sought to be derived from Sutton v R [2004] NSWCCA 225 where a reduction (on similar calculation) from 75% which would equate to the statutory ratio to “about” 70% was held not to give proper effect to such a finding.  
     
      
    4 In response, the Crown Prosecutor referred to Fidow v R [2004] NSWCCA 172 where, in respect of a total sentence of eleven years, the non-parole period was 72.7% was held to be within the range of discretion. 
     
      
    5 As is arithmetically obvious, the practical effect in terms of actual potential period of custody, will vary in accordance with length of total sentence when proportions in percentage terms are applied. Hence, a small percentage of a long term may reflect a result whereby there is an appreciably longer period of potential release to parole with a markedly contrasting result if applied to a shorter total term. 
     
      
    6 Neither case establishes that there will be a miscarriage of discretion determinable from bare percentage calculation and every situation should be gauged in the context of particular facts and circumstances. 
     
      
    7 KIRBY J: I agree with Hislop J. 
     
      
    HISLOP J:  
     
      
    8 On 22 July 2004 the applicant pleaded guilty to a charge that on 29 April 2003 in circumstances of aggravation, namely in company with other persons, he detained Zhong Qing Lin without his consent, with intent to obtain a financial advantage contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 s 86(2). The maximum penalty for such an offence is imprisonment for 20 years. 
     
      
    9 On 18 March 2005 the applicant was sentenced by Goldring DCJ for that offence to a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months imprisonment commencing on 29 May 2003 and expiring on 28 February 2007 and a balance of term of 1 year and 7 months imprisonment. In sentencing the applicant his Honour took into account on a form 1 an offence of demanding money with menaces in company contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 s 99(2). The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 14 years.  
     
      
    10 The facts of the offence as stated by the sentencing Judge were: 
     
      
       
        
        The victim, Mr Jong Chin Lin [sic Zhong Qing Lin], was a student at a language school in Sydney. A friend invited Mr Lin to meet her at the Cashbox Karaoke Club in Chinatown, and when he went there he was introduced to two of the other offenders, whom he recognised, because they had both been students of the language school. Some time later, a month or so later, he received a phone call from one of the other offenders, who indicated that he wanted to meet him and later that day another girl, known as Vivien Coco, approached him in the class room at the language school and told him some one wanted to see him downstairs. 
        
       
       
        
        He went downstairs where he met the prisoner, whom he had not met before. The prisoner told the victim to follow him to the toilets. The prisoner tried to drag the victim to a fire escape. While they were in the toilets another student entered the toilets and the prisoner kicked him on the bottom in response. While they were in the toilet, the prisoner told the victim that he knew the part of China where he came from, and that he came from the neighbouring province. He told the victim that a friend had informed him that the victim had been involved in a car accident and as a result the victim owed the friend $20,000. The victim said that was not correct because he had never driven a car. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The prisoner then made a phone call and then three other males came into the toilets. They told the victim to accompany them to the Pitt Street Mall where they met two other offenders, Li and Wu, whom he knew previously. Li and Wu then suggested that they go to the Cashbox Karaoke Club to talk and Li offered to protect the victim at that place. The prisoner then grabbed the victim and walked him to a taxi. The taxi went to Chinatown and all went to a private room in the Cashbox Karaoke club. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        When they were there the prisoner told the victim to place his phone and wallet on the table. He then went through the wallet, took $70 and personal cards and he demanded the pin number for the keycard. The victim provided a number which he thought was correct. The prisoner Lin told another co-offender to take the card to an ATM and that person left. The prisoner then returned the victim’s phone and told him to make calls to raise $20,000. The prisoner also told the victim that he needed to pay $5,400 in cash that day and then he could then write out an IOU for the balance.  
        
       
       
        
        The victim made a number of phone calls, 27 phone calls in fact, to raise money, and during that period the prisoner slapped him and told him to make the calls more rapidly. 
         
         
        The other offender returned and indicated that he could not use the credit card because the PIN number was incorrect, and the prisoner then punched the face of the victim. The offender, Li, said, “don’t punch him” and at that stage the prisoner indicated that he knew about property owned by the victim and indicated that the victim could use it to obtain a loan. 
        
       
       
        
        Other offenders found a walkman and a Swiss army knife in the victim’s bag and the prisoner then directed someone to see if those items could be pawned. The prisoner then told another person to check the ATM with another number that the victim provided, and the victim was told it was his last chance to provide the correct number. Some time later that other person returned and said the PIN number was still incorrect and the prisoner then punched the victim in the face and kicked him in the ribs. 
        
       
       
        
        One of the other offenders, not this prisoner, produced a knife and threatened to chop the victim’s fingers off if he did not provide the correct PIN number. The victim then asked Li to assist with money and Li said he would write an IOU to the offenders. The victim could write an IOU to him and the victim then wrote out an IOU promising to pay him $15,000 within a month. The prisoner then said that more security, such as a computer or a TV, was needed. The victim said he had a lap top computer at home and it was agreed that this would be given to the offender Li. 
        
       
       
        
        The friend who had agreed to lend money arrived and the victim went downstairs to get the $200. 
        
       
       
        
        Another offender, who apparently has not been apprehended, Gia Chin, told the victim that they would be in trouble with their boss if they did not get the money back. 
        
       
       
        
        The victim’s phone was taken but his SIM card was returned. Wu then threatened the victim and the prisoner told the victim not to repeat this matter to the police. The victim, with Li and some other offenders went by taxi to the victim’s house and obtained the computer. 
        
       
       
        
        The next day the victim reported the matter to the police and provided a statement. 
        
       
       
        
        Subsequently the victim received a phone call from the offender Lin [sic Li] pursuing repayment of the money and indeed Lin [sic Li] made a number of phone calls requesting money. These were intercepted by police who had obtained a warrant. The victim was fitted with a lawful listening device and a video camera, and was placed under surveillance by the police. He waited in the area of the language school on 13 May 2003. There the presence of the offenders Li, Quinn and a third offender were observed. There were a number of phone calls between Li and the victim. Money was paid to Quinn and the computer and the IOU notes were returned. Quinn was arrested in possession of the backpack containing the money that the victim had given him. Li was stopped after he had attempted to escape. 
        
       
       
        
        This prisoner was identified by the victim a couple of weeks later in the street in Sydney and he was then arrested. He took part in a record of interview and denied any knowledge of the incident. His fingerprints, however, were located on a document and the victim’s bag which had been at the Cashbox, and also on the screen of his lap top computer which had not been at the Cashbox. Also his phone number was recorded in the directory of the prisoner’s phone when he was arrested. 
        
       
      
    11 The applicant has sought leave to appeal against sentence on the ground that:  
     
      
       
        
        The sentence imposed on the co-offenders lacks proportionality to the sentence imposed upon the applicant and gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance in the applicant. 
        
       
      
    12 A number of the co-offenders were sentenced by Goldring DCJ. The sentences imposed upon the co-offenders by his Honour were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        a) Qiang Wu - aged 19 at the time of the offences – no prior convictions - charged under  
        Crimes Act 
         ss 86(3) and 99(2) - not guilty pleas - convicted of each offence – special circumstances found– non-parole period 4½ years – balance of term 3½ years - also sentenced for break enter and steal which offence was committed after subject offence (Goldring DCJ 22 July 2004). 
        
       
       
        
        b) Shu Qiang Li - young man – no prior convictions – plea of guilty to offence under  
        Crimes Act 
         s 86(2) with s 99(2) offence taken into account on a Form 1 – special circumstances found - non-parole period 3 years and 9 months – balance of term 1 year and 7 months (Goldring DCJ 22 July 2004). 
        
       
       
        
        c) Rhineheart Quinn – aged 24 at time of sentence – minor criminal record for offence committed after subject offence – plea of guilty to offence under  
        Crimes Act  
        s 86(3) with s 99(2) offence taken into account on a Form 1 - lesser role than other offenders – special circumstances - non-parole period 3 years – balance of term 1.5 years (Goldring DCJ 22 April 2005). 
        
       
      
    13 The applicant had no prior convictions and was aged 22 at the time of sentence. His Honour found special circumstances. 
     
      
    14 The relevant principles are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) … the parity principle, as identified and expounded in  
        Lowe v The Queen,  
        recognises that equal justice requires that, as between co-offenders, there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to ""a justifiable sense of grievance"". If there is, the sentence in issue should be reduced, notwithstanding that it is otherwise appropriate and within the permissible range of sentencing options -  
        Postiglione v The Queen 
         (1996 – 1997) 189 CLR 295 at 301 per Dawson and Gaudron JJ. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) The test for determining the legitimacy of a sense of grievance is objective not subjective -  
        R v Kelly 
         (2005) 155 A Crim R 499 at 502 per Johnson J. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) It is obviously desirable that persons who have been parties to the commission of the same offence should, if other things are equal, receive the same sentence, but other things are not always equal, and such matters as the age, background, previous criminal history and general character of the offender, and the part which he or she played in the commission of the offence, have to be taken into account -  
        Lowe v The Queen 
         (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 609 per Gibbs CJ. 
        
       
      
    15 His Honour held: 
     
      
       
        
        I see no real distinction between Mr Lin’s position and that of Mr Li and I propose to impose the same sentence on him. 
        
       
       
      This conclusion led his Honour to impose the same sentence upon the applicant as he had imposed on Li. 
       
      
    16 Li appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal against sentence. His appeal was heard on 13 December 2005 and judgment was given on that day. It was not submitted that there was a lack of proper parity or proportionality between the head sentences imposed on the applicant and Qiang Wu. However, it was submitted that there was a lack of proper parity or proportionality between the non-parole periods set for the two sentences. James J, with whom Grove and Simpson JJ agreed, allowed the appeal to the limited extent of varying the non-parole period. The non-parole period was set at three years and three months with a balance of term of two years and one month. 
     
      
    17 The reasons for that decision were: 
     
      
       
        
        [51] … his Honour divided the total sentence of eight years imposed on Wu into a non-parole period of four and a half years and a balance of term of three and a half years, that is a ratio of non-parole period to total sentence of about fifty-six per cent. In the case of the applicant, his Honour divided the total sentence of five years four months into a non-parole period of three years nine months and a balance of term of one year seven months, that is a ratio of non-parole period to total sentence of about seventy per cent.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [52] It seems to me that the applicant has a valid ground of complaint, that the sentencing judge, having found in his favour that there were special circumstances, gave very little effect to that finding in the sentence he actually passed on the applicant. Furthermore, the circumstances which his Honour found to be special circumstances being the same in the case of both offenders, his Honour gave no explanation in his remarks on sentence of why he had adopted such different ratios of non-parole period to total sentence in sentencing the two offenders. 
        
       
      
    18 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that, as the sentencing Judge had held there was no real distinction between the position of the applicant and Li, to allow the applicant’s non-parole period to stand once Li’s non-parole period had been reduced by the Court of Criminal Appeal would create “a justifiable sense of grievance” in the applicant. Accordingly it was appropriate that the Court intervene to vary the applicant’s non-parole period to correspond with that ultimately imposed upon Li. 
     
      
    19 In support of his Honour’s finding that there was no real distinction between the position of the applicant and Li, the applicant relied upon the fact that he and Li were each charged under the Crimes Act s 86(2), each had an offence under s 99(2) taken into account on a Form 1, each offence arose out of the same joint illegal enterprise, the sentencing Judge found special circumstances in respect of each based upon youth, that they had come to Australia from China as students, that they had no previous convictions, they had good prospects of rehabilitation and had limited English which would make imprisonment more than usually onerous. 
     
      
    20 The Crown accepted there were common elements between the applicant and Li. However, it submitted, the roles which the applicant and Li played in the commission of the offence were different. The applicant alone had attacked the victim, grabbing and slapping him, punching him in the face and kicking him in the ribs. This violent behaviour distinguished the role of the applicant from that of Li. It involved a higher level of culpability. The non parole period imposed upon the applicant was appropriate. As a result of the different roles played in the commission of the offence there was a real distinction between the position of the applicant and Li and his Honour erred in not so finding. In these circumstances parity principles did not require that the non parole period imposed upon the applicant be reduced to correspond with that imposed upon Li. The application for leave to appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    21 This was a joint criminal enterprise in the true sense. Each of the offenders knowingly took part in it. The applicant took the role of the enforcer, the one who used force and made threats as a means of obtaining property and cash from the victim. Li took the role of the facilitator. He set up the initial meeting between the applicant and the victim. He endeavoured to obtain property and cash from the victim by pretending to befriend him and assist him against the threats being made by the applicant. Each was responsible for the acts of those involved in carrying out the enterprise. The direct involvement of the applicant was limited in time to a matter of a few hours whereas Li’s direct involvement with the victim continued for more than a week as he pursued payment on the IOU. 
     
      
    22 In my opinion it was open to the sentencing Judge to conclude that there was no real distinction between the position of the applicant and Li. Accordingly I would apply parity principles to reduce the applicant’s non parole period to 3 years and 3 months to correspond with that ultimately imposed upon Li. 
     
      
    23 I propose the following orders:1. Grant leave to appeal. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    2. Allow the appeal. 
     
      
    3. Quash the sentence and in lieu thereof sentence the applicant to imprisonment for a non parole period of 3 years and 3 months to commence on 29 May 2003 and expire on 28 August 2006 and a balance of term of 2 years and 1 month to commence on 29 August 2006 and expire on 28 September 2008. The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for release to parole is 28 August 2006.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by Hidden and with his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Tahi Brooks, pleaded guilty in the District Court to the following charges: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Aggravated break and enter and commit indictable offence, namely, aggravated sexual intercourse without consent: s112(2) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        ; 
         
         
        (2) Aggravated sexual intercourse without consent: s61J(1) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        ; 
         
         
        (3) Attempted aggravated sexual intercourse without consent: s61J(1)/s61P of the  
        Crimes Act 
        ; 
         
         
        (4) A further offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent; 
         
         
        (5) Aggravated robbery: s95 of the  
        Crimes Act 
        .  
        
       
       
      Each of those offences carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for twenty years. Standard non-parole periods are prescribed in respect of the charges other than the aggravated robbery. For the aggravated break and enter charge the period is five years, and for the charges of aggravated sexual assault (including the attempt) the period is ten years.  
       
      
    3 The applicant asked that there be taken into account on a Form 1 yet another offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent and an offence of escaping from lawful custody. Those offences were taken into account in the sentence on the first charge. 
     
      
    4 He was sentenced as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        On the fifth charge (aggravated robbery), imprisonment for a fixed term of seven years to commence on 14 November 2003; 
        
       
       
        
        On the first charge (aggravated break and enter and commit aggravated sexual assault), taking into account the Form 1 matters, imprisonment for sixteen years to commence on 14 November 2004, comprising a non-parole period of twelve years and a balance of term of four years; 
        
       
       
        
        On each of the second and fourth charges (aggravated sexual assault), imprisonment for a fixed term of eight years to commence on 14 November 2004; 
        
       
       
        
        On the third charge (attempted aggravated sexual assault), imprisonment for a fixed term of four-and-a-half years to commence on 14 November 2005.  
        
       
      
    5 The total effective sentence is imprisonment for seventeen years, with a non-parole period of thirteen years, dating from 14 November 2003. He seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. 
     
      
    6 To assess the gravity of the offences a fairly full account of the facts is necessary. The learned sentencing judge summarised them in her remarks on sentence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        At about 3am on Saturday 8 February 2003 the offender broke and entered the home of ... the victim, at .... Entry was gained through a sliding flyscreen door at the rear of the premises by forcing the screen mesh out of the door frame. At the time of entry, the offender was armed with a spanner. At the time, the premises were occupied by the elderly female victim who was then eighty two years of age and home alone asleep in her bed. 
        
       
       
        
        After gaining entry the offender entered the victim’s bedroom. The victim woke to find the offender standing next to her bed looking at her. She challenged him as to his presence in her home and told him to get out while she tried to get up. He grabbed her by the arm, held the spanner to her throat, pushed her onto the bed and said “Shut up you bitch or I will kill you, I want some pussy”. He removed his clothing whilst continuing to hold the spanner to the victim’s throat. He then laid on top of her and pulled up her night gown above the level of her breasts so that she was naked from the breasts down. He then had sexual intercourse with her by inserting two or three fingers into her vagina. Those facts constitute count one on the indictment, the breaking and entering and commit serious indictable offence, namely, sexual intercourse without consent. The offender then used the palm of his hand to rub the genital area whilst keeping the fingers of the same hand inside her vagina for some time estimated by the victim to be three to five minutes. After he removed his fingers from her vagina, he then had further sexual intercourse with her by inserting his penis in her vagina a number of times. This constitutes count two on the indictment, aggravated sexual intercourse without consent and this was done in a forceful manner causing the victim slight pain and continued for some time estimated by the victim to be about ten minutes. The victim was unaware if the offender ejaculated or not. 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst this act of intercourse was taking place, the offender said “Babe I love pussy, I love this babe, put your arms around me, cuddle me”. The victim put her hands on the top of each shoulder of the offender and tried to scratch his back. It was her intention to get his DNA under her fingernails in order to identify him. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender told the victim to turn over and he rolled her over so that she was face down on the bed with her face in the pillow. He then placed his penis on her anus and the victim said “No, it’ll hurt too much, I can’t breathe”. The offender then rolled the victim onto her back, knelt over her by putting his legs on either side of her body, removed her night gown completely so that she was naked and began rubbing his erect penis around the victim’s mouth. When the victim would not open her mouth the offender said “Open your mouth, open your mouth bitch”. That act constitutes count three, the attempted sexual intercourse without consent. The victim resisted by shaking her head. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender then moved his position so that he was lying on his stomach with his head between the victim’s legs. He then began licking the victim’s genital area and moving his tongue in and out of her vagina a number of times for a period of time. The victim estimated five or six minutes. This act constitutes count four, an act of aggravated sexual assault without consent. 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst he was performing this act, the offender used both hands to hold the victim around the waist holding her down. The offender then said “Well hold me with your hand”. The victim complied and took hold of the offender’s penis and began to masturbate him. The offender then laid on top of the victim again and had sexual intercourse by inserting his penis in and out of her vagina a number of times. This is the act of aggravated sexual intercourse listed on the Form 1. This was done in a rough manner and continued for some time estimated by the victim to be about ten minutes. The offender said at times during this act “This is great babe, this is great babe, I love pussy”. 
        
       
       
        
        The victim said the offender had better leave because her son was due home very shortly. The offender ceased having sexual intercourse with the victim at the time, stood beside the bed and said to her “Haven’t I got a wonderful cock?” The victim again said that he had better leave because her son was due home very shortly and if he caught the offender he would kill him. The offender got dressed and said “Where’s your money?” The victim said she would give it to him. She removed all of her money from her wallet, sixty dollars, and gave it to the offender. These are the facts which constitute count five on the indictment, the aggravated robbery. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender searched the bedroom looking in a bedside cabinet and looking in an empty wallet in the cabinet. He also repeatedly asked for the victim’s car keys and mobile phone. She told him she had neither. The victim was experiencing breathing difficulties at this stage. The offender went to the bathroom, the victim went to the lounge room and sat down to try and get her breath back. The offender came out of the bathroom into the lounge room and again asked the victim for her mobile phone and car keys and whether she had any beer in the fridge. The victim said she had none of these things. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender told the victim not to move and he went to the kitchen where he looked in the refrigerator and removed a bottle of sherry, a casserole dish containing an apricot chicken casserole and a block of cheese. He went to the dining room table, placed the items on the table, went back to the kitchen where he obtained a fork before returning to the dining room table where he sat down and ate some of the casserole. He asked if she had more beer and was told that she had some Marsala which the offender then also took from the refrigerator. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender then went to the telephone in the kitchen and tried to pull it out of the wall plug a number of times before using his teeth to sever the cord between the handpiece and the telephone body. He also asked the victim for the location of the nearest telephone. The victim told the offender to leave because her son would be home soon and the offender asked for her son’s car keys. The offender took the casserole, the two bottles of alcohol, the fork and left the premises via the same hole in the flyscreen door by which he had entered the premises. 
        
       
      
    7 Her Honour went on to record the process of investigation which led to the applicant’s arrest for these offences on 14 May 2003. He was then in custody in respect of unrelated offences, for which he had been arrested on 15 February 2003. Upon his arrest, he was conveyed to a police station in a caged police vehicle. When the vehicle arrived at the police station and the doors were opened, he jumped out and ran a short distance before police apprehended him. This gave rise to the charge of escaping from lawful custody on the Form 1. 
     
      
       
      Subjective case 
       
      
    8 The applicant was eighteen years old at the time of the offences and is now twenty-one. He has a bad criminal record for one so young, comprising Children’s Court and Local Court entries. One of his Children’s Court appearances was in June 2002, when he was placed on concurrent control orders for two counts of aggravated robbery. He was on parole in respect of those orders when he committed the present offences. In November 2002 he was sentenced in a Local Court to short fixed terms of imprisonment for assault and demanding property with menaces, those sentences expiring only ten days before the present offences. 
     
      
    9 As I have said, he had been arrested on 15 February 2003 for unrelated offences, including breaking, entering and stealing. In April 2003, in respect of those offences, he was sentenced to terms of imprisonment aggregating nine months, with a non-parole period of three months, to date from 15 February 2003. It was upon the expiration of that non-parole period on 14 May 2003 that he was arrested for the present matters. In the following month his parole was revoked and he became liable to serve the balance of the nine month term, expiring on 14 November 2003. It was on that date that her Honour directed the first of the present sentences to commence.  
     
      
    10 He was born in New Zealand, and migrated to this country with his family when he was fourteen years old. It seems that his upbringing in New Zealand was satisfactory. However, about two years after their arrival in Australia his older brother committed suicide. This had a deleterious effect upon his behaviour and that of his remaining siblings, and his parents effectively disowned them. These developments appear to have contributed to his offending behaviour, as well as his pattern of abuse of alcohol and of a variety of illicit drugs. 
     
      
    11 When he was seven years old he was sexually assaulted by an adult male who was a friend of the family. It was one incident only, involving touching in the genital region, and he was counselled by a psychologist for about eighteen months. Dr Bruce Westmore, a forensic psychiatrist who prepared reports for the sentence proceedings, thought that this incident must have had a significant impact upon him. However, the doctor concluded that the present sexual offences were “of an opportunistic type” and that “drugs and alcohol were also relevant.” 
     
      
       
      Sentencing judge’s findings 
       
      
    12 In evidence at the sentence proceedings, the applicant gave an account of the offences which her Honour considered to be sanitised and which, in large part, she rejected. However, she found that his intention when he broke into the victim’s premises was to steal and, like Dr Westmore, she concluded that the sexual assaults were opportunistic. She appears to have accepted that he was affected by alcohol, although not to the degree which he had claimed in evidence.  
     
      
    13 In the light of an eloquent victim impact statement, her Honour found that the offences had caused the elderly victim substantial emotional harm: s21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. While acknowledging that the offences might not be “the worst kind imaginable”, she found that they fell into the worst category of offences of that kind. Although she initially made that observation about “the offences” generally, it appears from a later passage in her remarks that it might have been confined to the sexual assaults. Her Honour also found that, despite the applicant’s relative youth, the offences were not the product of immaturity and that considerations of general deterrence and the protection of the community had to play “a significant role” in sentencing.  
     
      
    14 Her Honour was not persuaded that he was remorseful, but she recognised the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty by a reduction of sentence of twenty percent. She was pessimistic about his prospects of rehabilitation. She noted that, because of the nature of the offences, he had been on protection of one form or another while in custody.  
     
      
       
      The application 
       
      
    15 Mr Dhanji, for the applicant, argued the application on a number of grounds: that her Honour had erred in treating the applicant’s criminal record as an aggravating factor under s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, in failing to have regard to the effect of accumulation of the sentences in setting the non-parole period, and in finding that the offences fell into the worst category. A ground challenging her Honour’s assessment of the applicant’s credibility was abandoned at the hearing. It was also argued that the sentences, individually and in their total effect, are manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    16 I have concluded that there is substance in the ground concerning her Honour’s finding that the offences fell into the worst category. As I consider that the Court should intervene for that reason, I do not find it necessary to deal with the other grounds of the application. However, I should mention in passing the ground that her Honour wrongly treated the applicant’s criminal record as an aggravating factor under s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In response to that ground the Crown prosecutor advanced an interpretation of s21A which calls into question a line of authority commencing with R v Johnson [2004] NSWCCA 76. On 6 June 2006, after judgment in this matter was reserved, a five judge bench heard argument about that matter in McNaughton v Regina, and judgment in that case is still reserved.  
     
      
    17 I turn, then, to her Honour’s finding that the offences, particularly the sexual assaults, fell into the worst category of offences of their kind. Normally, a judge characterises an offence as falling into the worst category when imposing the maximum sentence for that offence. Her Honour did not sentence the applicant to the maximum term for any of the offences. However, it does appear that her starting point for the offence of aggravated break and enter was the maximum of twenty years. No doubt, the sixteen year term which she imposed was the result of the twenty percent reduction she allowed for the pleas of guilty. Of course, in passing that sentence her Honour took into account the matters on the Form 1, which included a further offence of aggravated sexual assault.  
     
      
    18 The gravity of the offences committed against that unfortunate woman requires no emphasis. Moreover, they were perpetrated by a young man with an unfavourable criminal record, who was on parole in respect of other serious offences at the time. Notwithstanding those matters, I am persuaded that her Honour fell into error in characterising the offences as falling into the worst category.  
     
      
    19 As I have said, her Honour found that the sexual offences were opportunistic, rather than planned. As one would expect, the emotional impact of the incident upon the victim was severe. However, the indignities accompanying the sexual assaults, the applicant’s threats by word of mouth and by the presentation of the spanner, the deprivation of the victim’s liberty and the physical pain experienced by her fall short of much that this Court has had to consider, from time to time, in other cases. There are also bizarre features of the applicant’s behaviour, in particular, his boasting of his “wonderful cock” and his helping himself to a makeshift meal in the kitchen despite the victim’s warning that her son was due home, which raise a question about the extent of his insight into the criminality of his actions. However, this was not a matter explored in the psychiatric reports and little significance can be placed upon it.  
     
      
    20 As I have said, none of the charges was visited with the maximum sentence. Nevertheless, the sentences imposed on most of them, after allowance for the applicant’s pleas of guilty, disclose that her Honour misapprehended where they lay in the scale of objective criminality. While I have focused upon the sexual offences in dealing with this ground, this is equally true of the sentence in respect of the aggravated robbery. I would not disturb the sentence of four and a half years imprisonment on the third charge, the attempted aggravated sexual assault, but I am satisfied that the other sentences cannot stand.  
     
      
    21 Accordingly, this Court must re-sentence the applicant. The sentences must reflect the seriousness of the offences and the relevant aggravating features, while giving appropriate weight to his relative youth, his background and his protective custody. Like her Honour, I would recognise his pleas of guilty by a reduction of sentence of the order of twenty percent, and I would direct the first sentence to commence on 14 November 2003. I would pass partly cumulative sentences on the other charges, mindful of the principle of totality.  
     
      
    22 I referred at the beginning of these reasons to the standard non-parole periods for the offences of aggravated break and enter and aggravated sexual assault. I would adopt her Honour’s approach of passing fixed terms of imprisonment on all the charges except the aggravated break and enter. As to that charge, although the applicant pleaded guilty to it, it is appropriate to have regard to the five year standard non-parole period as a reference point or guide post, in accordance with the principles enunciated in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [117] ff. In so doing, however, it is necessary to bear in mind that the offence created by s112 of the Crimes Act is one of breaking and entering premises and committing “any serious indictable offence” therein. The expression “serious indictable offence” embraces a wide variety of criminality, and the nature of the serious indictable offence alleged in a particular case must have a significant bearing upon the assessment of the gravity of an offence under the section. In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that a non-parole period in excess of five years is necessary to reflect the criminality of the applicant’s offence. 
     
      
    23 I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. I would quash the sentences on all charges but the third, and re-sentence the applicant as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        On the fifth charge (aggravated robbery), imprisonment for three years from 14 November 2003; 
        
       
       
        
        On the second charge (aggravated sexual assault – penile penetration), imprisonment for seven years from 14 November 2004; 
        
       
       
        
        On the third charge (attempted aggravated sexual assault – fellatio), I would confirm the sentence passed by her Honour of imprisonment for four-and-a-half years from 14 November 2005; 
        
       
       
        
        On the fourth charge (aggravated sexual assault – cunnilingus), imprisonment for five years from 14 November 2006; 
        
       
       
        
        On the first charge (aggravated break and enter and commit aggravated sexual assault – digital penetration), taking into account the matters on the Form 1, imprisonment for ten years, with a non-parole period of six-and-a-half years, from 14 November 2007. 
        
       
      
    24 Because of the sentence passed on the first charge, I would decline to set non-parole periods in respect of the other sentences. I would depart from the statutory proportion in setting the non-parole period for the sentence on the first charge because that sentence is accumulated upon the other sentences. The result would be an overall sentence of imprisonment for fourteen years, with a non-parole period of ten-and-a-half years, dating from 14 November 2003. The applicant would be eligible for release on parole on 13 May 2014.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant was arraigned on 1 April 2005 on an indictment alleging an offence against s 102.5(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Between about the 12th day of January 2003 and the 2nd day of February 2003 in Pakistan did intentionally receive training with respect to combat and the use of arms from a terrorist organisation, namely Lashkar-e-Taiba, he the said Izhar UL-HAQUE at time aforesaid knowing that the said organisation was a terrorist organisation.” 
        
       
      
    2 The applicant is an Australian citizen. 
     
      
    3 By Notice of Motion filed on 4 August 2005 the applicant sought orders from Bell J quashing the indictment and in the alternative an order staying the proceedings as an abuse of process on the basis that the prosecution was doomed to fail. Three issues require resolution in this application. The first raises the constitutional validity of the relevant legislation. The second challenges the pleading and the third raises evidentiary issues. 
     
      
    4 The law which applies to this offence is the law at January 2003. There have been subsequent amendments to the legislation which are not presently relevant. 
     
      
    5 Section 102.5 of the Code provides that it is an offence for a person to train a terrorist organisation or receive training from such an organisation. Section 102.5(1) is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person commits an offence if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the person intentionally provides training to, or intentionally receives training from an organisation; and 
          
         
         (b) the organisation is a terrorist organisation; and 
         
          
          (c) the person knows the organisation is a terrorist organisation.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    6 “Terrorist organisation” is defined in s 102.1(1) in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) An organisation that is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not the terrorist act occurs); or 
         
        (c) An organisation that is specified by the regulation for the purpose of this paragraph.” 
        
       
      
    7 As at January 2003 Lashkar-e-Taiba was not an organisation specified by the regulations for the purpose of s 102.1(1) of the Code. Accordingly, at the trial the Crown must prove that in January 2003 LeT was relevantly a terrorist organisation. 
     
      
    8 “Organisation” is defined in s 100(1) and means: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) a body corporate; or 
         
         
        (b) an unincorporated body; 
         
         
        whether or not the body is based outside Australia, consists of persons who are not Australian citizens, or is part of a larger organisation.” 
        
       
      
    9 “Terrorist act” is defined in s 100(1) and relevantly means: 
     
      
       
        
        “An action or threat of action where: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the action falls within subsection (2) and does not fall within subsection (2A); and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the action is done or the threat is made with the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause; and 
        
       
       
        
        (c) the action is done or the threat is made with the intention of: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) coercing, or influencing by intimidation, the Government of the Commonwealth or a State, Territory or foreign country, or part of a State, Territory or foreign country; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         (ii) intimidating the public or a section of the public. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Action falls within this subsection if it: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) causes serious harm that is physical harm to a person; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         (b) causes serious damage to property; or 
        
       
       
        
         (ba) causes a person’s death; or 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) endangers a person’s life, other than the life of the person taking the action; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) seriously interferes with, seriously disrupts, or destroys, an electronic system including, but not limited to: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         (i) an information system; or 
         
         (ii) a telecommunications system; or 
         
         (iii) a financial system; or  
         
          
           
            
            (iv) a system used for the delivery of essential government services; or 
             
            (v) a system used for, or by, an essential public utility, or 
            
           
          (vi) a system used for, or by, a transport system. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2A) Action falls within this subsection if it: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) is advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         (b) is not intended: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) to cause serious harm that is physical harm to a person; or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         (ii) to cause a person’s death; or 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (iii) to endanger the life of a person, other than the person taking the action; or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (iv) to create a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) In this Division: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a reference to any person of property is a reference to any person or property wherever situated, within or outside Australia; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) a reference to the public includes a reference to the public of a country other than Australia.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    10 The Crown case as originally particularised is that between 12 January 2003 and 2 February 2003 Lashkar-e-Taiba was a terrorist organisation, in that it was directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        An action that: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) was to be done with the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause, namely the restoration of control of Indian occupied Kashmir to Muslims; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) was to be done with the intention of coercing, or influencing by intimidation, the government of India or intimidating the public or a section of the public (including members of the Indian armed services), actually or potentially serving in the region of Indian occupied Kashmir; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) was intended to cause serious harm, that is physical harm, to a person or persons, namely members of the Indian armed forces serving in the region of Indian occupied Kashmir; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) was intended to endanger the life of such a person; or 
        
       
       
        
        (e) was intended to create serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public, namely members of the Indian armed forces serving in the region of Indian occupied Kashmir, or the health and safety of members of the public who may be put at risk as a result of actions against such members of the Indian armed forces.” 
        
       
       
      First ground of appeal: Commonwealth Legislative Power 
       
      
    11 The applicant’s submission is that the Commonwealth Parliament does not have the legislative power to proscribe the killing of foreigners by a foreign organisation in foreign territory where there is no apparent connection with Australia. 
     
      
    12 The Commonwealth submits that s 102.5(1) of the Code is a law with respect to external affairs within the meaning of s 51(xxix) of the Constitution for any one or more of the following reasons: 
     
      
       
        
        “6.1 it operates on conduct geographically external to Australia; 
        
       
       
        
        6.2 it is reasonably capable of being considered appropriate and adapted to giving effect to an international obligation; 
        
       
       
        
        6.3 it affects and/or concerns Australia’s external relations; and 
        
       
       
        
        6.4 the subject matter of s 102.5(1), namely the suppression of terrorist acts, is a matter of sufficient ‘international concern’.” 
        
       
      
    13 I have set out the provisions of the Code which create the relevant offence. The Commonwealth submits that the intended external operation of the legislation is reinforced by s 100.1(3) which provides that: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) a reference to any person or property is a reference to any person or property wherever situated, within or outside Australia, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) a reference to the public includes a reference to the public of a country other than Australia. 
        
       
      
    14 Section 102.9 applies s 15.4 of the Criminal Code to the offences in Division 102, including s 102.5. Section 15.4 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “If a law of the Commonwealth provides that this section applies to a particular offence, the offence applies: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) whether or not the conduct constituting the alleged offence occurs in Australia; and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) whether or not a result of the conduct constituting the alleged offence occurs in Australia.” 
        
       
      
    15 Section 100.2 purports to identify the constitutional basis for terrorism offences. It relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) This Part (5.3) applies to a terrorist act constituted by an action, or threat of action, in relation to which the Parliament has power to legislate; 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), this Part applies to a terrorist act constituted by an action, or threat of action, if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            … (n) the action takes place, or if carried out would take place, outside Australia.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    16 Bell J resolved this issue in favour of the Commonwealth after consideration of the decision of the High Court in Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth (1991) 172 CLR 501. In that case the Court held (by a majority of 6:1) that provisions of the War Crimes Act 1945 rendering unlawful certain conduct engaged in outside Australia were supported by the external affairs power. It was a necessary step in the reasoning of five judges in Polyukhovich that a law that operated on conduct geographically external to Australia was for that reason alone a law with respect to external affairs within s 51(xxix) of the Constitution. 
     
      
    17 The provisions of the War Crimes Act that were challenged in Polyukhovich provided for the trial and punishment in Australia of acts committed outside Australia that had a specified relationship with the 1939-1945 war or armed conflict in Europe. The provisions of the War Crimes Act could be used to charge a person with an offence in circumstances where, at the time of committing the offence, the person was not an Australian citizen or a resident of Australia. 
     
      
    18 Five members of the Court held that the geographic externality of the conduct that formed the basis of the provisions was sufficient by itself to support the provisions by reference to the external affairs power. Mason CJ held that the “externality of the conduct which the law prescribes as the foundation of the criminal offence is enough without more to constitute it as a law with respect to external affairs”(p 531). It was not necessary for the court to be satisfied that Australia had an interest or concern in the subject matter of the legislation in order for its validity to be sustained; it was enough that Parliament’s judgment was that Australia had such an interest or concern. Deane J held that “any law which can properly be characterised as a law with respect to any matter, thing or person occurring or situate outside Australia is a law with respect to ‘External affairs’ for the purposes of s 51(xxix)”(p 602). Dawson J held that the external affairs power “extends the legislative reach of the Commonwealth Parliament to those places, persons, matters or things [which are physically external to Australia] because of their externality and nothing further is required to bring them within the description of ‘external affairs’”(p 641). Gaudon J held that a law that applies to matters or things geographically situated outside Australia would necessarily be a law with respect to external affairs. In her Honour’s view, such a conclusion proceeded from the ordinary meaning of the words “[e]xternal affairs” in s 51(xxix). McHugh J held that the term “external affairs” should be interpreted to include any matter, thing, event or relationship existing or arising or which might exist or arise outside Australia. The remaining judges in Polyukhovich on whose reasons the appellant relies, took different approaches. Toohey J held that externality alone was not sufficient. In his Honour’s view, a matter did not qualify as an “external affair” simply because it existed outside Australia: the matter must be one which the Parliament recognised as touching or concerning Australia in some way. However, because the conduct that formed the basis for the relevant provisions of the War Crimes Act took place during a war that touched and concerned Australia, whether or not Australia was directly involved in the particular conflict from which the conduct arose, those provisions were supported by the external affairs power. Brennan J held that the relevant provisions of the War Crimes Act were not supported by the external affairs power because there was not a sufficient nexus between Australia and the “external affairs” which the law purported to affect. A sufficient nexus would have existed if there was a requirement that the person charged be an Australian citizen or resident at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    19 The approach of the majority in Polyukhovich has been confirmed in two subsequent cases Victoria v The Commonwealth (1996) 187 CLR 416 and De L v Director-General, New South Wales Department of Community Services (1996) 187 CLR 640. 
     
      
    20 In no subsequent case has a majority of the High Court suggested that the Polyukhovich principle was wrong. In XYZ v Commonwealth [2006] HCA 25 the High Court rejected an attempt to reopen and overrule Polyukhovich on the basis that the external affairs power only deals with relations between countries. In XYZ when upholding the validity of provisions of Part IIIA (Child Sex Tourism) of the Crimes Act 1914, which made it an offence for Australian citizens and residents to engage in sexual conduct outside Australia with children under the age of 16, Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ described the reading of s 51(xxix) in Victoria v Commonwealth as “correct” (at [38]). 
     
      
    21 In XYZ Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ also stated (at [49]): 
     
      
       
        
        “The Commonwealth correctly submitted that legislation proscribing conduct engaged in outside Australia, such as s 50BA and s 50BC of the  
        Crimes Act 
        , is supported by the external affairs power. That is so without the further requirement, here imposed by s 50AD, that the person alleged to have committed the offence outside Australia must be an Australian citizen or a resident of Australia.” 
        
       
      
    22 Gleeson CJ regarded the argument of the plaintiff in that case (that the external affairs power only authorises laws with respect to relations between Australia and other countries) as inconsistent with all the views of the external affairs power expressed in Polyukhovich. However, his Honour observed (at [10]): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Polyukhovich  
        held that the external affairs power covers, but is not limited to, the matter of Australia’s relations with other countries. It also includes a power to make laws with respect to places, persons, matters or things outside the geographical limits of, that is, external to, Australia. That conclusion represents the current doctrine of the Court on the external affairs power, and should be maintained because it is correct.” 
        
       
      
    23 Whilst his Honour noted that the difference between the view of s 51(xxix) taken in Polyukhovich by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ on the one hand, and the views of Brennan J and Toohey J on the other “[did] not affect the point presently in issue”, there is nothing in his Honour’s judgment that casts doubt on the majority view in Polyukhovich. 
     
      
    24 The remaining judges in XYZ had no doubt that Polyukhovich stood for the principle that a law that operated on conduct geographically external to Australia was for that reason alone a law with respect to external affairs within s 51(xxix) of the Constitution. They differed, however, in their attitudes to the case. While expressing concerns about the principle, Kirby J refused to overrule it. On the other hand, Callinan and Heydon JJ (in dissent) would have overruled Polyukhovich to the extent that the geographic externality principle was a necessary step in the reasoning in that case. 
     
      
    25 It must follow that Polyukhovich remains binding High Court authority for the proposition that a law that operates on conduct geographically external to Australia is for that reason alone necessarily a law with respect to external affairs within s 51 (xxix) of the Constitution. The applicant’s argument that the Commonwealth Parliament has no power to enact legislation proscribing the killing of foreign citizens by members of a foreign organisation on foreign territory must be rejected by this Court. If it is to be reconsidered this must be done in the High Court. 
     
      
    26 During the course of argument the following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “McCLELLAN CJ at CL: Would that mean that a law which had the effect of making it an offence in Australia to fight for Hezbollah in the current conflict would be valid? 
        
       
       
        
        BENNETT: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        McCLELLAN CJ at CL: What about fighting for Israel? 
        
       
       
        
        BENNETT: The same. 
        
       
       
        
        McCLELLAN CJ at CL: Which is an indication of the breadth of the proposition, is it not?” 
        
       
       
        
        BENNETT: Yes, that is a matter for Parliament. 
        
       
       
        
        McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I understand that.” 
        
       
       
      If such a prosecution was contemplated under the  
      Code 
      , the Attorney General would have to consent to it if the person was not an Australian citizen or body corporate incorporated under the law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory: s 16.1(1). Some may find the Solicitor-General’s acceptance of the breadth of the Constitution’s reach surprising, and it will no doubt inform the debate as to the validity of the legislation, if, and when it is considered by the High Court. However, this Court is bound by  
      Polyukovich 
       with the consequence that the applicant’s argument must be rejected. 
       
      
    27 The Commonwealth submitted that the legislation could be supported on other grounds. Although appropriate to acknowledge the submissions it is unnecessary to resolve them. 
     
      
    28 It was submitted that subsection 102.5(1) gives effect to Australia’s international obligations. The relevant international obligation was identified as Resolution 1373 of the United Nations Security Council which it is submitted obliges Australia to take relevant action in relation to terrorists and terrorist organisations. It was further submitted that s 102.5(1) affects and/or concerns Australia’s “external relations” in that, inter alia, a failure to provide legislation proscribing and suppressing terrorist acts would necessarily affect Australia’s relations with other countries. In particular the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombing and other international agreements embody the principle of “no safe haven” which it was submitted effectively requires legislation to the effect of s 102.5. Finally, it was submitted that s 102.5 (1) deals with a matter of international concern: see Koowarta v Bjelke-Peterson (1982) 153 CLR 168. Although the concept was relevantly doubted by Kirby, Callinan and Heydon JJ in XYZ it was submitted that it must be accepted as continuing and available to validate the relevant provisions. 
     
      
    29 The applicant responded to each of the Commonwealth’s submissions. In essence it was submitted that whatever be Australia’s international obligations they do not extend to an obligation to legislate extra-territorially so as to criminalise conduct wholly unrelated to Australian interests. It was further submitted that it is paradoxical to suggest that the imposition of Australian criminal law upon foreigners acting in a foreign country in circumstances in which Australian interests are not affected would further Australia’s relations with other nations. Finally, it was submitted that the mere prevalence of international protocols and the like dealing with terrorism does not make it a matter of “international concern” justifying extra territorial legislation. The applicant identifies many international instruments, an example being instruments seeking to suppress the distribution of narcotics which it was submitted would not permit the Commonwealth to enact legislation criminalising the production of cocaine in Columbia. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: Her Honour erred in concluding that the Crown was not required to particularise the discrete act which is said to constitute the terrorist act that established that LeT was a terrorist organisation for the purpose of Division 102 of the  
      Criminal Code 
      . 
       
      
    30 Before Bell J the matter was approached having regard to the particulars provided by the Crown by letter dated 16 August 2005. I have previously identified its contents but it is convenient to repeat it: 
     
      
       
        
        “Between 12 January 2003 and 2 February 2003 Lashkar-e-Taiba was a terrorist organisation, in that it was directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act, namely: 
        
       
       
        
        An action that: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) was to be done with the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause, namely the restoration of control of Indian occupied Kashmir to Muslims; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) was to be done with the intention of coercing, or influencing by intimation, the government of India or intimidating the public or a section of the public (including members of the Indian armed services), actually or potentially serving in the region of Indian occupied Kashmir; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) was intended to cause serious harm, that is physical harm, to a person or persons, namely members of the Indian armed forces serving in the region of Indian occupied Kashmir; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) was intended to endanger the life of such a person; or 
        
       
       
        
        (e) was intended to create serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public, namely members of the Indian armed forces serving in the region of Indian occupied Kashmir, or the health and safety of members of the public who may be put at risk as a result of actions against such members of the Indian armed forces.” 
        
       
      
    31 The essential argument for the appellant before Bell J and this Court was that before it can establish LeT is a terrorist organisation the Crown must particularise and prove a discrete terrorist act. Her Honour records the submission of the applicant in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Barker acknowledged that the description of the offence in the indictment is in the words of s 102.5(1). The Crown has furnished particulars identifying the basis upon which it will contend that LeT was at the material time a terrorist organisation. Mr Barker did not maintain the submission that the indictment was defective for failure to contain an averment of the terrorist act. He submitted that the particulars are not particulars of a ‘terrorist act’ within the meaning of that expression in s 100.1 and thus are not capable of proving that LeT was a terrorist organisation at the time. The offences created in Pt 5.3 were said to require an action or threat of action as distinct from preliminary acts. The argument is that the Crown must particularise a discrete act as the terrorist act relied upon to establish LeT’s character as a terrorist organisation in January 2003.” 
        
       
      
    32 Her Honour makes plain that neither party paid close attention to the written particulars when the matter was argued. Instead her Honour resolved the issue after consideration of oral argument, during which the Crown effectively proffered an amendment to the particulars. Although the amendment was not formally made before Bell J, it was made before this Court and the particulars now read: 
     
      
       
        
        “Between 12 January 2003 and 2 February 2003 Lashkar-e-Taiba was a terrorist organisation, in that it was directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act, namely: 
        
       
       
        
        An action  
        involving physical attack on members of India’s armed services in Kashmir that 
        : 
        
       
       
        
        (a) was to be done with the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause, namely the restoration of control of Indian occupied Kashmir to Muslims; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) was to be done with the intention of coercing, or influencing by intimidation, the government of India or intimidating the public or a section of the public (including members of the Indian armed services), actually or potentially serving in the region of Indian occupied Kashmir; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) was intended to cause serious harm, that is physical harm, to a person or persons, namely members of the Indian armed forces serving in the region of Indian occupied Kashmir; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) was intended to endanger the life of such a person; or 
        
       
       
        
        (e) was intended to create serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public, namely members of the Indian armed forces serving in the region of Indian occupied Kashmir, or the health and safety of members of the public who may be put at risk as a result of actions against such members of the Indian armed forces.” 
        
       
       (the amendment is underlined) 
       
      
    33 Bell J said that the particulars in their unamended form were flawed but having regard to the manner in which the matter was argued said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I have noted, the motion was argued on the basis that the Crown case is that LeT was a terrorist organisation at the material time because it was directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act namely killing Indian soldiers in Kashmir, this being an action that falls within s 100.1(2)(a), (c) and (d)) and which was done with the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause, namely the restoration of control of Indian occupied Kashmir to Muslims and with the intention of coercing, or influencing by intimidation, the government of India or intimidating the public or a section of the public (including members of the Indian armed services), actually or potentially serving in the region of Indian occupied Kashmir. I propose to deal with the challenge to the indictment on this footing and not by reference to the written particulars which do not reflect the way the matter was argued. 
        
       
       
        
        In Mr Barker's submission, the particulars (understood in the way summarised in his submission which I have set out at paragraph 34 above) do no more than identify as an aim of LeT the doing of physical harm to members of the Indian armed forces serving in the region of Indian occupied Kashmir. The concepts of preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering were said to be separate from the act that is their object. All the offences in Pt 5.3 were submitted to require a discrete terrorist action. The repeated use of the definite article was said to make this much obvious. 
        
       
       
        
        In Mr Barker's submission amending legislation serves to demonstrate that conduct not involving specific terrorist acts was not caught by Pt 5.3 of the  
        Criminal Code  
        as it stood in January 2003. In this respect Mr Barker firstly relied on the introduction of the  
        Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2003  
        (the 2003 Act) which effected the repeal of Pt 5.3 of the Criminal  
        Code  
        and substituted a new Pt 5.3 dealing with terrorism. Section 100.4 of Criminal Code as amended by the 2003 Act is in these terms: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          100.4 Application of provisions 
           
          Part generally applies to all terrorist acts and preliminary acts. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) Subject to subsection (4), this Part applies to the following conduct: - 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) All actions or threats of action that constitute terrorist acts (no matter where the action occurs, the threat is made or the action, if carried out, would occur); 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) all actions  
            (preliminary  
            acts)  
            that relate to terrorist acts but do not themselves constitute terrorist acts (no matter where the preliminary acts occur and no matter where the terrorist acts to which they relate occur or would occur). 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Mr Barker also relied on the provisions of the  
        Anti-Terrorism Act 2005,  
        No 127 of 2005 (The 2005 Act), which amends a number of the terrorist act offences contained in Div 101 and the financing terrorism offences contained in Div 103 of the  
        Criminal Code.  
        The 2005 Act did not amend the terrorist organisation offences contained in Div 102. 
        
       
       
        
        Section 101.2, as it stood prior to the amendment introduced by the 2005 Act, relevantly provided as follows: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) A person commits an offence if; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) the person provides or receives training; and 
             
            (b) the training is connected with preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in a terrorist act; and 
             
            (c) the person mentioned in paragraph (a) knows of the connection described in paragraph (b). 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (3) A person commits an offence under this section even if the terrorist act does not occur. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The 2005 Act effected the repeal of subs (3) above and substituted the following: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (3) A person commits an offence under this section even if: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a terrorist act does not occur; or 
           
            
            (b) the training is not connected with preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in a specific terrorist act; or 
             
            (c) the training is connected with preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in more than one terrorist act. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Other amendments introduced by the 2005 Act effected like changes. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown submitted that care needed to be exercised in approaching the construction of Pt 5.3 of the  
        Criminal Code  
        as it stood at the material time by reference to amending legislation. In written submissions the Crown referred to the judgment of French J in  
        Sun World lnc v Registrar, Plant Variety Rights  
        &  
        Anor  
        (1997) 148 ALR 447 at 459: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The role of amending legislation in the construction of the earlier provisions of the legislation it amends is debatable. It can be said that although the  
          Plant Breeder's Rights Act 1994  
          repealed the  
          Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 and  
          substituted a new statutory regime, there is an analogy to the case of amending legislation at least in respect of the operation of the NPC Rules, Amending legislation which expressly introduces an exemption from some condition or liability imposed by the legislation to be amended may support a construction of that earlier statute that does not incorporate the exemption:  
          Grain Elevators Board (Vic) v Dunmunkle Corp  
          (1946) 73 CLR 70. But as has been pointed out in a number of cases, care must be taken to determine whether the amending legislation merely makes clear what was implicit in the previous law or resolves doubts about its construction:  
          Allina Pty Ltd v FCT  
          (1991) 99 ALR 295 at 303 and see generally Pearce and Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia 4th ed at [3.18] [now 5th ed at [3.3011]]. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        In the Crown's submission, the 20O3 Act served merely to clarify the offences created by the 2002 Act and not to expand their ambit. The Crown submitted that the 2003 Act identified the constitutional basis for the operation of the terrorist offences in Pt 5.3 in a context that includes both referring States and non-referring States; s 100.2 and in s 100.3. Section 100.4 in subs (2) – (6) deals with the operation of the Pt 5.3 in relation to terrorist acts and preliminary acts occurring in a State that is not a referring State. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown referred to the Explanatory Memorandum of the 2003 Act and to the Attorney-General's Second Reading Speech in support of the submission that the 2003 Act was not intended to remedy any perceived deficiency in the ambit of the offences that had been introduced by the 2002 Act. I note that in  
        Downey v Trans Waste Pty Ltd  
        (1990-1991) 99 ALR 402 Dawson J, at 409, took into account the reasons for amending legislation by reference to the Minister's second reading speech. In moving the bill that became the 2003 Act be read a second time, the Attorney-General said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The Federal legislation enacted earlier this year creates a number of offences in relation to terrorist acts, terrorist organisations and terrorist financing. Those offences were based on existing Commonwealth constitutional powers. As the Commonwealth Constitution does not give the Commonwealth Parliament power to make laws with respect to terrorism as such, the offences rely on a patchwork of existing constitutional powers. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The patchwork of existing Commonwealth constitutional powers is extensive, but it is also complex. It is impossible to rule out unforeseen gaps in the coverage offered by offences based on existing powers. Arguments about possible gaps could be exploited by people trying to avoid prosecution. The reference of powers by the States and the enactment of this Bill will rule out these kinds of arguments. It will ensure comprehensive national application of the Federal counter-terrorism offences. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The Bill will re-enact Part 5.3 of the Criminal Code, which contains the terrorism offences enacted in June and amended in October this year, so that it attracts the support of the State references of power. The Bill will, in effect, re-enact the  
          Terrorist Act  
          offences in Division 101, the terrorist organisations offences in Division 102, and the financing of terrorism offences in Division 103. Once re-enacted, terrorism offences will be capable of operating throughout Australia, without any potential limitations arising from existing limits on Commonwealth constitutional powers. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The Bill does not effect [sic] the substance of the current offences. The re-enacted offences will be in the same terms as the current offences, but for the constitutional ""reading down"" provisions. The Government has already taken action under the current provisions. Regulations have been made specifying organisations as ""terrorist organisations"" for the purpose of the terrorist organisation offences (Mr Williams, Hansard, House of Representatives, 12 December 2002, at 10263/4). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        I do not infer that the introduction of the new Pt 5.3 into the  
        Criminal  
        Code  
        demonstrates that conduct not involving specific terrorist acts was not caught by the legislation as it stood in January 2003 (WS 10 August 2005, [12]). 
        
       
       
        
        In the Crown's submission the amendments introduced by the 2005 Act have no bearing on the provisions of  
        s  
        102.5 of the  
        Criminal  
        Code,  
        which deals with terrorist organisations. The Crown also submitted that reference to the Second Reading Speech in the Legislative Assembly lends no support to a contention that the amendments to Divisions 101 and 103 were effected in order to create criminal liability where it had not previously existed. In his speech moving that the bill which became the 2005 Act be read a second time the Attorney-General said this: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The amendments before the House today ensure that the Terrorist Act offences in Part 5.3 of the Criminal Code are interpreted as they were originally intended to be interpreted. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          They clarify that in a prosecution for a terrorist  
          offence it is  
          not necessary to identify a particular terrorist act. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The existing offences contain a subsection that provides that a person commits the offence even if ""the"" terrorist act does not occur. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          When the offences were originally drafted, it was not the intention that the prosecution would be required to identify a ""particular"" terrorist act. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The amendments will clarify that it is not necessary for the prosecution to identify a 
            
          specific terrorist act. (Mr Ruddock, Hansard, House of Representatives, 2 November 2005 at 62). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        In  
        Interlego AG v Croner Trading Pty Ltd  
        (1992) 111 ALR 577 Gummow J (as he then was) said at 612: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          There is a line of authority that an amendment may be taken into account in determining the scope of the prior legislation, at least to avoid a result which would render the amendment unnecessary, or futile or deficient; see especially  
          Grain Elevators Board (Vic) v Dunmunkle Corp  
          (1946) 73 CLR 70 at 85-6;  
          Hunter Resources Ltd v Melville  
          (1988) 164 CLR 234 at 254-5. But in doing so, caution should be exercised: see Pearce and Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia (3rd ed, 1988), ¶ 3.26. It is, after all, a curious way of revealing a parliamentary intention at the time of passing the earlier provision. As was observed by Viscount Haldane LC in Re Samuel [1913] AC 514 at 526: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          It is not a conclusive argument as to the construction of an earlier Act to say that unless it be construed in a particular way a later enactment would be surplusage. The later Act may have been designed, ex abundante cautela, to remove possible doubts. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        I do not consider that an inference should be drawn that the offences created by the 2002 Act did not embrace conduct not involving specific terrorist acts (WS 10 August 2005, [12]) from the fact of the enactment of the 2005 Act. I approach the accused's challenge to the capacity of the case as particularised to constitute an offence under s 102.5 by reference to the meaning of the expressions ""a terrorist act"" in s 102(1)(a) and 'terrorist act” in s 100.1(1) as these definitions stood in January 2003. 
        
       
       
        
        In written submissions the Crown contended that the accused's submission that it was necessary to identify a discrete and specific terrorist act was one that may have validity in relation to the offences created under Div 101 of the  
        Criminal Code  
        dealing with terrorist acts, but that it had no force with respect to Div 102, which provides for offences relating to terrorist organisations. It pointed to the broad definition of organisation in s 100.1(1) in support of a submission that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          In considering the meaning of ""terrorist organisation"", it is first to be noted that the legislation is referring to an organisation, that is, a standing body of people with a particular purpose; not a transient group of conspirators who may come together for a single discrete criminal purpose. The requirement for an ""organisation"" is consistent with the provision for an entity with an ongoing purpose of committing a number of terrorist acts with the intention of advancing the same political, religious or ideological cause (WS 18/11/05 at [10]). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        In the Crown's submission, the definition in s 102.1(1)(a) of a terrorist organisation as one directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act is inconsistent with the requirement for the involvement of the organisation in an immediate and specific terrorist act (WS 18/11/05 at [11]). 
        
       
       
        
        To the extent that the Crown's submission carries with it that the requirements of proof of a terrorist act in the context of the offences created in Div 101 may be distinguished from the requirements of proof of a terrorist act for the purpose of the Div 102 terrorist organisation offences, I reject it. The definition of terrorist act contained in Div 100 applies both to the terrorist act offences in Div 101 and the terrorist organisation offences in Div 102. 
        
       
       
        
        In R  
        v  
        Lohdi, (unreported) 23 December 2005, Whealy J considered the definition of ‘terrorist act’, observing that the definition postulates an action of threat of action of the widest possible kind (at paragraph 52). His Honour was dealing with  
        the  
        provisions of Pt 5.3 introduced by the 2003 Act however nothing turns on this since the definition of ""terrorist act"" was not subject to material alteration. I respectfully agree with his Honour's observations concerning the breadth of the action that may found a terrorist act. A terrorist act is an action that is done (or a threat of action that is made) with each of the intentions specified in subparas (b) and (c). The action must possess one or more of the features specified in subsection (2) provided that it does not have the features specified in subsection (2A). The latter excludes advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action that is not intended to cause serious harm (that is physical harm) to a person, or to cause death or to endanger life from founding a terrorist act. The breadth of the definition is such that advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action may be action that falls within subs(2), and be capable of founding a terrorist act, if it is not unaccompanied by the intentions specified in subs(2A)(i)-(iii). In my opinion the words of the definition admit of the killing of Indian soldiers in Kashmir being ""action"" within the meaning of subsection (2), which provided it is done (or the threat of it is made) with the intentions set out subparagraphs (b) and (c), may constitute a terrorist act. 
        
       
       
        
        A second basis of challenge identified by Mr Barker was that there is no suggestion that the accused knew of or contemplated the possibility of a discrete, specific terrorist act or that he intended to prepare to participate in any such act. If the accused is to be caught by the provisions of s 102.5(1) in Mr Barker's submission it is necessary that the training received by him be itself a terrorist act. This was said to flow from the provisions of s 100.2(1): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          This Part applies to a terrorist act constituted by an action, or threat of action, in relation to which the Parliament has power to legislate. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        In .the course of oral submissions Mr Barker put it this way: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          If he is not charged with a terrorist act constituted by an action or threat of action, there cannot be any case. In other words, if what the Crown sets out to prove in proving a case under 102.5, if that does not involve evidence of a terrorist act on the part of the accused, it can't come within Part 5.3 because it applies specifically to acts constituted by action or threat of action. (T 21/11/05 37.42-49) 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The  
        Criminal Code  
        codifies the law with respect to offences against the laws of the Commonwealth and s 100.2 sets out the constitutional basis for the offences created by Pt 5.3. The provisions of subsection (1) in my opinion do not operate to confine the offence created by s 102.5(1) in the way for which Mr Barker contends. The offence is the intentional receipt of training from (or provision of training to) an organisation that is a terrorist organisation and is known by the accused to be such. The offence is complete on proof of these elements and does not require proof of the commission of a terrorist act constituted by an action, or threat of action by the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        I note that the Crown accepts that in order to prove the fault element of knowledge it must establish that the accused knew LeT to be a terrorist organisation because he knew that it was directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act being the action or threat of action that the Crown relies on to prove the fact that LeT was a terrorist organisation at the material time. 
        
       
       
        
        For these reasons I reject the challenge to the indictment as particularised as not disclosing an offence that is known to law.” 
        
       
      
    34 Since the matter was argued before Bell J this Court considered a challenge to an indictment alleging a terrorist act contrary to the Code in Lodhi v R [2006] NSWCCA 121. That case was concerned with alleged offences under Division 101 of the Code. The Court confirmed that although the elements of the definition of “terrorist act” relevant to the asserted breach of the Code must be pleaded the terrorist act need not be further particularised. 
     
      
    35 The applicant submitted that the Court should take a different approach to Division 102 by reason of the fact that it extends to conduct which may be wholly innocent including the receipt of money from an organisation, even though the payment may be in no way related to a terrorist act. Accordingly, it was submitted that it is imperative that the ambit of Division 2 be narrowly confined. 
     
      
    36 The Code provides for two offences when a person is involved in training which relates to terrorist activities. Section 101.2 provides for an offence of training relating to a terrorist act in which event particulars of the alleged act would be required. Section 102.5 pursuant to which the applicant has been indicted requires proof the applicant intentionally trained with an organisation that is a terrorist organisation which engages the definition in s 102.1. In Lodhi Spigelman CJ said of the relevant offence creating provision in Division 101: 
     
      
       
        
        “Each of the offence sections is directed to the preliminary steps for actions which may have one or more effects. By their very nature, specific targets or particular effects will not necessarily, indeed not usually, have been determined at such a stage. In the present case, no complaint is made about Count 1 which identifies the terrorist act as bombing an unspecified “part” of the electricity system. 
         
         
        Preparatory acts are not often made into criminal offences. The particular nature of terrorism has resulted in a special, and in many ways unique, legislative regime. It was, in my opinion, the clear intention of Parliament to create offences where an offender has not decided precisely what he or she intends to do. A policy judgment has been made that the prevention of terrorism requires criminal responsibility to arise at an earlier stage than is usually the case for other kinds of criminal conduct, e.g. well before an agreement has been reached for a conspiracy charge. The courts must respect that legislative policy.” 
        
       
      
    37 I do not accept the applicant’s argument that a relevant distinction must be made between Division 101 and Division 102. Terrorist acts are relevantly described by reference to activities which may have been completed or which are merely planned. The definition of terrorist organisation incorporates the same concepts and having regard to the nature and purpose of the legislation I see no reason to approach it otherwise than this Court approached the relevant provisions in Lodhi. 
     
      
    38 Being the correct approach to the offence creating provision in Division 101 in my opinion the same approach is required to be taken to the definition of terrorist organisation in s 102. Accordingly, it will be sufficient to particularise an act having the character of a terrorist act without identifying a particular act which has occurred or is planned. 
     
      
       
      
    39 An organisation will be a terrorist organisation if it engages in conduct which may result in a completed terrorist act even if the act has not been completed or the planning has progressed no further than a generalised aim without descending to a specific act. 
     
      
    40 The amended particulars provide that the relevant terrorist act is “an action involving physical attack on members of the Indian armed services in Kashmir” with other relevant characteristics. No greater particularity is required. 
     
      
    41 Although I would grant leave to appeal on this ground I would reject the appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: Her Honour erred in concluding the statements made by the applicant were admissible for the truth of their contents, even though the opinions expressed therein were based on otherwise inadmissible evidence. 
       
      
    42 The rationale for this ground of appeal is not entirely clear. As ultimately articulated it was submitted that the prosecution was doomed to fail because the Crown could not prove by admissible evidence that the applicant trained with a terrorist organisation. 
     
      
    43 When this issue was argued before Bell J reference was made to records of interview given by the applicant which the Crown proposes to tender at the trial. Relevant passages are identified by her Honour (see paras [66]-[77]) and I need not repeat them. Upon the assumption that they are admitted into evidence (which for present purposes must be accepted) they are capable of proving that the applicant received training which he understood was to require him to fight and to injure or kill Indian soldiers. If that is not sufficient to raise the necessary inference in relation to the organisation, the Crown proposes to call additional evidence from a witness K to prove the nature of the organisation. Although her Honour expressed reservations about the contribution which this evidence could make to the Crown case I am not persuaded that it is irrelevant to the argument. 
     
      
    44 Beyond these matters the applicant submitted that insofar as the applicant expresses an opinion that the alleged organisation is a “terrorist organisation” his evidence would not be admissible pursuant to s 78 of the Evidence Act. Whether the evidence is admitted and the basis for its admission is a matter for the trial judge who can make the decision having regard to the whole of the evidence tendered and the issues which require resolution. It is sufficient for present purposes to acknowledge that there is evidence beyond the applicant’s opinion which is proposed to be tendered which could prove the Crown case. Otherwise as this Court has said a ruling as to the admissibility of evidence is not amenable to appeal pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912: see R v Edelsten (1989) 18 NSWLR 213; R v Powch (1988) 14 NSWLR 136; R v Bailey (1988) 36 A Crim R 30; Steffan v R (1993) 30 NSWLR 633. 
     
      
    45 Leave to raise this ground should be refused. 
     
      
       
      Orders: 
       
       
      1. Application for leave to raise grounds 1 and 2 granted but the appeal dismissed. 
       
      2. Leave to raise ground 3 refused.

    HIS HONOUR: As to the sentencing of Mark Anthony Morris.1. The offender is Mark Anthony Morris. He was born on either 22 March 1964, as per the records of the New South Wales Police, exhibit E1, the Victorian Police, exhibit E2, the New South Wales Department of Corrective Services, exhibit FF, and the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service, exhibit GG, or 22nd September 1965, as per the report of Ms Duffy, psychologist, exhibit 2. Accordingly, he was aged either forty-one years three months, or thirty-nine years ten months when on 22 July 2005 he committed the subject offence.2. The offender’s background and upbringing are referred to in the report of Ms Duffy. He is the eldest of his parents’ five children. He had two brothers and two sisters. His parents are alive. The younger of his two brothers died during 1994. His other brother and sisters are alive. Although I accept that his background and upbringing played a part in shaping the way that he has lived his life, there is nothing, so far as I am aware, in his background or upbringing relevant to his commission of the subject offence.3. The offender's education and employments, like his background and upbringing, are referred to in the report of Ms Duffy and, like them, there is nothing, so far as I am aware, in his education or employments relevant to his commission of the subject offence.4. The offender is, so far as I am aware, single, never having married, and he does not have anyone dependent upon him.5. The offender’s state of health, both physical and mental, is referred to in the report of Ms Duffy and need not be recited. There is nothing to show or to suggest that any medical condition of the offender caused or contributed to his commission of the subject offence. 6. The offender’s past abuse of intoxicating liquor and prohibited drugs is referred to in the report of Ms Duffy and need not be recited. There is nothing to show or to suggest that the offender was under the influence of or even affected by intoxicating liquor or any prohibited drug when he committed the subject offence.7. The offender does not have an unblemished character. He has a criminal record in New South Wales, see exhibit EE1, and Victoria, see exhibit EE2. In New South Wales he has been dealt with for fifty-nine offences, thirty-three in a Children’s Court, fifteen in a Local Court, ten in the District Court and one in the Supreme Court, and in Victoria he has been dealt with for two offences. Of the offences dealt with in New South Wales two involved the use of violence, being assault dealt with on 16 March 1984 and assault occasioning actual bodily harm dealt with on 20 June 2000, and one involved the use of a weapon, being armed robbery dealt with on 5 December 2000, and of the offences dealt with in Victoria, one involved the use of both violence and a weapon, being murder dealt with on 30 June 1988. I think that it is interesting to note from the remarks of Justice Teague on sentencing the offender for murder, see exhibit EE3, that the offender blamed the murdered victim for what had happened, just as he when interviewed by police and by his counsel’s cross-examination of the Crown’s witnesses, blamed the complainant for what had happened.8. The offender was on conditional liberty at the time when he committed the subject offence. 9. On 5 December 2000 the offender was sentenced by a judge of this Court to imprisonment for seven years, with a non-parole period of four years six months from 18 February 2000 to 17 August 2004, and a parole period of two years six months from 18 August 2004 to 17 February 2007, for the offence of armed robbery. He was released from prison on 24 April 2005, see exhibit FF, to be on parole to 17 February 2007. He committed the subject offence less than three months after his release from prison. His commission of the subject offence constituted a breach of his parole. This is an aggravating factor of the subject offence. On 26 July 2005 the Parole Board revoked the offender’s parole, see exhibit GG.10. Moreover, on 13 July 2005, only eleven days before he committed the subject offence, the offender was charged with a number of driving offences and, after he had been charged with them, he was released on bail to appear later in the Local Court at Wyong to answer the charges. His commission of the subject offences constituted a breach of his bail. This is a further aggravating factor of the subject offence.11. On 24 July 2005 the offender committed the subject offence. At about 1am on that day he attacked Mr Wade Burns when armed with a knife and he wounded Mr Burns a number of times, after which he ran away, taking the knife with him.12. On 28 July 2005 the offender was arrested and, after being arrested, he was taken to The Entrance Police Station where he was interviewed. The interview was recorded on video and audio tapes. A transcript of the edited interview became exhibit Y2 during the offender’s trial. During the interview the offender admitted having been involved in the incident with the complainant, he denied that he had been armed with a knife and that he had been the aggressor, and he alleged that the complainant had been armed with the knife and that the complainant had been the aggressor. The offender has been in prison since his arrest on 28 July 2006 serving the balance of the sentence imposed upon him on 5 December 2000 for the offence of armed robbery following revocation of his parole on 26 July 2005, see paragraph 9 above.13. In due course, on 17 November 2005 the offender appeared before a magistrate in the Local Court at Wyong for a committal hearing. It was a paper committal hearing. Not surprisingly or unexpectedly as the Crown’s case was not challenged or tested, the offender was committed to appear in this Court on 9 December 2005 for arraignment.14. In due course, on 15 May 2006 the offender appeared before me in the Court at Gosford to stand his trial. The Crown Prosecutor presented an indictment charging the offender with having maliciously wounded the complainant on 24 July 2005. This is an offence contrary to section 35 subsection 1 of the Crimes Act, for which the prescribed penalty is imprisonment for a maximum of seven years when dealt with on indictment or imprisonment for a maximum of two years if dealt with summarily. It is an offence which does not carry a standard non-parole period. The offender pleaded not guilty to the charge. A jury was empanelled. The jury heard evidence from seventeen witnesses, all called by the Crown Prosecutor, and it received twenty nine exhibits, some of which had more than one part, all presented by the Crown Prosecutor, over four days, from 15 to 18 May 2006, counsel’s addresses on one day, 18 May 2006, my summing-up on one day, 19 May 2006 and it returned its verdict of guilty on 22 May 2006 after deliberating over two days, 19 and 22 May 2006.15. The jury’s verdict did not surprise me as the Crown’s case was strong to the point of being overwhelming and the offender’s case, as contained in the interview of him by police on 28 July 2005, and as suggested by his counsel in cross-examination of the Crown’s witnesses, was unlikely to the point of being fanciful.16. I do not have any doubt that the offender, when armed with a knife, ran towards the complainant intending to attack him with the knife and that the complainant, in defending himself against the offender’s attack, tackled the offender, sending them both onto the concrete path leading from the stairs at the footpath to the home, and that then the offender stabbed the complainant a number of times with the knife, after which, and fortunately for the complainant, Mr Anderson, the complainant’s friend, intervened, which led to the offender running away, taking the knife with him.17. The offender’s attack upon the complainant was a premeditated, unprovoked, armed and cowardly attack upon an unsuspecting, unarmed, defenceless and helpless man, which resulted in the complainant suffering numerous wounds, lacerations, grazes and abrasions. Fortunately, as a result of luck, the complainant’s actions in his own defence and the intervention of his friend, Mr Anderson, none of the complainant’s injuries was serious or life threatening and, so far as I am aware, the complainant has recovered from his injuries. Of course, the number of the complainant’s injuries and the nature and extent of them are indications of the ferocity of the attack and of the offender’s intention at the time.18. The offence committed by the offender involved the use of violence and the use of a weapon. It was, as I have said, an armed attack upon an unarmed man. It resulted in the victim suffering numerous injuries. It was, in my assessment, at the top of the range of seriousness for offences of its kind. It falls within the class of worst case of its kind. It merits, and demands, an appropriately severe penalty.19. The offender’s counsel submitted that the offence was not premeditated, being unplanned and spontaneous. I do not agree. I accept that, when the offender left his flat at the rear of the property, taking a knife with him, and why he did so is unexplained, and walked to the corner of the building at the front of the property, he did not intend to attack and to injure the complainant. However, I find that he stood at the corner of the building at the front of the property, that he watched Mr Anderson and the complainant as they walked along the footpath from one corner of the property towards the other corner of it, that, while watching the complainant and what the complainant was doing, he decided to attack the complainant with the knife and that, having made that decision, he ran from where he was standing towards the complainant carrying the knife in one hand and he attacked the complainant with the knife.20. The offender’s counsel submitted that the offender was provoked by the complainant. I do not agree. Although I accept that the complainant used offensive language towards the offender, which language was in response to offensive language used by the offender towards the complainant, that the complainant was dry retching while leaning on the letterbox at the front of the property and that the complainant tackled the offender when the offender ran at him with the knife in one of his hands, none of the words or actions of the complainant could be considered to amount to provocation for the conduct of the offender, and, in any event, the complainant’s tackling of the offender was an act in his own defence.21. As to the offender’s prospects for rehabilitation and as to the likelihood of the offender not reoffending, I consider that, having regard to his past, it is obvious that the offender is not motivated towards living a crime free life and that, if he does not get his way, he will resort to the use of violence. 22. In determining an appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender for the offence, of which the jury has found him to be guilty, I must recognise the purposes of sentencing outlined in section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and I must take into account such of the aggravating factors referred to in section 21A subsection 2 of the Act as are present, and such of the mitigating factors referred to in subsection 3 of the section as are present, and any other relevant factor.23. As to section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, having regard to what I have said already about the offence and the offender, I consider that the only appropriate aggravating factor is that lettered (l), in subsection 2 and that the only appropriate mitigating factors are those lettered (a) and (b), that is, not part of an organised criminal activity, in subsection 3 of the section.24. One factor not mentioned in section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is deterrence. I see both personal and general deterrence to be important. Neither can be ignored or overlooked. Having regard to the offender’s criminal past he must be reminded, yet again, and loudly and clearly, that repeat offending will not be tolerated. Others who may think of doing what the offender has done must be deterred from doing so.25. Another factor not mentioned in section 21A of the Act is the concurrent jurisdiction of the Local Court. In some cases the fact that the Local Court has concurrent jurisdiction with this Court will entitle an offender to a discount in penalty (see R v El Masri (2005) NSWCCA 167; also R v Gent (2005) NSWCCA 370), but in this case, in view of the objective seriousness of the offence and the aggravating factor that the offender was on conditional liberty at the time of committing the offence, I can understand the reason for the Director of Public Prosecutions prosecuting the offender in this Court, rather than in a Local Court and I cannot see that the offender is entitled to any discount in penalty because of the concurrent jurisdiction of the Local Court.26. What, then, having regard to what I have said about the offence and the offender, is an appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender for that offence? 27. When I take into account the objective circumstances of the offence, the subjective circumstances of the offender, the purposes of sentencing, the aggravating and mitigating relevant factors referred to above, I have determined that the appropriate sentence to impose on the offender is the maximum sentence of imprisonment for seven years.28. Apportionment of a sentence of imprisonment for seven years into a non-parole period and a parole period in accordance with the statutory ratio between a non-parole period and a parole period would produce a non-parole period of five years three months and a parole period of one year nine months.29. The offender’s counsel submitted that the length of the non-parole period should be reduced and the length of the parole period should be increased because of accumulation of the sentence upon the sentence being served, and the need for the offender to be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service for a lengthy period to assist him to return to living in the community.30. I accept that accumulation of this sentence upon the sentence being served is a special circumstance to vary the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the parole period, however, I do not accept that the offender’s need for supervision is a special circumstance to vary that statutory ratio as the offender’s past has shown that he is not motivated towards living a crime free life. I propose to fix a non-parole period of four years six months and a parole period of two years six months.31. The question then arises as to the day on which the sentence is to commence. This day could be the day of the offender’s arrest, or the day on which his trial commenced, or the day on which the jury found him to be guilty, or today, or the day following the day of expiry of the sentence being served, or any day between the day of his arrest and the day following the day of expiry of the sentence being served. The offender’s counsel submitted that the day for commencement of the sentence should not be later than twelve months from the day of the offender’s arrest because had the offender not committed the subject offence but had the offender been arrested for the breach of parole referred to in the statement of Ms Leafe, exhibit GG, the likelihood is that the Parole Board would have granted parole to him within twelve months of his arrest on 28 July 2005. I have a discretion as to the day on which the sentence is to commence, (see R v Callahan 2006 NSWCCA 58). I consider that, although the offender has not been held in prison in relation to the subject offence, it is fair and just to the offender that I commence the sentence that I will impose upon him on 28 January 2006.32. Accordingly, Mark Anthony Morris, for the offence of malicious wounding, of which the jury found you to be guilty, you are convicted. I sentence you to imprisonment for seven years. I fix a non-parole period of four years six months to commence on 28 January 2006 and to expire on 27 July 2010, on which day you are eligible to be released on parole, and a parole period of two years six months to commence on 28 July 2010 and to expire on 27 January 2013. I order that you be subject to supervision by the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service whilst on parole during the parole period.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: This is a Crown appeal asserting the inadequacy of sentence imposed by Geraghty DCJ at Sydney District Court. The respondent had been committed for sentence from Central Local Court following his plea of guilty to supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA) commonly called ecstasy. His Honour was asked to take into account pursuant to the Form 1 procedure further offences of cultivating a prohibited plant (fifty four cannabis plants); possession of a prohibited substance (0.34 grammes of MDMA); possession of a restricted substance (Stanazol) and possession of unlawfully obtained goods in premises ($5,000 cash). 
     
      
    3 The respondent was sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of five years two months commencing on 26 February 2005 and a balance term of two years seven months. This amounts to an effective total sentence of seven years nine months. The primary offence had available a prescribed maximum penalty of life imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 The respondent is a Serbian national who arrived in Australia in 2003 as a member of the support entourage for a musical group. He was permitted entry pursuant to a visitor’s visa which was valid for one month. He overstayed that visa. There remained in Serbia a former partner, Sanja Lukenic (also known as Tomic) and three daughters born to their relationship. Whilst he was in Australia, the respondent married Ljiljana Novakovic. The evidence did not disclose when this marriage took place. A letter from Ms Novakovic tendered in the sentence proceedings (Exhibit 5) stated that they are separated but remain close friends.  
     
      
    5 Another letter (Exhibit 2) authored by Jelena Marjanovic asserts that she and he “became involved in an intimate relationship in December of 2003 which lasted until Nenad’s arrest”. She states that she was unaware of his illegal activities and has “ended the relationship but we have remained good friends”. It would appear that she is referring to the arrest in February 2005 although the respondent had been arrested previously in respect of the matters which were eventually dealt with on the Form 1. Interviewed by police after the February arrest, the respondent claimed that he was living “at the moment” with his girlfriend, Zorica Popovic in a hotel “in the city”, the address of which he did not know. The content of intercepted telephone calls would confirm the likely existence of an intimate relationship between the respondent and Ms Popovic. In his testimony at the sentencing hearing, the respondent mentioned the marriage to Ms Novakovic and the relationship with Ms Marjanovic in response to questions led commencing “since you’ve been in Australia have you had relationships with two women?” (T13 – 14 December 2005). No mention was made of Ms Popovic. 
     
      
    6 In a letter (and translation) tendered in the proceedings, Ms Lukenic stated that her “husband by marriage” lived and worked in Australia but the respondent, the father of her children, lived with her in Serbia until he disappeared in 2002. She heard that he was somewhere in Montenegro but in late 2004 he started calling her from Australia. The respondent denied some of this detail, asserting that he left Serbia in March 2003 and that Ms Lukenic had seen him off at the airport. Despite his marriage and subsequent relationships, he expressed an intention to bring Ms Lukenic and the children to Australia. 
     
      
    7 The respondent came to the notice of police on 15 April 2004 when they executed a search warrant at Mount St Thomas near Wollongong and he was detained after he was located trying to leave the premises by a rear door. The door from which he emerged contained cannabis plants (linked to an elaborate hydroponic set-up). Further search led to the location of other items which, together with the cannabis under cultivation, constituted the offences in respect of which the respondent acknowledged his guilt and asked his Honour to take into account pursuant to the Form 1 procedure when he was being sentenced. 
     
      
    8 After arrest and charge in respect of those matters, the respondent was released on bail. In cross examination he admitted that he did not appear in Court in accordance with his bail undertaking. His Honour found that he was invited to establish another “cannabis business” but declined, and he noted his claim that he went into hiding in order to avoid the overtures of his “business partner” Nikola Sipka. Nikola Sipka died in June 2005.  
     
      
    9 The respondent testified that Sipka was in effect a principal of the Mount Thomas venture and provided money for the respondent’s legal fees after his arrest and also to establish the venture at Dee Why in respect of which the respondent faced the primary charge. He said he came out of hiding after January 2005 when Ms Lukenic contacted him about a letter she had received threatening harm to her and the children. 
     
      
    10 Consequent upon this information he met Nikola Sipka who persuaded him to participate in the new criminal venture of manufacturing MDMA at premises in Dee Why. The respondent testified that this commenced in February 2005 but by 21 February 2005 police had commenced physical and electronic surveillance of the activity.  
     
      
    11 Police became aware that the respondent had injured his hand operating a press used in drug manufacture and had attended for treatment at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. At the hospital he gave a false name. 
     
      
    12 On 26 February a warrant was executed at the Dee Why premises and the respondent and a co-offender Nikolic were arrested. Just short of forty four kilos of manufactured MDMA were seized. This is nearly eighty eight times the amount of drug scheduled in legislation as constituting a large commercial quantity. 
     
      
    13 The premises were found to contain the accoutrements of drug manufacture. In addition to the pill press, there were found mixing bowls, air purifying respirators, dust masks, eye goggles, punches, dies for the press, bags and a container in which there was a quantity of tablets and as well there were supplies of sealable bags. The dining room of the premises in particular was covered in green powder and a similar powder was extracted from the vacuum cleaner. The green dust was analysed and discovered to represent varying purities of MDMA. 
     
      
    14 It was plain that, like the earlier cannabis cultivation, the respondent had involved himself in illicit drug activity on a planned “commercial” scale. 
     
      
    15 His Honour imposed sentence by assessing what he described as a “starting point” of twelve years. He discounted this by a factor of 20 percent to recognize the respondent’s plea of guilty which was made at the earliest opportunity after an alteration in the specification of the preferred charge. There was, by agreement of counsel, a further discount of 15 percent for matters described in a document identified as Exhibit F which his Honour directed to be sealed. We have examined that document in the course of hearing the appeal.  
     
      
    16 Given the content of Exhibit F, I comment that the discount appears very generous but, in the light of the express agreement, I consider that it should be taken as appropriate. 
     
      
    17 Geraghty DCJ noted that it was “conceded by the Crown” that these two reductions should be added together and deducted from the head sentence. Hence, a notional sentence of twelve years reduced by 35 percent became seven years nine months and this was divided into a non parole period of five years and two months and a balance term of two years seven months. The applicable provision of sentencing legislation requires the setting of the non parole period first but there is no reason why that setting and the setting of the balance term (amounting to a total sentence) need be done in a two step process and the relevant steps may be taken simultaneously: R v Hampton 1998 44 NSWLR 729; R v Way 2004 60 NSWLR 168. 
     
      
    18 Having regard to the concession, I would be content to approach the issues on the basis that the plea of guilty and the matters referred to in Exhibit F should be implemented by application of an applicable discount of 35 percent against notional total starting point. In adopting this course in this case I would not wish to be taken to be holding that where a sentencing judge estimates discounts against sentence otherwise assessed which involve different factors, those factors should necessarily be added together before being applied.  
     
      
    19 The prescribed maximum penalty for the offence to which the respondent pleaded guilty was, as I have said, imprisonment for life. There is also specified in Part 4 Division 1A of the legislation a standard non parole period of fifteen years imprisonment. This is not directly applicable unless the offence is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for the offence and the conviction follows trial. The plea of guilty by the respondent avoided the necessity of trial. His Honour does not appear to have made a finding in terms of range but he did state that “there is no doubt on an objective basis, that the offence is extremely serious”. I consider that the respondent’s blatant criminal activity would be placed at least in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for this offence. 
     
      
    20 His Honour recognized that, although the standard non parole period did not apply, it was a guideline to be “borne in mind” when sentencing.  
     
      
    21 He expressed his ultimate conclusions in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Bearing in mind the guideline of a standard non-parole period of fifteen years and, for the moment, not considering the guilty plea or the co-operation offered by the offender, and considering especially the quantity of the drugs involved, the role of the offender in the joint enterprise and the duress factor, a starting point for a total sentence in my estimation is twelve years. This period of a total sentence reflects the objective seriousness of the offence, the aggravating factors to which I have referred, as well as the mitigating factors, except the factor of the plea of guilty”. 
        
       
      
    22 A non parole period (standard or otherwise) must represent the minimum period of imprisonment to be served because the crime committed calls for such detention: Power v The Queen 1974 131 CLR 623; R v Simpson 2001 53 NSWLR 704. To the extent that a standard non parole period offers guidance it must guide in respect of that minimum term. It appears from his Honour’s remarks that he used the specified standard non parole period as a guide to his assessment of a total sentence.  
     
      
    23 It is observable in the above quoted summary of his findings that his Honour made no reference to the crimes required to be taken into account pursuant to the Form 1 procedure. These were offences of considerable gravity. I am conscious that at the conclusion of his remarks his Honour said that he had taken the matters on the Form 1 into account and, although I accept this statement, it is difficult to perceive that offences of the magnitude involved have been reflected in a sentence (after discounts) consisting of a non parole period of five years two months and a balance term of two years seven months. Neither is the reflection of the Form 1 matters perceptible in the stated starting point of twelve years.  
     
      
    24 The use of the Form 1 procedure is designed to achieve a longer sentence than would have been imposed for the primary offence had it stood alone: Attorney General’s application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; No 1 of 2000 2002 56 NSWLR 146; Des Rosiers v R [2006] NSWCCA 6. 
     
      
    25 Whether the assessment by his Honour is so low that latent error should be deduced is a question which needs to be assessed after analysis of the factors which his Honour took into account and in particular those which he took into account as mitigating factors.  
     
      
    26 I have already mentioned the discounts totalling 35 percent against sentence which his Honour applied. The other mitigating factors found by his Honour seem to be the absence of prior conviction, that he “has expressed his remorse and regret”, duress and his participation as “a factory worker or a labourer” rather than as a principal in the criminal enterprise. 
     
      
    27 The value of the absence of prior conviction is somewhat diminished by the commission of the offences which were ultimately taken into account on the Form 1 and by the fact that, before being arrested and charged with the primary matter, he was at conditional liberty on bail (which he breached) in respect of those offences.  
     
      
    28 His Honour did not make a finding in terms that the respondent was remorseful and his evaluation of the expressions to that effect, to himself and to friends who provided testimonial letters, was accompanied by what seemed to be some reservation when he said that such expression “is an easy matter to do when facing the consequences of such a serious crime”.  
     
      
    29 There can be no argument about the correctness of the characterization of the respondent’s activity as that of a factory worker or labourer, nor, in my opinion, of his Honour’s conclusion that the respondent was “an essential part of the joint enterprise”. He recognized that a measure should be made against what the respondent did rather than simply trying to deduce his ranking among the participants in the enterprise: The Queen v Olbrich 1999 199 CLR 270. That the respondent’s activity might have been more serious had he been a principal does not constitute an element of mitigation. Obviously the appropriate penalty for more serious activity is likely to require severer reflection than lesser activity, but the existence of a hypothetical discrimination does not provide a mitigatory factor against appropriate penalty reflecting what the respondent has in fact done. 
     
      
    30 The fourth apparent factor of mitigation taken into account by his Honour was duress. It is plain from the extent to which his Honour elaborated his findings in this regard that he gave significant weight to it.  
     
      
    31 The sequence of events was that the respondent asserted that he became indebted in the sum of $10,000 for the equipment which was used in the hydroponic production of cannabis – which, I would observe, seems to place the respondent at a higher level than being a mere labourer in that enterprise – and a further $10,000 for legal expenses. The latter, I assume, were incurred in connection with his arrest and charge following the discovery of the Mount St Thomas activity by police. The respondent claimed that he had repaid $2,500 of this debt. 
     
      
    32 As earlier mentioned, he went into hiding. He reappeared and became involved in ecstasy manufacture after being told that his Serbian family received a threat by letter.  
     
      
    33 The translation of this letter is as follows (Chokie is a reference to the respondent): 
     
      
       
        
        “To Sanja Tomic, mother of Chokie’s three children. You were not at home when we came by to explain some things to you. We shall come another time or maybe it will be better for you and your children if we do not come at all; also mum and dad live peacefully and nicely in 28 Podavalska St., but for how much longer we don’t know, depends on you and also on your husband Chokie who apparently thinks that he can borrow without having any intentions of paying back. We have tried to bring him back to his senses in a normal and civilized way, but he thought he could avoid it by hiding, but Mister has forgotten that he has a wife and three children in Serbia, that is you. Therefore, we ask you to tell him to come to his senses, to get in touch with us and have his debts settled, otherwise we will be collecting them via you and your children. I hope we are the only ones he owes to and that he will know whom to turn to. In the case that he doesn’t know, tell him that a friend from Australia is sending his regards; he will figure it out then. At least you can be reasonable – if he can’t, and don’t let you children end up in Italy. We shall wait for a little while to see what results this letter will bring. And just for you to know how lucky you were for not having been at home when we arrived otherwise we would have taken your eldest daughter to show you how serious this is”. 
        
       
      
    34 Ms Lukenic understood this anonymous letter as a threat of violence and she made a written report to a Serbian government department concerning those “threatening me and endangering my life and the lives of my children” and requested that they be found and that the Resnik (her place of residence) police force “watch over me more often”. 
     
      
    35 A response from that department stated that investigation did not get “any clues” which would aid in the identification of the “persons who left the threatening letter”.  
     
      
    36 His Honour’s findings, after noting that duress might be a significant mitigating factor even if not available as a defence, were: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have already recited the details of the alleged debt owed to Nikola Sipka by the offender, in the sum of $20,000, and of the threat to recover money, which at the time of the threat, would seem to have been $17,500. Quite a paltry amount when one thinks of the money that would be ‘earned’ by putting forty-four kilograms of ecstasy on the market. I do not accept this was a genuine debt. I do accept that among fellow criminals, one man often provides money to another in a business endeavour. I do not accept the  
        physical 
         involvement of Nikola Sipka in the provision of the equipment since, being a one legged man, it would seem impossible for him to deliver the pills, the powder and the heavy machinery to a coffee shop. I do accept however, that there were threats to the family of the offender in Serbia. I do accept that those threats appeared to be demanding repayment of money, but were in fact a violent means to maintain Stankovic’s involvement in criminal enterprises. His initial involvement was to make fast, easy money. He himself initiated this involvement and freely engaged in this criminal activity. But, once part of the criminal world, he became more deeply involved in it so that he was drawn down and blackmailed as it were into further inducement, and threats were made to his family. These threats predated the production of the pills at Dee Why and would seem to have been a reason for the offender becoming further involved”. 
        
       
      
    37 Given all the foregoing, the Crown’s submissions were in summary: 
     
      
       
      (a) A starting point of twelve years total must have reflected too much weight having been given to the extent of duress which his Honour found; 
       
      (b) A starting point of twelve years imprisonment could not have taken into account the Form 1 matters; 
       
      (c) The objective seriousness of the primary offence was “lost” in whatever equation his Honour used to determine sentence; and 
       
      (d) A non parole period of five years two months could not, as it is required to, reflect the objective gravity of the offence. 
       
      
    38 As I have already observed, I would accept his Honour’s statement that he took into account the Form 1 matters, however, the consequential figure which he used (before the 35 percent discount) on any analysis cannot disclose any greater than a minimal contribution to the commission by the respondent of those offences. As was observed about the Form 1 procedure in Des Rosier: 
     
      
       
        
        “There must be some increase in sentence, above that otherwise appropriate to the circumstances of the primary offence”. 
        
       
      
    39 In the present case, the magnitude of the criminality involved in the Form 1 offences is such that the increase would need to have been substantial. 
     
      
    40 The Crown contention that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate has been made out for the reasons above summarized. The sentence should be quashed and this Court should proceed to resentence. In so doing the restraint to be exercised in recognition of what is frequently termed “double jeopardy” following a successful Crown appeal must be borne in mind and applied. 
     
      
    41 As Olbrich makes clear, a participant in drug activity should be sentenced for what he or she has done as distinct from their ranking in the criminal organization. Although I would accept his Honour’s categorization of the respondent as a worker or labourer, the statement of facts records that the co-offender Nikolic had arranged the leasing of the Dee Why premises and that: 
     
      
       
        
        “It would appear that Nikolic also worked making tablets but the electronic and physical surveillance over the 5-day period prior to the arrests indicates the majority of the blending and pressing for the tablets was done by Stankovic”. 
        
       
      
    42 In evidence at the sentencing proceedings the respondent confirmed the limited role of the co-offender: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Did the man (Sipka) then indicate to you how you might be able to repay the debt that he said you owed him? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did he say you could do to repay that debt? 
        
       
       
        
        A. He brought along a machine and two bags of this powder and a bag with green tablets. And he explained to me that I have to grind these tablets and I have to mix them with the powder and from 90,000 I should make 180,000. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Were you alone in doing that or was there another man involved? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I was doing that myself. The man that was involved in this he only rented the house. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That’s the man who was your co-offender Mr Nikolic? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes”. 
        
       
      
    43 A critical matter is the weight to be given to the finding of duress. As Geraghty DCJ noted (and accepted) the threats appeared to relate to demanding money. The approach to the family in Serbia was made by delivery of the anonymous letter and there was no evidence of any further approach following Ms Lukenic’s request for police investigation or any further approach at all. 
     
      
    44 Whilst the threat operated on the respondent’s mind as his Honour found, his initial involvement was to make fast, easy money and, once involved, irrespective of what motivated him, he freely engaged in the criminal activity. He was not supervised. The content of the translations of the intercepted telephone calls does not reveal any instance where he mentioned that he was acting by reason of fear and in fact the overall tenor of his conversations is of enthusiastic participation in what was anticipated to be a very profitable enterprise. 
     
      
    45 Although the current provision of the sentencing legislation requires that the non parole period be set first, that does not mean that the total effect of the sentence is to be ignored. It is desirable in this instance to approach assessment using the same procedure adopted in the District Court so that it will make patent any needed comparison. 
     
      
    46 In my view, giving full weight to the matters of objective seriousness of the offence, the respondent’s role and the very serious matters on the Form 1 of which account must be given, and the matters of mitigation with particular emphasis on the element of duress as well as the restraint which I previously mentioned, I would consider an appropriate starting point for total sentence would be eighteen years imprisonment. In that estimation I necessarily have regard to guidance offered by the statutory prescription of available maximum penalty of life imprisonment and the standard non parole period of fifteen years, both of which guides stand independently of the need to reflect the Form 1 matters. 
     
      
    47 I would adopt the total discount of 35 percent for the reasons given by Geraghty DCJ. I have noted the agreement by counsel at first instance and this was not sought to be repudiated in the appeal. I would also, like his Honour, not depart from the proportion between non parole period and balance term which would result from application of the formula mentioned in the statute. The final figures, adopting those approaches, should be slightly rounded. 
     
      
    48 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (a) Crown appeal against sentence allowed. 
       
      (b) Sentence imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
      (c) In lieu thereof, taking into account the matters scheduled in the Form 1, the respondent sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of eight years nine months commencing on 26 February 2005 and expiring on 25 November 2013, with a balance term of two years eleven months commencing on 26 November 2013. 
       
      (d) The earliest date of eligibility for release to parole is specified as 25 November 2013. 
       
      
    49 HIDDEN J: This was an unusual and troubling case, which presented Geraghty DCJ with a difficult sentencing exercise. The measure of duress affecting the respondent was an important matter. Nevertheless, while giving that matter the weight which it deserved, I am persuaded, for the reasons expressed by Grove J, that the sentence is manifestly inadequate and that this Court should intervene. 50 I agree with the orders proposed by Grove J.

      2005/1090 - REGINA v ASHRAF MENCARIOUS 
       
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Ashraf Mencarious, following your plea of not guilty, you have been convicted of the murder of your wife by verdict of a jury and it is my task to sentence you for that crime. 
     
      
    2 You were born in Egypt on 10 April 1967 but migrated to Australia with your family when you were aged about three or four years. The migration was arranged through the Eastern Coptic Church and the adherence of your family and yourself to this faith has been a matter of some significance.  
     
      
    3 Formal education was undertaken in local schools in the western suburbs of Sydney and you left Holroyd High School in Year 11 to pursue studies in accounting at Granville TAFE. In steady employment for over ten years, you progressed from clerk to costing supervisor and it is obvious that you were a diligent employee. 
     
      
    4 During this period you met a woman whom you married in 1994. That marriage produced two children, a daughter born in 1995 and a son in 1997. You had moved to Queensland and the relationship between yourself and your wife deteriorated and the marriage failed. There have been allegations about your conduct towards your first wife but I am not satisfied of the facts to the necessary standard and I make no adverse finding towards you in those regards. I note that you have not seen these children since late 2001 although I accept that personal contact would be inhibited by the need for interstate travel. 
     
      
    5 You reported to Mr Benad, a psychologist, that you were depressed after the breakdown of this marriage. You apparently ceased employment for a time, as he noted that you resumed employment, and worked for a number of corporations in administrative, financial or accounting roles. 
     
      
    6 I am presented with material which differs in some detail as to how your second marriage came about. Mr Benad records that you spoke to your father about a desire for a committed relationship and your father commented on a woman whom he had met through the church in Egypt, Nevine Youssef. Ms Bond, who prepared the pre sentence report, recorded that you told her that it was your family suggestion that they arrange for you to marry a second time. You told her that you were not completely happy with the idea, but in contemplating your first marriage which was a love marriage which failed, you considered that perhaps an arranged marriage would give you a stable family life. You expressed a desire for this. You told Ms Bond that it was your mother who made first contact with Nevine Youssef’s mother through the church in Egypt and that “the families arranged from there on to the wedding”.  
     
      
    7 You travelled to Egypt to meet Nevine Youssef. You had been there for fifteen days when you married her on 27 January 2002. You returned to Australia shortly thereafter, apparently on or about 8 February 2002. Your wife’s visa needed to be arranged and she did not arrive in Australia until August 2003. 
     
      
    8 Overall the marriage was far from happy. There were a number of incidents, to some of which I will later refer. Except where a third person was present as a witness, I have only your version of events and of course I have no version from your wife.  
     
      
    9 Despite unpromising beginnings and an apparent mistrust of your wife, which you said was consequent upon her stripping the monies from an account which you made available to her, she became pregnant and on 1 July 2004 a son, John, was born. However, you became separated from your wife and eventually she was staying in a women’s refuge with the child. Among other things, an apprehended violence order was taken out. Nevertheless, and in breach of the rules of the refuge, your wife continued to have contact with you and you met from time to time.  
     
      
    10 At the core of the reasons that you propose for this second marriage failure is an assertion that Nevine entered it for the purpose of facilitating the migration of her family to Australia, particularly a younger brother to whom she was close. 
     
      
    11 In evidence in the sentencing proceedings, your sister Mrs Sivapragasam asserted that Nevine had admitted to her that she, Nevine, had told your parents that this was the case. I do not accept this evidence or the assertion that your wife entered the marriage as some sort of sham.  
     
      
    12 Far from her family seeking you out as a husband for her in order to enable them to come to this country, on both the versions that you had given to Ms Bond and Mr Benad, it was your family, whether through your father or mother, who sought her out as a wife for you.  
     
      
    13 I would accept that Nevine may have expressed the desire for the company of her family in this land to which she was a stranger, but I am convinced that your assertions on this subject are gross exaggerations. I do not accept your sister as a reliable witness. It is an example of her tendency to unacceptable overstatement that she said you have “always been a wonderful family man and an amazing father” who “absolutely loves, adores and cherishes all three of his children as they do him”. At the time of this assertion by your sister, in a document dated 13 April 2006, it was the fact as I have mentioned that you had not seen the children of your first marriage since some time in 2001.  
     
      
    14 Contrary to your proposition, to the extent that there was any desire to have the marriage succeed, I am satisfied that it emanated from your wife. On the fatal night when you had arranged to spend it together at the hotel in Rosehill, Ms Zrno testified and I accept that she had observed that your wife was “excited and couldn’t wait” and was “getting dressed up” for the anticipated dinner and reunion. 
     
      
    15 Some evidence was given concerning what was described as Nevine flirting towards you even in the unlikely circumstances of court proceedings. That would seem to me to be more consistent with her trying to attract you than to repel or otherwise mistreat you.  
     
      
    16 Nevine had come to reside in the refuge after an extraordinary event which occurred along the Putty Road near Windsor. Apparently, the purpose of the excursion was to visit the Coptic Monastery in the area but you did not arrive there and, whatever provoked it, you abandoned her and left her on foot in bushland and along a relatively remote rural roadway.  
     
      
    17 Fortunately Detective Inspector Shoebridge, an off duty officer returning from a private camping trip, found her on the roadway. He observed her shaking and crying and in a high level of distress. By getting her to speak to a female officer at Windsor Police Station and confirm his identity, he was able to persuade her to accompany him to the police station where she met Acting Inspector Wendy Izzard who, amongst other things, contacted you by telephone. 
     
      
    18 I regard the content of this telephone call as more revealing of your general attitude to your wife than the protestations of affection and the like which you have made, and your claims that it was you who was making an effort for the marriage to succeed. 
     
      
    19 Inspector Izzard said to you “This is Inspector Izzard from Windsor Police. Is that Mr Mencarious?” You replied “Yes”. She said “I have your wife at the police station very upset. She’s complained that you kicked her out of the car in the Kurrajong area and left her there”. Your response was “She needs to understand her place here and respect me. I am on my way home and I don’t want her to come back”. Inspector Izzard then said “Wait just a minute, it’s not your place to say whether or not your wife returns home. If she makes a complaint to the police about your treatment of her you may find you will be looking for somewhere else to live”. You then rejoined “We live with my parents and we don’t want her here”. Inspector Izzard then said “Well, it would be in your best interest if you attend the Windsor Police Station and give your version of events”. You then said “I can’t get there, I have a baby”. I am satisfied that you did not regard your marriage as a partnership and you considered Nevine a subordinate who was subject to your dictate. 
     
      
    20 Of course, at this time the baby John was only a few months of age.  
     
      
    21 As I have said, irrespective of what later happened, what you said to Inspector Izzard was convincingly demonstrative of the attitude that you exhibited towards your wife. 
     
      
    22 I move now to the night of Nevine’s death. At the hotel, you engaged in sexual intimacy with each other. As I have said, I have only your version of what occurred after that. I am sceptical of your testimony generally and I note that, both during your evidence at trial and after conviction in the sentencing hearing, you frequently paused, and apparently deliberated for lengthy periods, before answering and the impression which was conveyed to me was that you were contriving your answers rather than responding candidly. 
     
      
    23 Your version is that Nevine again raised the question of her family’s migration to Australia and that you then realized that she was not seeking genuine reconciliation. I do not find this credible, and even assuming it to be so, your subsequent behaviour cannot possibly be justified. I observe that there is evidence of your purchase of liquor in that afternoon, other than the bottle of bourbon which you later wielded as a weapon, and that the post mortem sample later analysed detected no alcohol in Nevine’s blood. The probability was that you were disinhibited to an extent by your consumption of liquor but, whatever triggered your attack, you struck your wife severe blows to the head with the bottle. Your explanation is that you did this to force her to release a bite hold on your finger. No doubt at some stage of a struggle, Nevine did bite your finger but the seriousness of this can be gauged by the extent of treatment which consisted of application of antiseptic and a bandaid. 
     
      
    24 Of more critical significance to my mind is the fact that Nevine did not die as a result of the savage beating which you inflicted upon her with the bottle. She died of asphyxiation. To the extent that it was suggested, albeit somewhat faintly, that this may have occurred when you had your hand over her mouth and nose because your finger was in her mouth, I reject the suggestion. 
     
      
    25 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, after the attack with the bottle you applied something to Nevine’s mouth and nose and thereby killed her by asphyxiation. I am conscious of the absence of precise evidence demonstrating what the implement was and that the evidence does not establish that it was the pillow which was found in the room, but that absence of precise identification of what you used does not create any doubt in my mind about it being your act which caused the death by asphyxiation. I am further satisfied in all the circumstances that at the time you caused the death, it was your intention to kill your wife. 
     
      
    26 I am fortified in reaching the latter conclusion somewhat by your subsequent conduct. You were familiar with the hotel, having stayed there some nine or ten previous occasions, although this was the first occasion that Nevine had been there. You left the hotel after killing her, avoiding those areas where you might have been filmed by security cameras which were installed. You did not seek to contact reception in order to summon an ambulance nor did you do anything yourself about summoning assistance although in addition to a hotel phone you had a mobile phone with you.  
     
      
    27 In fact you used it and telephoned a taxi. After some delay however, you got your own car and drove yourself to a police station. You may also have spoken to your father before you entered the police station where you said, somewhat disingenuously, to the constable on duty that you thought you had done something horrible to your wife. It is a trivial matter but offers an indication of a self-centred importance that you insisted upon speaking to an inspector. 
     
      
    28 This was arranged and you spoke to Inspector Krawczyck and gave him the same sort of information that you had given to the constable except that you added that you thought you had killed your wife because you hit her a few times over the head with a bottle of bourbon.  
     
      
    29 By the time you told Inspector Krawczyck these things, I conclude that you had considered your situation and realized that it was inevitable that you would be affixed with responsibility for hitting her with the bottle, which could easily be demonstrated, and that you were deliberately concealing the subsequent activity by which you had ensured her death by suffocation. 
     
      
    30 Parliament has decreed that an offence of murder which is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for such offence should have imposed a standard non parole period of imprisonment for twenty years. It is therefore a matter to which I must turn to determine whether your offence is in the middle of that range. 
     
      
    31 It can be contemplated that a range of seriousness for murder might locate a killing done in the heat of a moment’s passion towards a lower end whilst something such as cold blooded killing for material gain might be located at an upper end. 
     
      
    32 I do not assess your offence at the lower end of the notion of range. Whilst I would accept that your multiple strikings of your wife with the bottle occurred during an explosion of passion, whether provoked by the comparatively minor bite on your finger or her raising the subject of her family or anything else, your subsequent act of killing her by asphyxiation falls well outside the category of lower objective seriousness.  
     
      
    33 Your act was deliberate and separate from the attack with the bottle and, as I have found, it was intentionally fatal. 
     
      
    34 I would assess your offence to lie at least within the middle of the range of objective seriousness for an offence of murder. 
     
      
    35 It is not inevitable that upon such a finding the standard non parole period must be applied if there are reasons to depart from it, and I turn to consider subjective matters raised on your behalf. In an appropriate case, such matters may operate to result in departure in favour of an offender from imposition of the standard non parole period. 
     
      
    36 You have no prior convictions. I have examined the testimonial letters which have been tendered on your behalf. I have no reason to think that the various authors are other than well meaning but the utility of their expressions is somewhat diminished by the absence of any acknowledgement of the detail of your crime which not only involved a savage attack, but a subsequent and intentional killing. One author referred to a “sad accident” and others, in differing ways, expressed levels of disbelief. Of course it can be said to be out of character for you to commit the crime, as I accept that your life to date has been free of conviction for any offence whatever, but I would be inclined to give greater weight to the proposition that your crime was out of character if I were persuaded that you were remorseful for what you had done. 
     
      
    37 I am not so persuaded. At the sentencing hearing you expressed sorrow and regret but were extremely reluctant to specify just what it was that your sorrow and regret was for. I consider that you are a self centred person and have sought to manipulate the facts and circumstances as far as you were able in order to disguise the extent of your culpability. You are not to be additionally punished by reason of that conclusion but it is a circumstance to be weighed when I consider whether this is an appropriate case in which to ameliorate the imposition of the standard non parole period.  
     
      
    38 In the course of submissions on your behalf, counsel referred to the specification of possible aggravating and mitigating factors which are tabulated in the sentencing statute. The use of the table as a sort of check list is unnecessary and indeed has been disapproved but in this case, in any event, the Crown Prosecutor did not submit that any aggravating factor as therein specified needed to be taken into account in addition to the criminality manifest in the facts, circumstances and elements of the crime of murder which you committed. 
     
      
    39 It is submitted on your behalf that you were provoked by the revelation (on your version) that your wife’s real aim was to arrange her family’s migration and by her biting your finger. Neither of these matters assume significance sufficient in my view in the context of your deliberate killing to mitigate a sentence otherwise assessed. 
     
      
    40 It was also argued that biting your finger gave rise to a mitigatory element of duress. This is a somewhat unconventional appeal to duress as a factor, however for the reasons just given concerning provocation, I would not ameliorate sentence on this account. This is not a case of relevant duress. 
     
      
    41 I have already noted my finding of the absence of genuine remorse and that absence renders it difficult to prophesy rehabilitation. Your conduct in gaol has been satisfactory but your capacity for sudden violence, which followed closely upon an intimacy which I infer was not so violent, and your unwillingness to reveal what you did to cause asphyxiation after the attack with the bottle, leaves me unable to make a positive finding of likely rehabilitation. 
     
      
    42 Next it was submitted that you should have consideration for your assistance to law enforcement authorities. The assistance is said to be your surrender to the police which, on any view, was delayed for some time after the fatal events in the hotel room. As I have already discussed, your assistance did not extend to a complete revelation of facts which must be within your knowledge and in particular revelation of exactly how asphyxiation was achieved.  
     
      
    43 You have, as a result of application, been confined in protective custody. This can be terminated as a result of your own application. Whilst it is notorious that prisoners convicted of certain offences, especially those involving child victims, are in great danger in the general prison population, the killing of a spouse is not in any category bearing such notoriety. I do not regard your current circumstance of being in protective custody as a matter of any great weight. 
     
      
    44 Mr Benad reported that you have suffered depression since your wife’s death. I note that he did not say that you suffered because of your wife’s death. He opined that depression was associated with incarceration and he suspected that this would worsen with a lengthy period of imprisonment. I do not regard these opinions as matters which should result in a reduction of a sentence otherwise assessed. 
     
      
    45 I have concluded that this is not an appropriate case in which to depart from the standard non parole period.  
     
      
    46 I have also given consideration to assessment of a total term of imprisonment. My conclusion is that such a term as reflects the statutory non parole period and a balance term calculated in accordance with the statutory formula is appropriate to all the circumstances of your crime and your commission of it. 
     
      
    47 Pursuant to the statute I am first to set the non parole period and then a balance term which is not to exceed one third of the non parole period unless there are special circumstances. It was acknowledged by the Crown Prosecutor that there were matters capable to amounting to such special circumstances but it was submitted that departure from the statutory proportion was not, in this case, justified. My conclusion coincides with that of the Crown submission on this aspect. 
     
      
    48 I should, for completeness, record that I have given attention to matters which were also explored at the trial and sentencing hearings, including assertions that Nevine threatened to harm the unborn child, and that after his birth you would be deprived of his company, that there had been reportings to police including that one made by you concerning Nevine’s alleged threats and behaviour, contretemps at the times of access visitation and your explanation for withdrawing your wife’s visa sponsorship and your contention that she took out the AVO so as to inhibit deportation. 
     
      
    49 These and some of the events to which I have earlier referred disclose unsavoury aspects of marital squabbles but they should not divert attention from the fundamental issue of your culpability for effectively rendering your wife defenceless by attacking her with the bottle and then deliberately killing her. 
     
      
    50 On 5 May last a victim impact statement on behalf of Nevine’s family made by her brother and read to the court in English translation was read by Mr Guirgis. The content is a graphic description of the effects of your crime on that family. As required by statute I record an acknowledgement of receipt of that statement. 
     
      
    51 Ashraf Mencarious, for the murder of Nevine Youssef you are sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of twenty years commencing on 15 December 2004 and expiring on 14 December 2024 with a balance term of six years and eight months commencing on 15 December 2024. 
     
      
    52 The earliest date of eligibility for parole is specified as 14 December 2024.

   JUDGMENTHIS HONOUR:1 Andrew Schofield was working at Gosford Railway Station in the early hours of the morning of 12 March 2004 as a senior transit officer. Sometime after 3.30am two brothers, Sebastian and Christian Whitbread arrived at the station intending to travel by train to Wyong. Both had consumed copious quantities of alcohol. As each arrived at the station he was still husbanding a last bottle of Bacardi mix. 2 As events turned out their consumption of alcohol, coupled with their drunken behaviour would have consequences impacting on their lives and the lives of others for several years following. 3 Their time at this station ended shortly after 4pm when Andrew Schofield and other Transit officers manhandled each, removing each brother from the station in circumstances I shall come to. Each complained to the police who took them into their custody at the behest of the Transit officers believing each had been arrested by the Transit officers. 4 The police charged Andrew Schofield and five other Transit officers with assault of each youth. The hearing of these matters before His Honour Magistrate Miszalski appears to have been a cause celebre in the Gosford Local Court, taking eleven days to finalise.5 His Honour dismissed the charges of assault against the other co-accused. His Honour convicted Andrew Schofield of both counts of common assault. For reasons not made clear to me the appeal has been moved out of the Gosford district. It comes before me sitting at the Downing Centre District Court. This Court in determining this appeal has before it the relevant depositions and exhibits that were before his Honour. 6 The Court’s task is to review the evidence before the Local Court hearing the matter de nova that means, I am required to make my own findings of fact upon the evidence before the Local Court. I am required to form my own view as to whether the Crown has proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt in respect of each count.What the Crown Must Prove: 7 The Crown will do this if it is satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt of the essential elements of the charge, or put in layman’s terms the fundamental propositions contained in the charge sheets. It does not have to prove every adverse fact beyond reasonable doubt, what it must prove beyond reasonable doubt are a limited number of propositions: the date 12 March 2004; the alleged perpetrator Andrew Schofield, the appellant; the criminal act, the assault; and the victim in respect of count one Sebastian Whitbread, and in respect of count two Christian Whitbread.  
    8 An assault occurs when the perpetrator intentionally or recklessly commits an act, which causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful violence. In this case, the prosecution says the act was a physical aggressive battery committed upon each without the consent of the either. In the case of each of the Whitbread youths there is undisputed evidence that the appellant intentionally committed an act, to use neutral term, aggressively manhandling of each, which caused each to apprehend immediate violence.The Defence Thesis: 9 The defence has sought to argue, however, that the violence was not unlawful. The defence case is that the acts were either lawful for one of two reasons of believed necessity by the appellant. The acts were believed necessary by the appellant for self defence, a proposition which the Crown must negative, or alternatively, or as well, the acts constituted a lawful removal of each from railway property in accordance with the provisions of regulation 58of the Railway Safety (General) Regulation 2003. The final possibility was that the acts constituted a lawful citizen’s arrest pursuant to s352(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. The burden of proving each of these lawful justifications rests with the defence on the balance of probabilities. The Legal Issues Defined: 10 Section 418 of the Crimes Act 1900 provides that a person is not criminally responsible for an offence, if the person carries out the conduct constituting the offence in self defence. A person carries out conduct in self defence if and only if the person believes the conduct is necessary to defend himself, or to prevent criminal trespass to any land, or to remove a person from committing any such criminal trespass; and the conduct is a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceives them. Was there a lawful arrest?11 An arrest is the lawful seizing or apprehension of a subject, placing restraint upon his liberty for a purpose related to the administration of criminal justice. Such purpose may include presenting the subject before a lawful authority so that the person may be charged with an offence it is said he has committed. The parties agree the only power of arrest the appellant was able to exercise is the power provided at the relevant time by s352(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. 12 The parties agree Transit Officers are not constables or special constables. However, s352(1)(a) provided that a person may without warrant apprehend any person in the act of committing, or immediately after having committed an offence punishable on summary conviction under any Act. The Act required the person who carried out the arrest to take the person arrested and property found on him before an authorised justice to be dealt with according to law. An authorised justice is a Magistrate or justice employed in the Department of Courts Administration. 13 It is clear from the Interpretation Act 1987 that the term “Act” does not embrace “statutory instruments” see s20, s65 and s67 of also s100 Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002. I note s352 was repealed on 1 December 2005. 14 I have not been referred to any other power of arrest available to Transit Officers prior to 1 December 2005. As presently advised it does not appear to me the appellant had any power to arrest a person committing or immediately after having committed an offence on summary conviction under any other statutory instrument and in particular the Rail Safety (General) Regulation 2003. 15 Counsel for the appellant in written submissions argued that s95 of the Rail Safety Act 2002 allows for the making of regulations to create offences, that the offences so created provided they fall into subject constraints revealed by s 95(a) to s95(o) are offences created under the Rail Safety Act and therefore captured as relevant offences under s352(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. The argument goes that being so captured the powers of arrest created by s352(1)(a) apply. 16 However, the crucial issue is the mechanism by which the manner of punishment is determined that is, whether the offence is to be punishable on indictment or summarily. In this case, the mechanism by which that punishment is determined is by the penalty imposed see; s6(c) of the Criminal Procedure Act. By virtue of the maximum penalty being five penalty units, an offender would fall within the definition of a summary offender. 17 The Common Law powers of arrest on the other hand appear to be limited to cases where treason or felony have actually been committed or attempted, or there is a danger of such offences being committed, or a breach of peace had actually been committed, or is reasonably apprehended. A breach of the peace is sufficient to justify arrest when there is an actual assault, public alarm and incitement are created by the offender’s wrongful act, or when a person obstructs a public officer in the execution of his duty. Mere annoyance, disturbance, insult or abuse of language, even of great heat and fury, without personal violence are not sufficient generally to establish breach of the peace. Nobody has sought to argue that the Transit Officers are relevantly a public officer. 18 While it is true a servant may have authority to arrest on behalf of his master it is generally limited to cases where the arrest is reasonably necessary for the protection of the master’s property. Neither of the parties has been relying on the Common Law power of arrest. 19 The Rail Safety (General) Regulations 2003 created offences appear to be from regulation 13 through to 38 and include in regulation 13, for instance, conduct generally; regulation 15 smoking; regulation 17 drinking and alcohol generally prohibited; regulation 18 passengers who are intoxicated. 20 Regulation 39 gives to an authorised officer a power to direct a person to leave a train, railway land or part of monorail works in the event that the authorised officer comes to a view someone is committing an offence under this Part, meaning between regulation 13 and regulation 21. Regulation 58 gives to an authorised officer a power to remove from a train or land a person who refuses or fails to comply with a direction given under the Rail Safety (General) Regulation. Part 3 of the regulation relates to conduct on trains and railways. 21 Each of the clauses 13 to 38 creates at least one offence, some clauses create two offences. Offences range from drinking alcohol, use of offensive language, smoking, intoxication, hindering another’s use of a facility and so on. That is to say there is a limited range of circumstances in which an authorised person or authority can direct a person to leave railway property. 22 Clauses 18 and clause 39 empower authorised officers to direct persons to leave railway property. If circumstances permit the authorised personnel should indicate the offence or offences, which in his or her opinion a person is committing, whereby the authorised person is authorised to direct the offender to leave. 23 Where such circumstances do exist it seems to me a direction formulated simply as, “You are not allowed to be here”, (the witness, Singh, 22 August 2005 p46, line 55), or “I’m giving you a direct order to leave the station,” (the appellant Schofield, 19 July 2005, p13, line 39) is inadequate. The Evidence: 24 The evidence establishes that Christian and Sebastian Whitbread arrived at Gosford Railway Station together. They had been drinking since at least 8pm perhaps earlier. They were still drinking their last drink at 3.30am the following morning. They were asked to and did, in fact, leave the station to finish this drink. At some point shortly thereafter they returned. They were asked by a Transit Officer for a ticket. When it was discovered neither had a ticket they were told to purchase one from a nearby ticket vending machine. 25 At least one of the youths protested loudly and in language that was unseemly and on occasions offensive. This conversation was not on the station platform proper but rather on a concrete ramp leading from the station platform to Showground Road. 26 There is no doubt the youths were on railway property and quite possibly that property is adequately described as “the station”. 27 At the outset of the incident the Court is concerned with the group comprised Christian and Sebastian Whitbread and six Transit officers. At this point in time Transit Officer Sanderson was directing the two youths to leave the station. Whether the direction was given pursuant to clause 18 or clause 39 or both is unclear, because I am satisfied Sanderson did not give a reason. I am satisfied Sebastian Whitbread was using offensive language, behaving offensively and under the influence of intoxicating liquor. I am also satisfied Christian Whitbread was under the influence of intoxicating liquor and generally supportive of his brother. But at this point in time I am not satisfied he was using offensive language or behaving offensively. 28 The appellant, who had dealt with the two brothers some minutes earlier, returned after having a cigarette. The evidence is that he heard Sebastian Whitbread refusing a direct order to leave the station. The appellant’s evidence is that Sebastian Whitbread said, “I’m not fucking leaving; you’ll have to make me leave; I'm catching the Wyong train.” The appellant’s evidence is Sebastian said, “I’ve just been released from Lithgow Prison and I know my rights.” 29 The evidence establishes Sebastian had been to prison, but never to Lithgow, and he had not been “Just released,” but had been out for some months. Further, an analysis of the sentence demonstrates it to be a non sequitur. I have serious reservations about whether Sebastian Whitbread ever owned up to being at Lithgow Prison. I accept he may well have said, “I know my rights.” 30 When the appellant joined this group, on his evidence he said, “I thought you blokes had given me assurances that you would behave yourselves. I am giving you a direct order to leave the station.” That order was apparently on the basis that Sebastian Whitbread was continuing to abuse Sanderson, that is, behaving in an offensive manner. 31 The appellant’s evidence is Sebastian Whitbread said, “I will kill you cunts if you try.” The appellant’s evidence is, it is the uttering of these words that caused him to approach Sebastian Whitbread and take hold of him. The appellant says Sebastian resisted, his shirt gave way and ripped, and he wrestled him to the ground. It was during this struggle that Christian Whitbread ran towards him in a threatening manner. The appellant says, he took hold of him and got him to the ground. During that struggle Christian Whitbread abused him, spat in his direction at his face and dug his fingernails into the appellant’s right calf muscle so that the appellant felt pain.32 Elsewhere in his evidence the appellant says Sebastian Whitbread was extremely abusive, threatening, intoxicated and he did not know whether Sebastian was carrying weapons or on drugs. Elsewhere the appellant says:“I wanted to restrain his [Sebastian’s] movement. I came in with a right hand grabbed his collar area and intended to come around with my left hand behind his back to completely restrain his movements; therefore he could not use his knees or anything else...he resisted immediately and that’s how his, I mean, if I had got an open hand, how did I rip his shirt. I mean, his shirt has been ripped from the collar.” 33 It is noteworthy the appellant said in respect of Sebastian:“I was trying to bring my right hand onto his collar and the bottom part of my right hand was on his collar bone, I had hold of him there, I was bringing his left arm in. This was just a removal. There was no intention to go any further. However, by coming in close and tight like this I was prepared for this bloke to react violently, because he was ready to go and from what he’d said there was the grey area.” 34. As to Christian, the appellant said:“I would not take any risk with that fellow, because he was in total support of his brother. He would have run through a brick wall for him...They were both fairly juiced up. I can’t recall what was being said, but I found them to be intimidating, aggressive and there was a possibility of being assaulted.”35 At this point it is worth pausing to note all of the actions of the parties have been recorded on CCTV. While it is possible to observe that conversation is taking place there is no audio sound. 36 So there is the oral evidence of the conversation and the body language of the participants that give some insight into the conversation. The CCTV, of course, clearly exposes the actions of all of the parties involved. 37 The CCTV and the oral evidence appear to establish that in the moments leading up to the manhandling incident, Christian Whitbread was passive, taking little or no part in the conversation, but standing with his brother as Sebastian did most of the talking. I am of the view the reason for requiring Christian to leave the station has to be a different reason to the reason requiring Sebastian to leave. Yet that difference does not appear to have articulated by anyone when they were required to leave.38 Secondly, the body language of Sebastian in the moments prior to him being manhandled does not appear to be consistent with the threatening conversation alleged against him. Nor does the body language of those surrounding Sebastian appear to be consistent with a threat being uttered in the moments prior to the appellant handling him. It is clear from the appellant’s body language that he is gesticulating in a direction behind Christopher towards the CCTV camera 32. Yet when in the process of removing the men, the removal heads in a direction away from the camera. 39 I have now looked at that portion of the video a second time, and in fairness, there is seconds before the gesture in the direction of the camera, a gesture with the left hand in a direction opposite to the camera. 40 When Sebastian responds, he also gestures towards the camera. Then he drops both his hands down in a relaxed motion as though his hands were at rest one each side of his body. At this point there appears to be no conversation. The appellant’s hands are also hanging by his side. That in a sense was unusual, because for most of the time he was visible on the CCTV the appellant’s arms had been folded. Sebastian takes a half step backwards away from the appellant towards Transit Officer John Borcher who is standing with both arms folded across his chest behind Sebastian. Melchor Jaminez is resting his back against the glass wall. Christopher Sanderson stands about one and a half metres in front of Sebastian. He too has his arms folded across his chest resting on his stomach. Geoffrey Blight stands to the left of John Borcher, his hands appear to be hanging loosely by his sides. Reilly, the security guard, and Transit Officer Sinha are a metre and a half or so away from Christian Whitbread, they appear to be relaxed. 41 There are two Transit officers off camera behind Christian Whitbread who from time to time appear to be chatting to each other when they are captured by the camera. Christian Whitbread has his left arm hanging loosely and his right arm bent at right angles, but his elbow in against his side. 42 In the instant before the appellant lunges, the only person captured in the CCTV number 32 frame at seven minutes fifty five seconds, who appears to be stressed, is the appellant. In my view, such a scenario is entirely inconsistent with the sense of confrontation painted by the appellant on his evidence. 43 When Sebastian Whitbread moved the half step back the appellant almost immediately moved suddenly towards him, raising both arms towards Sebastian’s shoulders, one each side of the neck. In the CCTV footage from camera 32 it’s impossible to observe the appellant’s left hand. I should indicate that I have relied on camera 29 to come to a view that both hands were raised by the appellant when he approached Sebastian. The appellant’s right hand travels along the top of Sebastian’s left shoulder towards his left ear. Whether it grabs the left ear lobe, or applies pressure to a pressure point in the neck region immediately below the earlobe, is impossible to tell from the picture frames. 44 Sebastian is turned to his left through 30 to 40 degrees. The appellant moves in so that his chest is abutting Sebastian’s right shoulder. Sebastian’s head is now tilted backwards from the perpendicular some 15 or 20 degrees by the force of the appellant’s hand against Sebastian’s jaw line or pressure point. Sebastian’s left arm is grabbing the appellant’s right wrist area as though trying to release such grip or pressure as the appellant has on him. 45 I am satisfied the appellant’s right arm is making contact with Sebastian somewhere around the earlobe, upper neck region, although the nature of that contact I cannot determine specifically. Jaminez, Sanderson, Reilly, Christian and Blight have not reacted. Borcher is moving towards Sebastian. As best I can tell the appellant thrusts or pushes Sebastian with both hands downwards and against the glass wall. By this time the left side of Sebastian’s shirt is torn, revealing part of his left torso. My view is that any tearing occurred as a consequence of whatever the Appellant's left hand was doing. Borcher and another person, probably Jaminez, scoop up or try to scoop up Sebastian. The appellant is now a metre and a half from Sebastian. The appellant is on his feet standing erect. Sebastian is doubled over and is in or almost in the custody of the two other Transit Officers. 46 I am satisfied the pushing of Sebastian away has significance. If the appellant was truly fearful of Sebastian’s threat to kill or his possible possession of weapons, it is unlikely he would have pushed Sebastian free, even if only for a second, but crowded him as he earlier had, giving Sebastian no chance to reach for the weapon or otherwise advance his threat to kill. Nor is anything said to any of the other Transit Officers so far as I can tell about the threat to kill or the possible presence of a weapon. Whatever the appellant was doing, it was not about smothering a threat to kill or being alarmed about the potential for the presentation of a weapon. 47 Regulation 58 of the Rail Safety (General) Regulation 2003 permits an authorised officer to remove any person who refuses or fails to comply with a direction given under the regulation. I am prepared to accept that the appellant genuinely believed he had given an authorised direction. However, only reasonable force can be used for such a purpose. Further, the use of force would need to be a reasonable option in all of the circumstances. The circumstances that were occurring at about 4am were these: 
     
      
     Minimal public traffic in the region; 
      
     This is not a case where any member of the public was endangered by the behaviour of Sebastian or his brother; 
      
     So far as I can tell the only people to interact with the brothers were the Transit Officers who at all times outnumbered the brothers; 
      
     Neither brother was presenting any danger by the way in which he was behaving; 
      
     Sebastian certainly was rowdy and offensive at least towards the Transit Officers; 
      
     The police had not been called; 
      
     Nor was any threat made by the Transit officers to call police if the men failed to comply with the directions; 
      
     No infringement notice had been issued; and 
      
     No attempt to escort either brother from the station had been made. 
    48 I am satisfied the use of force at the time the appellant grabbed Sebastian was not a reasonable option in all the circumstances. It is to be remembered the onus is on the defence to prove it was a reasonable option. Even if I be wrong in that assessment I am satisfied the use of force was far in excess of the force required to effect a removal. Again, the onus is on the defence to prove that the force was reasonable in all the circumstances. Further, I am satisfied there was no warrant for the appellant to approach Sebastian by way of self defence. At that stage Sebastian was outnumbered by eight or nine to two - assuming his brother was willing to assist him. It should be clear I do not regard the appellant as seeking to effect an arrest. Nor in my view was there any power to arrest him in the circumstances. 49 It follows that the appellant intentionally committed an act, which caused Sebastian Whitbread to apprehend immediate and unlawful violence. I find the prosecution has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant assaulted Sebastian Whitbread. 50 The position in respect of Christian Whitbread is different. At the point where the appellant had pushed Sebastian towards the glass wall he stepped back. His assault upon Sebastian was at this point over. Sebastian was then in, or almost in the custody of two other officers who were in the process of securing him with a view to removing him from the railway station. For a brief moment Sebastian did break free and sought to approach the appellant in an aggressive way. But that situation plays little part in Christian Whitbread’s conduct. 51 To the point where his brother was assaulted by the appellant Christian Whitbread had been relatively passive. However, once the appellant disengaged from his actions with Sebastian, Christian Whitbread approached him. I have no doubt he was complaining about the way in which his elder brother had been treated by the appellant. 52 While he did not run but rather stepped forward one, or perhaps two steps, he was gesticulating with his right arm at about shoulder height. True, his hand was not in a fist, but that would not have taken long to accomplish. All this was being done while he was in what the appellant described as his “personal space.” 53 The appellant, no doubt, well knew that Christian Whitbread was upset by what had happened, and was happening to his brother and blamed the appellant for it. The appellant had every reason to fear an assault upon him by Christian Whitbread. The appellant responded by placing each of his hands on Christian’s arms gripping the left arm at Christian’s elbow and moving towards the right elbow. The appellant swung Christian around and slid his hand under Christian’s left armpit and would, it seems to me, have escorted him from the railway station had not other matters intervened. In my view, there was nothing untoward or inappropriate about the appellant’s response at that point in time. 54 Sanderson began to move towards Christian. The other officers were crowding in seeking to secure Christian. At this point Sebastian’s left hand is reaching towards the appellant. The Transit Officers thereafter removed both men from the railway station. 55 It is to be remembered the appellant cannot be expected to weigh with jeweller’s scales all the issues one might think of with hindsight. The force he first tried to use was appropriate. The escalation occurred because of the acts of Christian Whitbread. I regard the acts of the appellant, in respect of Christian Whitbread’s acts and movements, done in self defence. 56 Thereafter the acts of the other Transit officers were done pursuant to a removal presumably in accordance with cl58. I am not concerned with whether the force used in that removal was excessive. The parties agree that the incident I am focusing on is the incident occurring on the ramp way to the Showground Road captured by camera 32. 57 My formal findings are these: 
     
     I find the appellant guilty of common assault of Sebastian Whitbread.  
      
     I find the prosecution has failed to prove the appellant was guilty of assaulting Christian Whitbread. What do you seek to do now, Mr Doyle? 
    Submissions made:58 HIS HONOUR: My own view of it, is that the appellant is entitled to the benefit of a s10 discharge. The finding of guilt will have significant consequences upon him. He has for thirty years been associated with those in society, primarily here, but also for a while in New Zealand, who are least likely to comply with the requirements of observing peace and behaving lawfully. It would seem that he has done his job well. 59 At four in the morning on 12 March 2004 for whatever reason, he appears to have had a brain explosion. It appears to me entirely out of character. It will have significant consequences for him. He has fought tooth and nail to establish that he behaved lawfully. He has been unsuccessful at least in respect of one charge although he has succeeded in respect of the other. 60 It may well have been a different situation had the Magistrate convicted him only of the one, rather than the two offences. My own view is that the Magistrate would not have been out of order to fine him, but the justice that I would seek to administer would also seek to pay some regard to the tremendous contribution that he has made to the society by taking on work that is difficult, stressful and sometimes dangerous. 61 I am satisfied he made a very bad error of judgment on this night but I intend to discharge him without conviction. 62 The formal orders I make are these: 
     
     The conviction recorded by the learned Magistrate in respect of Christian Whitbread is quashed. The  
      
     Finding of guilt recorded by the learned Magistrate in the matter of Sebastian Whitbread is confirmed, however, the conviction is quashed.  
      
     Pursuant to s10 of the  
     Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      I discharge the appellant from conviction.

    1 HANDLEY JA: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    2 HULME J: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    3 KIRBY J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence. Timothy Michael Donnelly (the applicant) returned to Australia from overseas at 7.30 am on 11 November 2004. He was a passenger on a British Airways flight from London via Singapore. Having cleared Customs, he went to a flat in Neutral Bay. 
     
      
    4 At approximately 2.50 pm on 13 November 2004, Mr Donnelly presented at the Emergency Department of the Royal North Shore Hospital. He complained of severe abdominal pain. He disclosed to medical staff that, before leaving London, he had swallowed a number of pellets made from plastic and ducting tape containing the drug ecstasy. He had already regurgitated a small number of the pellets. 
     
      
    5 An x-ray was undertaken and revealed a large number of foreign objects in the stomach and intestines. He was suffering from severe abdominal obstruction and required immediate surgery. 
     
      
    6 The police were notified. At 4.45 pm Mr Donnelly underwent a laparotomy. Sixty-five pellets were removed. The operation was witnessed by the police who took possession of the pellets. 
     
      
    7 Later the same evening, the police searched Mr Donnelly's flat at Neutral Bay. The person with whom Mr Donnelly shared the flat handed the police a further 12 pellets, being the pellets he had regurgitated the previous day. 
     
      
    8 Each pellet was later examined. There were 77 pellets in all, each weighing about 5 mgs. One pellet contained 4.7 grams of cocaine. The remaining 76 contained the drug methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) in powder form. 
     
      
    9 On Sunday 14 November 2004, the police spoke to Mr Donnelly at the hospital. He was informed that he was under arrest for the possession of prohibited imports. He was also formally cautioned. 
     
      
    10 On 17 November 2004, a bedside court was conducted. Once discharged from hospital, Mr Donnelly remained in custody. Pleas of guilty were entered in the Local Court on 2 February 2005. When the matter came before Nield DCJ on 22 April 2005, the charges were reformulated and can be summarised as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 
        : That on 11 November 2004, he was in possession of a prohibited import, contrary to s233B(1)(a)(vi) of the Customs Act 1901, namely ecstasy, in an amount not less than the trafficable quantity of that drug. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2 
        : Further, that on the same day and contrary to the same section, he was in possession of the prohibited import cocaine, in a quantity not less than the trafficable quantity. 
        
       
      
    11 The Commonwealth Act, unlike the State Act, is concerned with the quantity of pure drug imported. In each case the drugs had a high level of purity, namely: 
     
      
    · Ecstasy: 278.69 grams pure MDMA (representing over 77% of the 362.3 grams imported). 
     
      
    · Cocaine: 3.9 grams pure (representing 84.6% of the 4.7 grams imported). 
     
      
    12 A ""trafficable quantity"" of MDMA or ecstasy under the Customs Act is 0.5 grams and a ""commercial quantity"" is 500 grams. Accordingly, as noted by his Honour, the amount imported exceeded by many times the trafficable quantity and was over half of a commercial quantity. 
     
      
    13 In the case of cocaine, a ""trafficable quantity"" is 2 grams and a ""commercial quantity"" is 2 kilograms. The amount imported, therefore, was just over the trafficable quantity. 
     
      
       
      Issues before the Sentencing Judge. 
       
      
    14 As mentioned, Mr Donnelly came before Judge Nield in the District Court on 22 April 2005 for sentence. He was represented by Mr Sutherland SC. In an opening address, counsel identified the issue. The penalty section under the Customs Act, s235(2)(d)(i), at that time fixed a maximum penalty in respect of each charge of a fine not exceeding $550,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 25 years, or both. However, where the Court is satisfied (the onus being upon the offender) that the offence was not ""for a purpose related to the sale of, or other commercial dealing in, the drugs"", the maximum penalty for each offence was a fine not exceeding $2,200 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 2 years, or both (s235(3) and s235(2)(e)) (since repealed). It was Mr Donnelly's case that the drugs were imported for his personal use. They were not imported with a view to sale.  
     
      
    15 The sentencing proceedings, which I will shortly describe, continued over a number of days. His Honour reserved his judgment. On 12 August 2005 he passed sentence. I will examine his reasons shortly. He expressed his conclusion in these terms: (ROS paras 29/30) 
     
      
       
        
        ""29. I am not satisfied that the offender imported the MDMA into Australia for his own personal use. On the contrary, the quantity of MDMA that he imported into Australia and the value, both wholesale value and street value, of the tablets that could be produced from that quantity of MDMA powder suggest, quite obviously, that he imported it into Australia to deal with it commercially. 
        
       
       
        
        30. However, on the other hand, as the quantity is small and the potential street value is small, I am satisfied that the offender imported the cocaine for his own use, to use his words 'for a bit of fun'."" 
        
       
      
    16 His Honour therefore sentenced Mr Donnelly as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 
        : Imprisonment for 6 years 9 months commencing on 13 November 2004 expiring on 12 August 2011; with a non parole period of 4 years commencing on 13 November 2004 and expiring on 12 November 2008. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2 
        : A concurrent sentence of 11 months and 7 days. 
        
       
       
      The Notice of Appeal. 
       
      
    17 The Notice of Appeal identified four grounds as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) That the sentencing judge failed to give any or any sufficient reasons for finding that he was not satisfied that the offender imported the MDMA into Australia for his own personal use; and 
       
       
      (b) That the sentencing judge should have held that the maximum sentence applicable to each charge was a fine of $2,200 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years or both (Customs Act 1901 section 235). 
       
       
      (c) That the sentence imposed exceeded the available statutory maximum. 
       
       
      (d) In the alternative, that the sentence imposed was too severe. 
       
      
    18 Before dealing with the arguments, I should describe the evidence given during the sentencing proceedings. 
     
      
       
      The Sentencing Proceedings. 
       
      
    19 When the sentencing proceedings began on 22 April 2005, the Crown tendered a number of documents. There was no issue concerning the circumstances of importation. The agreed facts included the following material as to the value of the drugs imported. In respect of cocaine, the following was said: (AB p13) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Based on a figure of between $200 and $300 per gram for impure cocaine, the street value of the cocaine seized from the Defendant is about $2,228 and $2,340."" 
        
       
      
    20 As to the ecstasy, the agreed facts were in these terms: (AB p12/13) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Imported MDMA tablets normally have a purity of 30% to 50% and a weight of 0.2 to 0.3 of a gram. Using this range, an ecstasy tablet has from 0.06 to 0.15 of a gram of pure MDMA. The MDMA powder would produce between 3095 (0.3 gram) to 4643 (0.2 gram) tablets at 30% purity. The MDMA powder would produce between 1857 (03. gram) to 2786 (0.2 gram) tablets at 50% purity. 
        
       
       
        
        In November 2004, the street value of MDMA tablets in NSW ranged from $30 to $60 with $50 being the more typical price. Based on these figures, the street value of the MDMA is between $92,850 and $232,150. Based on a figure of $20 per tablet for MDMA as a bulk price, the wholesale value of the MDMA is between $37,140 and $92,860."" 
        
       
      
    21 The Crown also tendered a statement by Det Sgt Stipnieks, an officer in the Australian Federal Police experienced in drug matters. Sgt Stipnieks said that commercial importations of ecstasy in powder form were extremely rare (8.7.05: T2). Ecstasy was soluble. It could be ingested by snorting or in liquid form. When cross examined by counsel for Mr Donnelly, Sgt Stipnieks said this: (8.7.05: T3) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. There would need to be a refining and/or manufacturing process undertaken by somebody to turn it into the tablet form? 
         
        A. No, it would only require a pill press. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It would require firstly somebody to cut it with an appropriate substance -- 
         
        A. It could be cut down further from the imported seizure, yes. I agree with that."" 
        
       
      
    22 The Crown also tendered a report of the Probation and Parole Service dated 21 April 2005. The report included a history of Mr Donnelly's involvement with drugs. Mr Donnelly, in his evidence, enlarged upon that history. His Honour, in his remarks, accepted that Mr Donnelly had, in the years preceding 11 November 2004, a significant involvement with drugs. His Honour said this: (ROS 2) 
     
      
       
        
        ""5. Whilst at the senior school at Newington College, he commenced to smoke cannabis and to use other prohibited drugs. Whilst at school, he was able to keep his use of prohibited drugs hidden and under control."" 
        
       
      
    23 Having left school, the applicant worked for his father. His drug use increased. His Honour continued: (ROS 2/3) 
     
      
       
        
        ""7. Then, during 1996, he was driving a motor vehicle which was involved in a collision with a cliff face on the Sydney-Newcastle freeway, which collision resulted in the death of his girlfriend. A search of his car revealed that he was in possession of prohibited drugs and analysis of a sample of his blood revealed that he had been driving the car with MDMA, commonly called ecstasy, in his blood. He was charged with dangerous driving causing death and possession of prohibited drugs. He was dealt with for the offences of dangerous driving causing death and possession of prohibited drugs at the end of 1997. He was sentenced to imprisonment for one year six months, with a non-parole period of twelve months to be served by home detention, and a parole period of six months, for the offence of dangerous driving causing death and he was fined $1,000 for each of the two offences of possessing a prohibited drug."" 
        
       
      
    24 Having completed his sentence, Mr Donnelly resumed the use of prohibited drugs, principally ecstasy. He said he used them ""on a recreational basis"" (22.4.05: T14). In 2001 he moved to London. He gave the following history to the Probation Officer concerning his drug use once in London: (AB p19) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Donnelly reported that after moving to London in 2001 he began using ecstasy and cocaine heavily. After the death of his father, in mid 2003, his usage increased, particularly ecstasy usage. He claimed he was using round 1 gram of ecstasy daily."" 
        
       
      
    25 After his father's death, Mr Donnelly received an inheritance of $100,000 and an annuity of $30,000. He travelled extensively. He had a Brazilian girlfriend and spent some time in South America and Europe, where he continued his use of drugs. He squandered much of his inheritance. The Probation Officer concluded her report in these terms: (AB p19) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Donnelly has had a longstanding problem with abuse of illicit drugs; which appears to be a substantial factor in his motivation to commit the offences."" 
        
       
      
    26 As mentioned, his Honour accepted that Mr Donnelly was a regular and heavy user of ecstasy before the offence (ROS para 28). 
     
      
       
      The Applicant's Evidence. 
       
      
    27 The applicant's credibility was obviously fundamental if he hoped to persuade his Honour (on the balance of probabilities) that the drugs he imported were for his own use. Whilst he was a heavy drug user, the amount of ecstasy imported (362.3 grams) was very substantial. When first called to give evidence, the applicant sought to explain that amount by the following evidence: (22.4.05: T20) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. And did you continue your usage of ecstasy in London? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How much ecstasy would you take in a day? 
         
        A. In powder form anywhere up to a gram. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What about in tablet form? 
         
        A. I very rarely took tablets. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now there's not a lot of powder form ecstasy seen in this country, how do you use it in powder form? 
         
        A. You can snort it or eat it, mix it with drinks."" 
        
       
      
    28 His evidence continued: (22.4.05: T22) 
     
      
       
        
        ""SUTHERLAND: Q. And so far as the ecstasy was concerned the quantity that you purchased I think in bulk terms is about 360-odd grams -- 
         
        A. That's correct."" 
        
       
      
    29 Mr Donnelly then said this: (22.4.05: T22/23) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. ... Did you propose to sell any of that ecstasy? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you propose to do with it? 
         
        A. To use it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And how long did you think, without using a slide rule and a calculator, but how long did you think it would last? 
         
        A. I figured about a year."" 
        
       
      
    30 The evidence that he used a gram a day, in the context of an importation of 362.3 grams and 365 days in a year, was an important aspect of Mr Donnelly's testimony. His evidence continued as follows: (22.4.05: T23) 
     
      
       
        
        ""SUTHERLAND: Q. How regularly were you using a gram a day? 
         
        A. Almost every day of the week, it varied, on weekends I'd use more, some days I'd use less. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I appreciate this comes from your perception as opposed to an external perception but what effect on your day to day life did it have? 
         
        A. Well it seemed normal at the time. Looking back on it with a clear head it had a pretty detrimental effect. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But how did you perceive it at the time? 
         
        A. I felt pretty normal to be honest. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And for what period of time or what length in your life had you been using effectively a gram a day? 
         
        A. Two or three years, two years."" 
        
       
      
    31 During cross examination by the Crown, his Honour asked a number of questions, including the following: (22.4.05: T33) 
     
      
       
        
        ""HIS HONOUR: Q. Did you know the purity of the MDMA that you'd purchased? 
         
        A. I'd tested it but I didn't know what the purity is mathematically. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It exceeds seventy per cent, you know that now? 
         
        A. I do now yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that's greater than the street percentage isn't it? 
         
        A. I don't know what the street percentage is to be honest."" 
        
       
      
    32 His Honour also asked the following questions: (22.4.05: T34) 
     
      
       
        
        ""HIS HONOUR: Q. What the Crown Prosecutor is asking you is that you know that MDMA is usually sold in tablet form? 
         
        A. Yes sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you know that tablets are made from powder? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And the tablets that are made from powder have an admixture of MDMA and other things, you know that don't you? 
         
        A. I've heard that happens yeah sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You know you could have cut the powder that you brought into Australia by fifty per cent, don't you? 
         
        A. I never even considered it to be honest."" 
        
       
      
    33 At the end of the examination, Mr Sutherland, counsel for Mr Donnelly, said this: (22.4.05: T38) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Your Honour if I can candidly say I was just a little concerned in relation to some of the questions from your Honour as to whether or not in the circumstances your Honour might be assisted by some pharmacological evidence which I don't have available today ..."" 
        
       
      
    34 Mr Sutherland continued: (T39) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... I must say my perception sitting here and just listening to the few questions that your Honour did ask gave me cause for pause to think that maybe that is evidence of a kind that might be of some assistance to your Honour if your Honour were felt weighed down by the healthy judicial scepticism, based on experience of course, of the purity of this particular substance."" 
        
       
      
    35 His Honour acknowledged that Mr Sutherland's perception was right and that he was sceptical (T39). The matter was adjourned to enable the applicant to place before the Court pharmacological evidence as foreshadowed by Mr Sutherland.  
     
      
    36 The proceedings resumed on 8 July 2005. A report had, in the meantime, been procured from Associate Professor Starmer, the professor of pharmacology at the University of Sydney. Professor Starmer's report included these words: (AB 38) 
     
      
       
        
        ""14. The residual effects after MDMA (75 - 150 mg) include exhaustion, fatigue, depression, nausea, numbness, feelings of coldness, anxiety attacks, persistent insomnia, rage reactions, psychosis and, possibly, flashbacks. The residual effects of MDMA may persist for period of several hours up to two weeks after drug ingestion. Users develop a rapid tolerance to MDMA. Most users will therefore (for financial reasons) allow an interval of at least a week between doses of the drug. More frequent use of MDMA results in a reduction of the pleasant effects and an increase in the unpleasant effects of the drug. If Mr Donnelly planned to take ecstasy tablets every day, the desired effects are likely to have become progressively less evident. ..."" 
        
       
      
    37 Mr Donnelly was recalled. He described, for the first time, certain adverse side effects of ecstasy. The examination in chief was in these terms: (8.7.05: T2) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. When your usage increased, and I think you explained to his Honour initially upwards of something in the order of five days a week or thereabouts? 
         
        A. Sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did the increased usage, that is where you were not having a gap of four or five or days or a week in between usage. What difference if any did that make to you? 
         
        A. Well, the drug would work again. It stops working when you do it every day over a period of time, so you need to take a couple of days off to make it work properly again. You start to feel pretty, pretty sick after a while as well. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I am sorry, I missed that last -- ? 
         
        A. You start to feel pretty sick after long periods of using it."" 
        
       
      
    38 Given these effects, Mr Donnelly described his practice in taking the drug in these terms: (T3) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. If you got to the stage during your heavy usage where you were feeling nauseous and sick, so you took a day or a couple of days off, would you be off the drug completely or would you use it in any way? 
         
        A. I'd still taste a little bit or snort a tiny amount even on days off, but just enough to get the taste and the feel, not really for a drugs effect."" 
        
       
      
    39 He was asked about Professor Starmer's report: (T3) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. You understand that during the adjournment period, your solicitor has obtained from Professor Starmer as you just saw me tender --? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. -- a report. Have you seen that report? 
         
        A. No."" 
        
       
      
    40 When cross examined, Mr Donnelly said this: (T5) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Sir, you said that you have not seen this report by Professor Starmer? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Have you discussed it with your legal representatives at all? 
         
        A. I spoke briefly to Michael Kirby this morning."" 
        
       
      
    41 When questioned further, Mr Donnelly added: (T5/6) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Did you talk about how the report indicates that people who use MDMA more frequently than once a week tend to have a result where the pleasant effect is reduced and there is an increase in the unpleasant effects? 
         
        A. He -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you discuss that? 
         
        A. -- he read me a small excerpt from the report, I think that was one of the lines yep. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You did discuss that? 
         
        A. Yeah he read me a small excerpt. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you also discuss the unpleasant, what those unpleasant effects are for example, depression, restlessness, nausea, did you discuss those things? 
         
        A. No I don't think so."" 
        
       
      
    42 It was put to Mr Donnelly that he had changed his account, and had tailored his evidence so that it did not conflict with that of Professor Starmer. He denied that suggestion, providing the following explanation: (T7) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. No what I've done is I've taken the average of say I was using seven grams a week and just divided it by the days. I was using the drug every day and mostly I'd be using a gram a day."" 
        
       
      
    43 Against this background, let me turn to the grounds of appeal. It is convenient to deal with a number of grounds together. 
     
      
       
      Arguments on Appeal. 
       
       
      (a) That the sentencing judge failed to give any or any sufficient reasons for finding that he was not satisfied that the offender imported the MDMA into Australia for his own personal use; and 
       
       
      (b) That the sentencing judge should have held that the maximum sentence applicable to each charge was a fine of $2,200 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years or both (Customs Act 1901 section 235). 
       
       
      (c) That the sentence imposed exceeded the available statutory maximum. 
       
      
    44 Mr Glissan QC appeared for Mr Donnelly on the appeal. He submitted that the material before the sentencing Judge amounted to a powerful case that his motivation was personal, not commercial. He was a regular and heavy user of ecstasy, as his Honour accepted. He was psychologically dependant upon it. He could be expected to need the drug once he returned to Australia. It was much cheaper in London. Whilst he had a number of convictions, none related to drug dealing. Unusually, the drug was in powder form, rather than tablet form. He was in the habit of using the drug in powder form. Sgt Stipnieks had not previously heard of an importation of ecstasy in powder form. Sgt Stipnieks agreed that the drug was much more readily saleable and valuable in tablet form. There was no evidence that Mr Donnelly had a pill press or the know-how or connections to transform the drugs from powder to tablet. 
     
      
    45 These were all matters said to support his claim that he imported the drugs for personal use. They were matters in the applicant's submission, that his Honour was obliged to weigh and accept or reject. Instead, his Honour had, in the passage already quoted (para 29) (supra para 13), simply adverted to the quantity and value of the drugs imported. In written submissions, the applicant said this in respect of that approach: 
     
      
       
        
        ""22. These do not, it is submitted, amount to reasons at all. There was no issue about the quantity or the commercial value of the drug beyond that identified above. More, there was no evidentiary basis for linking the accused at any past time with other than personal use of the drugs, nor quantity apart, for doing so on this occasion. To the contrary his long history of addiction, so carefully weighed by his Honour, argued strongly for the defence he advanced."" 
        
       
      
    46 There was, according to the applicant, nothing beyond the quantity of the drugs which led his Honour to reject the applicant's case (para 26). 
     
      
    47 The Crown responded to these submissions by drawing attention to the findings his Honour made before his conclusions, which are set out above. Contrary to the applicant's submissions, his Honour did, according to the Crown, reject significant aspects of the applicant's evidence. He said this: (ROS p7/8) 
     
      
       
        
        ""27. The offender claims that, as he was a regular and heavy user of MDMA, using up to a gram of it almost every day of the week, something that he had done for two or three years, he purchased the MDMA which he imported into Australia for his own use, purchasing sufficient to last him about a year. Also, he claims that he purchased the cocaine which he imported into Australia for his own personal use so that he could have a 'little bit of fun'."" 
        
       
      
    48 His Honour continued, making the following adverse finding against the applicant: (ROS p8) 
     
      
       
        
        ""28. I do not doubt that MDMA and cocaine are widely available, easily obtainable and cheaper to purchase in London than in Sydney. I do not doubt that the offender was a regular and heavy user of MDMA at the time of his arrest and that he had been such a user of it for two or three years before his arrest,  
        although I doubt that he used as much of it each day and that he used it almost every day as he claimed 
        . ..."" 
         
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    49 The remarks continued, again commenting adversely upon the applicant's evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        ""28. ... Also, I do not doubt that he had used other prohibited drugs, including cocaine, before his arrest.  
        However, I do not accept that he did not know the approximate purity of street quality MDMA and the approximate purity of MDMA that he had purchased. 
         A regular and heavy user of a prohibited drug, whether it was heroin, cocaine, amphetamine or MDMA, would want to know the approximate purity of the drug being purchased so as to ensure value for money, and being used so as not to endanger his or her own life."" 
         
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    50 It was within that context that his Honour stated that he was not satisfied that the applicant had imported the MDMA for his own personal use (ROS para 29), referring to the value of the drugs, both wholesale and street value. It was, he said, quite obvious that he had ""imported it into Australia to deal with it commercially"" (ROS para 29). 
     
      
    51 In my view, his Honour provided adequate reasons. He made it clear that he did not accept the applicant's evidence concerning the level of his use, one gram per day. The suggestion of a year's supply of drugs for personal use, imported at some personal risk, both physically and legally, stretches one's credulity. That evidence having been rejected, so that the supply was plainly for more than a year (and perhaps considerably more), it is hardly surprising that his Honour was not persuaded on the civil onus. 
     
      
    52 I would reject grounds (a), (b) and (c). 
     
      
       
      (d) In the alternative, that the sentence imposed was too severe. 
       
      
    53 This aspect was not the subject of written or oral submissions. The sentence was plainly within range. It was not too severe. I would likewise reject ground (d). 
     
      
       
      Orders. 
       
      
    54 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal be granted. 
       
       
      2. But the appeal dismissed.

      JUDGMENT – application to take the evidence of Khaled Taleb by audio-visual link 
       
      
    1 BELL J: On 4 July 2006 I directed that the evidence of Khaled Taleb be taken from a location outside the courtroom by audio-visual link pursuant to s 5B(1) of the Evidence (Audio and Audio-Visual Links) Act 1998 (the Act). These are my reasons for giving that direction. 
     
      
    2 Khaled Taleb (the witness) has a stutter. The application was made on the basis that his evidence would be more readily understood and complete if taken by audio-visual link.  
     
      
    3 The Crown tendered the report of Sue Brown, a speech pathologist, dated 7 April 2006 in support of the application. Ms Brown gave additional oral evidence and was cross-examined. The Crown tendered the transcript of evidence given by the witness on previous occasions. These included the transcript of evidence given by him at a voir dire hearing on 20 April 2006 at the trial of Adnan Darwiche, Naseam El Zeyat and Ramzi Aouad, on an indictment that charged them with offences relating to the murder of Ahmed Fahda. It also included the transcript of evidence given by the witness at a Basha hearing with respect to the present indictment. His evidence on that occasion was taken by audio-visual link over a lengthy period.  
     
      
    4 The statements of the witness made on 6 February 2006 and 18 March 2006 were tendered on the application. The witness is central to the Crown case in support of each of the counts in the indictment. He gives evidence of admissions made in his presence by each of the accused. He has been indemnified against prosecution for a very large number of serious offences of violence. His credit will be the central issue at the trial.  
     
      
       
      The evidence 
       
      
    5 Ms Brown has practiced as a speech pathologist since 1978. Throughout her career she has worked with adults and children who stutter. She has participated in intensive stutter programs for adults and she has seen adults and children with this condition in therapy.  
     
      
    6 Ms Brown assessed the witness at a consultation conducted on 6 April 2006. She concluded that he has a genuine stutter, which would affect his ability to communicate his ideas and information in a way that could be easily understood. The history that he gave, and his description of the factors that affect his communication were, in Ms Brown’s opinion, consistent with the literature and with her clinical experience. She observed that his stutter is exacerbated when he is anxious, nervous, under pressure and scared. She reported that when he discussed highly emotive personal issues he had become extremely dysfluent. At other times he had been fluent and able to express himself quite clearly. Ms Brown reported that the witness had a lot of difficulty coordinating his breathing, voice and speech when stuttering. She considered that his impediment would make it difficult for him to be understood clearly at times. In oral evidence she said that stress significantly affects a stutterer’s ability to plan and sequence the movements required for verbal expression at a neurological level. Stutterers are known to have higher anxiety levels than the general population. She described a cyclical effect in which increased anxiety inhibits motor control: people become anxious, stutter more, and this in turn increases anxiety (T 666). Ms Brown considered that decreasing the level of stress experienced by the witness would maximise his ability to convey information as effectively as possible.  
     
      
    7 On 20 April 2006, when the witness gave relatively brief evidence in the courtroom, his stutter was prominent and he was difficult to understand. This difficulty was increased at times by a lack of voice projection and by physical gestures that accompanied the stutter, rolling his eyes upwards and jerky head movements. 8 Ms Brown had noted that the witness’ difficulty in coordinating his breathing affected his ability to project his voice. In her opinion this difficulty would be relieved by the reduction in stress in giving evidence from a location outside the courtroom. She observed that directions to speak up would be likely to increase his stress level and the incidence of dysfluency. She commented that it is common for stutterers to have behaviours that are associated with stuttering: an individual might find that blinking helps him or her to articulate a word. Such a mannerism becomes a learned association and is persisted with even when it no longer helps with speech.  
     
      
    9 Ms Brown said that stutterers tend to avoid the use of words that they know may cause them to stutter. Typically, they will try to use simpler words.  
     
      
       
      The parties’ submissions 
      
     10 The court must not make such a direction under s 5B(1) of the Act in any of the circumstances specified in subs (2)(a) – (d). Of these it is only necessary to refer to subs (2)(c), which provides that the court must not make a direction if it is satisfied that the direction would be unfair to the party. 11 The making of the direction was opposed by each of the accused. It was submitted that taking the evidence of the witness by audio-visual link would be unfair to the accused. 
     
      
    12 Where a party opposes the making of a direction for taking evidence by audio-visual link the direction must not be made unless the party making the application satisfies the court that it is in the interests of the administration of justice for the court to do so: s 5B(3).13 It was contended on behalf of each accused that the Crown had failed to establish that it was in the interests of the administration of justice for the evidence of the witness to be taken by audio-visual link.  
     
      
    14 The accused submitted that it would be unfair to take the evidence by audio-visual link because the jury would not have the opportunity to assess the witness’ demeanour as well as if he gave his evidence in the courtroom. It was submitted that one notable feature of his presentation on 20 April, when he gave evidence in the courtroom, was his reluctance to look at the accused. It was submitted to be open to the jury to draw an inference as to his honesty and reliability from his unwillingness to look at those whom he was accusing. It was also submitted that any increase in the frequency of stuttering might be taken into account in assessing his honesty and reliability. 15 Taking the evidence by audio-visual link necessarily means that the jury will not observe any reluctance that the witness may exhibit in looking at the accused. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that this did not occasion any unfairness to the accused. He pointed out that a number of inferences might be drawn from any observation that the witness chose not to look in the direction of the accused. He submitted that the jury could not draw any useful conclusion from such an observation. He referred to the decision of the High Court in State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Earthline Constructions Pty Ltd (In Liq) 1999 73 ALJR 306 and, in particular, to the doubts about the reliability of the assessment of demeanour in the scientific studies, which are discussed by Kirby J at 328-329; [88] 4. This is a jury trial and it is within the jury’s province to arrive at its factual determinations upon an assessment of the demeanour of witnesses whether or not that process of reasoning is scientifically sound. However, I did not consider the inability to observe whether the witness avoids eye contact with the accused compromised their fair trial. Any reluctance exhibited by a witness to look at an accused, is an observation that may be more or less open depending upon the layout of the court. In some courts the dock will be in the line of vision of a witness looking at counsel in the course of giving evidence. In other courts the layout is such that no occasion arises for the witness to look in the direction of the dock.  
     
      
    16 The accuseds’ complaint was directed more generally to the restricted opportunity to observe the witness’ body language. Evidence given by audio-visual link does not allow the jury the same opportunity to observe a witness’ physical presentation as evidence given in the courtroom. It may be that some jurors have a better opportunity to observe the facial responses of a witness who is giving evidence by audio-visual link than one who is seated in the witness box. I accepted that there are differences between evidence that is given in the courtroom and evidence given by audio-visual link. However, I considered that, in light of the quality of the audio-visual equipment, the jury would not be deprived of the opportunity to make an adequate assessment of the witness’ demeanour.17 It was submitted on behalf of the accused that if the witness were permitted to give evidence by audio-visual link it would afford him a measure of protection to which he was not entitled. Counsel for the accused, El Zeyat, submitted that, difficult as it may be for the witness to give his evidence in the courtroom, it was the mantle that he had taken on (T 768). He submitted that I would find the witness’s evidence could be taken in the courtroom, albeit with difficulty.  
     
      
    18 The witness is giving evidence in the Crown case under an indemnity. It was not submitted that he would not give evidence if the Court did not permit him to do so by audio-visual link. In this respect the present application differed from that with which the Court was concerned in R v Ngo [2001] NSWSC 339.  
     
      
    19 It was not in issue that the witness suffers from a genuine stutter, nor that his evidence on 20 April had been difficult to understand. It was submitted that the witness might have exaggerated the extent of his speech difficulties when he gave evidence on that occasion. I did not draw that inference from my observations of his evidence given in court and by audio-visual link. I was satisfied that the witness’ disability affects his ability to communicate. In these circumstances I did not approach the question of whether the witness’ evidence should be taken by audio-visual link (which I was satisfied would be likely to minimise his difficulty) as conferring a benefit or form of protection on him.  
     
      
    20 I took into account the interests of the accused in having the evidence of this critical witness presented in the courtroom: R v Goldman [2004] VSC 165; 148 A Crim R 40 per Redlich J at 47 – 49. However, since I was not of the opinion that to take his evidence by audio-visual link would occasion unfairness, having regard to the quality of the equipment, I did not consider this to be determinative in dealing with an application under s 5B(1) of the Act in relation to a witness with a disability.  
     
      
    21 When the witness gave evidence by audio-visual link at the Basha hearing his stutter was apparent from time to time. It was accompanied by eye rolling and head jerking. Nonetheless he could clearly be understood. I approached the question of whether it was in the interests of the administration of justice for his evidence to be given by audio-visual link upon an acceptance that the evidence would be more comprehensible if given in that way. I did not consider that it worked unfairness to the accused to take the evidence of the witness in conditions that served to lessen the effect of his disability on his capacity to communicate effectively.  
     
      
    22 In considering the interests of the administration of justice I also took into account Ms Brown’s evidence that stutterers tend to avoid using words that cause difficulty. The witness is expected to give evidence of conversations. I considered that it was important that give his evidence as best he is able by reference to the words that he says were used and not in a contracted form to avoid the use of words that may cause him difficulty.  
     
      
    23 For these reasons I was satisfied that it was in the interests of the administration of justice for the evidence of the witness to be taken by audio-visual link.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Jason Glen Hammond appears before me on one indictable charge, namely assaulting police officer in the execution of duty, and occasioning to that officer, namely Leon Lincoln, actual bodily harm. That offence occurred between 1.45 and 2pm on 13 November 2005. 2 There are a number of back up offences, which were before the Local Court, which I am also asked to deal with. One of them is resisting police between 1.35 and 2pm, namely Senior Constable Matthew Dixon, and another is resisting Senior Constable Leon Lincoln at the same time while each of those officers were in the course of the execution of his duty. There is a further offence of assaulting Matthew Dixon, a police officer, while he was executing his duty.3 The situation is that the offender was charged on 6 November 2005 with contravening an apprehended domestic violence order. He was refused bail and was before the Local Court, Dubbo, on 7 November 2005. One of the terms of bail given was that he was not to approach or contact Glenda Weldon. At 1:35 on 13 November a number of police attended 41 Munnell Street, Gulargambone in respect of what was said to be a domestic violence incident involving the offender and the said Glenda Weldon. 4 The agreed facts appear to be that she was sitting on the verandah and told police that the offender was inside. They arrested him for being in breach of his bail. They were standing waiting for the offender to grab some belongings and for some reason, unclear to me, Senior Constable Lincoln grabbed the offender by his right arm; Constable Dixon grabbed him by his left. The offender commenced to resist by flexing his arms and demanding that the police let him go. There was a struggle during which the offender’s head hit a broken glass pane. He sustained a small cut. It was at this point, and perhaps because of that, it is hard to know, he bit Constable Lincoln twice on the left arm, once, it is said, leaving deep marks causing the hand to bleed, and there were marks on his left elbow. 5 It should be understood that in this day and age, particularly among people who have had custodial experience, the biting of somebody causes them tremendous stress because of the fear of HIV or hepatitis. That is because those sorts of diseases, which are, pretty lethal and disenabling diseases are transmitted through saliva transfer.6 The police sought to place handcuffs on the offender. There was further struggle. There was yet further struggle as they moved towards the doorway. During this struggle the offender turned at or to Constable Dixon and spat at his face. In fairness to the police and to those who record the facts, no saliva came out. In days of old that sort of detailed report would not have been made. It is actually a credit to them that they were frank and honest about it. Nonetheless, Dixon was fearful of the actions of the offender. There was further struggle as they sought to put him in the vehicle. The offender does not present as a very tall or well built second rower, but perhaps more in the Matthew Johns mould, short and stocky. I would imagine he could be difficult to handle if he was riled up, as it would seem he was at the time.7 The objective seriousness of the offence is that it is an interference with the administration of criminal justice. Police are there to enforce the laws and to protect those who are vulnerable or feel in peril. To interfere with an officer doing his duty is to strike at the heart of the administration of the criminal law, which in turn is to strike at the heart of justice. So in that sense the offence is serious. The police have a perfect entitlement to look to the Courts to protect them from assaults, and to assist them as best we can in doing their duty. They did not ask to go to these premises. They were called. 8 The offender has a record, including a record for assaulting police. There are a number of assaults in this record, to the extent that any of them are domestic violence related assaults, he should think seriously about whether that is a manly way in which to behave. If they are assaults on other men that is a different proposition, but if they are assaults on women, as I suspect they might be, then he ought to think whether, when he writes his biography, he wants to say to people ‘well I’m proud of having done those assaults’. 9 What is clear is that he has a drug and alcohol problem. His record is primarily in the Local Court. He has had community service in the past and he has had imprisonment in the past. 10 These offences may have been in breach of a bond and bail. That is also regarded as a feature which aggravates the criminality, the reasoning being this, that if the Court lets somebody free on bail or somebody free on a bond it is upon an understanding, obviously, that those people will not offend again. The subsequent offending conduct amounts to a breach of the understanding or, as it were, tacit agreement between the Court on the one hand and the offender on the other. I am about to release you now, on a s 12 bond, instead of putting you in gaol for another while, on the basis that you will behave yourself. If you choose not to behave yourself, notwithstanding that you have indicated to me you will behave yourself, the Court takes that as a personal affront, so it aggravates the seriousness of the criminality.11 Judith Hammond is your mother. There is material here that indicates she has gone through a kidney transplant and that it would be beneficial to her if you were free. She no doubt will be much less stressed knowing that you are at a rehabilitation clinic. This offender was born in February 1979. He is twenty-seven years old. 12. There is no probation and parole report. I know nothing about him.WILSON: There wasn’t a report, your Honour, the matter came from committal for sentence and it was moved to Bourke without a report being ordered, so the material before your Honour consists of the evidence that Mr Hammond gave in Bourke.HIS HONOUR: I don’t have that before me.WILSON: 24 May, where he outlined his background and early introduction to alcohol and drugs.HIS HONOUR: I was just trying to pick up his family. He has got a partner?WILSON: Yes, your Honour, she was the person involved in this matter.HIS HONOUR: Made the complaint.WILSON: And there are five children, all here today, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: So I can say he has the support of that family.WILSON: He does, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: And the grandmother.WILSON: His mother is very supportive of him.HIS HONOUR: He has indicated a willingness to do the Glen Rehabilitation Program and that has been instrumental in my taking the course that I intend to take. What I propose to do is to take cognisance of the seven months and eighteen days that he has already done in custody and to effect his release today, to sentence him to a term of imprisonment of nine months, conditional upon him entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of nine months I will suspend that sentence. 13 The conditions of the bond are these:-  
     
     That he make his way by 4 July, that being the date when there is a bed available, between the hours of 9am and 12 noon, to the Glen Centre at Chittaway Point and enter into the Glen Alcohol and Other Drug Rehabilitation Centre;  
     
     
     That whilst there he obey the directions of the manager of the centre;  
     
     
     That he do all in his power to effect his rehabilitation;  
     
     
     That he not leave The Glen unless authorised by the manager so to do;  
     
     
     I require him to be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service for the nine month period and for them to notify me in the event that he should depart from The Glen before his authorised date;  
     
     
     He will accept such counselling from the Probation and Parole office once released from The Glen as they require of him, particularly focusing on issues of anger management and domestic violence, and drug and alcohol counselling.  
    Mr Hammond, is any of that beyond you?OFFENDER: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Do you feel you can do those things?OFFENDER: Yes, I do.HIS HONOUR: I want you to remember that, because if it should be the case if you come back I will remind you that I asked you whether you felt you were able to do it, and you indicated to me you could. Is that understood?OFFENDER: Yes.14 The formal orders I make are these. Would you stand up please. I convict you of all four offences. So far as the summary offences are concerned I sentence you to a period of imprisonment to commence on the date of your arrest which was 13 November and to expire on 29 June, lest there be any doubt about it, 29 June 2006. That is yesterday. I do that pursuant to s 166 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.14 In respect of the current offence, which is the indictable offence, I take into account the time that you have served already in respect of that offence.  I sentence you to nine months imprisonment. Subject to your entering into a bond to be of good behaviour, which I understand you intend to do, I suspend the operation of that sentence for a period of nine months, conditional upon you entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for nine months, commencing today.  
     
     That bail will be conditioned that you attend The Glen between the hours of 9am and 12 noon on 4 July 2006, which is a Tuesday, at Chittaway Point;  
     
     
     That you obey the reasonable directions of the manager of The Glen until your authorised release by them;  
     That you are not to leave The Glen unless authorised by the manager, and that you are to accept the supervision of Probation and Parole and obey all reasonable directions of Probation and Parole;  
     
     
     That you will participate in programs that they may have and particularly programs relating to drug and alcohol abuse or management and domestic violence and anger management. 
     
     
     The sentence that you have had imposed upon you is one that is already served. It expired yesterday. 
     
     
     I order your release from custody in respect of those matters, but I order you to be placed in custody - you will still remain in the Court until I can find somebody to do so - for the purposes of attending upstairs to enter the bond.  
    CORRECTIVE SERVICES OFFICER: Excuse sir, may I take him downstairs, he’s got his papers--HIS HONOUR: No. You can bring the papers up here if you like. He is to remain here in custody and I understand you want the papers--CORRECTIVE SERVICES OFFICER: I understand, sir.HIS HONOUR: In the absence of a warrant you can’t take him anywhere but you can bring the papers to him. Thank you.

     IMNETU, Youssef Tecle v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: Youssef Tecle Imnetu was convicted of murder after a trial before Newman AJ and a jury. He was sentenced to an overall term of imprisonment of twenty-six and a half years with a non-parole period of twenty years. He appeals his conviction and seeks to appeal his sentence. 
     
      
    2 The Crown case against the appellant was that he was party with Basheeruddin Mohammed (“Ben”) in a joint criminal enterprise to kill Shoukat Ali Mohammed (“the deceased”). The evidence as to motive was not entirely clear. However, the deceased had put up a $20,000 bond for Ben as a condition of Ben’s obtaining a bridging visa allowing him to remain in Australia. The deceased’s own bridging visa was about to expire which meant that he would shortly have to leave the country. 
     
      
    3 The Crown case was that the deceased was killed in the appellant’s bedroom in a unit he shared with others at 13/187 Cleveland Street, Redfern, at some time between 2.13 pm and 8.15 pm on 29 June 2003. The primary mode of death was strangulation although the deceased was also given a large dose of heroin and was violently assaulted with a baseball bat, suffering a severe head injury. In the evidence of Dr Botterill the cause of death was given as strangulation with opiate intoxication described as a “significant contributing condition.” 
     
      
    4 Ben did not stand trial with the appellant. He had left the country on 17 July 2003 after his visa had been cancelled. 
     
      
    5 The case against the appellant was wholly circumstantial. Evidence of the movements of Ben, the appellant and the deceased on 29 June 2003 was available from video surveillance footage in the car park basement at the Cleveland Street premises. 
     
      
    6 The appellant was with Ben when they left the premises at 12.38 pm and went to a “Rebel-sport shop” in Broadway where Ben purchased a baseball bat and sleeping bag. The deceased made a telephone call from his mobile phone to Ben’s phone at 12.45 pm. After first buzzing at the front door Ben and the appellant are seen returning to the appellant’s premises through the underground car park with Ben carrying a parcel at 1.38 pm. At this time the appellant is also seen adjusting a surveillance camera in the underground car park. 
     
      
    7 At 2.25 pm Ben is seen leaving the premises. At 2.31 pm the deceased drives into the underground car park in his motor vehicle with Ben in the passenger seat. Both are seen approaching the internal lift. This is the last occasion the deceased is seen alive. 
     
      
    8 At 3.09 pm the appellant is seen entering the underground car park from the elevator. Ben joined the appellant for some two minutes and then leaves. The appellant is observed to walk into the view of camera 2, look up at it, and then move back from it. At 3.11 pm the appellant is seen standing near the fire stairs and doing a little dance. At 3.13 pm Ben is seen wearing a white top and the appellant a black top. 
     
      
    9 At 3.17 pm the appellant went back to the lift and returned to his unit. At 4.06 pm Ben and the appellant re-entered the car park. Ben is now wearing a dark top having changed from his white top. Both appear to be doing some form of surveillance. They also both approach the deceased’s motor vehicle. During this sequence the motor vehicle is moved and returned and cameras are again interfered with. The appellant said he moved the cameras so that Ben could not be seen changing the number plates on the deceased’s car. At 4.28 pm the appellant’s flatmate, Mr Legarth returned home. On the Crown case the murder may and most probably had already taken place in the appellant’s bedroom. The Crown submitted that the deceased had, at least, already suffered head injuries by this time. 
     
      
    10 At 5.09 pm Ben left the building through the front door and returned through that door at 6.06 pm. At 6.54 pm Ben left the building through the underground car park and returned shortly after at 6.59 pm with a wheelie bin which he took into the lift. 
     
      
    11 At 7.53 pm Legarth left the building. Legarth made no mention of a wheelie bin in his evidence and it was the Crown case that this could have been brought into the flat while he was showering. 
     
      
    12 It was the defence case that the first the appellant knew of the killing was when he came out of the shower, at or about 7.53 pm, when he saw the deceased in the wheelie bin in front of the exit door and that he was thereafter forced by the co-accused to assist in disposal of the body. 
     
      
    13 At 8.15 pm the appellant exited the lift, walked around and then went back into the lift. At 8.18 pm both exit. Ben was pushing a wheelie bin. Cameras are again interfered with. A few minutes later they re-enter the car park and enter the elevator. Some time later they are seen leaving in the deceased’s vehicle. The vehicle was disposed of. 
     
      
    14 The evidence established that the deceased had been orally administered a large dose of heroin (he was not a drug user), had been violently hit over the head and then strangled with an electrical cord which was later found in the appellant’s bedroom. Blood was subsequently identified on the carpet of the appellant’s bedroom. 
     
      
    15 The Crown case was that the appellant and Ben were engaged in a “joint criminal enterprise.” It was put that the jury could infer that the appellant was involved from at least the time of purchase of the baseball bat and sleeping bag, that he acted as a lookout in the basement car park, that he attempted to move the surveillance cameras on three occasions to avoid detection and that he was involved with the disposal and removal of the body of the deceased. The Crown also relied on mobile phone calls from the appellant to Ben and Legarth, which were made while both were at the premises and which were not answered by either of them. This was said to be a method of communication between the appellant and Ben and a method whereby the appellant tested whether Legarth was still in the unit. 
     
      
    16 There was also some evidence from which it could be inferred that the shirt worn by Ben got blood on it when the deceased was assaulted with the baseball bat, Ben took the shirt off and was then lent another, larger, dark shirt by the appellant. Ben is seen in the dark shirt at 4.06 pm. 
     
      
    17 There are two grounds of appeal in relation to the conviction. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 – The trial judge gave inadequate directions and erred in his directions on inferences and circumstantial evidence 
       
      
    18 Although the trial judge emphasised to the jury that the onus of proof lay upon the prosecution which must prove the relevant elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt and provided detailed directions with respect to circumstantial evidence, the appellant said they were inadequate. In particular it was submitted that because the judge did not tell the jury that before an inference could be drawn it had to be the only rational inference available (Knight v R (1992) 175 CLR 495 at 502-503) the directions given were inadequate and the trial miscarried. The appellant particularly emphasised the reasons of McHugh J in Stevens v R [2005] HCA 65 at [25] where his Honour said that because the prosecution case was a circumstantial case it required a direction to “the jury that, if there is any reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence of the [accused], it is their duty to acquit.” 
     
      
    19 The defence at the trial was confined to an argument that the appellant was not involved in the events until late in the evening when he acted under duress. On the appeal it was submitted that his Honour had failed to give the jury adequate guidance as to an hypothesis consistent with his innocence of the count of murder, because, so it was suggested, if the deceased had died at an early time in the sequence of events, by 4 pm, it was suggested the evidence of the appellant’s initial acts – going to the Rebel-sport store and adjusting cameras, was not sufficient to found a conviction for murder. This, so it was submitted, was an hypothesis consistent with innocence which had to be excluded before the appellant could be convicted. 
     
      
    20 I have no doubt that this ground of appeal should be rejected. 
     
      
    21 To my mind the submission now made by the appellant significantly understates the strength of the Crown case. That case was comprised of the early phone calls to and from the deceased, the journey to the Rebel-sport store to purchase the baseball bat and the sleeping bag, the manipulation of video surveillance cameras to avoid being filmed followed by a period of time when the deceased, Ben and the appellant were together undisturbed in the appellant’s flat. They were in the flat together for at least 49 minutes following which at 4.06 both the appellant and Ben are seen in the car park without the deceased. Ben has changed his clothes and they proceed to change the number plates on the deceased’s car while endeavouring to shield their activities from the video cameras. It was at 4.28 pm that Legarth arrived and stayed for about three hours. 
     
      
    22 I accept that the overwhelming inference from this sequence of events is that the deceased had either died by about 4.00 pm or was seriously ill by this time. The medical evidence is also consistent with death by this time. The killing occurred in the appellant’s bedroom which was not accessed by Legarth whilst he was at the premises. The door was shut although for a period the appellant accessed the room. 
     
      
    23 The deceased was both drugged and violently attacked in the appellant’s bedroom. It seems to me to be inconceivable, having regard to the evidence of their movements both before 3.00 pm and after 4.00 pm, that the appellant was not involved in the planning, preparation and carrying out of the killing. Rather than death at an early time being consistent with innocence it is to my mind but one of the elements in an overwhelming Crown case that the appellant carried out the killing together with Ben. 
     
      
    24 The trial judge summed up to the jury over part of two days. His Honour told them that the Crown carried the onus of proof “from start to finish” and “in relation to every element which the Crown is required to prove in relation to the crimes and the Crown must establish those matters beyond reasonable doubt.” These directions were repeated on more than one occasion. 
     
      
    25 His Honour also addressed the jury in relation to inferences making plain the difference between an inference and speculation. He did this by using the example of a football match. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “During the course of addresses, you heard reference to drawing of inferences. Drawing of inferences, members of the jury, is a process of reasoning whereby you move from one or more established fact, or facts, to a further conclusion of fact. That process, which his open to you, is to be distinguished from mere speculation, a process which is not open to you. 
        
       
       
        
        The process of factual reasoning in which you engage, is to be undertaken in the light of the directions I have given to you concerning onus of proof. Perhaps I can give you a somewhat homely example of the distinction between drawing a proper inference and mere speculation. Go back to last weekend and you will remember, members of the jury, that it started to rain last Thursday night and, happily, we can say, it has kept on raining ever since. Assuming last Saturday afternoon you were driving around the suburbs of Sydney around quarter to five, just as darkness was falling, and you were passing by a suburban oval. You see 26 young men. 13 in garb which was basically green. 13 in garb which was basically red, and all very muddy and they are walking off a rectangular field and at the end of each end is a pair of rugby posts, accompanied by three other people; one dressed, say, in a yellow garb basically, and two others otherwise dressed. The one dressed in yellow garb is carrying a football. Now, members of the jury, it would be a perfectly proper inference for you to draw that those 26 young men had just competed in a game of rugby league football. Why is it so? Facts known: winter, football season. Saturday afternoon, a time when football is often played. Thirdly, a suburban oval marked as a rugby field. 26 young men, 13 each side; quarter to five, about the time when a game of football ends’ muddy young men leaving a muddied field; football in the hand of somebody who is a referee. A perfectly proper inference for you to draw is that they had just played a game of rugby. You can draw from those facts this: they had a game of rugby league, even though you had not seen a ball kicked, passed or a tackle made. A perfectly proper inference to draw. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, say one of the young men in red had a big grin on his face. It would be mere speculation for you to conclude that he had that big grin on his face because the side in red had just won the match. For all you know, it may be the first time that season that the red team had managed to avoid being beaten by more than 50 points. It may be that he had scored a try. Who knows. There is nothing upon which you can draw a proper inference as to why he is smiling. There are a whole lot of reasons why he is smiling. But, there is no fact that you can look to to draw a further conclusion of fact as to why he was smiling. If you do so, it is mere speculation. That, members of the jury, is a process of reasoning which is forbidden to you. 
        
       
       
        
        But, as I have said, you are perfectly entitled to draw inferences, and I have explained to you what an inference is and I hope that example, members of the jury, is helpful to you in understanding the difference between speculation and inference.” 
        
       
      
    26 After addressing the jury in relation to the appellant’s defence his Honour turned to deal with the evidence. Identifying the essential elements in the Crown case as the evidence on the video of the movements of both the appellant and Ben. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “You have had the Crown saying that the actions you see from thereon right through to the time you see the wheelie bin heading out of the garage are absolutely consistent with only one thing, that from the start to finish, including the manipulations of the cameras, and there were a number of them members of the jury, the accused was in it, assisting Ben from start to finish. The accused of course said, ‘No, no I only assisted Ben after he threatened me, after Mr Legath left the flat.’ 
        
       
       
        
        Remember the accused told you that when Legath left the flat he was having a shower, and he came out of the shower, it was then that the accused says that he first became aware that any misfortune had occurred to the deceased at all, and it was then that Ben threatened him. He says, this is what the accused tells you, and again I remind you members of the jury he bears no onus. He says that it was not until Legath had left the flat, and Legath left the flat, according to the accused, when the accused was under the shower. So it couldn’t have been too long after, you might have thought, Legath left the flat. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused points to the time when he first became aware that some misfortune had fallen to the deceased. Members of the jury, an easy reference to when it was that Legath had left the flat is picked up in the still photographs contained in Exhibit Q, which is put down as being eastern standard time, about 7 minutes to 9. In fact as we know, it’s about 7 minutes to 8 real time. Then the accused says that he first became aware that misfortune in any way had fallen to the deceased. 
        
       
       
        
        Of course the Crown case is that you are perfectly entitled when looking at the whole of the evidence to infer the participation of the accused in the murder of the deceased.” 
        
       
      
    27 His Honour then contrasts the Crown case and that of the appellant saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown case is that the accused accompanied the man Ben to the Rebel Sport store where a baseball bat and a sleeping bag were purchased. They returned – I am just repeating the Crown case members of the jury. I’m not putting it anything else but that. This is the Crown case. They returned to the block of flats. They go to the entrance, the ordinary entrance, the buzzer is pushed, then they go downstairs and go in through the basement because, you will remember, again it’s common ground, that the accused had a remote control to the garage door. You then see the accused, and he admits it, adjusting it – to use a neutral phrase – the camera above the lift; camera 3. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown says you would not accept the accused’s explanation that he was just doing it because Ben suggested it was, as I understand, out of alignment. Go upstairs. You see the arrival of the deceased. You then see on the film the involvement of the accused coming down. The Crown says when he’s down in the basement he is obviously keeping a lookout, the discussions in the basement with the man Ben, various adjustments to various cameras in the basement by the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused says the camera’s being adjusted because Ben was going to do something, change the number plates on the deceased’s car. The Crown says you would not accept that. The Crown says when you look at the continuation of the video, at all stages the accused seems calm, he seems to know what he’s doing, he’s with the man Ben, and the Crown puts it of course a lot of the activity, including the adjustment of cameras, occurs well before Mr Legath leaves the premises just before 8 o’clock in the evening.” 
        
       
      
    28 At the end of the first day of the summing up his Honour took care to discuss any issues requiring attention with counsel. No reference was made to circumstantial evidence until the court resumed on the following day. The matter was raised by the Crown who indicated that counsel for the appellant sought a “circumstantial direction not of the links in the chain type, if I can call it that, but the strands in the cable type.” His Honour indicated that he would give the direction provided at para 2-510 of the Supreme Court Bench Book. Counsel for the appellant agreed that would be a suitable direction. Counsel also agreed with his Honour the evidence which comprised the circumstances relevant to the Crown case. 
     
      
    29 Subsequently, his Honour gave the following further directions to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now members of the jury, you will recall that yesterday I gave you directions about the drawing of inferences and you will remember I gave you an example relating to football about the difference between drawing proper inference and mere speculation. Mere speculation being, as I directed you, a process of reasoning which is forbidden to you. That direction is important because in this case the Crown relies upon what lawyers call circumstantial evidence. And I will now give you a direction relating to circumstantial evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, members of the jury, I have already told you the onus of proving the accused’s guilt in respect of charges which it brings against him is on the Crown. It must establish, as I have told you, his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. That means that in respect of each of the essential elements, ingredients or elements of the charges, you must be satisfied that the Crown has established its case before you would be entitled to bring in a verdict of guilty on any charge that you believe the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
       
        
        I have also told you that your function as a fact finding tribunal in this case goes beyond coming to a conclusion that you were satisfied that a particular basis of fact has been established by the evidence. Your function also extends, as I have told you, to drawing reasonable inferences or conclusions from the facts you find to be established. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, here, in this case members of the jury, the Crown relies upon evidence which is described as circumstantial evidence. First, the Crown relies upon evidence that the accused, and as I understand him Ben, went shopping, when the baseball bat and the sleeping bag were purchased. 
        
       
       
        
        Secondly, the Crown of course relies upon the video player. The CCTV, Ex. X, about which much has been said and about which you have seen now on a number of occasions and of course you are at liberty to see again at your leisure. 
        
       
       
        
        Thirdly, the Crown relies upon the fingerprints of the accused which were found firstly on the bin, secondly on the garbage bag which was over the deceased’s legs and thirdly you will recollect the cornflake packet in the bin. That is a circumstance upon which the Crown relies. 
        
       
       
        
        Next, the Crown relies upon the evidence of phone calls which is found in Ex. AA and you will recollect that the Crown took you to phone calls such as the one which is number 28 from the accused’s phone to Legath at 18.09, number 28, and the one, number 31, at 19.15. I will not go into that in any more detail. There are other calls, of course, referred to. You have the exhibits. The Crown says that is another circumstance upon which it relies. It also relies, members of the jury, upon the circumstance of the removal of the body of the deceased in the wheelie bin from the block of units to the position where it was subsequently found in the street. It also relies in another circumstance, upon the fact that the accused and Ben took the deceased’s car from the premises, Ben driving. There is not [sic] issue, but the accused accompanied him. 
        
       
       
        
        Now they are the circumstances upon which the Crown relies as circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence, members of the jury, is evidence of a basic fact or facts from which you, are asked to draw a conclusion as to a further fact or facts. In other words, as I described to you yesterday, drawing a proper inference. 
        
       
       
        
        Circumstantial evidence is sometimes contrasted with direct evidence. That is, evidence from a person who says that he saw or she saw or otherwise perceived a fact or facts which the Crown relies upon as establishing its case. Now there is nobody here who says – I saw somebody attack the deceased. Now, there is no such evidence of that type. 
        
       
       
        
        And such direct evidence, they not only take the form of a witness saying, as I have just said, that he or she saw, the accused doing the act which the Crown says constitutes the alleged crime. It may take another form, such as a video recording showing the accused, or Ben committing that act. There is no such evidence here, of course. Plenty of video evidence but no video evidence of the act which gave rise to the deceased’s death, or evidence of a person who says that he or she heard an admission being made. Again, no such evidence of doing the act. No such evidence this case. 
        
       
       
        
        Where, however, the Crown’s case depends on circumstantial evidence to some degree, then it relies upon evidence of a basic fact or facts from which you, the jury, are asked to infer or conclude that further fact or facts existed, being in this case the accused’s guilt of the crime, because the onus of proof is on the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt as to every essential element or ingredient of the charge. Any such inference or conclusion from basic facts relied upon by the Crown must of course be a conclusion reached by you beyond reasonable doubt, having taken into consideration not only the material presented on behalf of the Crown but also any material presented on behalf of the accused, and having given careful consideration to the submissions of counsel on behalf of both the Crown and the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        I should add that a case on circumstantial evidence may be just as convincing and reliable as a case based upon direct evidence, depending upon the nature of the circumstances relied upon when considered as a whole, that is, all the circumstances considered together. And remember, members of the jury, yesterday I directed you to consider the whole of the evidence in the case, and do not compartmentalise it. That is, do not look at evidence individually or in isolation, and the degree of clarity and certainty to which that evidence may lead inevitably to a conclusion that the Crown has established its case or does not lead to the conclusion that the Crown has established its case. 
        
       
       
        
        It is essential that you examine the evidence with care and consider whether it is reliable before drawing any conclusions from facts which you regard as being established but which in your view it is not of such reliability to enable you to come to the conclusion which the Crown says you will come to, having taken into consideration the accused’s evidence, and the character of evidence called on his behalf and having given due weight to the submissions of counsel on both sides, if that is your view then you must acquit.” 
        
       
      
    30 To my mind the directions which his Honour gave adequately explained to the jury the nature of circumstantial evidence and how they could use it in their deliberations. His Honour was careful to tell the jury they could not speculate and that the prosecution carried the onus of proving its case beyond reasonable doubt. When considering these matters on the second day his Honour was careful to remind the jury of the illustration he had given and emphasised that they could only draw a “proper inference” which his Honour had explained by example was one where only one explanation for a known event was appropriate. His Honour contrasted a “proper inference” with “mere speculation” describing the latter as a process of reasoning which was forbidden to them. 
     
      
    31 Although McHugh J in Stevens v R [2005] HCA 65 at [25] spoke of the “requirement” that the jury be told that “if there is any reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence … it is their duty to acquit,” I do not believe his Honour should be understood as requiring that precise formulation be used by the trial judge. What is required is that the directions given ensure that the jury understand that if there is another reasonable explanation available “other than that the accused committed the crime charged the accused is entitled to be acquitted” (see Barca v R (1975) 133 CLR 82 per Gibbs, Stephen and Mason JJ). 
     
      
    32 In Grant v R 11 ALR 503 Barwick CJ emphasised that there is no rule of law that a trial judge must, in a circumstantial evidence case, give the direction in terms expressed by McHugh J (which is apparently derived from R v Hodge (1838) 2 Lewin CC 227 at 228). As Barwick pointed out the direction suggested in Hodge was “an amplification of the direction that the Crown must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.” 
     
      
    33 In Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 Dawson J said at 578: 
     
      
       
        
        “The learned trial judge gave the customary direction that, where the jury relied upon circumstantial evidence, guilt should not only be a rational inference but should be the only rational inference that could be drawn from the circumstances: see Hodge’s Case; Peacock v The King; Plomp v The Queen. Whilst a direction of that kind is customarily given in cases turning upon circumstantial evidence, it is no more than an amplification of the rule that the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. In many, if not most, cases involving substantial circumstantial evidence, it will be a helpful direction. In other cases, particularly where the amount of circumstantial evidence involved is slight, a direction in those terms may be confusing rather than helpful. Sometimes such a direction may be necessary to enable the jury to go about their task properly. But there is no invariable rule of practice, let alone rule of law, that the direction should be given in every case involving circumstantial evidence. It will be for the trial judge in the first instance to determine whether it should be given. As Barwick CJ, speaking for the Court, observed in Grant v The Queen: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Where the circumstances of the case seem to require that some such direction be given, the summing up regarded as a whole may prove to be, and generally may be likely to be, inadequate. On the other hand, having regard to the circumstances of the case and the nature of the summing up, the failure to give the special direction may not in a particular case result in an inadequacy of the summing up as a whole. It may none the less be concluded from the terms of the summing up that the jury were fully instructed.’” 
          
         
        
       
      
    34 In my opinion when read as a whole the directions given by the trial judge, in the present case, with respect to circumstantial evidence and the drawing of inferences were adequate. 
     
      
    35 Although the appellant suggested otherwise this is a matter where Rule 4 applies. At the beginning of the second day of his Honour’s summing up he discussed and agreed with counsel the direction he proposed to give with respect to circumstantial evidence. The direction which his Honour gave faithfully reflected the directions which counsel asked him to give. 
     
      
    36 In these circumstances I see no justification for this Court to allow the matter to be raised in an appeal. Both the adequacy of the directions given and the failure of counsel to raise any difficulties with them at the trial are persuasive reasons to deny leave to raise ground 1. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 – The trial miscarried by reason of the trial judge’s failure to correct a comment made by the Crown prosecutor regarding evidence of the accused’s good character or by reason of the Crown prosecutor’s comment regarding the accused’s good character. 
       
      
    37 There was evidence that the accused was of good character. The accused gave the following uncontradicted evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Have you ever been in trouble with police in Australia or anywhere else before? 
         
        A. No, never.” 
        
       
      
    38 Evidence was also called on behalf of the accused from a number of character witnesses. 
     
      
    39 In his address to the jury the Crown Prosecutor, when dealing with the accused’s character, said, inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        “The fact that he has had no prior criminal charges against him, criminal convictions as Sergeant Dyball told you in answer to one of my friend’s questions. That is something his Honour will tell you that you can take into account. His Honour will tell you how you can take those issues into account but I just ask you to bear in mind that people who have never committed crime do commit crime. Some of them do. You might think that evidence of that nature might be more compelling if it were someone who was perhaps 60 years old and had never committed an offence. You might think, that would weigh a little more strongly the balance perhaps than someone who hasn’t had a long life, who is young, who raises the same issue.” 
        
       
      
    40 The appellant submitted that the Crown Prosecutor was, in effect, attacking the probative value of the accused’s good character on two bases. The first was that some people who have never committed crime can change character and commit crimes. The second was that less weight should be given to the good character of a 20 year old accused than say a 60 year old accused. 
     
      
    41 It was submitted that the first basis was a comment that could properly be made by a Crown Prosecutor. However, it was said that it was significantly undermined by the failure of the Crown to point to any motive for the accused to change character so substantially as to enter into a joint enterprise to murder the deceased. 
     
      
    42 It was submitted that the second basis therefore assumed additional significance and that it was not appropriate and never has been appropriate for a jury to be told that they could place less weight on evidence of an accused’s good character because of his relative youth. In this formulation youth becomes a disentitlement to a good character direction. 
     
      
    43 This matter was not raised at the trial and to my mind leave should be refused. In my opinion there is no difficulty in the prosecutor’s submission. It is obvious that a person who has lived 60 years without blemish has demonstrated a capacity to avoid criminal activity which a twenty year old cannot claim. Furthermore, the life pattern of a sixty year old is likely to be more settled than a twenty year old. Accompanied by the standard observation that persons of good character nevertheless commit crimes all that the prosecutor was urging was that the jury appropriately evaluate a claim of good character made by a younger person. 
     
      
       
      Sentence 
       
      
    44 The application raised three related grounds: 
     
      
       
      1. The sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the appellant’s culpability for the offence. 
       
      2. The sentencing judge erred in assessing the offence as falling above the mid range of seriousness. 
       
      3. The sentencing judge erred in holding that: 
       
       a. the offence “revealed a degree of planning”; 
       
        
        b. was “carried out in company”; and these were aggravating factors under s 21A of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
        
       
      
    45 The challenge to the sentence was supported by the following written submissions: 
     
      
       
        
        “The sentence imposed by the trial judge was a non-parole period of twenty years with a total sentence of twenty six years and eight months. 
         
         
        His Honour determined that “the objective facts of this murder place it above the mid range.” His Honour determined to set the standard non-parole period on the basis that Ben was the ring-leader and because of the appellant’s favourable subjective circumstances. 
         
         
        Concerning the criminality of Ben it is accepted that his offending at least falls within or above the mid range of seriousness for the offending. It is submitted that the same could not be said for the criminality of the appellant. 
         
         
        His Honour made the following finding: 
         
         
          
          “What is not clear from the evidence is who it was who administered the heroin to the deceased, who struck him with a baseball bat and who it was that strangled him. However, I have no doubt that these acts were committed by the prisoner and Basheeruddin acting in concert.” 
          
         
         
        It would appear from this that his Honour was making a finding that the appellant had an actual involvement in drugging, assault and strangulation of the deceased, notwithstanding his acceptance that Ben was “the leader of these criminal activities.” Obviously, before his Honour made any such findings they had to be found on the evidence beyond reasonable doubt:  
        R v Olbrich  
        (1999) 199 CLR 270. 
         
         
        The Crown never put its case on this basis, or at least, certainly never explicitly did so. The Crown case appears to have been that the appellant’s participation could be inferred from things he did (eg shifting the surveillance camera), not that it could be inferred from this that he was actually involved in the killing. In addition, the “joint enterprise” was explicitly said to encompass joint enterprise to cause grievous bodily harm. 
         
         
        In any event the evidence supported no more than that the appellant effectively acted as a lookout and decoy for the activities which Ben was engaged upon. If this is so then his Honour did not accurately characterise the appellant’s culpability and his assessment of it falling above the mid range of seriousness was also erroneous. 
         
         
        His Honour also found that aggravating factors under s 21A of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
        1999 included: 
         
         
        (a) a degree of planning (cf s 21A(2)(n)); 
         
        (b) the offence was committed in company (cf s 21A(2)(e)). 
         
         
        His Honour rejected a submission that these matters fell within the proviso to s 21A(2), namely that they were elements of the offence. Whether or not this is correct as a matter of principle, it is incongruous to find an offender liable on the basis of his involvement in planning of the offence or participation in another’s acts and then aggravate his criminality because of it. For instance, what is to be made in such circumstances of a finding that Ben was the leader and principal? Does this mean somehow that the appellant’s liability is aggravated beyond that which a reasoned assessment of his involvement in the offence would enable? It is respectfully submitted that this could not be what the legislation intended.” 
        
       
      
    46 I am satisfied that it was open to his Honour to find that the appellant and Ben acted closely in the commission of the offence. Furthermore, it was open to his Honour to find that the appellant was prepared to use the baseball bat and do whatever it took to kill the deceased and dispose of his body. In my opinion his Honour did not err when characterising the appellant’s culpability for this offence. 
     
      
    47 Both “the degree of planning” and the “fact the offence was committed in company” were matters which his Honour appropriately determined as relevant to the characterisation of the seriousness of the offence thereby informing the appropriate sentence. They are not relevantly elements of the offence of murder for the purposes of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. They are merely descriptive of how this particular murder was carried out.  
     
      
    48 However, in the present case I am satisfied that the sentence imposed was appropriate. This was a premeditated and vicious killing. Not only was the victim induced to take an excessive heroin dose, he was bashed about the head and strangled, before his body was disposed of in a garbage container. In my opinion no other sentence than that which was imposed was appropriate in law. 
     
      
       
      ORDERS 
       
      
    49 In my opinion the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
    50 Although I would grant leave to appeal against sentence I would dismiss that appeal. 
     
      
    51 JOHNSON J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL and Latham J. 
     
      
    52 LATHAM J:  I agree with the reasons of the Chief Judge at Common Law and with the proposed orders. I wish to add some brief comments in relation to the appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    53 It is simply not correct to assert that “the evidence supported no more than that the appellant effectively acted as a lookout and decoy for the activities which Ben was engaged upon” (see the appellant’s written submissions set out at par 45). It is implicit in the jury’s verdict that the appellant’s evidence at trial was rejected, in that the appellant sought to place an innocent construction on his participation in all of the events of 29 June 2003, including the purchase of the bat and sleeping bag, the manipulation of the security cameras and his movements in and around the unit. Objectively, the remaining evidence at trial established that the appellant played a pivotal role in the commission of the offence, as the following specific acts make clear :- 
     
      
    · The appellant satisfies himself that the unit is empty by pressing the intercom at the front door, despite being able to enter the carpark and then the unit with a remote control device, before the deceased is due to arrive.  
     
      
    · The appellant adjusts a security camera in the car park, apparently without any direction from Ben. 
     
      
    · The appellant gives Ben the remote control device so that he can guide the deceased’s vehicle into the carpark.  
     
      
    · Between the arrival of the deceased and the infliction of fatal injuries upon him (2:31pm – 4:28pm), the appellant and Ben are in each other’s company, but for 8 minutes, during which time the appellant is in the carpark appearing to check the angle of the surveillance cameras. 
     
      
    · The appellant and Ben are sitting on the balcony when Mr Legarth arrives home (4:28pm). The appellant goes to his bedroom (where the deceased lay dead or dying), leaving Ben to monitor Mr Legarth’s movements around the unit. The appellant also monitors Mr Legarth’s presence by phoning Ben and Mr Legarth from inside the appellant’s bedroom. 54 Not only did the appellant jointly engage with Ben in doing all that was necessary to carry out the murder and to avoid, as far as possible, detection, but he provided the premises where the offence might be committed without the risk of intervention by others. I do not regard a finding by his Honour that Ben was “the leader of these criminal activities” as in any way detracting from the objective gravity of the appellant’s role. Similarly, the absence of evidence capable of establishing who administered the heroin to the deceased, who struck him with the baseball bat and who strangled him does not equate to the proposition that the appellant did not participate in those activities. Given the length of time during which the appellant and Ben were in each other’s company, and in the company of the deceased, inside the unit when the injuries were undoubtedly inflicted, his Honour was entitled to find that the acts leading to the deceased’s death were committed in concert.  
     
      
    55 Neither the “degree of planning” or the fact that “the offence was committed in company” were elements of the offence, or “inherent characteristics of the class of offence” of murder : see Elyard v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 43. This offence displayed a relatively high degree of planning, which ought to have been reflected in the sentence to be imposed. The further aggravating factor is intended to reflect the criminality inherent in the commission of offences by the combined force of two or more offenders. I am not persuaded that “joint criminal enterprise” as a basis of liability necessarily equates with the circumstance of aggravation arising out of the commission of this offence by two offenders. In any event, I agree that the sentence imposed was appropriate and that no lesser sentence was warranted in law.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 GROVE J: Following a ruling by the presiding judge Dodd DCJ concerning intended use of evidence on the basis of tendency or coincidence, the appellant was tried successively before his Honour and juries on two indictments involving female victims. 
     
      
    2 The first indictment charged offences committed on a woman whom I will refer to as RA. It contained seven counts. Counts 1 and 2 charged assault occasioning actual bodily harm, to each of which the appellant pleaded guilty. Count 3 charged common assault and each of counts 4 to 7 inclusive charged aggravated sexual assault contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The latter offences carried a prescribed available maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment.  
     
      
    3 The appellant pleaded not guilty to counts 3 to 7. He was found not guilty on count 3 but convicted on counts 4 to 7. 
     
      
    4 The second indictment charged offences committed on a woman whom I will refer to as TM. It contained three counts. Count 1 charged sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 which stipulates a prescribed maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment. To this count he pleaded not guilty but was convicted. Count 2 charged assault occasioning actual bodily harm to which the appellant pleaded guilty. Count 3 charged detaining the victim for advantage of the offender contrary to s 90A of the Crimes Act for which a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment is available. The appellant pleaded not guilty to this count but was convicted. 
     
      
    5 In due course Dodd DCJ passed sentence in respect of the counts in both indictments upon which the appellant had been convicted either following his plea of guilty or jury verdict. 
     
      
    6 The appellant challenges in this appeal the convictions on counts 1 and 3 of the second indictment. There is no appeal in respect of the convictions on the relevant counts of the first indictment. Alternatively, the appellant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of overall sentence.  
     
      
    7 It is obviously necessary to deal first with the appeal against conviction on counts 1 and 3 of the second indictment. 
     
      
    8 The appellant was aged about thirty six years in 1998 when he met TM, then aged nineteen, at a nightclub in Fairfield. A relationship between them was formed shortly after their meeting in November 1998 and they initially resided at TM’s father’s house. She became pregnant and thereafter moved to her mother’s home at Tahmoor. The pregnancy later miscarried. The relationship had ended by 28 April 1999 which date has relevance to the circumstances concerning count 3.  
     
      
    9 TM testified that at about the end of March 1999, while she was residing at Tahmoor, the appellant told her that he “wanted to try anal sex”. After expressing her reluctance and an anticipation that such would hurt, she agreed on the basis that he would desist if she told him that it was hurting. The activity commenced, she told him that it hurt and thereafter the appellant went to shower himself and, while he was doing this, he told TM to go to the bedroom. She complied with this and lay on the bed where he joined her and then said to her that she was either going “to have it the hard way or the easy way”. He tore off boxer shorts that she was wearing and penetrated her anus with his penis. She asked him to stop and screamed and cried but he continued until the activity was finished and he finally left the room. It might be noted that cross examination of TM did not include an assertion that the appellant had not preceded the action described with an expression to TM that she was “to have it the hard way or the easy way”. The Crown relied on this incident as constituting count 1. 
     
      
    10 TM slept and the next morning went to the nearby home of her sister. From there she moved later to her mother’s house and still later to her father’s house. In mid April the appellant contacted her and she met him at a railway station after which they went to a flat occupied by a cousin of the appellant. Her evidence described being assaulted by the appellant while at this flat, which I will refer to as “the Liverpool premises”. 
     
      
    11 After this incident TM moved to Picton. Again the appellant contacted her by telephone and she agreed to accompany him in a car. This was on 27 April 1999 and they ultimately went to the Liverpool premises. Whilst they were there an argument developed and the appellant slapped her and punched her on the nose causing it to bleed. She went to the bathroom to clean herself and when she returned the appellant was cleaning her blood from where it had splashed onto the walls of the flat. 
     
      
    12 There was then an apparent period of relative calm during which there came a knock on the door. The appellant told TM to remain in one of the rooms. The callers at the door were in fact police officers conducting enquiries about disputes concerning car parking spaces in the residential complex. After making some enquiries of the appellant they left.  
     
      
    13 The appellant then thanked TM for not leaving the room as he had instructed. She remained overnight and the next day (28 April) her face had swollen and she had two black eyes. The appellant told TM that, if anyone came, she had to go to the room so that her face would not be seen. In cross examination TM said that she did not leave because the appellant had beforehand, as she had said in her evidence in chief, made threats concerning her family.  
     
      
    14 It was this detention that the Crown relied upon in support of the third count. The assault on the previous day which I have described constituted the second count to which, as already noted, the appellant pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    15 In fact, TM did see a visitor on that day, whom she asked not to tell the appellant of the visit because she, TM, was scared. That visitor (Jody R) gave evidence of the appearance of TM and that, in response to her suggestion that she accompany her away from the premises, TM had said “I can’t go, I’m too scared”.  
     
      
    16 It transpired that TM needed to fulfil a requirement to lodge some form in order to secure a social security payment and the appellant left the flat for the purpose of acquiring sunglasses so that TM could attend the relevant office and appear in public without attracting unwanted attention. She took the opportunity of his absence to flee the flat and she went to a police station where, unfortunately, she was offered no assistance. Following this denial of help, her sister and a friend came to her aid and then took her to a medical centre. 
     
      
    17 Later she went to another police station at Picton where she made detailed complaints of her treatment by the appellant. The content of her complaints were, on 1 May 1999, entered into a police data system (COPS).  
     
      
    18 The appellant had lodged four grounds of appeal. The grounds were couched in general terms without particulars, and submissions on behalf of the appellant, both written and oral, conveyed a wide range of complaints some of which it was difficult to comprehend within the grounds as expressed. These submissions should be dealt with in due course. 
     
      
    19 It is convenient to begin by dealing with grounds 1 and 2 together. They were expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The trial judge erred by giving inadequate and incorrect directions to the jury in respect of the admitted ‘relationship evidence’. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The trial judge erred to the extent that he admitted the ‘relationship evidence’.” 
        
       
      
    20 Logically, ground 2 must be addressed first. At trial counsel (who did not appear in the appeal) objected to what was described as “a whole history of alleged incidents of violence” by reference to paragraphs in a statement of the complainant dated 11 January 2003. The evidence which was actually tendered and admitted, demonstrative of the relationship between the appellant and TM, focussed upon five incidents. They should be identified. They constituted the “relationship evidence”. 
     
      
    21 In about February 1999 whilst TM was pregnant, she and the appellant were sharing a bath. He said that, if the baby was not his, he would kill both TM and the baby. They got out of the bath and he grasped her and pushed her against a wall and slapped her face. Her face was stinging and he obtained some frozen peas so that she could use it as a cold compress. TM said that he was good to her after this, expressing sorrow for what he had done.  
     
      
    22 The second incident took place after they had been at the Fairfield Hotel. They were at a table with friends of the appellant who were becoming rowdy as they were drinking. TM moved to a nearby table where she spoke to an older man about her pregnancy and he spoke to her about his grandchildren. The appellant then took TM to Skelsey’s nightclub which is also at Fairfield. In the car park the appellant remonstrated with TM for moving to the other table and speaking to the older man and he slapped her and called her a slut. She commenced to cry but nevertheless followed him into the club. 
     
      
    23 Still in early February 1999 they were on another occasion at the Tahmoor Inn. The appellant was playing pool and TM was seated nearby. A male acquaintance of TM stopped and spoke to her. The appellant apparently saw this, and after the man left, he asked her why she was being a slut. She denied she was so behaving and he placed his arm around her neck. She asked to be taken home. They went to a car and there he slapped her on the face. When they arrived home she told him that she no longer wished to be with him. He pushed her onto a lounge and sat on her. Thereafter he directed her to come to the car where the boot was opened and he pulled her by the hair and said he was going to show her a gun, which he was “not afraid to use”. She said that she believed this, however they went back inside without inspecting the content of the boot.  
     
      
    24 I interpolate that TM at about this time, ascertained that she had miscarried. In an explicit correction to something he had earlier said, Dodd DCJ directed the jury that there was no evidence that the incident described (sitting on TM) caused the miscarriage.  
     
      
    25 In March 1999 they were again at Skelsey’s nightclub. The appellant asked TM to get him a cigarette. When she returned he hit her in the face and enquired why she had been gone for so long. He flourished some metal knuckledusters and told her that he should use them on her because she had been “a slut”. 
     
      
    26 The fifth occurrence happened when TM was at the Liverpool premises on the occasion in mid April which I have mentioned. TM said she was going to get some water and the appellant said that she could not and thereupon he dragged her by the hair causing her head to strike part of an audio system. As a result she sustained a cut to her head. The appellant’s cousin, in whose premises they were, obtained a tea towel to use as a bandage. 
     
      
    27 There is ample authority that evidence of a prior course of conduct is admissible, not to prove uncharged offences, but to show the background of a relationship between an accused and an alleged victim, and to prevent unreality in inviting a jury to consider a charged offence in deceptive isolation: see R v Garner 1963 81 WN (NSW) 120 and cases referred to therein.  
     
      
    28 The five incidents above described fit comfortably into that category of admissible material. His Honour did not err in law in ruling the relationship evidence was admissible.  
     
      
    29 The thrust of objection at trial sought that his Honour rule that this evidence was unfairly prejudicial and that, as its prejudicial potential outweighed any probative value, his Honour ought reject the evidence for that reason.  
     
      
    30 As counsel for the appellant in the appeal has pointed out, there was no formal judgment on the objection but his Honour’s remarks clearly demonstrated that the objection had been overruled and this was understood by those present at the trial. 
     
      
    31 An extract from the transcript shows reference to the paragraphs of the statement eventually taken by police from TM in January 2003. The content elaborates the matters which I have sketched including the circumstances of what became count 2, to which the appellant pleaded guilty. It is significant to note that TM gave evidence about the “relationship” incidents which I have described and there was no cross examination challenging that testimony.  
     
      
    32 The argument on appeal was presented in a lengthy written submission supplemented by oral address. As I have said, it is not easy to attach all the argument to the grounds as articulated but I understand the essential complaints to be these:  
     
      
       
      (a) His Honour had ruled that the relationship evidence was admissible only on count 3; the Crown Prosecutor finally addressed on the basis that it was germane to both counts 1 and 3. Specifically the Crown Prosecutor contended that the relationship evidence could be used in proof of the lack of consent of TM which was a necessary element in the proof of count 1.  
       
      (b) In relation to count 3 his Honour invited the jury to use the relationship evidence as tendency evidence despite his earlier ruling to the contrary which led to the presentation of separate indictments in respect of offences committed against RA and TM.  
       
      (c) His Honour failed to correct the misuse of the relationship evidence in the Crown Prosecutor’s address.  
       
      (d) By the time of final direction his Honour had expanded his ruling from limiting the relationship evidence to count 3 to including its availability for consideration by the jury in respect of count 1 for the purpose of offering an available explanation as to why TM did not terminate the relationship at some earlier point than that at which she did, and, 
       
      (e) In any event, his Honour did not adequately direct the jury as to the limited use that could be made of the relationship evidence. 
       
      
    33 I will deal with the elements of contention in the context of those complaints. 
     
      
    34 The transcript of his Honour’s informal ruling on the objection includes these remarks to counsel (the references to paragraphs are, of course, to the statement which was used for reference in order to found the objection): 
     
      
       
        
        “I can see that it is extremely prejudicial, well I don’t know about extremely, it’s highly prejudicial but provided the evidence is led in an admissible form, I am of the view that what’s contained in paragraphs 4-33 as to violence inflicted on the complainant by the accused has significant and indeed possibly crucial probative value as to the third count in the indictment, such that the probative value is not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        And indeed it seems to me that the Crown case could not be properly presented on the third count in terms of what the accused meant the complainant to understand by saying to her when the police came to the door ‘stay there, don’t come out’. By saying to her after the police have left and the next morning ‘you can come into the lounge room, if anyone comes you have to go back to the bedroom’. 
        
       
       
        
        And what in fact the complainant understood him to mean by saying those things to her. And it seems to me that the inferences that the Crown will be asking the jury to draw, in order to the appropriate conclusion on the Crown case, will only be possible if the evidence of previous violence from the accused towards the complainant is put into evidence.  
        
       
       
        
        Now in relation to paragraphs 47-55 which are objected to, it seems to me first of all that what is contained in paragraphs 47-50 is in the same category 4-33.  
        
       
       
        
        In relation to paragraphs 51-55 I am of the view that that is admissible on two bases, first of all the same basis as the basis I have referred to in relation to paragraphs 4-33. And also on the basis that it explains how and why the complainant had resumed an association with the accused leading up to the events, the subject of the third count in the indictment.” 
        
       
      
    35 Although the final passage referred to matters “subject of the third count”, it was acknowledged in the written submissions that it might be “divined” that the relationship evidence was allowed in respect of count 1 to the extent that it explained TM’s failure to leave the relationship.  
     
      
    36 That was the way that it was ultimately left to the jury in a final direction which followed a specific exception taken on behalf of the appellant by his counsel. His Honour charged the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “The second thing that I should say to you and correct to a partial extent, make clear, is this: I referred to all that background material of violence to TM by the accused and threats of violence towards her as to being relevant to both counts. In relation to the first count however, it is relevant only in this sense that it explains on the Crown account, and it is the Crown account that I am talking about in terms of the asserted relevance, it explains on the Crown account why she didn’t leave the accused when perhaps we might think she should have left him. 
        
       
       
        
        It is an explanation in some ways I might say, that as the Crown had indicated is at odds with what you might think is a rational approach. Most of us would say if someone starts hitting us around the head, threatening us with violence and that kind of thing you’d leave straight away and would not tolerate it any longer. But as the Crown has pointed out things in real life are a bit more complicated than that unfortunately, especially for women in certain circumstances. There are women, I think as we all know who are vulnerable. 
        
       
       
        
        I say these things not to draw any conclusions about any aspect of the trial now before you but only to indicate that there can be women who unfortunately find themselves subjected to violence and nevertheless seemingly put up with it. Sometimes for long periods of time. That is what the Crown says is an element of this case in terms of the relationship between the two of them, in terms of T staying with him for some time. She was looking as she put it, for love and despite the violence and sometimes because of it she stayed with him and returned to him. 
        
       
       
        
        Is that fairly put Madam Crown?  
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, thank you, your Honour.  
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: (addresses counsel for the accused at trial). 
        
       
       
        
        COUNSEL FOR ACCUSED: Yes your Honour”. 
        
       
      
    37 Whilst examination of the transcript, it must be acknowledged, is capable of demonstrating some inconsistency in expression or, accepting counsel’s contention, a shifting of ground, whether intervention is called for is dependent upon demonstration of error in the way the evidence was left available to the jury for deliberation. 
     
      
    38 In summary, on count 3 the exposed facets of the relationship were germane to consideration of the issue of TM’s being detained by reason of her fear of what the appellant would do and on count 1 to explain why she did not leave the relationship. 
     
      
    39 The use of the relationship evidence in those fashions on those issues would not taint the jury’s deliberations. The ground asserts error “to the extent” that his Honour admitted the relationship evidence and the first complaint does not sustain that ground. 
     
      
    40 The second complaint focussed upon part of his Honour’s charge to the jury concerning the offence of detaining TM. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “…..the Crown says he did not lock her in but he nevertheless detained her by getting her to understand, firstly, that if she did not stay there, and in particular, stay in the room when he wanted her to, that he would force her to by inflicting physical violence upon her, or by restraining her. The Crown says that you would draw that inference that that was his intention from the words he used to her at the time, and it was his intention to convey that to her, that she was not free to leave by the words he used at the time, by the violence that he had inflicted upon her on the 27th by blackening her face, hitting her in the face repeatedly, breaking her nose, bloodying her face to the extent of requiring her to clean herself up, needing to clean himself up because there was blood on his clothes as well, and on his hands, and clean the blood off the walls, or wall. And the Crown says also that he had that intention and he conveyed that intention to her by that behaviour, in the context of previous behaviour that he had exhibited towards her, so that this incident, and these words were not in isolation, but against a background of his preparedness to use violence towards her, and to force her to do what he wanted to do, and against the background of threats. I will come to all of that evidence, shortly, as I say. 
        
       
       
        
        If you accept that those events, as background events, occurred and if you draw the inferences that the Crown asks you to draw, then I tell you that it is open to you to draw the conclusion that the accused did detain TM in the sense to which I have referred, as the Crown contends – that is, that it is not necessary, in order to find this element made out, that there be a locking in by lock and key necessarily and that a detaining in this sense can be effected by the behaviour or the actions and the words contended for by the Crown, provided you draw the inferences sought by the Crown as to the accused’s intention, and his intention to convey that to the complainant TM. 
        
       
       
        
        To make that clear again, the Crown contends that he, by his words and by his actions on that occasion, in the context of previous actions and words directed to TM intended that she stay in the unit unless he let her go, and he intended her to understand that”. 
        
       
      
    41 The appellant’s contention is that those directions convey a clear invitation, by the repeated references to previous behaviour, to use the evidence of the previous behaviour manifest in the relationship evidence to establish a tendency on the part of the appellant in proof of the issue of TM being detained by reason of her fear of him. 
     
      
    42 The submission treats the passage which I have extracted from his Honour’s summing up somewhat in isolation. Whether it conveyed the vice now complained of needs to be determined in a wider context. 
     
      
    43 Early in his charge to the jury he gave an emphatic direction forbidding tendency reasoning namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “You have heard the accused plead guilty to a charge earlier on of assault upon TM. You have heard evidence given of various incidents of assault and what most of us would regard as bad if not unlawful behaviour on various occasions towards TM by the accused and you have heard a certain amount of what I had described as bad language also used by the accused. Using a lot of bad language is still regarded by some people as very bad behaviour. You must not reason from that evidence of other incidents of either bad or unlawful behaviour, if you regard it in that way, to a conclusion that the accused is the kind of person likely to commit crime and then to the conclusion that he did commit these two crimes that you must consider. That would be quite wrong. 
        
       
       
        
        Any prejudice you have on those matters, you must put aside for the purposes of your consideration of these two charges. None of those matters which we might regard as very bad or unlawful behaviour can support a conclusion that the accused committed the crime with which he stands charged, just because it is very bad or unlawful behaviour. Insofar as it is relevant, I will come to explain how it is relevant when I consider the evidence in relation to the charges later. It would be totally unfair, however, to use any of those matters as indicators of guilt by the process of reasoning that I have just identified”. 
        
       
      
    44 Count 3 was charged in terms that the appellant detained TM: 
     
      
       
        
        “…..with intent to hold her in order to obtain an advantage, namely to conceal injuries which he had inflicted on her”. 
        
       
      
    45 The evidence of previous conduct of the appellant was available to the Crown, and for consideration by the jury, in proof of the necessary intention pleaded: see R v Atroushi [2001] NSWCCA 406.46 That the invitation to the jury was, if they saw fit, to use the relationship evidence in that way and not in a way which would contradict the explicit warning which he had given against tendency reasoning is manifest in his Honour’s directions as to the proof of count 3. 
     
      
    47 Virtually the last direction before the jury was asked to retire and consider their verdict was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “In respect of the third count, the detain for advantage count, you will not find the accused guilty unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant, TM, is telling the truth and accurately telling the truth when she says that she did not leave the premises because she feared that if she attempted to do so, the accused would seek to inflict physical violence upon her and in fact that it was the intention of the accused to have TM understand that, whether or not he would have actually inflicted physical violence upon her, but to have her believe that he would do so or that he possibly would do so if she attempted to leave.” 
        
       
      
    48 This is entirely consistent with the paragraph now sought to be impugned by the appellant, within which his Honour made reference to the appellant’s intention, explaining that it was not necessary that it be achieved by use of lock or key. It was in respect of that intention that the “context of previous actions” was left to the jury as being potentially relevant. 
     
      
    49 That what was said was understood in this way has implicit confirmation in the absence of complaint being raised at trial.  
     
      
    50 His Honour did not err by inviting the jury, in his references to previous behaviour to engage in tendency reasoning and the appellant’s contention in this regard should be rejected. 51 The third issue for examination relates to matters raised in the address of the Crown Prosecutor. It should be pointed out that, as the expression of grounds 1 and 2 impliedly recognize, the intervention of this Court may be attracted as a result of erroneous direction, ruling or failure to direct by the presiding judge. The remedy for complaint about the content of an opponent’s address is to make application to the presiding judge for an express correction or, if it is irreparable, for discharge of the jury. An inappropriate response to such application by a judge may give rise to a ground of appeal but there was no response by the judge to examine in this case because no application was made.  
     
      
    52 The remedies which I have mentioned do not exist to the exclusion of a capacity in any event of counsel to put contradictory contention to the jury. In this case it was counsel for the appellant who had the final address. 
     
      
    53 In any event, as the Crown submissions to this Court contend, the complaints advanced now are to an extent misconceived. 
     
      
    54 The first element of complaint inferred that, in observing that there was no challenge to the incidents of assault having occurred, the jury may have found consistency between TM’s evidence and the report on the COPS system recorded in May 1999. It was said that the prosecutor was, in effect, inviting a form of coincidence reasoning. 
     
      
    55 The separate trials (involving the different complainants) had followed his Honour’s ruling against the use of evidence in that way. In fact the Prosecutor’s address was not defying that ruling but drawing attention to circumstances which the jury might find useful when weighing the credibility of TM’s testimony. That was no inhibition upon the Prosecutor making such a submission. 
     
      
    56 The second element adverted to an expression in address that the appellant had been “using the complainant as a punching bag”. There is no legal impediment to the use by counsel of hyperbole, if the phrase may be so categorized. The submission to this Court that it “unnecessarily inflamed an otherwise highly toxic issue” might well fit within the same category of language. There was no call, as contended, for his Honour to “neutralize” counsel’s expression. 
     
      
    57 The appellant’s written submissions referred to a comment by the trial judge, in the absence of the jury, concerning the miscarried pregnancy which had occurred, at least as a matter of chronology, after the appellant had sat on TM. The jury were expressly directed that there was no evidence of causal link between those events. The exchange with counsel in the absence of the jury, now sought to be interpreted critically, is not a matter which would attract intervention by this Court. 
     
      
    58 In the final analysis, the judge responded to trial counsel’s request for explicit direction concerning the matter of relationship in respect of which both counsel acknowledged that his Honour had fairly put the issue. This acknowledgement was in the presence of the jury. It is now put by different counsel that what was put did not “cure” the earlier directions in that it did not make it clear that the jury could not use the evidence of violence in order to prove the sexual assault charged nor to negative the availability of tendency reasoning. 
     
      
    59 This submission ignores the context of the trial which, as I have mentioned, essentially involved the disproof of consent or, alternatively, the appellant’s belief in consent. The absence of complaint by trial counsel and, more emphatically express acknowledgment of the fairness of what was put by those who were in a position to gauge the atmosphere of the trial, is, in my view, of more convincing significance than ex post facto toothcombing of the transcript of the trial and the directions to the jury. 
     
      
    60 The fourth issue above described in effect complained of his Honour’s adoption of what had been addressed by the Crown Prosecutor and I have dealt with it in discussing the first issue canvassed on behalf of the appellant in support of these grounds. 
     
      
    61 As earlier mentioned, there was evidence that TM expressed fear about leaving the Liverpool premises. An issue was whether she was in fact detained. Her fear, and the reason for it, were relevant to this issue. 
     
      
    62 An analogy may be drawn from R v Preston unreported NSWCCA 9 April 1997 where there was an issue of consent to alleged forced sexual intercourse, and it was held that previous violent conduct of the offender was available to explain the state of the mind of the victim and why she did not, on the occasion, resist or call for help. The evidence of the previous conduct of the appellant was similarly germane to TM’s state of mind which led her not to leave the Liverpool premises until eventually the circumstances altered and she could avail herself of the opportunity.  
     
      
    63 The fifth identified issue is raised in the context of complaint that his Honour did not adequately warn the jury that they could not substitute evidence of the “relationship” activity for evidence of the specific offence charged nor could they reason that, because the appellant may have done something wrong on other occasions, he must have done so on the occasion relevant to the charge: cf R v Beserick 1993 30 NSWLR 510. 
     
      
    64 The question is whether directions were adequate. What he had said early in his charge to the jury is set out above. The terms were an explicit embargo upon the jury entertaining a course of reasoning such as is now suggested may have tainted the trial. I am unpersuaded that his Honour’s directions were inadequate. No doubt it would have been desirable to give such warning as the evidence was being adduced but the final direction was emphatic and unequivocal and the trial did not miscarry. 
     
      
    65 I would reject grounds 1 and 2. 
     
      
    66 Ground 3 contends that the trial judge erred in failing to give a direction to the jury in accordance with R v Murray 1987 11 NSWLR 12 concerning the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant. 
     
      
    67 It is apt to recall just what Lee J said in that case. It was: 
     
      
       
        
        “In all cases of serious crime it is customary for judges to stress where there is only one witness asserting the commission of the crime, the evidence of that witness must be scrutinized with great care before a conclusion is arrived at that a verdict of guilty should be brought in; but a direction of that kind does not of itself imply that the witness’s evidence is unreliable. There will be cases where failure to bring home to the jury the position of the uncorroborated witness will undoubtedly lead to the verdict being set aside. It is a different matter altogether from requiring a direction that it is unsafe to act on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant in a sex case”. 
        
       
      
    68 The complaint of the appellant concerns the absence of a direction by Dodd DCJ in terms that the jury should scrutinize the evidence of TM with great care. 
     
      
    69 In relation to the first count, he directed: 
     
      
       
        
        “You must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that her account of that, in terms of her lack of consent is accurate and true beyond reasonable doubt before you can convict the accused”. 
        
       
      
    70 In relation to the third count and both counts he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “You will not find the accused guilty unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant TM is telling the truth, and accurately telling the truth when she says that she did not leave the premises because she feared that if she attempted to do so the accused would seek to inflict physical violence on her and that in fact it was the intention of the accused to have TM understand that. Whether or not he would actually have inflicted physical violence upon her, but to have her believe that he would do so, and that he possibly could do so if she attempted to leave. 
        
       
       
        
        It is therefore essential, members of the jury, that you examine the evidence of the complainant, TM, carefully in respect of both counts”. 
        
       
      
    71 I would not draw any distinction between the words “examine carefully” and “carefully scrutinize”. They convey the same precaution. The submissions on behalf of the appellant overlook that the incantation “scrutinize with great care” was not used at trial in Murray and the appeal in that case was in fact dismissed.  
     
      
    72 There is no mandate to give a Murray direction, as Lee J’s expression that it was customary, shows. Nor is there, if following the custom, an obligation to use any formula of particular words or in particular to use the verb scrutinize. 
     
      
    73 The cautions given by his Honour were entirely adequate to the issues of the trial and ground 3 is not made out. 
     
      
    74 Ground 4 complains that the trial judge erred in not giving adequate directions in respect of the disadvantages faced by the appellant by reason of the delay in formal complaint and prosecution. 
     
      
    75 The events giving rise to the allegations occurred in March to April 1999. TM’s complaint to police was prompt as evidenced by the detailed entry on the COPS computer system on 1 May 1999. This, as I have related, follows her first attempt to seek help at a police station which was ignored.  
     
      
    76 It does appear that a formal statement was not taken by police until January 2003. The circumstances which led to this lapse of time were not explored. 
     
      
    77 Argument in support of the ground is sought to be derived from Longman v The Queen 1989 168 CLR 79 and the oft quoted passage in the joint judgment specifying the requirements of warning to a jury of the disadvantage to an accused which perhaps may not be apparent in possibly losing the means of testing the complainant’s allegations when there has been delay in prosecution. 
     
      
    78 It should be mentioned that in Longman the complainant was aged six and ten at the times of the alleged offences and aged thirty two when the allegations came to trial. The contrast in terms of bare effluxion of time is between nearly four years in the present case and at least twenty two years in Longman. 
     
      
    79 There was no issue raised at trial in the present case of an explicit disadvantage by reason of the effluxion of time. The occurrence of the act of anal penetration in count 1 was not disputed. The issue was consent. 
     
      
    80 The submissions by the appellant refer to a number of authorities where the need, or the absence of need, for a Longman direction has been discussed culminating in a contention that “it was incumbent on the trial judge to give the warning and explain how it could be relevant in the context of this case and at the very least to explain that the appellant was unable adequately to test and meet the evidence of the complainant”. 
     
      
    81 The context of the case was epitomized by the judge in the extracts I have referred to, namely the absence of consent on count 1 and the intention to instil and the apprehension of fear of physical violence on count 3. It is not surprising that neither counsel at trial nor in the appeal have been able to articulate how specifically the appellant was disadvantaged. 
     
      
    82 The appellant does not identify any precise mischief which ought to have been addressed. It does not establish this ground to incant the hypothetical disadvantages which may accrue to any accused when there is any delay. Obviously, the longer the delay, the greater the risk of an accused being actually affected. There is always an implicit consideration of degree of risk to which extent of delay is germane. Such consideration must be made in the context of the disputed issues in a particular case. 
     
      
    83 Rule 4 applies. It is stated that it cannot be said that there has been no miscarriage of justice. I disagree. The kernel of the submission is that the appellant was denied “the forensic weapons that reasonable contemporaneity provides” but that expression avoids coming to grips with the need to demonstrate something other than general hypothesis. His Honour’s task was to guide the jury in relation to the current case and not to lecture them on general legal propositions.  
     
      
    84 I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
    85 I turn to the applications for leave to appeal against sentence. As observed, the appellant stood for sentence for two groups of offences in which TM and RA, respectively, were the victims.  
     
      
    86 The facts concerning sexual intercourse without consent and detaining for advantage in which TM was the victim have been sketched above. The offence to which the appellant pleaded guilty arose out of the assault on 27 April at the Liverpool premises which preceded the arrival of the police investigating the car parking problem. 
     
      
    87 In his remarks on sentence the judge indicated the sentences that he would have imposed if the groups of offences against TM and RA were dealt with independently of each other. It is significant to observe the ancillary orders for concurrence, cumulation and commencement. 
     
      
    88 His Honour stated that he would have sentenced the appellant for the sexual intercourse without consent constituted by the anal penetration of TM to imprisonment for four years with a non parole period of three years and for each of the counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and detain for advantage to imprisonment for three years with a non parole period of one year six months, these two sentences to be concurrent with each other but cumulative upon the non parole element of the sentence for the firstmentioned offence. The effective sentence would therefore amount, as a matter of overall assessment, to imprisonment for six years with a non parole period of four years six months. 
     
      
    89 In imposing actual sentences his Honour specified fixed terms of three years imprisonment for each offence, the sentence on count 1 commencing on 18 December 2002 and the sentences on counts 2 and 3 both commencing on 18 December 2005. The result therefore was an overall fixed term of six years imprisonment which, whilst it is recognized that grant of parole is a matter for decision, offers a contrast between that six years of actual custody and the four years and six months of minimum custody which would have been the case if his Honour had applied his provisional sentence indication. It is to be borne in mind that the dates of commencement for the sentences imposed in respect of the offences committed on RA were in each case set at 18 December 2008, that is to say at the expiry of the full six years of the cumulated fixed terms imposed in respect of the offences against TM. 
     
      
    90 The first count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm committed against RA arose out of events on 10 August 2002 when the appellant was at her flat. A relationship between them had existed for about two months, she apparently believing that the appellant was a single man. An argument developed about a girlfriend of hers and the appellant pushed her face to the floor following which she went to a bathroom and saw her lip starting to swell. The appellant said that perhaps he should leave but on receiving her assent to this, he slapped her and she fell against a towel rail. He then dragged her by the hair into a bedroom, picked her up by the ears and threw her to a bed. During these events RA was crying and screaming. 
     
      
    91 All of the other offences committed upon RA occurred on 29 November 2002. On the previous evening RA and the appellant had been out together for dinner, but following events which are detailed in the remarks on sentence, the appellant left the flat and returned at about 4.30 am. Upon gaining entry to the flat and seeing indications that RA wanted him to leave, the appellant struck her on the side of the face causing some injury from which blood commenced to flow from her nose. 
     
      
    92 RA testified that she felt that she had blacked out near this point but when she became conscious that she was on the floor, in conduct somewhat similar to part of the conduct in August, the appellant picked her up by the hair and dragged her into a bedroom. The appellant commenced manually to throttle her. Her resistance became exhausted and she curled into a foetal position. She tried to access a mobile phone but the appellant stamped on it. 
     
      
    93 Later, a period of comparative calm existed and the appellant obtained a tea towel and ice which he applied about her face and head where RA said she was suffering pain. The foregoing relates to the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm to which the appellant pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    94 The calm did not last and the appellant commenced to molest RA sexually. Without detailing all the incidents, the appellant forcibly and successively penetrated RA’s vagina with his fingers, pushed her head into a position so as to have her fellate him and then penetrated her vagina and her anus successively with his penis. These four acts led to the charges of aggravated sexual assault without consent to which the appellant pleaded not guilty but was convicted by jury verdict. 
     
      
    95 As with the offences against TM, the judge indicated the sentences which he would have imposed if the offences against RA were dealt with independently. His actual impositions were the same as his provisional indications with the exception of that on the seventh count which related to the act of anal penetration. For the two offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm he set fixed terms of three years imprisonment; for the digital penetration offence a fixed term of one year imprisonment; for the act of fellatio to imprisonment of four years with a non parole period of three years and for the vaginal intercourse to four years imprisonment with a non parole period of three years. 
     
      
    96 For the seventh count he indicated a term of six years imprisonment with a non parole period of four years six months but in fact he imposed a sentence of six years imprisonment with a lesser non parole period of three years. 
     
      
    97 All six sentences, and non parole periods where fixed, were directed to commence, as I have said on 18 December 2008. 
     
      
    98 For both groups of offences the overall effective sentence amounted to twelve years imprisonment with a non parole period of nine years commencing on 18 December 2002. 
     
      
    99 It is submitted that this effective sentence was manifestly excessive. Attention was directed on behalf of the appellant to some specific factors. 
     
      
    100 In a somewhat oblique fashion it was said that the failure to have regard to the pleas of guilty (to three of the offences as detailed above) did not recognize the prospects of rehabilitation or strike a balance between objective seriousness of offences and the appellant’s subjective case. 
     
      
    101 The late pleas of guilty to limited counts in the indictments were held by his Honour to be neither of utilitarian value nor indicators of remorse. In my view those findings were well open upon the facts. It is not demonstrated that his Honour overlooked relevant subjective factors not all of which, it must be observed favour the appellant. His findings on subjective matters can be adopted and there is no need to pause to recite them. 
     
      
    102 The principal thrust of complaint is in two parts. First, that the head sentence of twelve years does not give proper reflection to the favourable subjective factors, and second, that there should be an adjustment of the proportion of the non parole period to that head sentence by reason of special circumstances. 
     
      
    103 There was an express finding by his Honour in the negative with reference to special circumstances. Despite that, if the setting of non parole periods is examined and it was limited to counts 5, 6 and 7 in the indictment concerning RA, the proportion does favour the appellant when gauged against the proportion mentioned in the statute. 
     
      
    104 Of course, overall, a minimum period of nine years before eligibility for parole against a head sentence of twelve years does exactly equate to the statutory proportion. 
     
      
    105 As his Honour recognized, there were matters capable of amounting to special circumstances, the extent of accumulation being one such circumstance. 
     
      
    106 However, there was no obligation to give reasons for not varying the statutory proportion.  
     
      
    107 Whilst respect should be paid to the views expressed in R v Hookey [2004] NSWCCA 223, the express authority of R v Simpson 2001 53 NSWLR 704 (where the Bench was constituted by five judges) represents binding authority that a judge is not obliged to give reasons for not departing from the statutory formula. His Honour is not shown to have fallen into error. 
     
      
    108 I do not need to dwell upon this matter as, for a reason to which I now turn, the appellant should receive some amelioration by a different route, of what I do not consider he should achieve otherwise. 
     
      
    109 I return to my observation that the actual impositions in respect of the offences against TM, in the sense of non parole period specification, exceeded his Honour’s provisional assessment. Had the latter been implemented, the sentences in respect of the offences against RA would commence at the end of the non parole period hypothesized for counts 2 and 3 in the TM matters, that is, from 7 June 2007 rather than 18 December 2008. Whilst in terms of proportion the adjustment may seem slight, the consequence for the appellant is a reduction of one year six months both in total term and minimum non parole period to be served. 
     
      
    110 Save adjustment, which I consider should take place, to reduce the term actually imposed to that which his Honour provisionally formulated, I consider the sentences imposed as well within the bounds of the sound exercise of discretion. It will be convenient in order to ensure clarity to restate the sentences. 
     
      
    111 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. The appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
      2. In each appeal, application for leave to appeal against sentence granted and appeal allowed in part. 
       
      3. Sentences imposed in the District Court quashed and in lieu therefore the appellant sentenced as follows: 
       
        
        (a) Upon the indictment in respect of which offences TM was the victim: 
         
          
          On count 1 (sexual intercourse without consent) – to imprisonment for a fixed term of three years commencing on 18 December 2002 and expiring on 17 December 2005; 
           
          On count 2 (assault occasioning actual bodily harm) – to imprisonment for three years commencing on 18 December 2005 and expiring on 17 December 2008 with a non parole period of one year six months commencing on 18 December 2005 and expiring on 17 June 2007 and, 
           
          On count 3 (detaining for advantage) – to imprisonment for three years commencing on 18 December 2005 and expiring on 17 December 2008 with a non parole period of one year six months commencing on 18 December 2005 and expiring on 17 June 2007. 
          
         
        (b) Upon the indictment in respect of which offences RA was the victim: 
         
          
          On count 1 (assault occasioning actual bodily harm) – to imprisonment for a fixed term of three years commencing on 18 June 2007 and expiring on 17 June 2010. 
           
          On count 2 (assault occasioning actual bodily harm) – to imprisonment for a fixed term of three years commencing on 18 June 2007 and expiring on 17 June 2010. 
           
          On count 4 (aggravated sexual intercourse without consent – digital penetration) to imprisonment for a fixed term of one year commencing on 18 June 2007 and expiring on 17 June 2008. 
           
          On count 5 (aggravated sexual intercourse without consent – fellatio) to imprisonment for four years commencing on 18 June 2007 and expiring on 17 June 2011 with a non parole period of three years commencing on 18 June 2007 and expiring on 17 June 2010. 
           
          On count 6 (aggravated sexual intercourse without consent – penile/vaginal penetration) – to imprisonment for four years commencing on 18 June 2007 and expiring on 17 June 2011 with a non parole period of three years commencing on 18 June 2007 and expiring on 17 June 2010. 
           
          On count 7 (aggravated sexual intercourse without consent – penile/anal penetration) – to imprisonment for six years commencing on 18 June 2007 and expiring on 17 June 2013 with a non parole period of three years commencing on 18 June 2007 and expiring on 17 June 2010.  
          
         
        
       
      4. Where non parole periods have not been set, the reason is stated that the sentences will be subsumed within or followed by other sentences. The extent of concurrency is reflected in the orders for sentence commencement. 
       
      5. The earliest date of eligibility for parole is specified as 17 June 2010. 
      
    112 JAMES J: I agree that for the reasons given by Grove J in his judgment the orders proposed by his Honour should be made. 
     
      
    113 As regards the first ground of appeal against conviction, that the trial judge erred in the directions he gave the jury about the evidence of previous acts of violence by the appellant against the complainant, I agree with Grove J that the trial judge did not err in directing the jury about the use to which the evidence of previous acts of violence could be put. The trial judge did not direct the jury that the evidence of previous acts of violence could be used, as evidence of a tendency on the part of the appellant, for the purpose of proving that on the occasion in question the appellant had, in accordance with that tendency, inflicted physical violence on the complainant. The use to which the trial judge directed the jury that the evidence of previous acts of violence could be put, was that the evidence of previous acts of violence could be used to prove relevant states of mind of the appellant and of the complainant on the occasion in question, namely that the appellant, in telling the complainant to remain in the premises, intended to convey to the complainant that, if she did not comply with his demand, he might inflict physical violence on her and that the complainant understood that that was what the appellant intended to convey and feared that, if she attempted to leave the premises, the appellant might inflict physical violence on her. If those states of mind were established, it would be open to the jury to find that the appellant had detained the complainant even though he had not physically restrained her. 
     
      
    114 SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of Grove J, with which I agree, and the additional remarks of James J, with which I also agree. 
     
      
    115 Prior to the commencement of the trials, there was lengthy debate about the admissibility of evidence of prior assaults upon the complainant that the then Crown Prosecutor sought to have admitted (compendiously) as “tendency and coincidence evidence”. In a judgment delivered on 11 May 2004, Dodd DCJ ruled that none of the evidence would be admitted on either basis. As a result of that ruling the Crown Prosecutor opted to present two separate indictments, and the trial concerning the allegations made by RA proceeded first, followed immediately by the trial in respect of the allegations made by TM. 
     
      
    116 Although the evidence presented as “relationship evidence” largely covered the same ground as the evidence previously sought to be relied upon as tendency and coincidence evidence, it was tendered, and admitted, on a different basis. The logic of, and the explanation for, that is covered in the judgment of Grove J. It was fully explained to the jury by the trial judge. The summing up cannot reasonably be read as traversing the earlier ruling. 
     
      
    117 I agree that the appeal against conviction ought to be dismissed. I agree with the orders proposed by Grove J in respect of the application for leave to appeal against sentence.

     Judgment 
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of McColl JA in draft. I agree with her Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    2 McColl JA sets out s 32 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (“the Act”). The structure of subs (1) turns on whether each of two matters “appears to the magistrate”, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) one of the three facts set out in s 32(1)(a); and  
         
         
        (ii) that “it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant” in the manner set out in s 32(1)(b). 
        
       
      
    3 The first part of the two-fold test set out in s 32(1)(a) was found to “appear to the magistrate” and nothing turns on that finding in this appeal. The magistrate concluded that it did not ‘appear’ to her Honour that it was more appropriate to deal with the Respondent under the Act within s 32(1)(b). 
     
      
    4 The formulation - “appears to the magistrate … that it would be more appropriate …” - is, in my opinion, similar in effect to the formulation that appears often in the case law as to whether or not a decision-maker is “satisfied” of a relevant matter. That was the structure of the legislation under consideration in Norbis v Norbis (1986) 161 CLR 513; Singer v Berghouse (1994) 181 CLR 201 and Coal & Allied Operations Pty Ltd v AIRC (2000) 203 CLR 194. Such a statutory provision can be accurately described as conferring “a very wide discretion”. (See Buck v Bavone (1976) 135 CLR 110 at 119.) 
     
      
    5 In my opinion the formulation of the judgment found in s 32(1)(b) is of a character to which the approach set out in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 applies. It may be that the finding of fact contained in s 32(1)(a) is more appropriately considered by invoking the principles reflected in Warren v Coombes (1979) 142 CLR 531. However, this matter does not arise in the present case. 
     
      
    6 I agree with McColl JA that Greg James J erred in concluding that the magistrate committed an error of law. In my opinion, her Honour made no error. In her ex tempore reasons she took into account considerations that made it less appropriate “to deal with” the Respondent under the Act: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) the seriousness of the alleged offences; 
         
         
        (ii) the fact that the alleged offences involved premeditation and planning and that the nature of the mental illness, involving lack of self-control, including impulsivity and an inability to plan, was not manifest on the occasion of the alleged offences. 
        
       
      
    7 In my opinion each of these matters was a relevant consideration. Determining what weight is to be given to them was a matter for her Honour. However, as Howie J said in Confos v Director of Public Prosecutions [2004] NSWSC 1159 at [17] the seriousness of the alleged offence is always a matter entitled to weight in formulating the judgment for which s 32(1)(b) calls. 
     
      
    8 Counsel for the Respondent suggested that it was not open to conclude that there was no causal relationship between the mental illness and the offence. In my opinion her Honour accurately set out the import of the psychologist’s report which suggested that inability to plan was a feature of the kind of condition she diagnosed. Her Honour was entitled to conclude that the alleged offences involved no impulsivity and, indeed, involved premeditation and planning. 
     
      
    9 Contrary to the findings of Greg James J, her Honour did not take into account any irrelevant considerations. 
     
      
    10 Furthermore, contrary to the findings of Greg James J, her Honour did not fail to take into account a relevant consideration, namely the existence and content of the treatment plan. Her Honour referred to the treatment plan. She was entitled to reject the proposition that the proposed course of treatment should receive significant weight in formulating the judgment for which s 32(1)(b) calls. 
     
      
    11 I agree with the orders proposed by McColl JA. 
     
      
    12 HANDLEY JA: I agree with McColl JA and with the additional reasons of the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    13 McCOLL JA: The Director of Public Prosecutions seeks leave to appeal from a decision of his Honour Greg James J holding that a Magistrate had erred in law in refusing to deal with Sami El Mawas pursuant to s 32 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (the “Act”): El Mawas v Director of Public Prosecutions [2005] NSWSC 243. Leave to appeal is required because the orders made by the primary judge were on an appeal pursuant to Pt 5 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001: s 101(2)(h) of the Supreme Court Act 1970. 
     
      
    14 Section 32 enables a Magistrate, in the circumstances it prescribes, to deal with persons suffering from a developmental disability, a mental illness or a mental condition who have been charged with a summary offence or an indictable offence triable summarily, otherwise than in accordance with law. 
     
      
    15 The case raises a question of general importance concerning the proper construction of s 32 warranting the grant of leave to appeal. 
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    16 Sami El Mawas, the respondent, is the defendant in summary criminal proceedings currently before the Local Court. He is charged with: 
     
      
       
      (a) malicious wounding (2 counts) (s 35,  
      Crimes Act  
      1900); 
       
       
      (b) assault occasioning actual bodily harm (2 counts) (s 59,  
      Crimes Act  
      1900); 
       
       
      (c) enter building/land with intent to commit indictable offence (s 114,  
      Crimes Act  
      1900); 
       
       
      (d) maliciously destroy or damage property (s 195,  
      Crimes Act  
      1900); and  
       
       
      (e) enter enclosed lands without lawful excuse (s 4, 
       Enclosed Lands Protection Act  
      1901). 
       
      
    17 The charges arose from incidents involving the respondent and his neighbour, Hai Tong Pham, on Sunday, 8 February 2004. The allegations against the respondents are set out in the appellant’s summary of argument as follows. It is alleged that in the early hours of 8 February, the respondent and Pham had an altercation, after which the respondent was taken to Liverpool Hospital for treatment (and for which Pham was charged with malicious wounding and released on bail). It is alleged that that evening, the respondent and two others, each armed with implements (the respondent with a steel tubular mop handle and the others with a steering lock and a broom handle) broke into the area outside Pham’s flat and confronted Pham and his friend Trang, the three men hitting Pham and Trang with their implements. Pham and Trang required treatment in hospital, including stiches to cuts on the head and neck, and each suffered swelling and bruising. 
     
      
    18 The respondent was arrested and taken to Bankstown police station, where it is alleged he said to police that “I told the doctor at Liverpool I would send him two Asians tonight … he called me a loser, so I said I will send them to him. I am a winner”.  
     
      
       
      The proceedings before the Magistrate 
       
      
    19 When the respondent’s matter came before Mottley LCM at Burwood Local Court on 30 June 2004 his solicitor sought an order that he be dealt with pursuant to s 32 of the Act.  
     
      
    20 The Police Prosecutor tendered the Police Facts which were, in substance, as I have outlined. The respondent’s solicitor tendered a report of Natasha Langovski, a Consultant Psychologist who had assessed the respondent on 29 March 2004. In addition to her meeting with the respondent, Ms Langovski had access to the Police Facts and a number of medical reports, including two from neurosurgeons and two from psychiatrists which dealt with the sequelae for the respondent of a “severe traumatic head injury” he had suffered whilst at work in October 1999. 
     
      
    21 The medical reports to which Ms Langovski had access apparently stated that the respondent would be “permanently impaired”. In Ms Langovski’s opinion, the behavioural, affective and cognitive difficulties described to her by the respondent were consistent with traumatic brain injury. She described him as having “problems in emotional control”, “executive dysfunction” (meaning impaired capacity for self-control and regulation), irritability, demonstrated disinhibition and impulsivity in his behaviour, leading to him behaving inappropriately and without self-modulation, inflexibility and depression. She opined that the respondent would require assistance “to generate strategies to manage his emotionality and executive dysfunction, thereby reducing the likelihood of him re-offending in future”. She suggested it might be useful for the respondent to return to the Brain Injury Rehabilitation team at Liverpool Hospital where it appears he had been treated previously. In a supplementary section, she suggested counselling and rehabilitation were methods by which the respondent could be treated.22 There was no dispute before the Magistrate that the respondent had an injury as detailed in the psychologist’s report, nor that the dysfunction from which he suffered was a “mental condition” as defined in s 3 of the Act.  
     
      
    23 The Police Prosecutor did not address the Magistrate in respect of the s 32 application. After hearing from the respondent’s solicitor, the Magistrate said: 
     
      
       
        
        “This is a very serious allegation. Two counts of malicious wounding and as I read the facts it is the position where Mr El Mawas had been assaulted and the person Sam had been charged with a malicious wounding of Mr El Mawas that had occurred the day before the incident subject to the section 32 application. Mr El Mawas is a person who satisfies the Court in relation to the first consideration under section 32. He is clearly a person who’s suffering from a mental condition. He’s suffering from a brain injury that has been acquired as a result of an accident and the report that’s been prepared by Natasha Langovski has set out the difficulties under which Mr El Mawas labours on a day to day basis and the changes that appear to have occurred in relation to his personality and his life since the acquiring of that brain injury.  
        She has, in her report, set out a suggested treatment plan. 
        
       
       
        
        I note that throughout Ms Langovski’s report she’s made a number of comments that have been made by Mr El Mawas to her as to the changes that he has experienced in himself and as Mr Hopper pointed out, in page 4 of the report, Mr El Mawas said ‘After the accident I am a different Sami. I am like a monster, like King Kong’. He made an account that he gets angry very easily and sometimes for no reason. Mr El Mawas went on to observe he’s aware of his lack of self-control and thereby engaged in arguments arising and as a consequence he says that he has no friends and his social visitors have dwindled. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Langovski commented that the symptoms described by Mr El Mawas during his assessment are more likely to be creating tension and stress within his family unit and as I’ve indicated she notes that these injuries are of a permanent nature. She goes on to say that Mr El Mawas has an impaired capacity for self-control and regulation. He demonstrates disinhibition and impulsivity in his behaviour and he often finds himself behaving inappropriately and without self-modulation. She further makes the observation that literature confirms that impaired self-control accounts for why many individuals with severe brain damage engage in aggressive behaviour. There is an inability to plan, recognise and choose alternatives in relation to any inappropriate behaviour.  
         
         
        I look at the facts in relation to the charge before the Court. This is not an unplanned operation. Mr El Mawas has gained access to the premises occupied by Fam* in the company of two others persons. He’s gone to those premises on the basis of these facts armed with a mop handle and he’s gone there with two other friends who, on premeditation and planning, not an  
        Act  
        of impulsivity. I note that the facts that have been presented suggest that the person Fam and Tran suffered significant injuries. Fam required four stitches to close wounds in his neck and scalp. Tran required stitches to close wounds sustained in his forehead and scalp. It’s noteworthy that Mr El Mawas was armed with a mop handle. One of the persons accompanying him was armed with a broom handle and the other with a silver coloured steering wheel lock. 
        
       
       
        
        In determining whether to deal with the matter under section 32 firstly the Court has to address whether the applicant is suffering from a mental condition and clearly Mr El Mawas does. The second condition that the Court has to be satisfied of is that the proceedings are such that it is appropriate to apply the provision of section 32. Undoubtedly Mr El Mawas is labouring under some difficulties and they relate to lack of self-control, they relate to impulsivity and aggressive behaviour. The facts that have been described certainly suggest that Mr El Mawas has engaged in aggressive behaviour but there’s no suggestion that his behaviour on this particular occasion lacked any thought and was an act 
          
        of passion or impulse. 
        
       
       
        
        in relation to the matter I’m of the view that the application of the provisions of section 32 to these proceedings is not appropriate and the application is refused.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
       
      *The references to “Fam” were a phonetic transcription of the name of one of the alleged victims of the offences with which the respondent was charged, Hai Tong Pham. 
       
      
    24 The respondent sought leave to appeal from the Magistrate’s decision. The Director of Public Prosecutions then took over the proceedings on behalf of the prosecution pursuant to s 9 and s 10 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986. 
     
      
       
      The primary judge 
       
      
    25 On 15 March 2005, the primary judge heard and determined in an ex tempore judgment, the respondent’s summons for leave to appeal under Pt 5 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001.  
     
      
    26 Section 53(3)(b) of that Act provides that “[a]ny person against whom … an interlocutory order has been made by a Local Court in relation to the person in summary proceedings, may appeal to the Supreme Court against the order, but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone, and only by leave of the Supreme Court”. The respondent’s summons proceeded on the basis that the Magistrate’s dismissal of the s 32 application constituted an interlocutory order within the meaning of s 53(3)(b). The appellant has not challenged that premise. In Confos v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2004] NSWSC 1159 (at [2]), Howie J opined, without deciding, that an order refusing to apply s 32 appeared to be an interlocutory order open to challenge pursuant to s 53(3)(b). I, too, will proceed on that basis.  
     
      
    27 The sole question before the primary judge, was whether the respondent had established that the Magistrate had erred on a basis involving “a question of law alone”. 28 His Honour held that the Magistrate’s ruling was tainted by the following errors which he characterised (at [53]) as errors of construction of s 32: 
     
      
      (a) failure to have regard “not only to the existence of the mental condition, but also to the prospect of treatment for it”: (at [46]); 
      (b) failure to consider (apparently by way of comparison) the appropriateness of proceeding by way of the usual criminal procedure and the appropriateness of proceeding by way of an order for treatment ([47]); 
      (c) erroneously considering that unless the features of the particular mental condition had a substantial causal relationship with the commission of the offence alleged, the application of the section would not be appropriate whether or not treatment might be afforded for the mental condition from which [the respondent] suffered…” (at [49]);(d) erroneously holding “that either the offence was too serious or that it was characterised by a degree of planning where the condition to which she had been referred was a condition itself mitigating against planning, so that the condition should not be seen to be causative of the crime, and that that rendered the matter inappropriate for the application of s 32” (at [52]); and /or(e) finding, in the absence of evidence, that the respondent’s offences were not related to his mental condition (at [59]). 
      
    29 The primary judge then considered the nature of the exercise a Magistrate undertakes when dealing with a s 32 application. He first extracted paras [16] - [18] in Howie J’s decision in Confos (the only decision in relation to s 32 to which the parties referred him) which state: 
     
      
       
        
        “16 It is clear that s 32 requires the Magistrate to make a discretionary judgment as to the appropriateness of proceedings under the section rather than under the general criminal law. But the section requires a Magistrate to arrive at a positive finding of f 
        act  
        before proceeding to deal with the defendant under the provisions of Part 3 of the  
        Act 
        . The Magistrate can only proceed under s 32(3) to dismiss the charge or discharge the defendant where, in accordance with s 32(1)(b), the Magistrate has determined that;  
         
         
          
          ‘…it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the Provisions of this Part than otherwise in accordance with law.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        17 In order to determine whether it is more appropriate to deal with the applicant under Part 3 the Magistrate has to perform a balancing exercise; weighing up, on one hand, the purposes of punishment and, on the other, the public interest in diverting the mentally disordered offender from the criminal justice system.  
        It is a discretionary judgment upon which reasonable minds may reach different conclusions in any particular case. But it is one that cannot be exercised properly without due regard being paid to the seriousness of the offending conduct for which the defendant is before the court. Clearly the more serious the offending, the more important will be the public interest in punishment being imposed for the protection of the community and the less likely will it be appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of the  
        Act 
        . 
         It should be emphasised that what is being balanced is two public interests, to some extent pulling in two different directions. It is not a matter of weighing the public interest in punishment as against the private interest of the defendant in rehabilitation. 
        
       
       
        
        18 Because the Magistrate’s jurisdiction under the  
        Act  
        involves a discretionary judgment, what weight is to be given to the various factors that touch upon that judgment will be very much a matter for the particular Magistrate. It would be very difficult, if not impossible, for a defendant to convince this Court to intervene in the exercise of that discretion simply on the basis that the Magistrate appeared to give more weight to one factor than another. As with any appeal against a discretionary judgment, the basis upon which this Court can intervene in the exercise of the power under s 32 is very limited. The question for this Court is whether the Magistrate failed, either actually or constructively, to exercise the discretion conferred on the court by the section.” (emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    30 The primary judge then said:  
     
      
       
        
        “54 I am not sure that, even with the greatest respect, I agree entirely with Howie J. I do not see that a discretionary judgment, in the strict sense, is made by the Magistrate. To my mind it is rather a value judgment concerning the appropriateness of dealing with the matter under one regime or another. The Magistrate does perform a balancing exercise, weighing up, on one hand, the purpose of the criminal process and sentencing, which now are defined by the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
        1999 and, in particular, s 32 of that  
        Act  
        and the purpose of the new procedure under s 32.  
         
         
        55 The purposes of sentencing of which s 32 speaks include deterrence, community protection, and rehabilitation as well as the other purposes therein set out, of which punishment is only one. The public interest to which Sec 32 relates, lies in diverting the mentally disordered offender from the criminal justice system into a system of treatment, which system has also as one of its objects, the protection of the community. But the modes of achieving the objects differ according to the precise nature and degree of any mental condition and the available treatment.  
         
         
        56 Howie J points out that the judgment that is made in those circumstances is one upon which reasonable minds may reach different conclusions in a particular case. I agree.  
        I agree that due regard must be paid to the seriousness of the offending conduct, as Howie J has referred to. But one should not exclude from consideration, when considering the seriousness of the offending conduct, the degree to which the defendant is disabled from being able to control that conduct by limiting consideration to the “seriousness of the offence”. 
          
         
         
        57 I do not see that the question of appropriateness is amenable to being decided by some short form test such as referring to “the more serious the offending, the more important will be the public interest in punishment”, not only because of the importance of treatment, but also because of the amplitude of s 32 of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
        1999.  
         
         
        58 I agree with Howie J that it is the protection of the community with which one is concerned. I do not agree that that renders it less likely in more serious cases, that it will be appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of the  
        Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act  
        1990. To my mind, the provision for treatment there recognises the concept of protection of the community by the provision of treatment. What weight is given to the various factors that touch upon the Magistrate’s judgment is a matter for the particular Magistrate.  
         
         
        59 What policy considerations should properly be applied are dictated by the particular circumstances of the individual cases, and the principles to be applied - see  
        Norbis v Norbis 
         (1986) 161 CLR 513, but it does seem to me that, where a Magistrate failed to have regard to the purposes of treatment and concluded, on a factual basis apparently not at all established by the material before the Magistrate, that the offence did not seem to relate to the condition, that the Magistrate has incorrectly construed the ambit and purpose of the section.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
       
      
    31 His Honour granted the respondent leave to appeal, allowed the appeal and remitted the matter to the Local Court for determination conformably with his reasons.  
     
      
       
      Submissions on appeal 
       
      
    32 Mr D Howard SC, who appeared for the appellant on appeal, but not below contended that the primary judge erred in identifying appealable error in the decision of the Magistrate and applied a test that unduly constrains the wide discretion conferred by s 32 of the Act. 
     
      
    33 He submitted that the primary judge erred both as a matter of general principle and, too, in several of his factual conclusions. Dealing first with matters of principle, he argued that Howie J correctly formulated the manner in which s 32 applications should be determined: Confos at [17]. He also submitted that Howie J was not, as the primary judge suggested (at ([57]), stating a “short form test” to answer each s 32 application but, rather, was enunciating a principle which could be taken into account in the exercise of the s 32 discretion. 
     
      
    34 Turning to the matters of fact, the appellant submitted that, contrary to the primary judge’s conclusion (at [46]), the Magistrate did have regard to the prospect of treatment of the mental condition from which the respondent was suffering, pointing out that the Magistrate referred to the suggested treatment plan in her reasons. The appellant submitted that the primary judge’s identification of error in this respect involved an unduly strict approach to ex tempore reasons, notwithstanding that his Honour said he was permitting the Magistrate a degree of latitude in the circumstances: judgment at [45] – [46]. 
     
      
    35 The appellant submitted that the same strict approach to the Magistrate’s reasons infected the primary judge’s finding that the Magistrate erred in concluding that unless the mental condition from which the respondent was suffering had a substantial causal relationship with the commission of the offences with which he was charged, it would not be appropriate to apply s 32. The appellant submitted that the passages in the Magistrate’s reasons which his Honour criticised were, in fact, no more than an available inference that the respondent’s violent conduct on this occasion was not outside his conscious control, but, rather, was a planned retaliation. The appellant submitted that it could not be an error for a Magistrate to examine the facts of the alleged offences and draw rational conclusions about the respondent’s state of mind. Nor, the appellant submitted, could it be an error where the respondent’s mental condition included “problems” of inappropriate impulsive behaviour for the Magistrate to comment that the facts alleged were not, in her view, of that quality. 
     
      
    36 The appellant next contended that to the extent the primary judge appeared be critical (at [52]) of the Magistrate’s consideration of the seriousness of the offence, or her apparent conclusion that there was not a relevant relationship between the mental condition and the offences by reason of the premeditated nature of the offences, it could not be doubted that it was incumbent upon the Magistrate to consider the seriousness of the offence. He also argued, it was legitimate for the Magistrate not to be satisfied that there was a relationship between the respondent’s mental condition and the offences. 37 The appellant finally submitted that on a proper reading of the Magistrate’s reasons while she properly referred, as a relevant factor, to the conclusion she drew that the respondent’s offences were not related to his mental condition, she had not (although she could have) on a proper reading of her reasons, given that consideration determinative weight. 
     
      
    38 Mr A Haesler SC who appeared for the respondent on appeal, but not below, submitted that the primary judge did not err, had proper regard to the relevant legislation and correctly identified and dealt with the errors of law on the part of the Magistrate. 
     
      
    39 He contended that the primary judge was correct not to follow Confos. He submitted that s 32 does not require the exercise of discretion (cf Confos at [16]) but, rather, after the initial preconditions are met, requires a judgment between two alternatives: whether the defendant should be dealt with according to Pt 3 of the Act or in accordance with law. 
     
      
    40 He argued that s 32 should not be constrained by a test which focuses on the seriousness of the offence and that the diversionary regime identified in s 32 should be available to serious offenders as long as it is more appropriate than the alternative. 
     
      
    41 Mr Haesler also contended that s 32 does not require a balancing of the purposes of punishment against the public interest in diversion and submitted that, in this regard, Howie J erred in his approach to the section. Significantly, he contended that adopting the diversionary alternative available in the Act did not mean a defendant escaped “punishment”, pointing out that although not characterised as “punishment”, an order under either subs 32(2) or 32(3) can substantially limit a person’s freedom and curtail their liberty. In this context he also observed that a defendant who is diverted from being dealt with at law pursuant to s 32, loses the opportunity of pleading not guilty and having the prosecution prove their guilt. 42 The respondent next submitted that the fundamental rationale of the Act, like all criminal justice legislation, was the protection of the community. This was recognised by the provision of treatment rather than the engagement of the criminal justice process. While the respondent accepted that the weight to be given to the various factors remained a matter for the particular Magistrate, he contended it was incumbent upon the Magistrate to properly construe and apply the section to the relevant evidence. 
     
      
    43 In this case, the respondent submitted, the primary judge had correctly identified the Magistrate’s errors. He argued the Magistrate was plainly in error in forming the view that the respondent’s offences were not related to his mental condition. He drew attention to the passage in the psychologist’s report which concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “An impaired ability to control his behaviour and regulate his emotions seem to have landed him in his current predicament. These impairments are the direct result of his severe acquired brain injury.” 
        
       
      
    44 The respondent submitted that the Magistrate’s conclusion that there was no relevant relationship between the offences with which he was charged and his mental condition was an error of law, as I understand this submission, because there was no evidence to that effect and there was clear evidence to the contrary.  
     
      
    45 The respondent accepted that the Act provides only limited guidance as to how that decision is to be made, such guidance as there is coming from the options in subs 32(2) and 32(3) and, apparently, from the Magistrate’s presumed knowledge of what might happen if the matter were to be dealt with in accordance with law. He submitted that “obviously if the options available in subs 32(2) and 32 (3) such as conditional release or discharge into care can properly and confidently be applied to the defendant, then that course will often be more appropriate than the alternative.”  
     
      
    46 Mr Haesler contended that there are sound public policy reasons why it is preferable that the intellectually disabled, the mentally ill or those suffering mental conditions for which treatment is available not be dealt with in accordance with law. He contended that diversion is more appropriate in many cases because of the public interest in a person with a mental condition, illness or disability obtaining appropriate care and treatment, the recognition that gaols are inappropriate places “to warehouse such people”, the difficulties such people have in participating fairly and meaningfully in criminal justice proceedings, that “proceeding in accordance with law” may lead to a result similar to that available under Pt 3 as such people “are not suitable vehicles for condign punishment” and that “at the end of the process their right to a fair trial and to gain an acquittal may be compromised.” 
     
      
      Legislative framework 
      
    47 Characterising the exercise in which the Magistrate was engaged turns on an analysis of the context, general purpose and policy of s 32: Commissioner for Railways (NSW) v Agalianos [1955] HCA 27; (1955) 92 CLR 390 at 397 Dixon CJ; Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [69] - [71]. 
     
      
    48 The long title of the Act is “an Act with respect to criminal proceedings involving persons affected by mental illness and other mental conditions.” Part 2 applies to criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court (including criminal proceedings when the summary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court) and in the District Court: s 4. It deals with the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence, how that issue is determined and consequential proceedings that do not require consideration. Part 3 applies to criminal proceedings in respect of summary offences or indictable offences triable summarily, being proceedings before a Magistrate, including any related proceedings under the Bail Act 1978, but not to committal proceedings: s 31(1).  
     
      
    49 Section 32, which appears in Pt 3, provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “32  
        Persons suffering from mental illness or condition 
          
        (1) If, at the commencement or at any time during the course of the hearing of proceedings before a Magistrate, it appears to the Magistrate:  
        (a) that the defendant is:  
         
          
           
            
            (i) developmentally disabled, or  
            (ii) suffering from mental illness, or  
            (iii) suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital,  
            
           
          but is not a mentally ill person within the meaning of Chapter 3 of the  
          Mental Health Act  
          1990, and  
          (b) that, on an outline of the facts alleged in the proceedings or such other evidence as the Magistrate may consider relevant, it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of this Part than otherwise in accordance with law,  
          the Magistrate may take the action set out in subsection (2) or (3).  
          
         
        
        
        (2) The Magistrate may do any one or more of the following:  
         
          
          (a) adjourn the proceedings,  
          (b) grant the defendant bail in accordance with the Bail Act 1978 ,  
          (c) make any other order that the Magistrate considers appropriate.  
          
         
        (3) The Magistrate may make an order dismissing the charge and discharge the defendant:  
         
          
          (a) into the care of a responsible person, unconditionally or subject to conditions, or  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) on the condition that the defendant attend on a person or at a place specified by the Magistrate for assessment of the defendant’s mental condition or treatment or both, or  
          (c) unconditionally.  
          
         
        (3A) If a Magistrate suspects that a defendant subject to an order under subsection (3) may have failed to comply with a condition under that subsection, the Magistrate may, within 6 months of the order being made, call on the defendant to appear before the Magistrate.  
        (3B) If the defendant fails to appear, the Magistrate may:  
         
          
          (a) issue a warrant for the defendant’s arrest, or  
          (b) authorise an authorised justice within the meaning of the Search Warrants Act 1985 to issue a warrant for the defendant’s arrest.  
          
         
        (3C) If, however, at the time the Magistrate proposes to call on a defendant referred to in subsection (3A) to appear before the Magistrate, the Magistrate is satisfied that the location of the defendant is unknown, the Magistrate may immediately:  
        (a) issue a warrant for the defendant’s arrest, or  
         
          
          (b) authorise an authorised justice within the meaning of the  
          Search Warrants Act  
          1985 to issue a warrant for the defendant’s arrest.  
          
         
        (3D) If a Magistrate discharges a defendant subject to a condition under subsection (3), and the defendant fails to comply with the condition within 6 months of the discharge, the Magistrate may deal with the charge as if the defendant had not been discharged.  
        (4) A decision under this section to dismiss charges against a defendant does not constitute a finding that the charges against the defendant are proven or otherwise.  
        (5) The regulations may prescribe the form of an order under this section.” 
        
       
       
      “Mental condition” means a condition of disability of mind not including either mental illness or developmental disability of mind: s 3. 
       
      
    50 Section 33 prescribes the steps a Magistrate, or an authorised officer within the meaning of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, may take if it appears at any time during the course of a hearing that the defendant is a mentally ill person within the meaning of s 3 of the Mental Health Act 1990. It is unnecessary to detail the steps. It is sufficient to note that a wide range of options is available. 
     
      
    51 If a Magistrate has inquired into whether a defendant should be dealt with under either s 32 of s 33 and decided not to do so, the Magistrate must disqualify himself or herself from further hearing the proceedings on the defendant’s application: s 34(1). 
     
      
    52 For the purposes of Pt 3, a Magistrate may inform himself or herself as the Magistrate thinks fit, but not so as to require a defendant to incriminate himself or herself: s 36. 53 The Act re-enacted provisions relating to proceedings involving persons affected by mental illness and other mental conditions previously contained in Pts 11A and 11B of the Crimes Act 1900 with appropriate amendments consequential upon the drafting of the Mental Health Act 1990: Second Reading Speech, Minister for Health, the Hon P Collins MLA, NSW Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) 22 March 1990 at 892-893. 
     
      
    54 Parts 11A and 11B were inserted in the Crimes Act 1900 as part of the substantial reforms of the law relating to the mentally disabled effected in 1983: see The Protective Commissioner v “D” & Ors [2004] NSWCA 216; (2004) 60 NSWLR 513 at [90] ff. The Second Reading Speech to the Bills which formed part of the 1983 reforms cast little light on the purpose of s 428W, the substantive precursor of s 32, save that it was described in explanatory notes in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “428W. Provides the Magistrate with a range of options for dealing with persons who, in proceedings before the Magistrate, appear to the Magistrate to be developmentally disabled or mentally disordered but who are not mentally ill persons within the meaning of the  
        Mental Health Act 
        , 1983.” 
        
       
       
      See New South Wales Legislative Assembly,  
      Parliamentary Debates 
      , (Hansard), 22 November 1983 at 3112. 
       
      
    55 The Act was introduced in 1990 as a cognate bill to the Mental Health Bill which became the Mental Health Act 1990. 
     
      
    56 In R v Mailes [2001] NSWCCA 155; (2001) 53 NSWLR 251 (at [108]) Wood CJ at CL (with whom Spigelman CJ and James J agreed) observed that it was proper to have regard to both the Mental Health Act 1990 and the Act for the purpose of construing expressions used in either of them because they formed part of a scheme of legislation, were introduced together and assented to on the same day. 
     
      
    57 It is appropriate, in that light, to observe that when introducing the legislation, the Minister for Health, the Hon P Collins, MLA said the Mental Health Bill would:  
     
      
       
        
        “… provide the opportunity for those suffering from a mental illness or a mental disorder to get the care and treatment they need. The primary objective of this treatment will be to ensure that the individual can have as normal and satisfying a life as possible. This should ensure that the community is protected adequately from abnormal or threatening conduct of a mentally ill or mentally disordered person.  
         
         
        At the same time the Bill protects the civil liberties of the mentally ill. Any restriction of personal freedom will be only the minimum necessary for the well-being of the individual or for the protection of others.” 
        
       
       
      See New South Wales Legislative Assembly,  
      Parliamentary Debates 
       (Hansard) 22 March 1990 at 886. 
       
      
    58 After referring to the two cognate bills, the Miscellaneous Act (Mental Health) Repeal and Amendment Bill and the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Bill, the Minister continued (New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) 22 March 1990 at 893): 
     
      
       
        
        “This legislation is intended to provide clarification of, and real guidance in solving, the confusing and complex problems that abound in the mental health area. The Bills will ensure ready access to appropriate treatment … this legislation … will improve the treatment of the mentally ill in our community and will assist to remove the stigma that attaches to them.” 
        
       
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    59 There has been little judicial consideration of s 32 or its precursor. 
     
      
    60 In Minister for Corrective Services v Harris & Anor (Supreme Court of New South Wales, unreported, 10 July 1987) Brownie J held that s 428W did not enable a Magistrate to make an order binding the Crown to provide particular services or facilities. At that time s 428W, as amended by the Crimes (Mental Illness) Amendment Act 1986, provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “428W. (1) Where, at the commencement or at any time during the course of the hearing of proceedings before a Magistrate, it appears to the Magistrate — 
         
          
          (a) that the defendant is developmentally disabled, is suffering from a mental illness or is suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital, but is not a mentally ill person within the meaning of the  
          Mental Health Act 
          , 1958; and  
          (b) that, on an outline of the facts alleged in the proceedings or such other evidence as the Magistrate may consider relevant, it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter than otherwise in accordance with law, 
          
         
        the Magistrate — 
         
          
          (c) may dismiss the charge and discharge the defendant — 
           
            
            (i) into the care of a responsible person, unconditionally or subject to conditions; 
            (ii) upon the condition that the defendant attend upon a person or at a place specified by the Magistrate for assessment of the defendant's mental condition or treatment, or both; or 
            (iii) unconditionally; or 
            
           
          (d) may do any one or more of the following: 
           
            
            (i) adjourn the proceedings; 
            (ii) grant the defendant bail in accordance with the Bail Act 1978; 
            (iii) make any other order that the Magistrate considers appropriate. 
            
           
          
         
        (2) A decision under subsection (1)(c) to dismiss charges against a defendant does not constitute a finding that the charges against the defendant are proven or otherwise.” 
        
       
      
    61 Brownie J was of the opinion that s 428W(d) related to orders which might be made at interlocutory stage, whereas s 428W(c) related to orders which might be made upon the final disposition of the proceedings. His Honour thought it was curious in that light that the drafter of the legislation had chosen to put subs (c) and (d) of s 428W in the order in which they appeared but, nevertheless, thought their effect was as I have stated. It will be noted that in s 32, subs (2) and (3) reverse the order of subs (c) and (d). 
     
      
    62 Section 428W was next considered in Mackie v Hunt & Anor (1989) 19 NSWLR 130 in which M Campbell J held (at 134) that it applied to a defendant who satisfied the criteria referred to in subs (1)(a) whether or not that person was unfit to be tried and without first determining that that was the situation. His Honour described s 428W (at 135) as a diversionary measure. 63 Apart from Confos and the instant case, Perry v Forbes & Anor (Supreme Court of New South Wales, unreported, 21 May 1993) appears to be the only other occasion s 32 has been considered. In Perry, Smart J described the Act as endeavouring “to introduce a more flexible scheme which recognises the variety of mental states which may exist and to overcome some of the rigidity which had previously existed” referring, it appears, to the position of persons affected by mental illness and other mental conditions who are the subject of criminal proceedings. His Honour accepted, as correct, a submission in that case by the plaintiff (the defendant in the summary criminal proceedings) that Pt 3 of the Act operated whether or not a plea had been entered and (following Mackie v Hunt & Anor) whether or not a defendant was fit to plead. His Honour also accepted, in a passage upon which the appellant relies, that it was appropriate for a Magistrate to have regard to the seriousness of the offence when considering whether to proceed under s 32.64 The primary judge was critical of Howie J’s characterisation of the s 32 exercise as involving a discretionary judgment. He characterised the s 32 decision as “a value judgment”, intending, it appears, to indicate the decision involved a normative judgment: see Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan [2002] HCA 54 at [49] per Gleeson CJ. At one level, with respect, his Honour was not drawing a true distinction for, as Spigelman CJ observed in Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd v Albert and Rose Khoshaba [2006] NSWCA 41 at [35]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The word ‘discretion’ is often deployed loosely in legal discourse … it is sometimes suggested that any decisions involving a value judgment on which reasonable minds may differ is a discretionary judgment (e.g.  
        Norbis v Norbis 
         at 518, 540;  
        Russo v Aiello 
         (2003) 215 CLR 643 at [27]. However, the contrary view has also been strongly advanced. (See  
        Buller v Black 
         (2003) 56 NSWLR 425 at [37]-[38], [96];  
        Blackburn v Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd 
         (2004) 61 NSWLR 632 at 634 [2]-[4];  
        Figliuzzi v Yonan 
         [2005] NSWCA 290 at [31]-[36], [67]-[68].)” 
        
       
      
    65 Norbis v Norbis [1966] HCA 17;(1986) 161 CLR 513 concerned the scope of appellate review of a decision made pursuant to s 79 of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) concerning the alteration of the interests of parties to a marriage. It was accepted that making orders under s 79 involved the exercise of a judicial discretion (see 517). In the course of discussing the scope of appellate review of such a decision, Mason and Deane JJ explained the distinction between discretionary decisions and those based on normative judgments. Their Honours said (at 518, footnotes omitted): 
     
      
       
        
        “The sense in which the terms ‘discretion’ and ‘principle’ are used in these remarks needs some explanation ‘Discretion signifies a number of different legal concepts: see, eg, the discussion in Pattenden,  
        The Judge, Discretion, and the Criminal Trial 
         (1982), pp 3-10. Here the order is discretionary because it depends on the application of a very general standard -- what is ‘just and equitable’ -- which calls for an overall assessment in the light of the factors mentioned in s 79(4), each of which in turn calls for an assessment of circumstances. Because these assessments call for value judgments in respect of which there is room for reasonable differences of opinion, no particular opinion being uniquely right, the making of the order involves the exercise of a judicial discretion. The contrast is with an order the making of which is dictated by the application of a fixed rule to the facts on which its operation depends.  
        
       
      
    66 In Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2000] HCA 47; (2000) 203 CLR 194 Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Hayne JJ said (at [19]):  
     
      
       
        
        “ ‘Discretion’ is a notion that signifies a number of different legal concepts’. ( 
        Norbis v Norbis  
        (1986) 161 CLR 513 at 518; 65 ALR 12 at 14; 10 Fam LR 819 at 821 per Mason and Deane JJ. In general terms, it refers to a decision-making process in which ‘no one [consideration] and no combination of [considerations] is necessarily determinative of the result’. ( 
        Jago v District Court (NSW)  
        (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 76; 87 ALR 577 at 615 per Gaudron J). Rather, the decision-maker is allowed some latitude as to the choice of the decision to be made. (See  
        Jago; 
          
        Russo v Russo 
         [1953] VLR 57 at 62 per Sholl J; see also Pattenden,  
        Judicial Discretion and Criminal Litigation 
        , 2nd ed, 1990, pp 5–6). The latitude may be considerable as, for example, where the relevant considerations are confined only by the subject matter and object of the legislation which confers the discretion. ( 
        Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission (NSW) v Browning 
         (1947) 74 CLR 492 at 504–5 per Dixon J;  
        R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; Ex parte 2HD Pty Ltd  
        (1979) 144 CLR 45 at 49; 27 ALR 321 at 325). On the other hand, it may be quite narrow where, for example, the decision-maker is required to make a particular decision if he or she forms a particular opinion or value judgment.” 
        
       
      
    67 They held (at [20] – [21], [28]) that a decision under s 170MW of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) to terminate a bargaining period made by reference to the facts and circumstances attending industrial action taken in support of claims with respect to a certified agreement and the threat that action posed, as to which a judge had to be satisfied, involved a measure of subjectivity or value judgment and “[i]n a broad sense” could be described as “a discretionary decision.” Accordingly, because “a decision-maker charged with the making of a discretionary decision has some latitude as to the decision to be made, the correctness of the decision [could] only be challenged by showing error in the decision-making process” – the errors being of the nature of those described in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505, per Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ.  
     
      
    68 In Russo v Aiello [2003] HCA 53; (2003) 215 CLR 643 at [27], McHugh J described the question whether, pursuant to s 43A(7) of the Motor Accidents Act 1988, an applicant for extension of a limitation period had a “full and satisfactory explanation” for delay as “an intellectual construct involving a value judgment, … on which reasonable persons may have widely differing views … [and is] therefore properly described as a discretionary judgment.” Accordingly a primary judge’s decision on the issue could only be set aside in accordance with the principles concerning an appeal against a discretionary judgment. Kirby J (at [111]) also appeared to regard the issue as involving the exercise of a discretion. 69 In contrast, as Spigelman CJ observed in Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd v Albert and Rose Khoshaba, in this Court the s 43A(7) exercise has been characterised as involving a normative judgment (see Buller v Black [2003] NSWCA 45; (2003) 56 NSWLR 425 at [39] per Mason P; at [96] per Giles JA (with whom Ipp JA agreed); Blackburn v Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd [2004] NSWCA 385; (2004) 61 NSWLR 632 at [2] - [4] per Mason P, adhering to the view he had expressed in Buller and disagreeing with McHugh J’s analysis in Russo v Aiello). 
     
      
    70 As can be seen there is no bright line rule demarcating discretionary and normative judgments. By way of final illustration, in Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd v Albert and Rose Khoshaba (at [34], [40]) Spigelman CJ concluded that the inquiry pursuant to s 7(1) of the Contracts Review Act 1980 as to whether a contract or a provision of a contract was “unjust in the circumstances relating to the contract at the time it was made”, involved “a finding of fact, albeit one involving a broadly based value judgment”.  
     
      
      Decision 
       
      
    71 Part 3 of the Act requires a Magistrate to balance the public interest in those charged with a criminal offence facing the full weight of the law against the public interest in treating, or regulating to the greatest extent practical, the conduct of individuals suffering from any of the mental conditions referred to in s 32(1) or mental illness (s 33) with the object of ensuring that the community is protected from the conduct of such persons. 
     
      
    72 As Spigelman CJ (with whom Simpson J and Blanch AJ agreed) said in R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [21], the significance of mental illness of an offender in the sentencing exercise has long been accepted. Pt 3 is clearly intended to permit the Magistrate, if it is appropriate, to divert a defendant from being exposed to sentence, with his or her mental condition being taken into account at that comparatively late stage. I agree with M Campbell J, therefore, that s 32 is a diversionary measure.  
     
      
    73 I accept Mr Haesler’s submission that adopting the diversionary route does not mean that a defendant is not exposed to punishment. While an order under s 32(3) is not custodial in the strict sense, it may involve the imposition of conditions restricting a discharged defendant’s freedom of movement and actions. Compliance with those conditions is ensured by the Magistrate retaining a supervisory jurisdiction for 6 months after a s 32(3) order is made: subs 32(3A)-(3D). 
     
      
    74 In exercising the Pt 3 jurisdiction, the Magistrate is given powers of an inquisitorial or administrative nature to inform herself or himself as the Magistrate thinks fit: s 36. That power, which would clearly have to be exercised in accordance with procedural fairness requirements, demonstrates the breadth of the inquiry a Magistrate is entitled to undertake in determining whether to send a defendant along the diversionary route, or leave him or her to be dealt with in accordance with law. 75 When one turns to s 32 it can be seen it requires the Magistrate to make at least three decisions. The first is to determine, in accordance with s 32(1)(a), whether the defendant is eligible to be dealt with under that section. That question clearly involves a finding of fact and is properly described as the jurisdictional question: see Singer v Berghouse (No 2) [1994] HCA 40;(1994) 181 CLR 201 at 208-209.76 The Magistrate must next determine whether, having regard to the facts alleged in the proceedings or such other evidence as the Magistrate may consider relevant (including presumably any information the Magistrate has garnered under s 36), “it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of this Part than otherwise in accordance with law. That decision clearly calls for the exercise of subjectivity or value judgments in which “…‘no one [consideration] and no combination of [considerations] is necessarily determinative of the result’ ”: Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd v Australian Industrial Relations Commission at [19]. In my view, as Howie J concluded in Confos, it involves a discretionary decision in which the Magistrate is permitted latitude as to the decision which might be made, a latitude confined only by the subject matter and object of the Act: Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd v Australian Industrial Relations Commission (at [19]).77 I do not, with respect to the primary judge, regard Howie J as having circumscribed the discretionary judgment exercised at the second stage of the s 32 inquiry. In Confos the Magistrate had rejected an application to deal with the defendant pursuant to s 32 because she concluded that notwithstanding the defendant’s mental condition the offences with which he was charged were too serious: see Confos at [15]. Howie J recognised that the second stage inquiry under s 32 required balancing the purposes of punishment and the public interest in diverting a mentally disordered offender from the criminal justice system. His reference to the fact that the discretionary judgment could not be exercised properly without due regard to the seriousness of the offending conduct was, in my view, a proper reflection of the s 32(1)(b) requirement that the Magistrate have regard to the facts alleged in the proceedings. 
     
      
    78 Unlike the primary judge (at [56]), I do not regard Howie J’s observations in Confos (at [17]) as having excluded from consideration “when considering the seriousness of the offending conduct, the degree to which the defendant is disabled from being able to control that conduct by limiting consideration to the ‘seriousness of the offence’ ”. Howie J’s references to the role of the seriousness of the offence were made to deal with the complaint in Confos that the Magistrate had fettered her discretion, in part, because of her reference to the seriousness of the offence: see Confos at [19]. 
     
      
    79 I accept the respondent’s submission, which I do not believe the appellant gainsaid, that the s 32 diversionary regime is available to serious offenders as long as it is regarded, in the Magistrate’s opinion, as more appropriate than the alternative. No doubt a Magistrate considering that question will consider whether proceeding in accordance with s 32 will produce a better outcome both for the individual and the community.  
     
      
    80 Once the Magistrate has determined that it is more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with s 32, the Magistrate must determine which of the actions set out in subs (2) or (3) should be taken. As Brownie J said in Minister for Corrective Services v Harris & Anor subs (2) permits interlocutory orders to be made pending determination of the proceedings pursuant to s 32(3). The subs (3) decision is also a discretionary decision, akin to the discretion exercised by a sentencing judge.  
     
      
    81 Before the primary judge the respondent sought to challenge the discretionary decision the Magistrate made at the second stage of the s 32 inquiry. In the ordinary course appellate review of that decision would be undertaken in accordance with the principles laid down in House v R. In the present case, however, the scope of review was confined to a question of law alone.  
     
      
    82 The primary judge appears to have identified the question of law as being whether the facts fell within the provisions of s 32 properly construed: see Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16; (1980) 144 CLR 1 at pp 8–9 per Mason J (with whom Gibbs, Stephen, Murphy and Aickin JJ agreed). 
     
      
    83 Accepting that is so, it was nevertheless necessary in determining whether the Magistrate erred in conducting the s 32 inquiry, to look at the substance of what she said, rather than to construe her ex tempore remarks strictly: Acuthan v Coates (1986) 6 NSWLR 472 at 478. 
     
      
    84 Approaching the matter on this basis I am of the view that the Magistrate turned her attention appropriately to the questions which arose for determination under s 32. She considered the facts of the offence, the mental condition from which the respondent was suffering as described by the psychologist, recognised a treatment plan had been proposed for the respondent’s mental condition, but concluded, having regard to the facts it was not appropriate to take the s 32 route. The Magistrate’s observations that the facts charged did not reveal “an unplanned operation” and that the respondent’s behaviour was not an act of passion or impulse were open to her on the facts. They did not demonstrate an error of law. In my view the Magistrate exercised her discretion properly. 
     
      
    85 Accordingly leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal allowed.  
     
      
    86 The respondent submitted that, in the event leave was granted and the appeal was allowed that he should not suffer a costs order but, rather, an order should be made under the Suitors’ Fund Act 1951. In my view it is not appropriate to make an order against the Suitors’ Fund in favour of the Director of Public Prosecutions. I agree, however, that as leave to appeal has been granted because the matter raises questions of law of general significance, the respondent ought not bear the costs of the appeal. The position is otherwise in relation to the proceedings before the primary judge. 
     
      
    87 I propose the following orders: - 
     
      
       
      1. Grant leave to appeal. 
       
       
      2. Appellant to file a Notice of Appeal in the form of the draft in the White Book within seven days. 
       
       
      3. Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      4. Set aside the decision of Greg James J and in lieu thereof dismiss the Further Amended Summons. 
       
       
      5. Respondent to pay the appellant’s costs of the proceedings in the Common Law Division. 
       
       
      6. Each party to pay their own costs of the Summons for Leave to Appeal and the Appeal. 
       
      
    7 Remit the proceedings to the Burwood Local Court.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant pleaded not guilty to an indictment which contained seven counts as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count One 
       
       
      On 20 November 2002 at Toormina in the State of New South Wales, did possess more than three firearms, namely five firearms that were not registered, of which five were prohibited firearms and he was not a person authorised by a licence or permit to possess those firearms. The maximum penalty pursuant to s 51D of the  
      Firearms Act  
      1996 is imprisonment for twenty years. 
       
       
      Counts two to seven 
       
       
      On 20 November 2002 at Toormina in the State of New South Wales, did possess (various prohibited weapons), without being authorised to do so by a permit. The maximum penalty provided by s 7 of the  
      Weapons Prohibition Act  
      1998 is a term of imprisonment for fourteen years. 
       
      
    2 The appellant pleaded not guilty and was tried before his Honour Acting Judge Ducker and a jury of twelve. The jury returned with a verdict of guilty to count one and not guilty to counts two to seven. 
     
      
    3 The appellant was sentenced to a non-parole period of three and a half years to commence on 1 June 2005 and expire on 30 November 2008 with a balance of parole of 18 months to expire on 31 May 2010, making a total term of five years to commence on 1 June 2005 and expire on 31 May 2010. 
     
      
    4 The appellant appeals against the conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. 
     
      
    5 The grounds of appeal with respect to the conviction are: 
     
      
       
      1. The trial judge erred in law in his ruling admitting the “tendency” evidence. 
       
      2. The trial judge failed properly to direct the jury in relation to the use that could be made of the “tendency” evidence. 
       
      3. The trial judge erred in failing to properly direct the jury, and failing to give any or any adequate warning to the jury, in relation to identification evidence. 
       
      4. There was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the appellant’s legal advisers being unable properly to investigate or present his defence by exploring the actions of the police informer and that person’s opportunity to put the weapons in the storage unit. 
       
      5. The learned trial judge erred in upholding the objection to a subpoena issued by the defence. 
       
      6. The learned trial judge erred in unduly restricting counsel for the accused in establishing the opportunity of the informer to put the weapons in the storage unit. 
       
      7. The trial miscarried as his Honour’s summing-up was unbalanced and unfair. 
       
       
      In relation to sentence the grounds of appeal are: 
       
       
      8. His Honour erred in failing to find the facts of the offence consistently with the jury’s verdicts on the charges under the  
      Weapons Prohibition Act  
      1998 and on the evidence. 
       
      9. His Honour erred by effectively considering that the weapons must have been for a hostile purpose. 
       
      10. His Honour erred in taking into account: 
       
       
       1. The applicant being the President of the Club; 
       
       2. The character of other members of the Club; 
       
        
        3. The character and conduct of members of other motorcycle clubs and in failing to take account, or to take adequate account, of the applicant’s subjective circumstances, other than relating to the Club. 
        
       
      11. The sentence is manifestly excessive. 
       
       
      The facts 
       
      
    6 The firearms and prohibited weapons the subject of the charges were located when the police executed a search warrant on storage unit 38 of the Hi-Tech storage facility at Toormina. The unit was accessed by the police cutting a padlock with bolt cutters. Inside the storage unit the police found two large rectangular metal boxes containing the firearms and prohibited weapons except for the handcuffs, which were, along with a prescription in the name of the appellant, inside a plastic bucket inside a cardboard box on top of one of the metal boxes. Some of the firearms and prohibited weapons in the metal boxes were wrapped in clothes or blankets or were in plastic or gun bags. The police also found a number of documents in the name of the appellant. The only document not in the name of the appellant was a driving manual for a car which had, at one stage, been owned by the appellant. 
     
      
    7 It was agreed that on 20 November 2002 the appellant was not authorised by licence or permit to possess a prohibited firearm or ammunition under the Firearms Act, and was not authorised by a permit to possess a prohibited weapon under the Weapons Prohibition Act. It was also agreed that the firearms were not registered firearms. 
     
      
    8 From October 1999 to November 2002 the storage unit in which the weapons were located was leased by the appellant. Two witnesses, Patrick Herrity, the Assistant Manager of Hi-Tech and Karen Windows the manager of Hi-Tech gave evidence that the appellant had leased the premises in his own name. They both said that the appellant was the only person to pay the account for the storage unit and the only person they had observed to access the unit.  
     
      
    9 One of the problems faced by the trial judge was whether to admit the evidence gained from the execution of another search warrant at premises known as 21 Turf Street at Grafton. Those premises are the clubhouse of the Gladiators Motorcycle Club. The appellant was not present at the clubhouse when the police arrived to execute this search warrant. However, other members of the Club, Scot McCombie, Tim Smith and Matt Horwood were present. Mr McCombie remained in the clubhouse and the others were told to leave. The appellant arrived at the clubhouse at about 4.20 pm that afternoon when the police were still present. He was arrested in relation to the firearms and prohibited weapons which had previously been found at the storage unit. He was searched and a key to the unit and an access card (“swipe card”) to the facility were found in his possession. 
     
      
    10 The search of the club premises revealed three firearms and a small quantity of drugs. A long wooden box was found behind the bar area of the club. On the lid of the box were the words “Keep clear at all times, fine 25 bucks.” The box was unlocked. Inside the box police discovered a Remington pump action 12 gauge shotgun loaded with four live rounds; one Winchester .30-30 rifle loaded with two live rounds; and one Greenfield .30-30 rifle loaded with two live rounds. A variety of ammunition and a box of disposable gloves were also located with the firearms. In the vicinity of the wooden box, and built into the brickwork of the bar, were two safes. These safes were able to be opened using keys found in the possession of the appellant. 
     
      
    11 In respect of the firearms found in the wooden box at the club it was accepted that the Remington Model 870 pump action shotgun is a prohibited, unregistered firearm and that the appellant was not licensed or permitted to possess the firearm. In respect of the remaining two rifles it was accepted that the appellant had no permit or licence to possess them. No charges have been laid with respect to these firearms. 
     
      
    12 The police had been made aware of the location of the firearms and prohibited weapons by an informer. Although the defence sought further details and issued a subpoena, following argument, the evidence in relation to the informer was confined to evidence to establish (1) that there was an informer whose disclosures to police had given rise to the searches, (2) that the informer had antipathy towards the accused and (3) that the informer had provided information that there were firearms behind the bar of the clubhouse. 
     
      
       
      The evidence of Patrick Herrity 
       
      
    13 Mr Herrity gave evidence that he knew the appellant as a customer of Hi-Tech and he remembered when he first attended to fill out a storage agreement/lease document. Mr Herrity said that he did not ask the appellant whether the storage unit would be used by others and the appellant gave no indication that this might occur. It was suggested to him that the appellant had asked to lease the storage unit on behalf of a club but he rejected this suggestion. He confirmed that Hi-Tech was able to enter into storage agreements with companies or clubs although it had not done so. Under cross-examination Mr Herrity accepted that he had some difficulty in remembering all of the details of the circumstances surrounding the execution of the lease on 21 October 1999. 
     
      
    14 Mr Herrity gave evidence that he had discussions with the appellant about an alternate contact person for the unit during which he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “We need an emergency contact, someone other than yourself or your partner but someone who is close to you on a personal basis that would know of your whereabouts and your activities in case we needed to contact them in the case of an emergency.” 
        
       
      
    15 Mr Herrity said that the appellant gave the name “Robert Gardiner” as a contact person. Mr Herrity also gave evidence that the lessee/storer could not assign the lease agreement and highlighted conditions 12 and 15 of that agreement. Conditions 12 and 15 are in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “[12] Deliveries and removals from the storage space will not be permitted by any person other than the storer unless the storer gives personal or telephone instructions to the owner. The storer must identify themselves by use of a password (if any) and name the person (persons) authorised by the storer to enter the storer’s space. 
        
       
       
        
        [15] The storer acknowledges and agrees to comply with all relevant laws including acts and ordinances, regulations, by-laws and orders as are or may be applicable to the use of this space. This includes the laws relating to the material which is stored and the manner in which it is stored. The liability for any and all breach of such laws rests absolutely with the storer and includes any and all costs resulting from such a breach.” 
        
       
      
    16 On 21 October 1999 the appellant was given an access card numbered 068802148 also referred to as a proximity card or swipe card. The card was issued to the appellant at the time that he signed the agreement with Hi-Tech and enabled access to the facility during identified hours. These hours extended beyond the times at which an employee of the business may have been present at the premises. 
     
      
    17 Mr Herrity said that subsequent to 21 October 1999 and up to November 2002 he saw the appellant approximately eight times a year when he came to pay his account. Mr Herrity could not recollect anyone apart from the appellant paying the account. Mr Herrity identified from the payment history for unit 38 that the account was processed predominantly by either himself or Karen Windows, there being only three occasions when someone else processed the payment. The rent had been most recently paid on 17 October 2002. Mr Herrity conceded that although he believed that the appellant paid the rent on that day he had no independent recollection of that occurring and was relying on the documentary record of the payment. It could have been Ms Windows who received the payment. A receipt for this payment was found in the appellant’s car although the appellant denied putting it there and said he did not know how it came to be there. 
     
      
    18 Mr Herrity gave evidence that if the appellant had wanted someone else to have access to the unit, the appellant would have to give them the access card and the key to the storage space, so that the person could enter without coming into the office. If someone arrived without a key the office staff could not help because they did not have keys to individual units. If someone arrived with a key but without the access card, the person had to identify themselves with their licence and know the password before the sales person contacted and checked with the customer that they were acting on their authority. 
     
      
    19 Mr Herrity explained that users of the storage facility had access to their units from 7.00 am to 7.00 pm using their access cards and that from 7.00 pm to 7.00 am the facility had alarms, and a guard dog. There were people living on the premises which were secured by sound sensors and six surveillance cameras.  
     
      
       
      The evidence of Karen Windows 
       
      
    20 Ms Windows said that in her estimate she saw the appellant probably half a dozen times each year. In total she estimated that she had seen him 15 to 18 times at Hi-Tech between October 1999 and November 2002. She agreed that this estimate was “probably based on computer records of payments made on the accounts for the storage and that she did not have a precise recollection of each occasion when Mr Gardiner attended at the premises.” She agreed that she had served many customers over the period. 
     
      
    21 Ms Windows recalled the appellant making payments for the storage unit but did not recall any other person making these payments. Ms Windows did not recollect any other person wanting access to space 38 including during the weeks before 20 November 2002. Ms Windows had a particular recollection of the appellant because he drove a car “very similar” to her own. 
     
      
    22 Ms Windows described the access arrangements to the storage space in similar terms to those described by Mr Herrity. She also said that if a customer had contacted them about other people accessing the unit there would have been a record of it on the computer system. There was no record of the appellant having done this and Ms Windows did not have a recollection of anyone apart from the appellant wanting access to unit 38. 
     
      
    23 Ms Windows had no recollection of any person apart from Mr Gardiner making payment on the appellant’s account.  
     
      
    24 The evidence disclosed that there had been 67 instances when the facility was accessed between 21 October 1999 and 17 October 2002. There were 34 occasions when payment was made. The unit was last accessed on the morning of 17 October 2002 which was the same day on which the last rental payment was made. 
     
      
    25 When the appellant was arrested and searched at the club premises police found that he had two sets of keys containing six keys. He was also carrying the swipe card with the reference number 068802148. This was the card which gave access to the storage space. 
     
      
       
      The appellant’s case 
       
      
    26 The appellant gave evidence. He said that he had no prior knowledge of the long metal boxes and did not know who had put the weapons and firearms in the storage unit. However, he said that he had suspicions. He admitted that there was some animosity between him and another member of the club, Steve Edmonds, over a woman with whom they had both had a relationship. 
     
      
    27 He said that it was at the request of the (then) President of the Gladiators Motorcycle club, Scott McCombie, that he signed the lease agreement in October 1999 for the storage unit. Mr McCombie also gave evidence stating that the reason for leasing the storage unit was to clear out the existing clubhouse and to keep items for a proposed new club chapter at Coffs Harbour. 
     
      
    28 The appellant said that when he came to arrange the lease for the storage unit in the name of the Gladiators Motorcycle Club or Gladiators Real Estate or just Gladiators he was asked by Mr Herrity if he had any authorisation or anything relating to the club. The appellant replied that he did not have anything. The appellant said that Mr Herrity told the appellant to put the lease in his name “because we’re going to have to have your name on the lease with your licence details.” When the appellant was asked to put down a next of kin as a contact person, he said that he named his brother. 
     
      
    29 The appellant and Mr McCombie both gave evidence that the appellant gave the lease papers and the access card to Mr McCombie, who made the access card available to other club members by placing it on the shelf of the fridge door at the club. The appellant said that he had about ten keys cut to the storage unit for other club members. The appellant said that he used Lock Solid Security Locksmiths in Grafton. 
     
      
    30 The locksmith gave evidence and indicated that the appellant had been a customer of his business since 1998. He said that he had cut maybe fifteen or twenty keys for him. 
     
      
    31 The appellant gave evidence that during the lease period he probably visited the unit about eight or ten times. He said that he and other club members stored some personal belongings in the unit, in addition to materials for the club. The appellant said that the last time he visited Hi-Tech Self Storage was in May 2002. He said that he had the access card in his possession when he was arrested because he had obtained the card from Sniper Edmonds a few days earlier because he planned to get a box of books from the unit. 
     
      
    32 The appellant gave evidence that the last time he had seen the box found behind the bar it had contained tent pegs not weapons. Similar evidence was given by Mr McCombie. There was a suggestion that on an earlier occasion an unlicensed weapon had been found at the clubhouse, although this was not proven, and at the time he had laughed it off as a lie. On this occasion the inference which the defence sought to have the jury draw was that the guns were planted by the police. 
     
      
    33 Including himself the appellant indicated that there were fifteen members of the Grafton chapter of the Gladiators at the time of the offence. He said that most, if not all, had keys to the unit and they all had access to the unit. 
     
      
    34 The appellant said that he had observed other members of the Club to have stored personal belongings at Hi-Tech and had, on one occasion, noticed a Christmas tree in the unit. He said that on one occasion he was let into the storage area without his access card, simply by honking his horn and yelling to the office. 
     
      
    35 Other members of the motorcycle club gave evidence about having access to the storage unit. Mr McCombie said that he visited the unit about six times and that he was always accompanied by someone else as he did not have a licence. He said that he went with Sniper Edmonds (Steve Edmonds) about three times, and that he also went with Matt Horwood and “Swifty.” He said that the rent had been paid by post, or by other members as well as the appellant. When cross-examined he gave a description of the storage unit which was clearly inaccurate. At one point he said that although he had been to Hi-Tech he never got out of the car. 
     
      
    36 Mr Benjamin Gilson gave evidence that he had a key to the storage unit and knew the access card was in the door of the fridge at the club. He said that he had visited the unit with other people about five or six times in the 18 months before November 2002. Mr Gilson also said that he ended up with two keys to the storage unit because on one occasion he had forgotten his key and took the key that was with the card in the fridge. Mr Gilson described in his evidence delivering an air conditioning unit to the storage unit with Craig Williams and also on another occasion taking a freezer from the unit with Sniper Edmonds. 
     
      
    37 Mr Shayne Fowler gave evidence that he also had a key and knew that there was a card in the fridge at the club to access the unit. Mr Fowler said that he used his key to the storage unit about three times, once to drop off some club stuff with the appellant, another time with his wife to store some Christmas presents for his children, and another time to retrieve the presents. Mr Fowler said that on the last occasion he went there, in late 2000, he remembered paying the fee for the unit in cash and dealing with a female sales person. 
     
      
    38 Mr Michael Reimer, Mr Craig Williams and Mr Mark Laming, each gave evidence of having been once to the storage unit at Hi-Tech Self Storage. Mr Reimer gave evidence that he had keys to the storage unit and the clubhouse. When he went to the unit in March 2002 he went with Albert Atkins who also had a key. Mr Reimer said that he drove the appellant’s gold Ford Fairlane. Mr Reimer said the purpose of the visit was to pick up an ice making machine from the unit. 
     
      
    39 Mr Craig Williams said that he had keys to the storage unit and the clubhouse. He gave evidence that when he went to the unit in early 2001 with Mr Gilson it was to drop off an air conditioner. Mr Williams recalled cardboard boxes but could not recall metal boxes in the unit. In cross-examination Mr Williams said that Sniper Edmonds had told him to drop off the air conditioner. 
     
      
    40 Mr Mark Laming gave evidence that in late 2002 on a day which could have been 17 October, but in any event, a couple of weeks prior to a bike show he drove Sniper Edmonds to the storage unit. Mr Laming said that Sniper Edmonds handed him the access card which he had taken out of his wallet and told him to hold it up so that the gate would open. Mr Laming said that he saw Sniper Edmonds carry a dark coloured bag that was about two thirds of a metre long into the unit and returned with two chairs. He said that he saw Edmonds go to the office. 
     
      
    41 Mr McCombie also gave evidence of the appellant’s car being taken to Hi-Tech by other club members. He said the appellant’s car was used by the whole club for just about anything which required a car.  
     
      
    42 It was the defence case that all of this evidence established that there were a large number of people with equal opportunity for access to the storage unit and a large number of keys in existence for the padlock. Accordingly, the defence submitted that it could not be established that the appellant was in possession of the firearms. Furthermore, it was submitted that the appellant neither knew nor ought to have known the firearms were in the storage unit. 
     
      
    43 Significantly, apart from the suggestion that Sniper Edmonds had carried a bag into the premises no one gave evidence of having put any guns there. Furthermore, no one suggested they had observed guns in the storage unit. 
     
      
       
      The statutory framework 
       
      
    44 There is no relevant distinction between the sections of the Firearms Act and the Weapons Prohibition Act providing for the offences with which the appellant was charged. However, the statutes define (or extend the definition of) “possession” in significantly different ways.  
     
      
    45 Section 4A of the Firearms Act is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Without restricting the meaning of the word ‘possession’, for the purposes of any proceedings under this Act, a firearm is taken to be in the possession of a person so long as it is in or on any premises owned, leased or occupied by, or in the care, control or management of, the person, unless the court is satisfied that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the firearm was placed in or on, or brought into or on to, the premises by or on behalf of a person who was lawfully authorised by or under this Act to possess the firearm, or 
           
          (b) the person did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known that the firearm was in or on the premises, or 
           
          (c) on the evidence before it, the person was not in possession of the firearm. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) In this section, ‘premises’ means any place, vehicle, vessel or aircraft. 
        
       
      
    46 Under s 4 of the Weapons Prohibition Act: 
     
      
       
        
        “‘possession’ of a prohibited weapon includes any case in which a person knowingly: (a) has custody of the weapon, or (b) has the weapon in the custody of another person, or (c) has the weapon in or on any premises, place, vehicle, vessel or aircraft, whether or not belonging to or occupied by the person.” 
        
       
      
    47 The jury found the appellant guilty of the charge under the Firearms Act but not guilty of the charges under the Weapons Prohibition Act. The appellant suggests, I believe correctly, that the explanation for the jury’s decisions is that it was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that the firearms and prohibited weapons were in the storage unit and thus acquitted him in relation to the Weapons Prohibition Act charges. However, the conviction in relation to the Firearms Act charge indicates that the jury was not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the appellant did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known that the firearms were in the storage unit. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      Ground One: the trial judge erred in law in his ruling admitting the “tendency” evidence 
       
       
      Ground Two: the trial judge failed properly to direct the jury in relation to the use that could be made of the “tendency” evidence 
       
      
    48 It is convenient to deal with these grounds together. A tendency notice pursuant to s 97 of the Evidence Act was served by the prosecution before the trial. It identified the appellant as the subject of the evidence and indicated that the relevant evidence was to be found in the statements of various police witnesses and the transcript from the “conducts/execution of search warrant at Gladiator’s clubhouse, Turf Street, Grafton – 20 November 2002.”  
     
      
    49 The essential thrust of the Crown submission was that in circumstances where the appellant denied any knowledge of the weapons at the Hi-Tech storage unit it was relevant for the jury to know that on the same day as the weapons were found at the unit weapons were also found at Turf Street, being the club premises of the motor cycle club of which the appellant was President. The Crown Prosecutor submitted: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown really says that it is doubly remarkable – I use the term ‘doubly’ not in a precise arithmetical sense, but it’s increasingly unlikely and relevantly so that there should be weapons found in each of the two premises of which he is utterly unaware, giving [sic] the leading role that he plays.” 
        
       
      
    50 The trial judge admitted the evidence and in doing so delivered a short judgment. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence which the Crown has indicated its intention to place before the jury, does have significant probative value. It provides a nexus between the accused and the two premises in which the firearms were found. The defence raised by the accused in the first trial, that the items alleged to have been found must have been planted by some person or persons whom he cannot identify, or by the police. The coincidence that the weapons that were allegedly found by the police on the same day, both in the club in Grafton, of which the accused was at the time President, and in the accused’s storage number 38 at Toormina near Coffs Harbour, if accepted by the jury, would be powerful evidence for the prosecution. Given the explanation put forward by the accused, the jury might consider it very difficult to accept that somehow someone could have gained access to both those premises and planted the various items. 
        
       
       
        
        In my view, given the defence which has been foreshadowed, the tendency evidence does have a high degree of probative value because it goes to the very heart of the case, which is, whether or not the accused had the items charged in his possession. When one speaks of the prejudicial effect, one does not mean the effect that may be quite legitimate of destroying the accused’s case. It means evidence unfairly suggesting that the accused was responsible. 
        
       
       
        
        It seems to me that if the Crown establishes in the mind of the jury the nexus which is relied upon as a result of the evidence of tendency, then it will be powerful evidence indeed. If it is not accepted by the jury it should not cause any unfair prejudice to the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        The cases that are to be relied upon by the prosecution and the defence make this evidence highly important. It may be detrimental in the effect that it may destroy or help to destroy the veracity of the claim made by the accused of his total lack of knowledge or association with any of the firearms but that does not mean that it would be unfair or prejudicial. 
        
       
       
        
        I admit the evidence as significant evidence of tendency.” 
        
       
      
    51 In my opinion there are a number of difficulties with his Honour’s reasons. The reasons are brief. This is not of itself a problem. However, nowhere does his Honour identify the tendency which the evidence supports. Was it a tendency to own weapons? If so how does the finding of weapons at the Club premises support the alleged tendency in the appellant? 
     
      
    52 The trial judge said that he had formed the conclusion that the evidence would have significant probative value. His Honour said it went to the “heart of the case” which is “whether or not the accused had the items charged in his possession.” However, his Honour does not explain his reasons for reaching this conclusion. For my part I would have difficulty arriving at the same conclusion. 
     
      
    53 In one respect the prosecution case against the appellant turned upon his knowledge of the presence of the weapons at the storage unit. Apart from the fact that the appellant was the President of the motorcycle club there was nothing to connect him with the weapons found at the club premises or from which it could be inferred that he knew they were there. Furthermore, even if he was aware that there were weapons at the club, this could not be probative of his knowledge of weapons at the storage facility. 
     
      
    54 It is apparent that the Crown took the course which it did because it was known from the appellant’s first trial that he proposed to offer as his defence that the weapons had been placed in the storage facility by the informer or the police. The argument was that it was less likely that this would be the case if weapons were found at two premises associated with the appellant requiring the informer to have “planted” weapons in both places. 
     
      
    55 For my part this is not an attractive theory. If the informer had planted the weapons at the storage facility, with its difficulties of access, there would seem little reason why he or she would not also plant them at the club premises and alert the police to the opportunity of discovering weapons in both places. If the suggested informer was a club member, as the defence inferred, or the weapons had been planted by the police, which was another theory, the opportunity to “fit up” the appellant by planting weapons at the club was readily available. 
     
      
    56 But leaving the question of probative value to one side, before his Honour could admit the evidence he was required to consider the safeguard provided by s 101(2) of the Act. Section 101(2) provides that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.” 
        
       
      
    57 His Honour does not expressly address the section and refers to prejudicial effect only in terms of an understanding of the proper meaning of that term. His Honour correctly identifies that the enquiry is as to whether or not the appellant would suffer “unfair prejudice” but does not proceed to consider that matter.  
     
      
    58 There were in my opinion a number of ways in which the evidence could unfairly prejudice the appellant and could have been misused by the jury. The tender of the evidence raised in the minds of the jury the possibility that the appellant was involved in other offences which had not been charged against him. It also involved the disclosure of associations with others who may have illegally possessed or stored guns at the clubhouse, leading to the suggestion that he would be more likely to own guns or store them in his storage unit. This would create a significant risk that the jury would be diverted from their task which was to consider the appellant’s ownership or knowledge of the weapons found at Hi-Tech: see Festa v The Queen (2001) 208 CLR 593 at [51]; R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112. 
     
      
    59 The difficulties for the appellant are apparent in the manner in which the trial judge dealt with this evidence when summing-up to the jury. His Honour said referring to the evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now that evidence was let in as tendency evidence. It is not evidence which can be in any sense substituted for admissible evidence of the guilt of the accused, or to prove the case against the accused.  
        In other words the evidence is there to show that on another occasion involving allegations of firearms having been present in circumstances where the accused was present and the learned representative for the Crown told you that it was just to show that the accused had particular tendencies 
        , that you could have regard to what happened at the clubhouse. 
        
       
       
        
        There are some connections of course because this whole event became a trial here now because of information provided to the police, the actual date on which it is said to have been supplied to the police has not been stated in evidence.” 
        
       
      
    60 Later, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I just want to deal now with the question of what we call tendency evidence. Where tendency evidence is relied upon, the elements of it must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had in fact been involved in the behaviour or acts relied upon as showing a tendency on the part of the accused. Evidence of tendency cannot be used unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that those events occurred as alleged, that those events gave rise to the suggestion of tendency on the part of the accused.  
        In considering the evidence, you look to see whether the similarities relied on are so striking or of such clear underlying unity as to make coincidence a very unlikely explanation; and whether the similarities indicate that the same person was responsible for each transaction 
        . You must be satisfied that the similarities exist only because the accused was a party to each transaction that the accused in effect has put a certain stamp upon those items. I must warn you that if you find that the accused was guilty of one or more of the charges you must not conclude from that alone that he has a generally bad character or propensity to commit such crimes and is therefore likely to be guilty of other charges. So, members of the jury, bear that in mind. Before the evidence which is relied upon arising from the happenings at the club can be used as tendency evidence, you have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that those things did occur.” 
        
       
       
        
        The prosecution has referred to the high likelihood that the same person was involved in both in so far as both of the premises are concerned, and suggests that there is a clear underlying unity because of the persons who were involved and the fact that the accused at the relevant times was the President of the Gladiators Motorcycle Club, and where the motorcycle club had, it is suggested, items that were put into the space no 38. In other words, that you will find that the accused was active in relation to both the premises of the club and also – and there was a similarity between what actually happened at both the club and the space 38. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        That is a matter for you to decide, but unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was involved in those matters at the clubhouse then you cannot use his behaviour and any tendency that he may have shown as evidence in relation to the charges that arise from the weapons that were said to be found at the space 38.” 
        
       
      
    61 There is apparent confusion in the proper categorisation of the evidence. His Honour appears to be speaking in terms of coincidence and nowhere identifies the tendency which it is said the evidence could support. This is hardly surprising for, at best, the evidence points to the fact that weapons were found at both the premises which the appellant had leased and at other premises of the motorcycle club of which he was the President. The issues at the trial were either the ownership of the weapons found at the storage unit or the appellant’s knowledge of them. There was nothing in the evidence to indicate that the appellant was the owner of the weapons at the clubhouse and accordingly it could not have been admitted on that issue. Perhaps it was thought to be admissible as evidence of a tendency to mix with people who had weapons or to frequent premises where weapons were present. If this was the case, to my mind its probative value on any relevant issue was of limited if not negligible value. 
     
      
    62 I have emphasised some of the more significant elements of his Honour’s directions. Apart from a failure to identify the relevant tendency the generality of his Honour’s language served merely to reinforce some of the unsavoury aspects of the appellant’s acquaintances and the presence of weapons at the club, creating a real possibility that the jury would be diverted from their proper task of determining whether the appellant owned the weapons found at Hi-Tech or knew or ought to have known they were stored there. There was a significant possibility that the jury would reason that merely because weapons were found at premises of which he was President his evidence that he did not know that they were in the Hi-Tech unit should not be accepted. Such a reasoning process carries with it a risk, if not a likelihood, that the jury would fail to adequately evaluate the evidence which otherwise indicated that the appellant did not know of the weapons. To my mind any probative value which the evidence may have had was significantly outweighed by its likely prejudicial effect. 
     
      
    63 The evidence was the subject of objection and in my opinion no occasion for the application of Rule 4 arises. 
     
      
    64 However, whether the proviso should be applied is a matter requiring further consideration. 
     
      
       
      Ground three: the trial judge erred in failing properly to direct the jury, and failing to give any or any adequate warning to the jury, in relation to identification evidence. 
      
    65 As I have previously related both Mr Herrity and Ms Windows gave evidence identifying the appellant as being present at Hi Tech on many occasions. Although the rent was paid on 17 October 2002 there was a dispute as to whether the appellant was present on that day. The appellant’s case was that he did not attend Hi-Tech as often as the witnesses suggested and he said that he did not attend on 17 October 2002. Neither Mr Herrity or Ms Windows had a clear recollection of the rent being paid on that day. However, neither of them recall anyone other than Mr Gardiner paying the rent. Of great significance is the fact that the receipt for the rent paid on that day was found in the appellant’s car. It was suggested to both Mr Herrity and Ms Windows that they were mistaken and that they have confused Mr Gardiner with other members of the club who attended to pay the bill or gain access to the storage unit. 
     
      
    66 The appellant submitted that relevant portions of Mr Herrity’s and Ms Windows’ evidence was identification evidence as defined in the Evidence Act 1995. That definition is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Identification evidence means evidence that is: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) an assertion by a person to the effect that a defendant was, or resembles (visually, aurally or otherwise) a person who was, present at or near a place where: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted is committed, or  
           
          (ii) an act connected to that offence was done,  
           
          at or about the time at which the offence was committed or the act was done, being an assertion that is based wholly or partly on what the person making the assertion saw, heard or otherwise perceived at that place and time, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (b) a report (whether oral or in writing) of such an assertion.” 
        
       
      
    67 There is a difficulty in applying the definition to the facts of the present case. The offence was allegedly committed on 20 November 2002 when the weapons were located. They could have been put there on any occasion prior to that when the storage unit was accessed. The indictment merely alleged that the offence was committed on 20 November 2002, the date of the search. However, because the most recent occasion for access was 17 October whether the appellant, or some other person, accessed the premises on that day was of significance to the question raised by s 4A(1)(b) whether “the person did not know and could not reasonably be expected to know that the firearm was in or on the premises.” If someone other than the appellant had been present the allegation that the appellant had no knowledge of the weapons may obtain some support. In this sense the evidence that the appellant was at the premises on 17 October was evidence of an act connected to the offence. Furthermore, because the offence was dependent upon the weapons having been placed there at some time prior to 20 November it was relevantly “at about the time at which the offence was committed.” 
     
      
    68 Although in my opinion falling within the definition of identification evidence, the evidence of both Mr Herrity and Ms Windows is appropriately described as recognition evidence. It is evidence of seeing someone they knew, not evidence that a person who they observed and who was presently unknown to them was the defendant. 
     
      
    69 As identification evidence the trial judge was obliged to give consideration to s 116 and the need for the jury to exercise appropriate caution. In an exchange with counsel his Honour indicated that he would tell the jury that they needed to be very careful about the evidence. However, complaint is made that his Honour failed to do as he intended and that he gave directions which were calculated to encourage the jury to accept the evidence uncritically. 
     
      
    70 In his summing up, Ducker ADCJ addressed the evidence of Mr Herrity and Ms Windows at various points. For example, his Honour told the jury that the Crown case was “built, you might think, heavily on the evidence of the two witnesses who were employees of Hi-Tech Storage” and went on: 
     
      
       
        
        “The defence suggests they are not reliable witnesses, that they are people, although they might be honest, who have relied only upon their records. To what extent that would be regarded as criticism is a matter for you. 
        
       
       
        
        What did you think of Mr Herrity’s evidence is very much a matter for you. Was he a person who was trying to give honest evidence? Was he a person who got rattled now and then, who at times did not seem to get the real thrust of the questions that were put to him? Was he attempting to tell what he believed to be the truth? Was his evidence accurate? It is a matter for you to make up your mind. 
        
       
       
        
        The suggestion was also made, on behalf of the defence that both Herrity and Ms Windows may well have mistaken other persons as being the accused, particularly if they were persons in or nearby the gold Ford motor vehicle, similar to the one which Ms Windows knew about; that they were really taking it for granted because that car was there, they thought that he was there. Well you heard their responses, particularly the response of Ms Windows. She would have none of that. She insisted that she knew the accused. One of the reasons was the motor car which he had, but she did not believe that there was any chance that she would mistake the accused, whom she knew by name and by appearance. 
        
       
       
        
        That evidence, if accepted, you might think, is powerful evidence for the prosecution.” 
        
       
      
    71 On an occasion when the jury had been sent home part way through the summing up, defence counsel reminded the judge of his request for an “identification evidence warning.” The judge said “I will say something about that … but it may not be terribly favourable to your client.” When, a short time later, defence counsel said “it gets back to this displacement effect of whether Ms Windows was recognising the car or recognising Mr Gardiner himself” the judge said “Well, I’ve dealt with that.” It is submitted by the appellant that his Honour had not “dealt with” it to that point in the summing up and notwithstanding that his Honour continued the summing up from 9.30 am until 3.30 pm the following day, he at no stage directed the jury properly in relation to the matter of identification. 
     
      
    72 On the second day of the summing up the judge again touched upon the evidence of Mr Herrity and Ms Windows noting: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the prosecution urges you to accept Mr Herrity and Ms Windows as honest, unbiased, disinterested and accurate witnesses as to the vital matters involved … . 
        
       
       
        
        Both Herrity and Ms Windows’ evidence is relied upon by the prosecution as reliable evidence.” 
        
       
      
    73 In these circumstances, the appellant submitted that the directions given by the judge failed to comply with the law relating to identification evidence: see Evidence Act ss 116 and 165; Domican v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 555; Dhanhoa v The Queen (2003) 217 CLR; R v Clarke (1997) 97 A Crim R 414; R v Zammit [1999] NSWCCA 65 at [117] and R v Coe [2002] NSWCCA 385 at [67]. 
     
      
    74 In particular it was submitted that: 
     
      
       
      (i) The evidence was disputed and s 116 mandated a direction:  
      Dhanhoa  
      per Gleeson CJ and Hayne J at 8-9, per McHugh and Gummow JJ at 61, 26-27 and per Callinan J at 26-27. 
       
       
      (ii) The jury was not directed as to the “special need for caution before accepting identification evidence”: s 116(1)(a)  
      Evidence Act. 
       
       
      (iii) The jury was not directed as to the reasons for that need for caution either generally or in the circumstances of the case: s 116(1)(b),  
      Zammit  
      at [117];  
      Coe  
      at [67]. 
       
       
      (iv) The jury was not directed that the “special need for caution” arose due to the courts’ experience of proved miscarriages of justice whereby innocent people have been convicted on mistaken identifications:  
      R v Aziz  
      [1982] 2 NSWLR 322 at 330;  
      Domican  
      at 561;  
      Clarke  
      per Hunt CJ at CL at 428. 
       
       
      (v) The judge did not direct the jury that a completely honest witness may be mistaken and warn the jury against the seductive nature of evidence given by a witness who is completely honest and yet who may be genuinely mistaken in their identification. 
       
       
      (vi) The judge did not, at the request of counsel, warn the jury that the identification evidence may be unreliable and the reasons it may be unreliable: s 165  
      Evidence Act. 
       
       
      (vii) The summing up failed to convey to the jury the need to exercise caution before accepting the identification evidence and that the danger that it may be unreliable must be overcome before accepting it:  
      Clarke. 
       
       
      (viii) The summing up did no more than put the defence submission that the identification evidence was unreliable which is “insufficient discharge of the trial judge’s duty”:  
      Domican  
      at 564. 
       
       
      (ix) The judge did not warn the jury that more than one witness (Mr Herrity and Ms Windows) can equally be mistaken:  
      R v Ali  
      (2001) 122 A Crim R 498 at 501. 
       
       
      (x) The summing up did not identify particular reasons why the evidence may have been unreliable or instruct the jury on “the factors which may affect consideration of [the identification evidence] in the circumstances of the case” or draw its attention to weaknesses in the identification evidence:  
      Domican  
      at 561-562;  
      Clarke  
      per Smart J. 
       
      
    75 It is now settled that, as with the common law, a warning is only required when identification evidence is disputed: Dhanhoa Gleeson CJ and Hayne J at 9; McHugh and Gummow JJ at 16; Callinan J at 26-27. Furthermore, as the joint judgment of Glesson CJ and Hayne J in that case makes plain, if a warning is required its content will depend upon the nature of the evidence which has been given and the issues debated at the trial. When evidence is given that a person previously known to the witness was recognised the warning required will be significantly confined. 
     
      
    76 In the present case the evidence with respect to the recognition of the appellant was both as to seeing him when paying the rent on 17 October, and never seeing any other person paying the rent or going to the rented space either on 17 October or on any other occasion. The latter which is not identification evidence, called for no warning although it was appropriate to remind the jury to consider the evidence carefully. 
     
      
    77 The substantial issue at the trial was not whether Mr Herrity and Ms Windows had correctly identified the appellant but rather whether they had a recollection of him paying the rent on 17 October or whether they were merely relying on the rental records which showed the rent as paid and assumed the appellant must have paid it. The only other issue was whether Ms Windows’ insistence that she recognised the appellant’s car may have meant that she assumed the appellant to have been there rather than having actually observed him. In other words the challenge was to the witness’s recollection. 
     
      
    78 In my judgment the trial judge appropriately identified these issues for the jury and made plain that before concluding that the appellant had been recognised they would need to carefully evaluate the accuracy of the evidence and consider the possibility that a mistake may have occurred. Although his Honour could have given directions warning the jury about difficulties which can exist when recognising other people in the circumstances of this trial the fact that he did not do so did not, in my opinion, lead to a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    79 As the High Court recognised in Dhanhoa the requirement in s 116 of the Evidence Act 1995 for a warning has to be assessed in light of the issues in the case as a whole. Both the content of any warning, or whether a warning is required at all, must be considered. In my opinion, the trial judge’s directions were adequate in the circumstances. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: There was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the appellant’s legal advisors being unable to properly investigate or present his defence by exploring the actions of a police informer and that person’s opportunity to put the weapons in the storage unit. 
       
       
      Ground 5: The learned trial judge erred in upholding the objection to a subpoena issued by the defence. 
       
       
      Ground 6: The learned trial judge erred in unduly restricting counsel for the accused in establishing the opportunity of the informer to put the weapons in the storage unit. 
       
      
    80 It is appropriate to consider these grounds together. 
     
      
    81 I have already related that the appellant’s case was that he did not know that the firearms were in the storage unit and evidence was adduced at the trial to establish that other people had access to the unit. In the course of the trial a number of keys were produced which fitted the padlock. No other member of the Club who was called to give evidence admitted to ownership or possession of the weapons in the storage unit. The jury were asked to accept that it may have been the police informer who had “set up” the appellant by planting the weapons. 
     
      
    82 The appellant sought to investigate the matter by subpoena to the Commissioner of Police. The subpoena sought: 
     
      
       
        
        “All records including notes, running sheets, day books, COPS event entries information reports, statements, memoranda, transcripts, audio and video footage, briefing notes and search warrant applications concerning: 
        
       
       
        
        1. (a) the preparation for searches by police of Space 38, Hi Tech Storage Toormina and the Gladiators Motor Cycle Club clubhouse at Turf St, Grafton on 20 November 2002 (the raids); 
         
         (b) The raids themselves; 
         
          
          (c) Information provided to police by the registered informant who spoke about the accused to Det David Johnston of Coffs Harbour Police on 19 November 2005 (the registered informant); 
           
          (d) Any threats made or inducements offered to the registered informant by police; 
           
          (e) Any payments made by police to the registered informant; 
           
          (f) Any malice or antipathy shown by the registered informant towards the accused; 
           
          (g) All firearms and prohibited weapons surrendered to or seized by the Coffs/Clarence Area Police between 1 October 2002 and 31 December 2002. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        2. All records of ownership, transfer or registration of the following firearms: 
         
         (a) SKS rifle serial no. 16318 
         
         (b) SKK rifle serial no. 22017414 
         
         (c) SKK rifle serial no. 2308001 
         
         (d) SKK rifle serial no. 8906078 
         
         (e) SKK rifle serial no. 22017414 
         
         (f) Gevarm rifle serial no. 101322 
        
       
       
        
        3. All records pertaining to the existence of a firearms amnesty in NSW between November 2002 and January 2003.” 
        
       
      
    83 In the course of argument the parties reached agreement that the Commissioner of Police would produce the material referred to in paras 1(a) and 1(b) and 2 of the Schedule to the subpoena. His Honour ruled that the defence had failed to show a legitimate forensic purpose in relation to the material referred to in paras 1(c) to 1(g) of the subpoena. Apparently, the material sought in para 3 of the subpoena was not pursued and that matter was effectively resolved by agreement. Accordingly, the material sought by the defence was confined to information in relation to dealings with the informant, evidence of any malice which he might have had towards the appellant and details of firearms seized. 
     
      
    84 An “objection” was taken to the subpoena which was upheld by the trial judge. The trial judge then made an order pursuant to s 130 of the Evidence Act that the defence be limited in the trial to establishing: 
     
      
       
      1. That the police had received information from an informer; 
       
      2. That the informer had antipathy towards the appellant and 
       
      3. That the informer had told police that the weapons in the clubhouse were behind the bar. 
       
      
    85 The police had already disclosed the existence, but not the identity, of the informer and other related matters in proceedings relating to an application for a liquor licence. The report disclosed that the informant claimed knowledge of meetings of the club both in Grafton in December 2002 and Maitland in November 2002. 
     
      
    86 The trial judge was satisfied that the subpoena constituted a “fishing expedition.” In his judgment of 16 May 2005 his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I cannot see any real prejudice at all to the accused in taking the course that I have. I have considered s 192 of the  
        Evidence Act 
         in this regard, and consideration of that section leads me to the view that the material which is being sought in the subpoena falls into the category of ‘fishing’ for evidence, attempting to investigate whether such evidence does exist.” 
        
       
      
    87 The appellant made the following submissions: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is submitted that this passage shows that his Honour erred in several respects. The test of whether there is a legitimate forensic purpose is whether it was “on the cards that the documents sought would materially assist his defence” ( 
        R v Saleam  
        (1989) 16 NSWLR 14 at 18;  
        Alister v The Queen  
        (1984) 154 CLR 404 at 414). It is submitted that s 192 of the  
        Evidence Act  
        was irrelevant to the question of whether it was “on the cards that the [information] would materially assist his defence” and his Honour’s reference to the section appears to be misconceived. Furthermore, it was not open to find the defence was on a “fishing expedition” in circumstances where the material sought to be explored was directly relevant to the defence being put forward. Defence counsel identified the legitimate forensic purpose: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Because of the reverse onus, your Honour it simply may not be good enough for him [the appellant] to stand up and say ‘well I didn’t put them there’ and ‘I didn’t know they were there, someone else must have put them there’ … It is really incumbent upon him to put before the jury evidence that supports the inference that he has been set up. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          We have no way your Honour of testing the good faith if you like of Officer Breton without being able to double check on what he says … extremely important that we be able to pursue these matters, look at these documents, check on the real situation … .” 
          
         
         
        It is also submitted that his Honour erred in failing to consider the matter in stages. The application to set aside the subpoena on the basis of an absence of a legitimate forensic purpose should not be determined in advance of a claim of public interest immunity:

        Ducker ADCJ stated that there is “in fact no evidence which would be of any assistance to the defence.” There was no basis on which Ducker ADCJ could make this determination unless he had inspected the documents produced. It seems that no such inspection was undertaken. 
         
         
        Finally, the learned trial judge appeared to disregard the fact that there had been disclosure, in other proceedings, by the police of information relating to, and giving rise to inferences as to the identify of, the informer. Under s 130(5)(d) a relevant factor is “the means available to limit its publication” (which could have been achieved by a non-publication order) and s 130(5)(e) required the judge to take into account whether the substance of the information or document has already been published (which it had). 
        
       
       
        
        In  
        Alister  
        Murphy J said at 431: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The processes of criminal justice should not be distorted to prevent an accused from defending himself or herself properly. If the public interest demands that material capable of assisting the accused be withheld, then the proper course may be to abandon the prosecution or for the court to stay the proceedings. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        It is submitted that these remarks have resonance in the present case where an onus was placed on the appellant to establish that he had no knowledge of the weapons but the state sought to restrict his ability to put his case properly before the jury on the grounds of public interest immunity.” 
        
       
      
    88 Although a party may obtain the leave of the court to issue a subpoena, if objection is taken, inspection of any documents which are produced will only be allowed if the court is satisfied that it has a legitimate forensic purpose. In Carroll v Attorney-General for NSW (1993) 70 A Crim R 162 Mahoney AP stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it is not the right of a party to litigation, merely by subpoenaing documents from a third party, to achieve inspection of them. As I have said, the court must, in general, be satisfied that the documents are relevant to an issue for decision by the court in the litigation. It is not open to a party, as on a ‘fishing expedition’, to subpoena documents merely in order to determine whether they may be relevant and may be of assistance to his case in the proceeding. 
        
       
       
        
        But mere relevance is not enough: thus it is not enough for the party to show only and without more that the document plainly shows and shows only that his case cannot be made out. It is not enough for the party to say: ‘The documents are relevant in the sense that prima facie they establish the case against me: therefore I am entitled to see them and to tender them.’ 
        
       
       
        
        In the case in which the party did not know what was the nature of the contents of the documents, the position would be plain. He could not claim to look at the documents merely to see whether they contained something which might be relevant or help his case … He must be able to indicate that the document is relevant in the sense that it may assist his case. At best the claim [in  
        Carroll 
        ] was: ‘I wish to see the document to see if it may assist my case.’ That, in my opinion, is not sufficient.” 
        
       
      
    89 In other cases the relevant test has been expressed in terms that the court must be satisfied that it is “on the cards” that the documents would materially assist the accused in his defence.” (R v Saleam (1989) 16 NSWLR 14 at 18). Care must be taken in criminal proceedings to attach “special weight to the fact that the documents may support the defence of an accused person in criminal proceedings” when deciding whether inspection should be allowed (see Alister v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 404 at 414). A mere fishing expedition is not permissible and it has to appear to be “on the cards” that the disputed documents will materially assist the defence (Alister at 414). 
     
      
    90 It is plain that mere suspicion or speculation is not sufficient and it is not appropriate for the judge to allow inspection of the documents simply because of a bare unsupported assertion that upon such an inspection something may be found which is helpful to the accused (Alister at 671 and the discussion in Travel Compensation Fund v Blair [2002] NSWSC 1228 at [20]ff). 
     
      
    91 I do not believe the appellant’s submission that the trial judge failed to consider the subpoena and the public interest immunity claim in stages is correct. The relevant steps which is Honour took were: 
     
      
    · On 14 April 2005 a subpoena was served on the Commissioner of Police.· The subpoena was objected to by the Crown Solicitor for the Commissioner of Police;· On 16 May 2005 argument took place before Ducker ADCJ in relation to the subpoena. On that day Ducker ADCJ handed down a judgment in relation to the subpoena. The Commissioner of police agreed to produce the material sought in paras 1(a), 1 (b) and 2 of the subpoena. Ducker ADCJ ruled that the appellant had failed to show a legitimate forensic purpose in relation to the matters in paras 1(c)-(g). The appellant did not pursue the production of the matters in para 3 of the subpoena.· On the next day (17 May 2005) the Crown Solicitor applied to have oral evidence in the trial in relation to informers restricted to three matters on the basis of public interest immunity. These three matters were namely (a) that the police had received information from an informer; (b) that the informer had antipathy towards the accused; (c) that the informer had told the police that the weapons in the clubhouse were behind the bar. The application was supported by the affidavit of Norman Hazzard. Ducker ADCJ granted the application, ultimately adopting the same approach that Hosking DCJ had taken in the first trial. 
     
      
    92 Accordingly, the subpoena was dealt with separately to, and in advance of, the public interest immunity application. 
     
      
    93 In his judgment of 16 May 2005 Ducker ADCJ concluded that the parts of the subpoena which his Honour disallowed amounted to a fishing expedition. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I cannot see any real prejudice at all to the accused in taking the course that I have. I have considered s 192 of the  
        Evidence Act 
         in this regard, and consideration of that section leads me to the view that the material which is being sought in the subpoena falls into the category of ‘fishing’ for evidence, attempting to investigate whether such evidence does exist.” 
        
       
      
    94 The reference to s 192 in this passage gives the impression that his Honour has misdirected himself. Both the appellant and the Crown agree that s 192 does not contain the relevant test. However, it may well be that what his Honour meant by the reference to s 192 was that he had considered the subpoena in light of the nature of the proceedings and the importance of the evidence (see ss 192(2)(c) and (d)). This would be consistent with what Gibbs J said in Alister v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 404 at 414: 
     
      
       
        
        “the court must attach special weight to the fact that the documents may support the defence of an accused person in criminal proceedings. Although a mere ‘fishing’ expedition can never be allowed it may be enough that it appears to be ‘on the cards’ that the documents will materially assist the defence.” 
        
       
      
    95 If what Ducker ADCJ meant by his reference to s 192 was that he had had regard to the fact that the subpoena was being sought by a defendant in a criminal trial, and to the question of whether or not the evidence being sought could materially assist his case, then his Honour did not in fact misdirect himself. His choice of words was perhaps inapt, but the substance of his Honour’s decision was correct. In this regard, it is worth noting what Simpson J said in a different context in R v Anna Zhang [2005] NSWCCA 437 at 145: 
     
      
       
        
        “Bearing in mind that reasons such as these are given under considerable pressure, during the course of a criminal trial, with a jury waiting, and without the luxury of time for reflection and refinement of expression, it seems to me that, although the steps in the process may have been, to an extent, concertinaed, the reasons suggest that the correct questions were addressed.” 
        
       
      
    96 Ducker ADCJ was correct to find that the subpoenaed documents had no legitimate forensic purpose. The appellant’s case was that either the police or the informer had “set him up.” Even if this was true, it was hardly likely that the appellant would find evidence supporting this assertion in documents made and retained by the police force. If it was the police who “set up” the appellant – and I in no way imply that this was the case – then it would seem highly improbable that they would make a permanent record of their own corruption. To my mind the appellant was “fishing” for evidence. It could not be said that it was “on the cards” that the subpoenaed information would materially assist the defence. At its highest the appellant’s claim was that “I wish to see the document to see if it may assist my case.” This is precisely what Mahoney AP said was insufficient in Carroll v Attorney General for NSW (1993) 70 A Crim R 162 at 182. 
     
      
    97 The appellant’s submission that the decision not to disclose the identity of the informer should have led to a stay of proceedings cannot be supported. A stay will only be granted if otherwise the accused would not receive a fair trial (Dietrich). In the present case, the appellant was entitled to establish that the police had received information from an informer, that the informer was antipathetic to the appellant, and that the informer had told police about the weapons in the clubhouse. Disclosure of the informer’s identity would not have taken the appellant’s case any further than the establishment of these matters could have done. To the extent that any unfairness was occasioned to the appellant by the Crown’s successful public immunity claim, it was not such as to warrant a stay of proceedings. 
     
      
    98 Courts have been reticent to allow the disclosure of the name or identity of an informant. In R v Abdullah & Ors [1999] NSWCCA 188 this Court considered the approach that should be adopted when attempts had been made to discover the identity of a police informer. Barr J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The identity of a police informer has, as a matter of public policy, been protected against disclosure at least since  
        Marks v Beyfus 
         (1890) 25 QBD 494 at 498 and 500. This species of public interest immunity was recognised in many cases, including  
        Duncan & Anor v Cammell Laird and Company Limited 
         [1942] AC 624 at 633 and 634;  
        Rogers v Home Secretary 
         [1973] AC 388 at 401-407;  
        Sankey v Whitlam 
         (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 61; and  
        Cain v Glass (No 2) 
         at 233-234, 242 and 246-247. It covers any material by which a shrewd idea might be conveyed as to the identity of the informer:  
        Rogers v Home Secretary 
         at 401.  
        
       
       
        
        21 The rationale is that if the identity of an informer were liable to be disclosed in a court of law, sources of information would dry up and the police would be hindered in their duty of preventing and detecting crime:  
        D v National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children 
         [1978] AC 171 at 218, 232 and 241;  
        Sankey v Whitlam 
         at 65-66; and  
        Cain v Glass (No 2) 
         at 247.  
        
       
       
        
        22 There is an exception to the rule, in that disclosure of the identity of the informer will be ordered when required to establish the innocence of an accused person.:  
        Marks v Beyfus 
         at 498 and 500;  
        D v National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children 
         at 218 and 232;  
        Sankey v Whitlam 
         at 42. See also  
        Attorney General for New South Wales v Stuart 
         (1994) 34 NSWLR 667, in the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL beginning at 669, but particularly at 674 and 675.  
        
       
       
        
        23 This exception was dealt with in the judgment of McHugh J in  
        Cain v Glass (No 2) 
         at 246 and 247. His Honour referred to the judgment of Lord Diplock in  
        D v National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children 
         at 218:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          By the uniform practice of the judges which by the time of  
          Marks v Beyfus 
           25 QBD 494 had already hardened into a rule of law, the balance has fallen upon the side of non-disclosure except whereupon the trial of a defendant for a criminal offence disclosure of the identity of the informer could help to show that the defendant was innocent of the offence. In that case, and in that case only, the balance falls upon the side of disclosure. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        24 Public interest immunity applies as much to proposed oral evidence as well as to the contents of documents:  
        Sankey v Whitlam 
         at 38;  
        Young v Quin 
         (1985) 4 FCR 483 at 485 in the judgment of Bowen CJ;  
        Marks v Beyfus 
         at 491; and  
        Signorotto v Nicholson 
         [1982] VR 413 per Fullagar J at 423 and 424.  
        
       
       
        
        25 His Honour was required in conformity with these authorities to enquire as to the factual basis upon which defence counsel justified the proposed examination. It was only if defence counsel could show that the desired evidence could help to show that the defendant was innocent that the claim of public interest immunity could be rejected and the proposed cross-examination permitted.” 
        
       
      
    99 As the authorities make plain only where revelation of the identity of an informer may assist a person to establish their innocence will the rule requiring that it not be disclosed be varied. In the present case there was nothing to suggest that if the defence knew the name of the informer it would assist his case. That case was that he had no knowledge of the weapons in the storage facility which he claimed were put there by others. The jury had to assess his evidence and the evidence of others who said they had been there against the evidence of Mr Herrity and Ms Windows that no one else had paid the rent or accessed the facility. Defence counsel did not show that the desired evidence could help demonstrate the defendant’s innocence. 
     
      
    100 It was submitted that the defence wished to test the “good faith” of Officer Brereton, one of the investigating police. Even if his credibility was relevant and I cannot see that it was, there was nothing to suggest that the file would be of any assistance in dong so. 
     
      
    101 Beyond these matters the parties to the appeal agreed that it was appropriate for this Court to examine the subpoenaed material. 
     
      
    102 Accordingly, both the confidential affidavit sworn on 13 May 2005 and referred to in the open affidavit of Norman Hazard sworn on 13 May 2005 and the documents exhibited to that affidavit have been considered by this Court. Consideration of those documents leads conclusively to the view that disclosure of the confidential documents would not have helped the appellant to show that he was innocent of the relevant offences. 
     
      
       
      Ground 7: The trial miscarried as his Honour’s summing up was unbalanced and unfair. 
       
      
    103 The trial judge was required to put the case of the parties in a fair and balanced way (see R v Meher [2004] NSWCCA 355). It was submitted by the appellant that his Honour’s summing-up in the present case lacked balance and contained rhetorical flourishes which were favourable to the prosecution. In this respect the appellant emphasised that his Honour said that he was required to outline the evidence of each of the defence witnesses in order to “satisfy the academics who scrutinize transcripts and summing ups for appeal points.” These remarks were prompted by complaint from defence counsel about the judge’s summary of the defence case. 
     
      
    104 I am not satisfied that the trial miscarried by reason of the trial judge’s summing-up. His Honour was careful to remind the jurors of the evidence of defence witnesses but warned them that his view in relation to the facts was in no way binding upon them. Although his Honour made some sarcastic remarks about the requirements of higher courts and academics, which should not have been made, his Honour was receptive to the views of both counsel and his summing-up to the jury reflected their concerns. 
     
      
       
      Summary submission on conviction 
       
      
    105 For the various reasons to which I have referred the appellant submitted that the trial miscarried. He further submitted that the verdicts of acquittal on counts 2 to 7 showed that the jury had misgivings about the prosecution case and a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s knowledge of the guns in the storage unit.  
     
      
    106 As to the latter submission the explanation for the verdicts of acquittal on counts 2 to 7 may well be because the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant “knowingly” had possession. However, this does not mean that he was able to satisfy the jury that he did not know or perhaps more significantly “could not reasonably be expected to have known” of the presence of the firearms. Section 4A(1)(b) of the Firearms Act is clearly aimed at a situation where the Crown could not prove knowledge to the requisite standard but the accused cannot adequately explain his alleged lack of knowledge of the presence of the weapons. By contrast, the test in s 4 of the Weapons Prohibition Act contains no deeming provisions. It requires the prosecution to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused “knowingly” had custody of the weapon, “knowingly” had the weapon in the custody of another person, or “knowingly” had the weapon in or on any premises, vehicle, vessel or aircraft, whether or not belonging to or occupied by the accused. An accused can quite reasonably be convicted under the Firearms Act provisions while being acquitted under the Weapons Prohibition Act. 
     
      
       
      The proviso 
       
      
    107 Although, in my opinion, none of the other grounds of appeal can be sustained I am satisfied that the evidence of the weapons located at the Club premises should not have been admitted. Does this matter? The Crown submitted, relying on s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act (“the proviso”) that the appeal should in any event be dismissed.  
     
      
    108 In Cornwell v R [2006] NSWCCA 116 I considered the proviso and the appropriate circumstances for its application. The issue had been recently considered by the High Court in Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81 and in Cornwell I endeavoured to summarise the relevant principles in the following terms at [110]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Court identified a number of relevant principles of which the following may be a useful summary: 
         
        
       
      
    · The appellate court must decide whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred; [42] 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · The task of the appellate court is an objective task and is to be carried out by consideration of the record of the trial; [42] 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · the appellate court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence having regard to the whole of the record of the trial including the fact that the jury returned a guilty verdict; [43] 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · it cannot be said that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred unless the appellate court is persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the accused’s guilt of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty; [44] 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · there may be cases where it would be proper to allow the appeal and order a new trial, even though the appellate court was persuaded as to the requisite degree of the appellant’s guilt; [45]” 
     
      
    109 There was no issue that the appellant was the lessee of the premises on which the weapons were found. However, on the first count the appellant carried the onus of satisfying the jury that “he did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known” that the weapons were on the premises or that he was “not in possession of the firearm.” 
     
      
    110 As I have related there was evidence of other members of the motorcycle club having access to the premises. In particular there was the evidence of Mark Laming who said that he took Sniper Edmonds to HI-Tech on a day which could have been 17 October. However, he believed that they went there on a Wednesday because that was the day of the week on which he regularly went to the club premises. The 17 October 2002 was a Thursday. He said that Edmonds deposited a bag which resembled the bag in which the shorn off shotgun was found. There was also evidence that Sniper Edmonds carried animosity toward the appellant. 
     
      
    111 Although the evidence of Mark Laming could possibly explain the presence of the shotgun no explanation for the presence of the other weapons was offered. Various members of the club said they had accessed the storage unit but none of them said they had left a weapon there or saw anyone else put one into the storage facility. In many respects their evidence was difficult to accept where it was in conflict with Mr Herrity and Ms Windows. Although Mr Herrity was criticised, and his recollection was, at least, unsure, it could not be suggested that he was not endeavouring to tell the truth. However, because of the opportunity for access to the storage unit out of hours when the premises were not supervised the opportunity for someone to leave weapons without the management being aware was available. 
     
      
    112 It follows that the evidence of the appellant was of fundamental significance. Before he could discharge the onus which he carried his evidence that he had not recently accessed the facility would have to be accepted by the jury. As a consequence his credit was critical. To my mind the evidence of the weapons at the clubhouse and the directions given to the jury in relation to them could not but have damaged his credit in the minds of the jury. The possible effect was that, whatever the appellant’s evidence of infrequent attendance at the premises and of no recent visit there, the jury were less likely to accept his claim that he had no knowledge of the weapons and that they must have been put there or “planted” by others. 
     
      
    113 In these circumstances I have come to the conclusion that the proviso cannot be applied. I do so with considerable hesitation because to my mind the Crown case is strong. However, because of the prejudice to the appellant and the potential impact on his credit from the admission of the evidence of the weapons at the club I have concluded that a new trial must be ordered. He lost the chance of an acquittal. 
     
      
    114 It is unnecessary to consider the matter of sentence. 
     
      
       
      ORDERS 
       
      1. Appeal upheld. 
       
      2. Conviction quashed and new trial ordered. 
       
      
    115 JAMES J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    116 SIMPSON J: I have read in draft and generally agree with the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL. I wish to add only a little about the grounds concerning the evidence of tendency. It is unnecessary to restate the facts and circumstances. These remarks should be read in conjunction with the principal judgment. 
     
      
    117 Tendency (and coincidence) evidence remain largely misunderstood. In R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338 and R v Anna Zhang [2005] NSWCCA 437 I endeavoured to set out what, in my opinion, is required by the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 in the determination of the tender of tendency evidence under s97 or coincidence evidence under s98. It remains the case that, frequently, the two are treated as interchangeable, or at least as overlapping, and are confused with one another. There are strong suggestions in the language used in the present case in both the decision to admit the evidence of tendency and in the directions to the jury, that that is what happened here. Much of the language used by the trial judge was the language of coincidence evidence, or what was, in pre-Evidence Act days, more commonly known as similar fact evidence, and is not apt in the determination of the admission of evidence tendered as tendency evidence. 
     
      
    118 In this case the Crown served a tendency evidence notice. It did not seek to rely upon the evidence as coincidence evidence. 
     
      
    119 The admission of tendency evidence is governed by s97 of the Evidence Act. That section is relevantly in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        97 The tendency rule  
         
         
        (1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, if: 
         
         
          
          (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence; or 
           
           
          (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    120 “Probative value” is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act as: 
     
      
       
        
        “…the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.” 
         
        
       
      “Significant” in s97 means “important” or “of consequence”: see  
      R v Lockyer 
       (1996) 89 A Crim R 457 per Hunt CJ at CL. The significance of the probative value of tendency evidence depends upon the nature of the fact in issue to which it is said to be relevant and the significance or importance which may be attributed to that evidence in establishing that fact. The distinction between a “fact in issue” and a “fact relevant to a fact in issue” is not to be overlooked. For present purposes, I am prepared to accept, as proposed in Odgers’  
      Uniform Evidence Law 
      , Sixth Edition, that a “fact is issue” means “ultimate fact in issue”. In criminal cases that includes (even if it is not limited to) each factual element of the offence charged. 
       
      
    121 The “tendency” with which s97 is concerned is a tendency to act in a particular way, or a tendency to have a particular state of mind. Evidence tendered for that purpose is not to be admitted if the court (making an assessment of the evidence already adduced and evidence anticipated to be adduced by the party tendering the evidence) thinks that it would not, either by itself or having regard to that other evidence, have significant probative value. 
     
      
    122 In a criminal case a further layer is imposed by s101(2) of the Evidence Act, which provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        101 Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution 
          
         
         
        (1) …  
         
         
        (2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant. 
         
         
        (3)… 
         
         
        (4)…” 
         
        
       
      
    123 The task of assessing the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue (that is, of assessing whether the evidence has probative value) is necessarily committed, even where a jury is the tribunal of fact, to the trial judge. (Where a jury is the tribunal of fact the determination of the extent to which a particular item of evidence does in fact affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue lies within the province of the jury. The role of the judge under s97 is to evaluate the likelihood that the jury would attribute significant probative value to the evidence.) In both Fletcher and Zhang I commented on the peculiarities of the drafting of s101(2), but accepted that to enable it to have any operation, it ought (despite the apparently contrary terminology) to be treated as laying down a rule of admissibility. On that basis, the exercise it involves is also one committed to the trial judge. 
     
      
    124 Underlying s97 is an unstated but obvious premise. That is that proving that a person has a tendency to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind in some way bears upon the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. The fact in issue is the conduct, or state of mind, on a particular occasion relevant to the issues in the proceedings, of the person whose tendency is the subject of the evidence tendered. That is, evidence that a person has or had a tendency to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind is not tendered in a vacuum. It is tendered for the purpose of further proving (or contributing to proving) that, on a particular occasion, that person acted in that way or had that state of mind. Proof of the tendency is no more than a step on the way to proving (usually by inference) that the person acted in that way, or had that state of mind, on the relevant occasion. 
     
      
    125 Where tendency evidence is tendered, the judicial process involves: 
     
      
       
      (i) determining whether the evidence has probative value; that is, determining whether it is capable rationally of affecting the assessment (by the tribunal of fact) of the probability of a fact in issue; 
       
       
      (ii) if it is determined that the evidence is so capable (and therefore has probative value), determining whether that probative value is capable of being perceived by the tribunal of fact as significant (as explained in  
      Lockyer 
      ); 
       
       
      (iii) (in a criminal case) if it is determined that the evidence is capable of being so perceived, applying the s101(2) test, and determining whether the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect upon the defendant. 
       
       
      The first step in the process necessarily further involves the identification of the fact in issue the probability of the existence of which is said to be affected by the evidence tendered as tendency evidence.  
       
      
    126 I have spent some time re-stating these propositions because, I think, it helps to cast some light upon the processes that were undertaken in the present trial. 
     
      
    127 I remind myself that, by s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, an appeal lies to this Court on three grounds: 
     
      
      (i) that the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported; 
       
      (ii) the wrong decision of any question of law; 
       
      (iii) miscarriage of justice on any other ground. 
       
       
      A ground of appeal raising the admission of evidence is a ground asserting the wrong decision of a question of law. That may involve an assertion of error in the process of determining the admission of the evidence, or it may involve assertion of the erroneous application of a rule, or rules, of evidence. 
       
      
    128 A properly drafted tendency evidence notice should, in my opinion, explicitly identify the fact or facts in issue upon which the tendering party asserts the evidence bears. It should also explicitly identify the tendency sought to be proved. 
     
      
    129 Essentially, the evidence proffered as tendency evidence in this case was evidence of the presence of the firearms in the clubhouse, being the clubhouse of an organisation of which the appellant was president, and to which he daily had open access. 
     
      
    130 The tendency evidence notice was, to put it mildly, terse. It expressly identified the appellant as the person whose “tendency” was the subject of the evidence sought to be adduced, and it listed the prosecution statements containing the evidence upon which it proposed to rely as tendency evidence. As the presiding judge has pointed out, at no point did it descend to the specification of the tendency which the evidence was tendered to prove. Nor did it specify any fact (or facts) in issue upon which the evidence was said to bear. 
     
      
    131 Let it now be assumed that, in the present case, the “tendency” of the appellant that the prosecution sought to prove was a tendency to possess firearms. Let it be further assumed that the (or a) fact in issue upon which the evidence was said to bear was the appellant’s knowledge of the presence of the firearms in the storage facility. That was one ultimate fact in issue, and, in the circumstances of this trial, it was the only fact in issue truly in dispute. That firearms were present was accepted. Was the presence of the firearms in the clubhouse rationally capable of affecting the probability of the existence of knowledge in the appellant of the presence of the firearms in the storage facility? If not, then the evidence was not capable of having probative value, and was not admissible. If it were so capable, it still remained for the judge to determine whether that probative value could have been perceived by the jury as “significant”. If the judge assessed that, in all of the circumstances (including his knowledge of the evidence already adduced and that which he then anticipated would be adduced by the prosecution, as the party tendering the evidence), it would not have been open to the jury to regard the probative value of that evidence as “significant” then, again, the section required the exclusion of the evidence. If, on the other hand, the judge concluded that the jury could reasonably have regarded the probative value of the evidence as significant, then the evidence was admissible under s97. In that event, however, s101(2) required a further exercise, of balancing the probative value of evidence against any prejudicial effect it may have had upon the appellant. Unless the assessment were that the probative value substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect, then s101(2) mandated that the evidence could not be used against the appellant. 
     
      
    132 With that analysis as backdrop, I now turn to consider its application in the facts and circumstances of this case. The trial was the second trial of the appellant on these charges. An earlier trial had been conducted in which the jury was unable to agree. By reason of the conduct of that trial, a somewhat clearer than usual picture of the issues truly in dispute was available. The appellant denied knowledge of either cache of firearms; he claimed that all had been deceitfully planted there either by the informer, or by police. Proof of his knowledge of their presence in the storage facility was therefore crucial to the prosecution case. The Crown sought to prove that the appellant did have the requisite knowledge, in the first instance, by quite extensive evidence of his association with and attendance at the storage facility – that it was leased in his name, that it was he who, on a regular basis, paid the lease fees; that it was he who frequently attended; and that few, if any, others had been known to have (regular) access to it. But the Crown also sought to prove the appellant’s knowledge by the evidence – as “tendency evidence” – of the existence of a second arms cache at the clubhouse. The Crown’s written submissions in this Court contained the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “15 The Crown relied upon the evidence of finding the three weapons at the club as being highly probative and going to the question of the accused’s knowledge of the presence of the firearms and other prohibited weapons found at [the storage facility].” 
        
       
      
    133 I am at a loss to understand how the presence of the weapons at the clubhouse – relied upon as tendency evidence – throws any light upon the appellant’s knowledge of the presence of the weapons at the storage facility. (It would be different if the Crown had relied upon the evidence under s98 of the Evidence Act, as rebutting the coincidental presence, without his knowledge, in two locations to which the appellant had ready and frequent access, of illicit firearms, but this it did not do or seek to do. That may, however, explain the use of coincidence evidence language, and the apparent confusion, in the consideration of the admission of the evidence as tendency evidence.) 
     
      
    134 In my opinion, if the fact in issue in respect of which the evidence was tendered was the appellant’s knowledge of the presence of the firearms in the storage facility, then the evidence was not capable of having the requisite probative value. Axiomatically, it was not capable of having significant probative value. 
     
      
    135 Further, if the “tendency” to which the evidence was said to go was an asserted tendency on the part of the appellant to possess illicit firearms, it’s probative value had to be assessed in the light of the evidence showing the extent to which the appellant had exclusive access, not to the storage facility, but to the clubhouse. The evidence as to this is outlined in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL. I incline to the view that evidence of the presence, on the same day, in two locations to which the appellant had ready, frequent and virtually unrestricted access, was capable of establishing a tendency in him to possess firearms. But his tendency to possess firearms cannot be the fact in issue, to prove the probability of the existence of which the evidence was tendered. As I have said earlier, proof of tendency is merely a step in the process of proving particular conduct or particular state of mind at a relevant time. The fact in issue must have been, not the appellant’s tendency to possess firearms, but his possession (with knowledge) of the firearms in the storage facility on 20 November 2002. 
     
      
    136 I am unable to accept that the evidence of the presence of the firearms in the clubhouse was capable of rationally affecting the assessment of the probability of that fact. The evidence was therefore not capable of having probative value. 
     
      
    137 It follows that the evidence was not capable of having significant probative value for the purposes of s97. 
     
      
    138 Even if the evidence of the presence of the firearms in the clubhouse were capable of having probative value, the significance of that probative value had to be assessed in the light of the evidence of the comings and goings from the clubhouse of other members of the club. This must have weakened any inferences available as to the appellant’s possession of those firearms: see R v Filippetti (1978) 13 A Crim R 335. 
     
      
    139 I otherwise agree with the orders proposed by McClellan CJ at CL, and with his Honour’s reasons therefor.

      2003/1364 REGINA v George SEGAL 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT – REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, George Segal, has pleaded guilty to four counts under s31 of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (C’th) of conducting transactions so as to avoid the reporting requirements imposed by that Act. The first two counts charge that he was a party to transactions, while the third and fourth counts charge that he was knowingly concerned in transactions to which one Maureen Bates was a party. He also asks that I take into account five further offences under that same provision, set out on a form under s16BA of the Crimes Act 1914 (C’th). The first three of those relate to transactions to which he was a party, and the fourth and fifth relate to transactions to which Ms Bates was a party and in which he was knowingly concerned.  
     
      
    2 The facts need not be recited at length. They are summarised succinctly in a statement of facts provided by the Crown, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Counts 1 – 2 on Indictment 
        
       
       
        
        Offences 1 – 3 admitted on section 16BA Crimes Act 1914 form 
        
       
       
        
        1. Between 20 March and 27 June 2000, George Segal, using his own name or that of a trust associated with him, undertook a total of 20 transfers of cash in amounts of less than $10,000 to overseas bank accounts… 
        
       
       
        
        2. The transfers were undertaken by way of international fund transfers through banks in Sydney. Customer copies of the bank documentation were located in George Segal’s study during the execution of a search warrant at his residential premises at Thornton Street, Darling Point. 
        
       
       
        
        Counts 3 – 4 on Indictment 
        
       
       
        
        Offences 4 – 5 admitted on section 16BA Crimes Act 1914 form 
        
       
       
        
        3. Between 10 April and 1 June 2000, another third party, Maureen Bates undertook transfers of cash in amounts of less than $10,000 to overseas bank accounts on behalf of George Segal. Bates conducted the cash transfers using her own name and a false name of Maria Grenfell… 
        
       
       
        
        4. Telephone calls were lawfully intercepted between George Segal and Bates in which Segal sought Bates’ availability to conduct the transfers and arrangements were made between them for the transfers to be undertaken. In one instance Segal stated to Bates that he had yet to leave his residence as he was still counting the money. 
        
       
       
        
        5. Other intercepted telephone calls revealed that Bates was receiving payments from George Segal for undertaking the transfers on his behalf. 
        
       
       
        
        6. During the execution of the search warrant at the Thornton Street premises the NCA located the customer copies of the relevant bank transfer documents in George Segal’s study. Also located was a piece of paper with the false name, address and phone number used by Bates. 
        
       
       
        
        7. George Segal’s fingerprints were identified on three bank transfer documents held by the bank. 
        
       
      
    3 Attached to the statement of facts is a schedule of the transactions involved. From that schedule, it appears that the offences the subject of the first two counts on the indictment and the first three matters on the s16BA form involved transactions totalling $176,000. The remaining offences, counts 3 and 4 in the indictment and the fourth and fifth entries on the s16BA form, involved transactions totalling $237,000. The grand total of all the transactions was $413,000.  
     
      
    4 In the offender’s case on sentence I received a statement he had made concerning the circumstances of the offences. In understanding that statement I was assisted by some background explained to me by his solicitor, Mr Bilinski, who appeared for him.  
     
      
    5 The offender was a friend of Ms Ida Ronen. In the late 1990s Ms Ronen was approached by a mutual friend who was involved in a company which traded in diamonds. That person sought Ms Ronen’s assistance in sending money overseas. Ms Ronen, in turn, approached the offender about that matter, saying that he could earn money by charging a small percentage of the amount transferred. Put shortly, the object of this exercise was to enable the diamond trading company to evade Australian taxation of the proceeds of its trading – a practice which, apparently, was not unknown in that industry. 
     
      
    6 It is not necessary to recite in any detail the offender’s statement. It is sufficient to say that he agreed to arrange the transfer of money from time to time, charging 4 percent of the amount involved. For a time, the transfers were effected by his accountant, Ms Helena Rule. Later, he transferred the money himself. He also engaged Ms Maureen Bates, with whom he was having a relationship, to transfer money. She was not well off financially, and he was able to help her by paying her for this service.  
     
      
    7 The offender’s statement suggests a longer course of these dealings than is disclosed by the statement of facts tendered by the Crown. Of course, he is to be sentenced only in respect of the charges which are before me, on the basis of those facts.  
     
      
    8 He was arrested in February 2001 for these matters, as well as his part in a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth. That conspiracy involved a major fraud upon the Australian Taxation Office, in which the principal offenders were Ms Ronen and her two sons and in which the offender’s role was relatively minor.  
     
      
    9 Early in 2003 he provided an induced statement to the authorities in the prosecution of the Ronens. He was granted a conditional undertaking, under s9(6D) of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983, that he would not be prosecuted for that matter. Over several days in June 2004 he gave evidence at the trial of the Ronens before Whealy J. His evidence was described by a senior officer of the Australian Crime Commission as “compelling and credible”, and was assessed as having substantially strengthened the prosecution case against the Ronens. They were found guilty and sentenced to terms of imprisonment. 
     
      
    10 He also supplied information nominating the persons he said were the owners of the money the subject of the offences with which I am dealing. Later, through his solicitor, he expressed his willingness to give evidence against those people. However, the Crime Commission decided not to pursue this information, on the basis that it was provided too long after his arrest and would be unlikely to be corroborated.  
     
      
    11 The only entry in his criminal history is his conviction in a Local Court in March 1999 of three charges under the Social Security Act relating to payments to which he was not entitled. He was ordered to perform 180 hours of community service. He is now seventy-one years old. He has two adult children and three grandchildren. He migrated to this country in 1957 and is an Australian citizen. For about the past three years he has been living with another woman, and that relationship appears to be stable.  
     
      
    12 In recent years he has been earning a modest income, managing bridge clubs. There were tendered on his behalf testimonials from responsible citizens, attesting to his general good character, his voluntary community work, and his remorse about the present offences. His voluntary service to the community includes work at a synagogue in the eastern suburbs and for the community radio station, 2MBSFM. From those testimonials it also appears that his relationship with his present partner is beneficial to him, and that his giving evidence against the Ronens caused him considerable stress and has compromised his relationship with a number of people with whom he and they used associate.13 An offence under s31 of the Financial Transaction Reports Act carries a maximum prison term of five years. Provision is also made for a fine, but I accept that the offender is not in a position to pay a fine in any significant amount. In dealing with the four offences on the indictment, I must have regard to the criminality disclosed by the additional offences on the form under s16BA of the Crimes Act. As will be seen, I have regard to s16A of the Crimes Act and, in particular, such matters in subs(2) as are relevant to the present case. I have approached the question whether a term of imprisonment should be imposed guided by s17A of the same Act.14 I acknowledge the assistance I have been afforded by the written and oral submissions of the Crown prosecutor, and the oral submissions of Mr Bilinski. The Crown prosecutor’s written submissions refer to a number of decided cases which emphasise the undoubted seriousness of offences under the relevant provision of the Financial Transaction Reports Act, and the need for deterrent sentences. Ms Helena Rule, to whom I have earlier referred, was herself prosecuted for offences under s31. In his leading judgment in her appeal against the sentences imposed upon her, Buddin J explained the purpose and significance of the Act and, in particular, of s31, referring to relevant authority: R v Rule [2003] NSWCCA 97 at [6] ff. The legislation is clearly directed to the underground cash economy and to the detection of money laundering and, relevantly for present purposes, tax evasion. 
     
      
    15 Ms Rule appealed unsuccessfully against a sentence of twelve months full-time imprisonment with a recognizance release order after six months. She had pleaded guilty to two counts under s31, embracing a number of transactions in which she had been involved with her husband. The total amount of money transferred was about $427,000, and it would seem that this offender was not involved in all of those transactions. She had no previous convictions, but her criminality was aggravated by her status as an accountant. Given the differences between her case and that of this offender, I do not think that the sentence imposed upon her provides any guidance for the sentencing task which I must undertake. 
     
      
    16 Ms Bates pleaded guilty to four counts under s31, representing her involvement in the offender’s enterprise in the manner which I have outlined in these reasons. She was dealt with in the District Court by Williams DCJ. On two counts, his Honour ordered her to perform 400 hours community service. On the other two counts he sentenced her to concurrent terms of imprisonment for twelve months but, pursuant to s20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act, he directed that she be released forthwith on recognizance to be of good behaviour for the same period. She was forty-one years old at the time of sentence, and had no prior convictions. His Honour noted that she undertook the transactions on behalf of the offender. In dealing with this offender I must, of coarse, have regard to the way in which Williams DCJ dealt with a person who was, to a significant extent, a co-offender. Nevertheless, the distinction between their subjective cases requires a different approach to the sentence of the present offender.  
     
      
    17 These are serious offences, committed by a man who cannot claim an unblemished criminal record. On the other hand, he is an elderly man, whose general good character and contribution to the community are evidenced by the testimonials to which I have referred. He has expressed remorse for his offences and his pleas guilty, albeit delayed and only after negotiation with the Crown, demonstrate a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. His assistance to the authorities in the Ronen matter entitles him to a significant measure of leniency, even though he had the benefit of an indemnity from prosecution for his part in that offence. He is also entitled to some recognition, albeit minor, for the assistance he proffered to the authorities in relation to the present matter.  
     
      
    18 At the time of the sentence proceedings before me, he was awaiting sentence at the Downing Centre Local Court for an offence of dishonesty of the kind of which he had been convicted in 1999. I have regard to that fact only insofar as it might bear upon his prospects of rehabilitation. Notwithstanding that matter, I have some confidence that he will not re-offend. Certainly, I think it most unlikely that he will ever again be involved in a criminal enterprise such as this.  
     
      
    19 All that said, I think it appropriate that his criminality be denounced by the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment. However, pursuant to s20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act, I would direct his immediate release on recognizance. Were it not for his pleas of guilty, his remorse and his assistance to the authorities, I would have imposed an aggregate sentence of the order of three years. In the light of those factors, I would reduce that term to two years. Although the offences were committed over a period in excess of three months, they were part of a continuing criminal enterprise and I consider that concurrent sentences are appropriate.  
     
      
    20 I shall consult the parties about how orders should be expressed to give effect to my intention.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    3 KIRBY J: David Sherwood Stinson (the appellant) was charged with a number of offences, arising out of a complaint by a person who will be referred to as ""Ms A"" (the complainant). The indictment may be summarised as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: 
         That, on 4 October 2002, he had sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation, namely, that he maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm upon the complainant. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: 
         Further, that on 4 October 2002, he had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent (in that he inserted his fingers in her anus). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3:  
        Further, that on 4 October 2002, he had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent (namely, vaginal intercourse). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 4: 
         Further, that on 4 October 2002, he had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent (namely, vaginal intercourse). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 5: 
         Further, that on 4 October 2002, he attempted to have sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent (namely, attempted to insert his penis into her mouth). 
        
       
      
    4 Mr Stinson pleaded not guilty to each charge. He stood trial before Phelan DCJ and a jury in Wollongong. He was convicted of an alternative charge in respect of count 1, namely, sexual assault, contrary to s61I Crimes Act 1900, being vaginal intercourse without consent. He was also convicted on counts 3 and 4. He was acquitted on counts 2 and 5. He appeals against his convictions in respect of counts 1, 3 and 4, asserting that they are unreasonable and cannot be supported on the evidence. 
     
      
       
      The Incident 
       
      
    5 Mr Stinson and Ms A met in about 1999. Ms A lived with her four children in Bateman's Bay. Mr Stinson lived in Sydney. He came to Bateman's Bay from time to time to see his children, who resided with his former wife. Having met, they established a relationship. When in Bateman's Bay he would stay at her home. 
     
      
    6 In July 2002, Mr Stinson secured employment in Bateman's Bay. According to the complainant, he then came to her home unannounced with his possessions. She allowed him to move in. They thereafter shared a bedroom. The complainant said, however, that she was not happy with the arrangement. She also said that days before the incident she asked him to find somewhere else to live. 
     
      
    7 On 4 October 2002, Mr Stinson worked between 8.30 am and about 1.00 pm. He then went to the races. At 6.30 pm, or thereabouts, his friends dropped him off at the complainant's home. He was affected by alcohol. It was common ground that she was not pleased to see him. She requested her 21 year old son to ask him to leave. Her son did so, as the appellant acknowledged. 
     
      
    8 However, the appellant did not leave. He retreated to the balcony and smoked cigarettes. The complainant attended to her two younger children, putting them to bed. Her older children went out. 
     
      
    9 The complainant gave evidence that she went downstairs to get away from the appellant. However, he followed her. They had a discussion. She then went upstairs. Again, he followed her. She told him he needed to find somewhere else to stay. She rang a taxi. There was evidence from the taxi driver who came to the premises at 7.45 pm. He waited for about three minutes but no-one came out.  
     
      
    10 Mr Stinson did not leave. According to the complainant, he sarcastically invited her to telephone the police. She did so. On her account, he terminated the call. Mr Stinson acknowledged that Ms A called the police. However, he said she terminated the call when he reminded her that the police may be interested in certain drugs which her oldest son had in his bedroom.  
     
      
    11 Ms A said that she then became fearful. She checked her handbag for her car keys. They were missing. They were in the possession of the appellant. He returned them later that night. He later said that he took them because he intended to buy cigarettes. 
     
      
    12 The complainant said that she retreated to the bathroom. She felt the need to be alone so that she could think. She locked the bathroom door. She ran a bath because she thought that may help her relax. Having got into the bath, she heard the appellant walking down the hallway. She described what he did in these words: (T5 10.6.05) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... working the handle to try and get it undone and then work - got the implement or something to get the handle undone on the bathroom to break in."" 
        
       
      
    13 The bathroom door locked from the inside. An implement was kept on the architrave above the door because the door had a history of malfunctioning. On occasions the children had become locked inside the bathroom. As he broke in, Ms A said that she drew her knees up and covered her breasts with a washer. She described herself as shaking when the appellant: (T5 10.6.05) 
     
      
       
        
        ""busted into the bathroom and he stood against the wall staring at me and shouting - he said, 'you can fuck anyone you like now and find yourself a bigger dick' ..."" 
        
       
      
    14 The complainant said that he grabbed her and pulled her out of the bath, gripping her arms very hard. He dragged her across the hallway, forcing her onto the bed. When examined the next day, she had visible bruising to each elbow, which was photographed. The photographs were an exhibit in the trial. 
     
      
    15 According to the complainant, he then removed his clothing, although she does not remember him doing so. She was frozen and terrified. He sat on top of her chest and began masturbating. He attempted to put his penis into her mouth (count 5). She said this: (T16 4.4.05) 
     
      
       
        
        ""He grabbed my ankle and forced my leg, my right leg back to my right side, backwards against the way a knee can go, like that backwards, and I could hear all the bone breaking and it was like an electric shock going through my body, all the things were torn, ligaments and things were all torn and I had lost any use of my leg."" 
        
       
      
    16 Thereafter he put his penis in her vagina (count 1). After a time the appellant, according to the complainant, said this: (T17 4.4.05) 
     
      
       
        
        ""'I've always wanted to fuck you up the arse', and he rolled me over and tried to do it in my bottom."" 
        
       
      
    17 However, she said he had great difficulty because the muscles in her bottom ""were so tight and tense"". Nonetheless, he forcefully inserted his fingers into her anus (count 2). Ms A said he had not ejaculated. He resumed vaginal intercourse. She said this (being counts 3 and 4): (T18/19 4.4.05) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. You said that he was putting his fingers into your vagina and anus and then also put his penis back in your vagina? 
         
        A. Yeah, I remember him doing that three times. He kept on stopping and masturbating himself and then forcing his penis back into my vagina again."" 
        
       
      
    18 The Crown prosecutor returned to the allegation which was the foundation for count 5, that is that the appellant had attempted to force his penis into her mouth. The transcript is in these terms: (T19 4.4.05) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. You gave evidence earlier at one stage that, of his penis going into your mouth? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can you recall what happened in relation to that? 
         
        A. He was trying to push it into my mouth and I kept my mouth and teeth clenched and he said he would squirt it [into] my eyes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He was sorry? 
         
        A. He would spray my eyes, but he didn't, he couldn't ejaculate and he kept on masturbating himself. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When he had his penis at your mouth area was he saying anything other than what you've just given evidence of, do you recall him saying anything else? 
         
        A. He asked me to suck his dick. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What position was he in relation to you when he had his penis at your mouth? 
         
        A. He was sitting on my chest. I couldn't breath properly. I was asking him to get off my chest, I couldn't breath. He's very heavy."" 
        
       
      
    19 The appellant gave an entirely different account. He said he manipulated the lock to the bathroom door to open it. He then sat on the floor. They discussed their relationship. He told the complainant that if he left he would not come back. On his version, there was no argument. They kissed. He removed her towel. They then went to the bedroom, where he undressed. Thereafter, with her consent, they had intercourse for about fifteen minutes. 
     
      
    20 The complainant, however, according to Mr Stinson, did not seem interested. She did not want to touch him. She just lay there. They ceased intercourse at one point and then resumed. Having resumed, the complainant then said: ""Dave, you don't want to do this."" He became upset at her comment. He responded saying: ""No, I had to think of somebody else."" She then said: (SU 35) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Yes, you'd probably think of my daughter while you were screwing me."" 
        
       
      
    21 The appellant was offended by that comment and became angry. He grabbed her arms, acknowledging that he must have bruised her in the process. 
     
      
    22 Once intercourse had ceased, they continued arguing. Both sobbed as they argued. Then they heard a noise in the kitchen. The complainant endeavoured to scream. The appellant acknowledged that he placed his hand over her mouth. 
     
      
    23 What followed next was the subject of a great deal of evidence. The complainant said that she could not breathe. Her daughter came into the bedroom. The complainant recalled her daughter addressing the appellant, saying: ""Just go"". He responded: ""Where am I to go?"" 
     
      
    24 The daughter gave evidence that she arrived home at 10.15 pm. She heard a high-pitched scream. It was not loud. She dismissed it as a cat. She then heard another muffled scream which was coming from her mother's bedroom. She went to the bedroom and heard her mother say: ""You're hurting me. I can't breathe, get off me"" (T122 6.4.05). She then entered the bedroom. The light in the hallway was on. She was able to see the appellant on top of her mother, in bed. The bedclothes were in disarray. The sheets were on the floor. She was with a friend, Adam, who stood next to the door. Her mother screamed: ""Call the police. David's been hurting me"" (T122 6.4.05). 
     
      
    25 The appellant told the daughter to leave. He said he needed five minutes with her mother. Her mother, meanwhile, was directing her daughter to ""get him out"". The daughter refused to leave the bedroom. She turned her back to enable the appellant to put on his clothes. She told him to leave and he did so. A short time later he returned briefly with the car keys. 
     
      
    26 The daughter's friend, Adam, provided a similar account. He recalled the complainant saying: ""He had me in here; he's been hurting me in here for hours."" Shortly after, Adam spoke to the appellant outside the house. They had a cigarette together. They knew each other, having played together in a band. Adam said that the appellant's speech was slurred. The appellant made the comment: ""Alcohol brings out the worst in the best of us"" (T192 6.4.05) 
     
      
    27 The account given by the appellant was not remarkably different. As mentioned, he acknowledged that the complainant endeavoured to scream. He placed his hand over her mouth. He recalled that the complainant's daughter asked her mother whether she was alright. He acknowledged that she said he had hurt her. He remembered asking the daughter for five minutes to get dressed, and then leaving. He denied that he had forced himself upon the complainant. He denied that he had inserted his fingers into her anus. He had not attempted to force his penis into her mouth. Nor, on his account, had he injured her knee. Indeed, she had told him two weeks earlier that she had slipped in the shower. 
     
      
    28 Family members and Adam described the complainant after she emerged from the bedroom as ""very upset"". She told her daughter that he ""hurt me and he raped me"" (T126 6.4.05). However, she did not want the police called. Indeed, she did not want to tell anyone. She simply wanted to go to bed, which she did. 
     
      
    29 The next morning the complainant's former husband arrived to collect the children. He gave evidence that the complainant was still distressed. She said that she had been raped. He passed this information to her brother who notified the police. The police arrived at 10.05 am that day. One officer described the complainant as ""quiet but upset and crying"". She was taken to Bateman's Bay Hospital. No doctor was immediately available. Ultimately she saw Dr Parekh. Dr Parekh conducted an examination that lasted about an hour. There was no injury to her vagina or anus, although that finding neither confirmed nor negated the history she provided. Her leg was bandaged at the time of the examination. Dr Parekh, however, regarded her knee as normal. There was a complaint of soreness. However there were no positive signs such as swelling or bruising. The doctor acknowledged that mild effusion would not necessarily be evident during a physical examination. There was also evidence that, on 7 November 2002, the complainant was examined by Dr Mathew Nott, an orthopaedic surgeon. On 28 October 2003, he performed arthroscopic surgery which revealed a tear to the medial meniscus of the right knee. 
     
      
    30 There was also evidence that the complainant had seen the appellant after the incident, and had telephoned him. She said she did so because she had been told that he was suicidal and wished to see her. On her account there was no intimacy. She had no further contact. 
     
      
    31 The appellant gave evidence of frequent contact after the incident, with intimacy on a number of occasions. After he left the complainant's home, he shared a house in Bateman's Bay with a Mr Senior. Mr Senior recalled the complainant coming to the home on one occasion. He thought that she and the appellant were ""still in maybe a semi relationship to some degree"". He believed that they went into the bedroom to converse. The appellant was accompanied by a child. 
     
      
       
      Were the verdicts unreasonable? 
       
      
    32 Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, so far as presently relevant, provides: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The court on any appeal under section 5(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported ..."" 
        
       
      
    33 The test to be applied was stated by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 as follows: (at 493) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty."" 
        
       
      
    34 Where the Crown case relies upon multiple counts, and depends fundamentally upon the testimony of one witness, and where the jury finds the accused guilty upon some counts, but not others, the question of inconsistency and unreasonableness arises. In determining whether the verdicts are inconsistent ""the test is one of logic and reasonableness"" (MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348, per Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ at 366). The High Court in MacKenzie adopted the statement of principle as formulated by Devlin J in R v Stone (unreported, 13.12.54), where the task of the appellant was described in these terms: (MacKenzie (supra) at 366) 
     
      
       
        
        ""He must satisfy the court that the two verdicts cannot stand together, meaning thereby that no reasonable jury who had applied their mind properly to the facts in the case could have arrived at the conclusion, and once one assumes that they are an unreasonable jury, or they could not have reasonably come to the conclusion, then the convictions cannot stand."" 
        
       
      
    35 Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ added: (at 367) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Nevertheless, the respect for the function which the law assigns to juries (and the general satisfaction with their performance) have led courts to express repeatedly, in the context both of criminal and civil trials, reluctance to accept a submission that verdicts are inconsistent in the relevant sense.  
        Thus, if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted. 
         If there is some evidence to support the verdict said to be inconsistent, it is not the role of the appellate court, upon this ground, to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury."" (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    36 Here the appellant contends that, upon proper analysis, the verdicts were inconsistent. The events giving rise to the charges occurred within a short time, perhaps two hours, inside a closed bedroom. There were no witnesses. Although members of the family had been present earlier in the evening, and were again present later, they did not witness the conduct giving rise to each charge. The Crown case, therefore, depended entirely upon the complainant's word. The appellant, in sworn evidence, denied her allegations. In these circumstances, the credibility of the complainant was fundamental. She described what occurred in terms which, according to the appellant, left no room for doubt. She was not shaken in cross examination. Yet the jury plainly did not accept her account in respect of the circumstance of aggravation on count 1, nor her evidence in respect of counts 2 and 5. They apparently did accept her evidence in respect of a sexual assault without aggravation in count 1, as well as counts 3 and 4. The differing conclusions on the appellant's argument, cannot be rationalised. They are illogical and unreasonable. On the appellant's case, the matters that caused the jury to reject the complainant's account in respect of the circumstance of aggravation on count 1 and counts 2 and 5 should have led them to reject her account in respect of the remaining counts. 
     
      
    37 The appellant pointed to the following words in Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439, which were said to aptly describe the situation of the complainant in this case, where Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said this: (at 453) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The jury's finding of not guilty on the second count damaged the credibility of the complainant with respect to all counts in the indictment. Implicit in the appellant's acquittal on the second count was a rejection of the complainant's account of the events which were said to give rise to that count. The jury may have acquitted because the unshaken evidence of the appellant's wife and daughter with respect to the absence of opportunity engendered a reasonable doubt about the appellant's guilt on the second count. They may possibly have acquitted because they were of the view that the complainant had fabricated the circumstances giving rise to the second count. Having regard to the convictions on the first and third counts, the latter alternative seems an unlikely explanation of the verdict on the second count. Whatever the explanation may be, however, the jury's rejection of the complainant's account on the second count diminished her overall credibility. The only reasonable conclusion is that the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of her evidence concerning the incident the subject of the second count. Having regard to the terms of the second count, we do not think that the complainant's confusion about whether the offence took place on a Thursday or a Saturday could explain the acquittal on that count. If that was the reason the jury rejected her evidence, they would also have acquitted the appellant on the first count."" 
        
       
      
    38 The Crown responded to these arguments by examining closely the evidence called in respect of each count. There were, according to the Crown, plausible explanations for each verdict, unrelated to the credit of the complainant. 
     
      
    39 In respect of count 1, there were a number of possible explanations, as the appellant conceded in argument. There was no question that the complainant had suffered a medial meniscus tear to her right knee, as found on surgery on 28 October 2003. However, there was an issue of causation. When did it occur? The appellant suggested that it may have arisen when she slipped in the shower two weeks before the incident. The complainant, on the other hand, provided a graphic account of the circumstances in which it had occurred, in the course of being manhandled by the appellant. On the other hand Dr Parekh, who examined the complainant the next day, noted the knee as being normal. To add to the confusion, Const Lisa Hyne, in the notes she made in her notebook the following day, made no reference to the knee. On the other hand, the complainant's daughter and others, including Const Hyne, saw her limping or walking slowly the next day. 
     
      
    40 There was also a further issue, which may well explain why the jury ultimately had doubt in respect of the aggravated form of sexual assault charged in count 1. The circumstance of aggravation obliged the Crown to prove that the actual bodily harm was ""maliciously"" inflicted. Whilst there could be no question that the tear to the medial meniscus was actual bodily harm, his Honour explained what was required to establish that the injury was maliciously inflicted in these terms: (SU 18) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Now what is meant by maliciously? First of all it has the Latin/French 'mal' in it meaning bad, so it is a bad intention so that it means in law that it was done intentionally without lawful excuse. There is no suggestion in this case that it would be with lawful excuse. So that goes to the word intention, he had the intention to inflict actual bodily harm."" 
        
       
      
    41 Since the jury convicted the appellant on the alternative charge of sexual assault, it was therefore satisfied that there had been sexual intercourse without consent, the appellant knowing that the complainant was not consenting. The rejection of the circumstance of aggravation meant either that the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about causation, or the appellant's intention to inflict the injury which was suffered. 
     
      
    42 Count 2 was, according to counsel for the appellant, the subject of some confusion as to the way in which the Crown put its case. When the Crown opened, he said this: (T10 4.4.05) 
     
      
       
        
        ""You will then hear that the second incident is when he was trying to force his penis into her anus and vagina, and you will hear that she felt something penetrate her anus which caused her great pain, and at the time she was continuing to struggle. So that penetration of her anus is the second count."" 
        
       
      
    43 The penetration ultimately relied upon by the Crown was penetration of the anus by the appellant's finger. The Crown addressed upon that basis in his closing address. His Honour thereafter summed up on the same basis, helpfully reminding the jury of the evidence. He said this: (SU 21) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Now the evidence relevant to that particular charge is in these terms. You may remember that first of all she said he had told her 'I've always wanted to fuck you up the arse', and he rolled her over 'and tried to do it into my bottom'. Now that is a factual position that is not the subject of a charge."" 
        
       
      
    44 His Honour continued: (SU 22) 
     
      
       
        
        ""She said that he could not do it successfully, that is the penis 'but he kept on trying so that then his arms and his hands were so strong he kept on trying to force his fingers into my bottom and vagina and it was very painful and terrifying', and again he tried to insert them into the vagina and there is no charge in relation to that matter either, but it forms the same category of context, and she was asked: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          'Q. And what did you feel firstly in your anus when he was doing that? 
           
          A. His fingers pushing in really hard. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. Into your anus? 
           
          A. Yes.'"" 
          
         
        
       
      
    45 His Honour then reminded the jury of the evidence given by the complainant in cross examination, including the following: (SU 22/23) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. And are you saying that his penis, sorry his fingers went inside your anus and inside your vagina at this point? 
         
        A. He had great difficulty because my muscles in my bottom were so tight and tense and I wasn't going to allow him to do it, but he was forcing really hard and it really hurt. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you felt pain inside your anus? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What were you doing whilst he was doing this to you, fingers in your anus and vagina? 
         
        A. Trying to stop him. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What were you actually doing? 
         
        A. Asking him to stop, pushing him away and to calm him down."" 
        
       
      
    46 His Honour then gave the following instructions: (SU 23) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Now that scenario might suggest that the fingers did not or finger did not penetrate the anus. If that were so then two things might follow. One is that you are not persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that there was an act of intercourse in the sense that the fingers did not penetrate or had not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt to have penetrated, or that there was an attempt by him, an alternative verdict which is allowable in this case."" 
        
       
      
    47 Having dealt with the elements of an attempt, his Honour concluded his instructions on this aspect with these words: (SU 23/24) 
     
      
       
        
        ""So that on that evidence the Crown would put to you that there is evidence that proves beyond reasonable doubt if you were to accept that as establishing that there had been entry of the finger into the anus. On what she said initially in chief it might be dubious on that evidence that there was an entry. However, as I say to you that might involve the issue of whether he had attempted to insert his finger or fingers into her anus and been unsuccessful, and if you have not been satisfied that the offender is - start again ... - if you are not satisfied that the accused is guilty of the crime charged you must find him not guilty ..."" 
        
       
      
    48 The jury was entitled to conclude, according to the Crown, that whilst the complainant was truthful, she may have been mistaken as to whether there had been actual penetration of her anus. 
     
      
    49 The final count, in respect of which the jury returned a not guilty verdict, was the fifth count. The fifth count, it will be remembered, charged an attempt by the appellant to insert his penis into the complainant's mouth. Again, the evidence was confused. The complainant said that the appellant was sitting on her chest masturbating. She added: ""I just felt his penis touching my mouth"". She did not suggest penetration. She had her mouth and teeth clenched. The Crown submission on this appeal was in these terms:  
     
      
       
        
        ""43. Again the jury was entitled to conclude that the complainant was being truthful but that her description of events was such that they were not convinced that the appellant's actions amounted to more than mere preparation. This is understandable given that the complainant's recollection of the sequence in which the events occurred was confused."" 
        
       
      
    50 Count 1 (without the matter of aggravation) and counts 3 and 4, in contrast, were allegations of penile vaginal intercourse. The only issue was consent. The complainant's allegations were consistent with her complaint to family members and the police. She said that she had been raped. She told Const Lisa Hyne the next day, as recorded in her notebook, the following:  
     
      
       
        
        ""... he forced me onto my bed and started on me for ages""; ""he pulled my legs opened, he held my arms on top body down""; ""his penis penetrated my vagina""; ""I struggled for about an hour and a half""; ""until my daughter Channell came home with her boyfriend"". 
        
       
      
    51 The complainant also provided the police with a statement made the next day. The statement included these words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I can remember three specific instances where his penis was inside my vagina."" 
        
       
      
    52 On the Crown submission, the guilty verdicts on counts 1, 3 and 4 reflected each act of penetration, and an acceptance by the jury that there had been no consent. The Crown said this:  
     
      
       
        
        ""46. It is the Crown's primary submission that the verdicts of acquittal are capable of explanation which do not impact upon the complainant's credibility on other counts."" 
        
       
      
    53 I accept that submission. Each count in the Crown case involved the fundamental proposition that the complainant had been overpowered by the appellant and subjected to various forms of intercourse to which she did not consent. In circumstances where the jury had returned guilty verdicts on some counts but not others, one can well understand that an issue of inconsistency arises. However, I accept that the different verdicts may properly be reconciled in the manner suggested by the Crown. Indeed, as mentioned, the appellant in argument acknowledged that the matter of aggravation in count 1, and the differing issue arising from the charge of attempt in count 5, were relevant points of distinction. Dealing with a similar allegation in another case, the following comments by King CJ (Olsson and O'Loughlin JJ agreeing) in R v Kirkman (1987) 44 SASR 591, are apposite to this case: (at 592) 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is to be remembered, however, that the jury were on the third count required to be satisfied that the appellant intended to insert his penis into the mouth of the alleged victim. This of necessity had to be a matter of inference. It seems to me that it was reasonably open to the jury to accept in substance what the alleged victim said about the incident but still not be satisfied that the precise detail on the appellant's movements were as she described them or that her interpretation of them was correct. It seems to me it was open to the jury to reach the conclusion that it was not satisfied to the requisite degree that the appellant's movements could be interpreted only as indicating an intention to force his penis into the alleged victim's mouth. I think for that reason alone it is fallacious to interpret the jury's verdicts as being inconsistent with one another."" 
        
       
      
    54 In respect of count 2, which alleged the insertion by the appellant of his finger in the complainant's anus, there was a real issue as to whether there had been intentional penetration of the anus. It is unsurprising on the evidence that the jury should have entertained a doubt. The doubt did not suggest a rejection of the complainant's assertion that she had been overpowered and had not consented to the appellant's conduct. 
     
      
    55 The verdicts therefore can be rationally explained in a way which does not require an inference of inconsistency. The issue remains whether the verdicts were unreasonable and whether, on the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the appellant's guilt in respect of counts 1, 3 and 4. 
     
      
    56 I believe that the verdicts were reasonable. There was much common ground as to what happened that evening before about 7.30 pm and after about 10.15 pm. That material is capable of providing insight into what happened in the bedroom in the two hours or so in between. The appellant was affected by alcohol. The complainant was displeased by his presence when he arrived at about 6.30 pm. Through her son, she asked him to leave. He did not do so. She then asked him herself. She called a taxi. She even called the police, although she did not ultimately speak to them. Again, he did not leave. She ultimately locked herself in the bathroom. The appellant used an implement above the bathroom door to obtain access. Although he gave a different explanation, the complainant had bruising to both arms, near the elbow, as demonstrated by photographs taken the next day. When she heard voices, shortly after 10.15 pm, she attempted to scream. Her screams were muffled by the appellant placing his hand over her mouth. When her daughter and her friend, Adam, came to the bedroom door, the complainant stated that the appellant had been hurting her. So concerned was her daughter, that she refused to leave her mother alone with the appellant. Instead she turned her back whilst he got dressed and then left. The complainant was visibly distressed. She complained of having been raped. She was still distressed the next day when she repeated her complaints to her former husband and the police. These matters were not contentious, apart from the cause of the bruising. 
     
      
    57 It was implausible in that context to suggest, as the appellant did, that once inside the bathroom, having penetrated the locked door, the complainant changed her attitude; that she embraced him and willingly accompanied him to the bedroom to engage in sexual intercourse. It is unsurprising that the jury rejected his account as a reasonable possibility. 
     
      
       
      Order. 
       
      
    58 The order I propose is that the appeal should be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: Abass Osman seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 a decision by Bell J refusing to order that he be separately tried on two counts of murder. The application was heard and dismissed by this Court on 9 June 2006. These are my reasons for joining in the making of that order.  
     
      
    2 Osman has been charged along with Adnan Darwiche, Naseam El-Zeyat and Ramzi Aouad with the murder of Ziad Razzak and Mervat Nemra. The charges are counts 6 and 7 on an indictment which contains 7 counts in all. This indictment has been substituted for an indictment which previously contained ten counts. 
     
      
    3 The charges against Osman arise from events which are shortly referred to as “the Lawford Street shooting.” The charges were preferred ex-officio against each accused. Bell J summarised the counts on the original indictment in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Count 1: On 27 August 2003 at Condell Park Adnan Darwiche and Abdul Darwiche shot at Farouk Razzak with intent to murder him (the Yanderra Street shooting). 
        
       
       
        
        Counts 2-4 charged Adnan Darwiche with firearm offences committed on 28 November 2003, the date of his arrest. 
        
       
       
        
        Counts 5-7 charged each of the accused with offences arising out of a shooting at premises in Lawford Street, Greenacre on 14 October 2003 (the Lawford Street shooting). Count 5 charged the murder of Ziad Razzak. Count 6 charged the murder of Mervat Nemra. Count 7 charged the offence of shooting at Ali Hamka with intent to murder. 
        
       
       
        
        Counts 8, 9 and 10 arose out of the shooting of Ahmed Fahda at the AP Service Station in Punchbowl on 30 October 2003. Count 8 charged Adnan Darwiche with soliciting the murder. Count 9 charged Naseam El-Zeyat and Ramzi Aouad with murder. Count 10 charged Adnan Darwiche as an accessory after the fact to the murder of Ahmed Fahda.” 
        
       
      
    4 Various motions for separate trials were filed by each of the accused. They were all rejected by her Honour. Only Osman has pursued an appeal. 
     
      
    5 A trial of Abdul Darwiche in relation to the shooting of Farouk Razzak has already been completed before Bell J and a jury. The present charges, apart from the firearm charges, arise from a series of events which allegedly emanate from feuding amongst family groups within the community. A chronological history of the alleged events is set out by Bell J in her judgment on the motion for separate trials. I do not repeat it in these reasons. Her Honour has also conducted a number of Basha style inquiries of Khaled Taleb, W and X. W and Taleb are expected to give evidence against Osman, as well as the others at the trial. They are both indemnified witnesses and an attack upon their credit is anticipated at the trial. 
     
      
    6 Critical to the rejection of the original motion by Her Honour and of present significance are the findings which her Honour made from paras [80] to [99] which are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence of Khaled Taleb is central to the Crown case. The Crown submits that in order to understand his evidence concerning the offences committed in 2003, it is necessary to know the history of hostility between Adnan Darwiche and Bilal Razzak dating back to events in 2001, and the peace deal that was brokered following the shooting of Bilal Razzak. 
         
         
        On the Crown case, while it is true to say that the motive for the Yanderra Street shooting was the belief that Ziad and Gehad Razzak had shot Khaled Taleb, the significance of that event was that it was a breach of the peace agreement (previously brokered between the groups). 
         
         
        It is the Crown case that Adnan Darwiche had abandoned his drug dealing activities in 2002 and in the first half of 2003. To confine the Crown in terms of an understanding of the motive and the relationship between Adnan Darwiche and members of the Razzak family to events in mid 2003 when dealing with the Yanderra Street shooting and the later offences, in the Crown's submission, would be to present an incomplete account. I accept that is so. 
         
         
        I consider that on the trial of Adnan Darwiche for the offences that occurred in 2003, it is in each case open to the Crown to lead evidence of the dispute between him and Bilal Razzak in 2001, the peace agreement and its subsequent breach. 
         
         
        The ballistics evidence linking the two SKS style rifles used in the Yanderra Street shooting with the two weapons used in the Lawford Street shooting, and linking the pistol used in the Sir Joseph Banks Street shooting to the Lawford Street shooting, is admissible in the Crown case on the Lawford Street counts. 
         
         
        I consider that the joinder of the counts charging the shooting of Bilal Razzak in an indictment charging Adnan Darwiche with the Yanderra Street shooting and the Lawford Street shooting to be proper, subject to a consideration of whether any counts should be separated in order to avoid prejudice to the accused. 
         
         
        I have considered whether the murder of Ali Abdul Razzak may be in a different category. There is evidence of an additional and discrete motive for that killing. There is no ballistics or other forensic evidence to link the commission of this offence to the other offences. 
         
         
        On the Crown case, it is open to consider the motive for the murder of Ali Abdul Razzak to be a combination of ill will arising out of the deceased's poor treatment of Khadjie Darwiche and the accused's hostility to members of the Razzak family following the breach of the peace agreement. There is evidence which, if accepted, points to the accused as claiming to have a motive to kill members of the Razzak family as at 27 August 2003. 
         
         
        It will be recalled that shortly after the shooting of Ali Abdul Razzak, Taleb says that Darwiche told him he had killed the deceased, and on the occasion of this admission, that Darwiche kept saying, ""See what I done for you, see.” 
         
         
        Khaled Taleb asserts his belief that Darwiche's real motive was his hatred of Ali Abdul Razzak over his treatment of Khadjie. Be that as it may, in order to understand Taleb's evidence of the admission, it is necessary to know something of the background, including the initial dispute, the peace agreement, and its breach. 
         
         
        Khaled Taleb gives an account of meeting Adnan Darwiche and Ramzi Aouad in a park near Adnan Darwiche's unit on the night of Ziad Razzak's funeral. Adnan Darwiche challenged him, saying that Gehad Razzak had told someone that Taleb was speaking to the police. Darwiche exhibited anxiety that Taleb may be wearing a listening device. In the course of this meeting, Darwiche asked Taleb, ""What did you kill Ali for?"" and ""Who done Greenacre?” Taleb admitted to the commission of both offences. He says that he did so because he understood that Darwiche was playing “mind games” with him, and pressing him to admit to the offences lest he was carrying a concealed listening device. 
         
         
        Khaled Taleb fled from New South Wales following this incident. On his account he feared that Adnan Darwiche and Ramzi Aouad would kill him. 
         
         
        X gives an account of a conversation with Adnan Darwiche that took place in November 2003, some time after Khaled Taleb left the jurisdiction. In this conversation, Darwiche expressed concerns about whether X and Y could be trusted, in the context that both had been present during discussions on 30 October 2003 when Darwiche and his associates had discussed the murder of Ahmed Fahda. 
         
         
        In the course of the November discussion, X says that Darwiche said to him: 
         
         
        Brother look, look at that dog Crazy [Khaled Taleb] half this drama is what they done to him and look, he ripped me and took off. I thought he was one of my closest brothers … he took off to Lebanon but he’ll be back. When he comes back I’m going to fuck him … X, don’t think that one day I just woke up and went crazy and started killing people. I went to a Sheik and told him everything that had happened from the day I paid them for that dog Bill (referring to Bilal Razzak), everything. They started this thing again. It was over that day I paid them that money. … Yeah it was sorted out in front of the Sheik, everything was sweet. When I went to the Haj (referring to Mecca) they grew balls and wanted to be hard cunts, they went and shot Crazy. … They’re the dogs that started it, if it wasn’t for them none of this would have started.  
         
         
        It is to be anticipated that a substantial attack will be made on Khaled Taleb's credit. It is reasonable to anticipate that it will be put to Khaled Taleb that his detailed knowledge of the events charged against Adnan Darwiche derives from the fact that he was the shooter in each case. 
         
         
        On the trial of the Lawford Street counts, it is to be expected that Khaled Taleb will be cross-examined to prove his admission to have, ""Done Greenacre. . . me and my Asian mates.” 
         
         
        On the trial of the count charging the murder of Ali Abdul Razzak, it is to be anticipated that Khaled Taleb will be cross-examined as to his admission, ""I shot Ali, I did the shooting at Greenacre I did the lot"". 
         
         
        The assessment of Taleb's explanation for the admissions that he made to Darwiche, and of X's evidence of the things Darwiche said to him at the November meeting, seem to me to require an understanding of the whole context. 
         
         
        I have concluded that the murder of Ali Abdul Razzak is connected with the other offences with which Adnan Darwiche is charged, and that it is open to the Crown to lead evidence of the motive, namely the breaking of the peace agreement brokered after the shooting of Bilal Razzak. 
         
         
        The joinder in the one indictment of a count charging Adnan Darwiche with the murder of Ali Abdul Razzak, together with the other counts, is in my opinion proper, subject to a consideration of whether its inclusion would prejudice the fair trial of the accused.” 
        
       
      
    7 Her Honour dealt with Osman’s application for a separate trial in relation to the Lawford Street shooting together with the similar application made by Adnan Darwiche. Her Honour’s discussion of the issue and relevant findings were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “I turn now to the application made by Adnan Darwiche that his trial for the Lawford Street shooting proceed separately to the trial of his co-accused, Abbas Osman. This application may conveniently be dealt with together with the application made by Abbas Osman for a separate trial. 
         
         
        The Crown case in relation to the two Lawford Street counts is that the four accused were a party to a joint criminal enterprise. The starting point is that they should be tried jointly:  
        Webb and Hay v R 
         (1994) 181 CLR 41. The principles that are to be applied in determining whether to grant a separate trial are those enunciated by Hunt CJ at CL in  
        Middis 
         and which were approved in  
        R v Baartman 
         (unreported) NSW CCA 6 October 1994: 
         
         
        1. Where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against another or the other accused to be jointly tried with him; and 
         
         
        2. where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible against him; and  
         
         
        3. where there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material,  
         
         
        a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges against the applicant.  
         
         
        It falls to the applicant for a separate trial to establish that injustice would be occasioned by a joint trial. In support of his application Adnan Darwiche points to evidence that the Crown proposes to lead in its case against Abbas Osman, and which it does not tender in its case against him. W says that prior to the shooting Abbas Osman drove him past the Lawford Street premises saying, ""Just drive past, I don't want the Razzaks to recognise the car or me. That's not the way they are going to do it. I am going to be in the hotty waiting for them on Roberts Road. Eddie, Fidel and Erdt are going to run down, they are soldiers"" (Statement 21 November 2004 at [9]).  
         
         
        W gives evidence against Adnan Darwiche of statements made by the latter in a conversation with Abbas Osman, including that Abbas was to be the driver. It is to be anticipated that Adnan Darwiche will mount an attack on the credit of W. It is also to be anticipated that Abbas Osman will challenge the evidence of W. 
         
         
        The Crown case against each accused in relation to the Lawford Street count may be broadly described as being of the same character. It depends on an acceptance of the evidence of indemnified witnesses, who describe aspects of the planning of the offence and of various admissions said to have been made by the accused. The evidence against Adnan Darwiche is not significantly weaker than the case against his co-accused. 
         
         
        I do not consider that there is a risk that the jury may approach the matter on the basis that they do not accept W's evidence in the case against Adnan Darwiche (taken with the other evidence) as establishing his guilt, but nonetheless reason to that conclusion, after taking into account (contrary to directions) W's evidence of the things Osman said to him.  
         
         
        The jury will be directed as to the evidence that is available in relation to the case against each accused. I do not consider that prejudice that may not be cured by direction will flow to Adnan Darwiche by reason of the evidence admitted in the case against Abbas Osman of his conversation with W. 
         
         
        Ms McSpedden (who appeared for Osman) submitted that the trial of Abbas Osman should proceed separately to the trial of Adnan Darwiche on counts 1 to 5 in the proposed indictment, and that he should be tried separately from Adnan Darwiche.  
         
         
        When the applications for separation first came on for hearing on 8 and 9 December 2005 the accused Osman was represented by Ms Francis of counsel. In her submission the first issue that it was necessary for me to determine with respect to the inclusion of counts against her client in the August indictment was whether the provisions of s 29(2) of the CPA had been met. It was submitted that the provisions of sub 2(c) did not permit the joinder of counts against Abbas Osman since the other counts in the indictment, even if forming part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character, were not charged against Abbas Osman.  
         
         
        Section 29 was inserted into the  
        Criminal Procedure Act 
         by the  
        Criminal Procedure Amendment (Justices and Local Courts) Act 
         2001. It provides as follows: 
         
         
        29 When more than one offence may be heard at the same time 
         
         
        (1) A court may hear and determine together proceedings related to 2 or more offences alleged to have been committed by the same accused person in any of the following circumstances: 
         
         
        (a) the accused person and the prosecutor consent, 
         
         
        (b) the offences arise out of the same set of circumstances, 
         
         
        (c) the offences form or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character. 
         
         
        (2) A court may hear and determine together proceedings related to offences alleged to have been committed by 2 or more accused persons in any of the following circumstances: 
         
         
        (a) the accused persons and the prosecutor consent, 
         
         
        (b) the offences arise out of the same set of circumstances, 
         
         
        (c) the offences form or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character. 
         
         
        (3) Proceedings related to 2 or more offences or 2 or more accused persons may not be heard together if the court is of the opinion that the matters ought to be heard and determined separately in the interests of justice. 
         
         
        Ms Francis noted that the provisions of s 29 had been previously enacted in s 78A of the  
        Justices Act 
         1902. In her submission the incorporation of the provision into Pt 3 of the CPA has effected a material change to the law with respect to the joinder of offences on indictment.  
         
         
        Section 78A was inserted into the  
        Justices Act 
         by the  
        Justices (Amendment) Act  
        1987. The reason for its enactment appears to have been in order to overcome the requirement for the consent of one or more defendants, or for related charges against the one defendant, before they might be heard together by a magistrate. When the Bill was read for the second time in the Legislative Assembly the Attorney General said this: 
         
         
        The second purpose of the Bill is to insert a new section 78A of the Justices Act to enable summary matters involving one or more defendants, or related charges against one defendant, to be heard together without the consent of the parties when the charges arise out of the same set of circumstances or are, or form part of, a series of offences of the same or a similar character. Provision is made also to enable multiple related matters to be heard together where these criteria are not met but the prosecution and the defence both consent. In all of these circumstances the magistrate hearing the matters will retain a discretion to order that the charges be heard separately if he or she considers it is interests of justice to do so. Under the existing section 78A of the Justices Act charges involving joint defendants or related charges against a single defendant may be heard together only if both parties consent. It is therefore possible for a party to force a separate hearing for each matter merely by withholding consent, even though common sense would suggest that the matters be heard together. The result is a duplication of evidence, gross inconvenience and additional expense to witnesses, and the wasting of valuable court time. 
         
         
        By removing the prerequisite of consent the procedure in the Local Courts will be consistent with that adopted by the higher courts. In both the District Court and Supreme Court the judge has a discretion to hear charges at the same time, irrespective of the number of accused persons, and does not rely upon the consent of the accused or the prosecution. (Hansard, Proceedings of the Legislative Assembly, 11 November 1987, p 15833). 
         
         
        The Criminal Procedure Amendment (Justices and Local Courts) Act 
         was introduced, together with the  
        Justices Legislation Repeal and Amendment Act 
         and the  
        Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 
        . This parcel of legislation effected a number of substantial changes to the operation of Local Courts. It is not clear that the inclusion of s 29 in Pt 3 of the CPA was intended to effect material change to the law with respect to the joinder of offences on indictment. 
         
         
        Section 23 of the  
        Criminal Procedure Act 
         provides inter alia that up to three counts may be inserted in the same indictment against the same person for distinct offences of the same kind committed against the same person. This provision was previously found in s 370 of the  
        Crimes Act 
        . It was considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
        R v Hass  
        [1972] 1 NSWLR 589 (which is not reported on this point). In that case the Court observed: 
         
         
        Whilst the Indictment Act 1915 has not in substantial degree been adopted in New South Wales, the common law rule as applied in this State, that any number of counts may be included in the one indictment charging different felonies, was always subject to the power of the court to call upon the Crown Prosecutor to elect upon which counts he would proceed. This is confirmed by s 365(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 [now s 21(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act] … s 365(2) is in similar terms to s 5(3) of the English Indictments Act 1915. … it is upon this background that s 370 [now s 23 of the Criminal Procedure Act] must be read. Its effect is that the Crown may not be put to its election, or a separate trial be ordered, if the indictment contains three charges of distinct offences of the same kind committed against the same person within a period of six months, with the proviso that counts alternative to those preferred may also be included.  
         
         
        The Court rejected a contention that the inclusion of five counts in the one indictment was contrary to either the common law or to the provisions of s370 of the  
        Crimes Act 
        . 
         
         
        It is not necessary for me to determine what, if any, change to the law relating to the joinder of offences in the indictment has been effected by the introduction of s 29 into Pt 3 of the CPA, since I am satisfied that the offences form or are part of a series of offences of the same or of a similar character. I do not consider the circumstance that the accused Abbas Osman is not charged with each of the offences in the indictment forming part of that series to mean that the provisions of s 29(2)(c) are not met. 
         
         
        Ms McSpedden placed principal reliance in her application on considerations of prejudice. In her submission the proposed indictment exposes her client to prejudice that is analogous to that with which the Court was concerned in  
        R v 
          
        Sheikh 
         [2002] NSW CCA 136. In that case the appellant was charged with offences said to have occurred at the commencement of a series of offences charged in the indictment. Ms McSpedden relied on a passage in the judgment of Justice Ipp (with whose judgment I concurred at [19]): 
         
         
        The alleged offenders are all, or all but one, from the same ethnic group. The details of the offences are likely to arouse extremely hostile feelings against these persons. The common ethnicity of the offenders could well give rise to generalised feelings of disgust and anger. It is possible that the jury may be influenced by such feelings, brought about by the conduct of all the offenders, when considering their verdict in respect of the counts alleged against Sheikh. 
         
         
        I do not consider that the issues with which the Court was concerned in  
        Sheikh 
         are raised in like degree in this application. The significance of the common ethnicity of the accused in the  
        Sheikh 
         matter derived in no small part from the complainant's evidence which included that during the course of a series of humiliating sexual offences she had been subjected to racial taunts. The Lawford Street shooting, on the Crown case, was carried out with the intention of killing members of the Razzak family who happened to be persons of the same ethnic background as the accused. It is no part of the Crown case that the motive for the offences was racially based. 
         
         
        Ms McSpedden complains that her client will have to sit through a lengthy trial at which the focus will be on events with which he has no connection. In her submission this is oppressive. Mr Stanton on behalf of Nasaem El-Zayet made a like submission. On behalf of both Abbas Osman and Nasaem El-Zayet it is noted that none of the evidence relating to motive or relationship has any relevance to the case that the Crown makes against him. In addition each accused complains that the evidence against him is substantially weaker than that which the Crown anticipates leading against Adnan Darwiche and Ramzi Aouad. Each is concerned lest the relatively weak Crown case against him gains strength by the jury impermissibly having recourse to material that is not admissible against him. 
         
         
        It does not seem to me that the case against any accused in relation to the Lawford Street count is significantly weaker than, and different to, that which is admissible against the other accused. I do not consider that there is a risk that the jury will reason towards a finding of guilt in the case against Nasaem El-Zayet or Abbas Osman on the basis of ""guilt by association"" with Adnan Darwiche who is charged with other serious offences in counts 1 to 5 of the indictment. The evidence admissible against each accused can be isolated and appropriate directions given to the jury so as to ensure the fair trial of the accused in each case.” 
        
       
       
      The application for leave to appeal 
       
      
    8 There are two questions raised in this application. Firstly, in the circumstances of the case to be made against Osman, whether the offences with which he is charged form, or are part of, a series of offences of the same or a similar character within the meaning of s 29(2)(c) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. If the answer to the first question is “yes”, the second question raises for consideration whether the “matters ought to be heard and determined separately in the interests of justice” (s 29(3)). 
     
      
    9 With respect to the question arising under s 29(2)(c) counsel for Osman accepted that the various offences alleged against Adnan Darwiche were part of a series for the purposes of s 29(1)(c) but submitted this was not determinative of the issue in relation to the co-offenders. In counsel’s submission the critical issue was whether evidence which was admissible in any of the other counts was admissible against Osman in relation to the counts charged against him. If not, it was submitted that a relevant series of offences could not be identified. Reliance was placed upon the decisions in De Jesus v R (1986) 68 ALR 1; Phillips v The Queen [2006] HCA 4; Regina v Sheikh [2002] NSWCCA 136. 
     
      
    10 To my mind none of the decisions referred to support the construction of s 29(2) contended for by the applicant. In the present case the prospective evidence makes plain that the offences charged on the indictment are intimately related and arise from a series of killings alleged to have taken place as part of a feud between families which has resulted in a number of shootings with fatal consequences. In the ordinary meaning of the words there could be no doubt that the various killings, including the two counts against the applicant, form part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character. The distinction between s 29(1) and 29(2) is not without significance. Section 29(1) is concerned with multiple offences and one offender. Section 29(2) is concerned with both multiple offences and multiple offenders, where the offences are part of a series. This does not raise any expectation that the evidence admissible against one offender must necessarily be admissible against any other offender. 
     
      
    11 De Jesus involved consideration of s 585 of the Criminal Code (WA) in relation to a series of alleged sexual offences by the same offender but perpetrated on different victims. At the trial the accused conceded that the charges were correctly joined. The High Court divided on the correct approach to the question of whether the interests of justice would be served by one trial of all the counts. Because there was no connection between them, the evidence on one count would not be admissible on any other count. In these circumstances the majority concluded that one trial would be inappropriate. The risk that the jury would be unable to separate the evidence admissible on any particular charge was too great. 
     
      
    12 Gibbs CJ summarised the relevant principles by reference to the existing authorities in the these terms at 3-4: 
     
      
       
        
        “The learned trial judge inquired from counsel whether there was any authority in conflict with  
        R v Ludlow 
         [1971] AC 29, in which Lord Pearson, at 39, gave implicit approval to the following statement in  
        R v Kray 
         [1970] 1 QB 125 at 130–1: “… offences cannot be regarded as of a similar character for the purposes of joinder unless some sufficient nexus exists between them. Such nexus is certainly established if the offences are so connected that evidence of one would be admissible on the trial of the other, but it is clear that the rule is not restricted to such cases.”  
         
         
        Lord Pearson, at 41–2, went on to consider the discretion given by s 5(3) of the Indictments Act to order separate trials, and said, at 41, that the judge has no duty to order separate trials under that section “unless in his opinion there is some special feature of the case which would make a joint trial of the several counts prejudicial or embarrassing to the accused and separate trials are required in the interests of justice”. He said that the principle is clearly stated in  
        R v Sims 
         [1946] KB 531 at 536, as follows: “We do not think that the mere fact that evidence is admissible on one count and inadmissible on another is by itself a ground for separate trials: because often the matter can be made clear in the summing up without prejudice to the accused. In such a case as the present, however, it is asking too much to expect any jury when considering one charge to disregard the evidence on the others, and if such evidence is inadmissible, the prejudice created by it would be improper and would be too great for any direction to overcome.”  
         
         
        R v Sims 
         was a case in which the accused was charged in one indictment with several charges of sodomy and gross indecency; it was held that on the trial of one of the counts the evidence would be admissible, and that the joinder was therefore properly made.  
         
        Unfortunately in the present case neither counsel referred the learned judge to the more recent judgments of the House of Lords in  
        R v Boardman 
         [1975] AC 421 or to the decision of this court in  
        Sutton v R 
         (1984) 152 CLR 528. In  
        R v Boardman 
         the accused was charged with homosexual offences involving a number of boys and the trial judge had ruled and directed the jury that the evidence given on a count concerning one boy was admissible as corroborative evidence in relation to the count concerning another boy. The House of Lords held that the judge was entitled to direct the jury as he had done because the evidence was admissible. The case contains an important discussion of the law relating to the admissibility of evidence of similar facts, but we are not concerned with that aspect of the matter. It was accepted by a majority of their Lordships that if the evidence in relation to one count was not admissible on another count there should have been no joinder of the counts. Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone expressed this view succinctly, at 447, where, dealing with counsel's argument, he said: “Strictly speaking, it was submitted that each boy's evidence was inadmissible in considering the other charge. This is somewhat surprising, since, of course, in that event there should have been separate trials …”  
         
         
        Lord Cross of Chelsea, at 459, dealt with the matter rather more fully. He said: “When in a case of this sort the prosecution wishes to adduce ‘similar fact’ evidence which the defence says is inadmissible, the question whether it is admissible ought, if possible, to be decided in the absence of the jury at the outset of the trial and if it is decided that the evidence is inadmissible and the accused is being charged in the same indictment with offences against the other men the charges relating to the different persons ought to be tried separately. If they are tried together the judge will, of course, have to tell the jury that in considering whether the accused is guilty of the offence alleged against him by A they must put out of mind the fact — which they know — that B and C are making similar allegations against him. But, as the Court of Criminal Appeal said in  
        R v Sims 
         [1946] KB 531 at 536, it is asking too much of any jury to tell them to perform mental gymnastics of this sort. If the charges are tried together it is inevitable that the jurors will be influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by the fact that the accused is being charged not with a single offence against one person but with three separate offences against three persons. It is said, I know, that to order separate trials in all these cases would be highly inconvenient. If and so far as this is true it is a reason for doubting the wisdom of the general rule excluding similar fact evidence. But so long as there is that general rule the courts ought to strive to give effect to it loyally and not, while paying lip service to it, in effect let in the inadmissible evidence by trying all the charges together.”  
         
        Lord Wilberforce expressed a similar view, at 442. Although, as I have said, the case concerned homosexual offences, the reasoning of Lord Cross of Chelsea is equally applicable to heterosexual offences since in those cases the risk of prejudice will be equally great. In  
        Sutton v R 
         (a case arising under the law of South Australia) this court applied the same principle to cases of rape. In that case I said (CLR at 531; ALR at 437): “Before us it was accepted by counsel for the prosecution that where an accused is charged with a number of sexual offences, the charges should not be tried together if the evidence on one count is not admissible on another count. That was the view taken by the majority of the House of Lords in  
        Director of Public Prosecutions v Boardman 
         and it is a view consonant with justice …”  
         
         
        Brennan J (CLR at 541–2; ALR at 445) said: “When two or more counts constituting a series of offences of a similar character are joined in the same information, a real risk of prejudice to an accused person may arise from the adverse effect which evidence of his implication in one of the offences charged in the indictment is likely to have upon the jury's mind in deciding whether he is guilty of another of those offences. Where that evidence is not admissible towards proof of his guilt of the other offence, some step must be taken to protect the accused person against the risk of impermissible prejudice. Sometimes a direction to the jury is sufficient to guard against such a risk; sometimes it is not. Where a direction to the jury is not sufficient to guard against such a risk, an application for separate trials should generally be granted.” 
        
       
      
    13 Phillips was also a case which involved a number of unrelated criminal acts of a sexual nature allegedly committed by the same person. Like De Jesus the decision turned upon the prejudice to the accused from the admission of evidence on one count at his trial on the other counts, a prejudice which the High Court said could not be removed by directions given by the trial judge at [79]. 
     
      
       
        
        “Criminal trials in this country are ordinarily focused with high particularity upon specified offences. They are not, as such, a trial of the accused’s character or propensity towards criminal conduct. That is why, in order to permit the admission of evidence relevant to several different offences, the common law requires a high threshold to be passed. The evidence must possess particular probative qualities; a strong degree of probative force; a really material bearing on the issues to be decided. That threshold was not met in this case. It was therefore necessary that the allegations, formulated in the charges brought against the appellant, be separately considered by different juries, uncontaminated by knowledge of other complaints. This is what  
        Pfennig  
        and other decisions of this Court require. To the extent that  
        O’Keefe  
        or other authority suggests otherwise, it does not represent the law. No other outcome would be compatible with the fair trial of the appellant.” 
        
       
      
    14 Sheikh also related to multiple counts of wrongful sexual acts. The alleged offences were described by Ipp JA as “brutal, cruel, callous and horrifying. The alleged offenders are all, or all but one, from the same ethnic group. The details of the offences are likely to arouse extremely hostile feelings against these persons. The common ethnicity of the offenders could well give rise to generalised feelings of disgust and anger. It is possible that the jury may be influenced by such feelings brought about by the conduct of all the offenders, when considering their verdict in respect of the counts against Sheikh.” Because of these considerations this court, by majority, held that a separate trial was required for without it there was a “risk of guilt by association.” Bell J agreed with Ipp JA in this conclusion. Again, the decision is relevant only to the second question which arises in the present case. 
     
      
    15 Reference was also made to R v Kray [1969] 3 All ER 941 which was considered by the High Court in De Jesus. The case involved two counts of murder which were unrelated but for the alleged killer. It was held that to qualify as a series, the offences only required similar features “as to establish a prime facie case that they can properly and conveniently be tried together” (at 944). That decision, although confined in its application by Gibbs CJ in De Jesus, remains relevant to the determination of the first question in the present matter. Although cross admissibility may indicate a series of offences it is not an essential requirement. 
     
      
    16 In the present case the charges against Osman will be supported by evidence that he was the driver of the car involved in the shooting and knowingly participated in the criminal enterprise. Although counsel indicated that Osman’s defence will concentrate upon a denial that he was present at all, it will be inevitable that the background to the particular killings must be explained to the jury.  
     
      
    17 Having regard to the connection between the events which constitute each charge I am satisfied that her Honour was correct in finding that the requirements of s 29(2)(c) were made out. Although in many cases the evidence against one accused, charged together with another accused, may be admissible against both, and may point to there being a series of offences, this is not an essential precondition. 
     
      
    18 With respect to s 29(3) Bell J was in a better position than this Court to exercise the judgment which the sub-section requires. She had heard all the evidence given at the Basha inquiries and is aware of the evidence given at the trial of Abdul Darwiche. 
     
      
    19 The primary attack upon her Honour’s decision was based on the assumption that evidence which may bolster the credit of the Crown witnesses against Osman may be tendered on the other counts, but not be admissible against Osman, making it impossible for the judge to ensure by her directions that Osman receives a fair trial. I am not persuaded that this will be the case. No doubt credit matters will arise but her Honour is aware of the basis of the proposed attack and I am not persuaded that the judgment she has made should be overturned by this Court. 
     
      
    20 There can be no doubt that the background to which the killings with which Osman has been charged will have to be explained by the Crown at the trial. The relevant events would make little sense unless this was done. Inevitably this must involve the jury gaining an understanding of the “feud” which was allegedly taking place leading to the inevitable inference that at the relevant time Osman was aware of the feud and the shootings which had taken place. Of the alleged shootings and killings at least one of those in respect of which Osman is alleged to have been involved is a frightening event involving a hail of bullets fired at premises where an apparently innocent woman was fatally shot. 
     
      
    21 In these circumstances although the whole sequence of events, if proved, suggests a lawless, violent and reckless foray I do not believe there is a reasonable risk that the applicant could be found guilty by reason of his association with the other accused. That association will be plain even if separately tried. 
     
      
    22 Osman’s alleged involvement in two of the series of offences will be the subject of evidence which can be confined to the charges against him by appropriate directions. It is important to bear in mind that the interests of justice involve more than the interests of the accused. As was pointed out in Kray and acknowledged in Sheikh the interests of the Crown, the witnesses and the public must also be considered. 
     
      
    23 The applicant relied on decisions of courts where it could be concluded that the evidence which would be given at the trial would not be admissible against one accused and where the trial judge would have difficulty in giving directions which appropriately confined the use of that evidence see R v Bunting (No 3) (2005) SASR 251; R v Demirok [1976] VR 244; R v Gibb and McKenzie [1983] VR 155 and R v Jones & Waghorn (1991) 55 A Crim R 159. However, even if there are potential difficulties it does not mean that a separate trial must be ordered. In Bunting the Court found that there would be extraordinary difficulty in confining the use which the jury would make of the available evidence and “not without” considerable hesitation “ordered a separate trial” [460]. 
     
      
    24 Nothing has been put before this Court which would persuade me that similar difficulties arise. Bell J has an intimate knowledge of the case against each accused, the evidence to be tendered and the foreseeable line of cross examination. Her Honour was satisfied that the applicant had failed to demonstrate that an injustice would be caused to him from a joint trial. I am not persuaded that this Court should, at this stage of the proceedings determine that her Honour’s decision that the interests of justice do not require a separate trial should be overturned. 
     
      
    25 JOHNSON J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL and the additional remarks of Latham J. 
     
      
    26 LATHAM J: I agree with the reasons of the Chief Judge at Common Law. I wish to add some brief remarks regarding the exercise of the discretion under s 29(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  
     
      
    27 As McClellan CJ at CL has observed at par 19, counsel for the applicant maintained that her client could not receive a fair trial in circumstances where the indemnified Crown witnesses, W and Taleb, would be supported by other independent evidence with respect to the charges against the co-accused, yet not so supported (or to the same extent) with respect to the two charges brought against the applicant. It would be impossible, according to the submissions, for the jury to give separate consideration to the comparatively weaker body of evidence against the applicant, uninfluenced by the fact that the credibility of the indemnified witnesses was bolstered by evidence inadmissible against the applicant. 
     
      
    28 Counsel for the applicant maintained that this type of prejudice would arise, relying upon that part of Bell J’s judgment which summarised the Crown case in relation to the ongoing feud between the Darwiche and the Razzak families (pars [38] – [66]). Two aspects of that summary should be noted. Her Honour was referring to the Crown case at its highest and her summary was prefaced by the observation that it was taken principally from Taleb’s statement (par [38]). True it is that her Honour notes that “there is material from other sources to support some aspects of the history that the Crown relies upon”, but there was nothing placed before this Court which provided a reliable basis for concluding that the indemnified witnesses would be supported to any significant extent on any aspect of their evidence. Indeed, the Crown submitted that there was very little evidence supportive of the indemnified witnesses, either with respect to the charges against the co-accused or the two charges against the applicant.  
     
      
    29 For these additional reasons, I am not persuaded that her Honour’s discretion miscarried.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant pleaded guilty to a total of four offences contained on two indictments: 
     
      
    2 Indictment One - Manslaughter 
     
      
      Crimes Act 1900: s 18(1)(b): maximum penalty 25 years imprisonment. 
       
       
      The applicant pleaded guilty to this charge on 4 July 2005. The offence having occurred on 11 June 2002. 
       
      
    3 Indictment Two: 
     
      
      Count One: maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm; 
       
      Crimes Act 1900: s 35(1)(a): maximum penalty 7 years: 
       
       
      Count Two: maliciously wounding; 
       
      Crimes Act 1900: s 35(1)(a): maximum penalty 7 years; 
       
       
      Count Three: assault in company occasioning actual bodily harm; 
       
      Crimes Act 1900: s 59(2): maximum penalty 7 years. 
       
      
    4 The first count alleged on the second indictment occurred on 9 June 2002 and the second and third counts on 11 June 2002. The applicant pleaded guilty to these counts when arraigned on 23 August 2005. 
     
      
    5 The applicant was sentenced to an effective total term of imprisonment of ten years four months with a non-parole period of seven years. The sentence for the first count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm commenced on 3 December 2002. The commencement date for the remaining sentences was delayed by one year and made concurrent with each other. Accordingly, the sentence imposed for the manslaughter count was nine years four months with a non-parole period of six years and subsumed the remaining sentences. 
     
      
    6 Before the sentencing hearing the representatives of the applicant and the Crown had conferred. The applicant offered to plead guilty to the manslaughter charge. An agreed statement of facts was prepared. They also reached agreement that the Crown and defence would submit that the judge should sentence upon the basis that a discount of 25% should be allowed for the plea of guilty. It was also agreed that the Crown and defence would submit that the non-parole period should be between 4 and 5 years. The sentencing judge was made aware of these agreements.

    7 It is convenient to adopt the facts from the remarks on sentence where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The factual basis upon which the parties ask me to sentence the offender is contained in an agreed statement of facts signed on behalf of the Crown and the offender. The facts can be summarised as follows. All of the offences for which the offender is before the Court and is to be sentenced arose from a course of conduct that commenced with an incident on 9 June 2002. On that day the offender was a security guard employed at a nightclub at Oxford Street. The nightclub was owned by relations of a person known as Hassan Ibrahim. 
         
         
        At about 4.30 am that morning Khaled Hammoud, who was a nephew of the deceased, tried to enter the nightclub along with two other persons. They were forbidden entry and, during a dispute that occurred at the time, one of these persons head butted the manager of the nightclub. The manager retaliated by punching this person and knocked him out. This person was conveyed to hospital but the dispute between the persons seeking entry to the nightclub and the staff continued. During the course of this argument the offender punched Hammoud once to the left side of his face knocking him out and breaking his jaw. The assault by the offender upon Hammoud, which the offender later explained as being to “discipline him”, gives rise to the charge of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm on the second indictment. Hammoud suffered a serious injury to his jaw requiring the insertion of wires. 
         
         
        The deceased was on a trip to Cooma when he learnt of this assault upon his nephew by the offender. There were telephone calls between the deceased and Ibrahim in which threats were made, including a threat by the deceased that he would close down the nightclub. It was agreed that the dispute between the men would be resolved after the deceased returned to Sydney. There is evidence that the deceased was intending to seek reprisal for the assault upon Hammoud and apparently he was known to carry a firearm with him when in public. 
         
         
        There were in Greenacre at the time two motor repair businesses. One called Just Vans was operated by Hammoud and his brother, Abdul. The other was called Automobile Wreckers and was owned by the wife of the offender. These premises were close to one another in Claremont Avenue, Greenacre. On the morning of 11 June there was a meeting at the Just Vans premises between the offender and the deceased. It appears that they reached a truce and deferred until a later time the resolution of the differences arising from the assault upon Hammoud. There was evidence that the meeting ended in both the offender and the deceased embracing. 
         
         
        However, shortly after the deceased’s departure, the brother of Hammoud arrived in Claremont Avenue and verbally abused the offender. The confrontation almost came to blows until bystanders intervened to separate the two men. By this time a large number of men had gathered in the area and were exchanging insults with each other depending upon which faction they happened to support. 
         
         
        At about midday Mr Khalifa, a nephew of the deceased and cousin to the Hammoud brothers, was working on a van in the premises of Just Vans. He was summoned to the rear of the van where he met with a group of about 15 men, one of whom was the offender. He questioned Khalifa as to the whereabouts of the Hammoud brothers. At some stage, when his back was turned to the group, Khalifa was struck by a heavy blow to the back of his head and rendered unconscious. As a result of this attack he suffered a blackened left eye and fractures of a number of facial bones. 
         
         
        The assault upon this person gave rise to the charge of malicious wounding which is the second count in the second indictment. It is alleged that the offender was involved in a joint enterprise with the group of persons who confronted Khalifa and the offender’s plea of guilty acknowledges that, while he was not the person who struck the blow, he was at least a principal in the second degree to the wounding of that victim by encouraging those with him who were, according to the facts, “a group of hostile men adversely disposed to certain Just Van employees”. 
         
         
        The owner of the van upon which Mr Khalifa had been working at the time of his assault was also confronted by one or more of the group of men and without any provocation was struck to the ground and beaten. He suffered bruising to both eyes, lacerations to his face and a bruised wrist. The assault upon this man gives rise to the third count in the second indictment and again the Crown alleges that the offender was part of a joint criminal enterprise to assault this man and was at least a principal in the second degree to the member or members of the group who assaulted him. 
         
         
        At about 1 o’clock the offender rang Ibrahim and complained about the behaviour of Abdul Hammoud, blaming him for in effect disturbing the truce earlier established between himself and the deceased. The call concluded with Ibrahim agreeing to come to the repair shop to meet with the offender. There were arrangements made between various members of the two factions agreeing to meet at the Automobile Wreckers shop. Ibrahim spoke to a person named Hijazi indicating that he should come to the shop and bring the deceased. Hijazi exhorted Ibrahim to calm the situation. 
         
         
        At about 1.40 pm there was a heated argument between the deceased and the offender in Claremont Avenue. The deceased entered the premises of Just Vans and saw the two injured men who had been assaulted by the group accompanying the offender. The argument continued when the two men met up again a short time later as the deceased was approaching the Automobile Wreckers premises. The agreed facts contain the following account of what then happened: 
         
         
          
          ‘… As he stood with his back to a red car, [the deceased] was ‘bear-hugged’ by Mahmoud Hussein an uncle of [the offender], who felt a need to restrain and calm [the deceased] after he noticed [he] appear[ed] to reach towards the waistband of his pants. 
           
           
          While holding [the deceased] in a ‘bear-hug’ face-to-face, Hussein was shot in the top part of his left thigh. The bullet emerged from the lower rear part of that leg. Witnesses reported hearing two loud gun shots about the time Hussein was seen to collapse to the ground. Gunshot powder residue was found on [the deceased’s] hands and the inner waistband of his pants. Four unspent .44 calibre cartridges, one of which bore a firing-pin strike mark on the rear, were found at the scene. The gun had dropped to the ground. Its cylinder might have jarred open on impact and spilled forth the unspent cartridges……..No spent cartridges have ever been recovered.’ 
           
          
         
        I interrupt to note that a person named Hamze removed that weapon from the scene. He was charged with hindering police and I have sentenced him for that offence. The fact sheet states that the Crown accepts that, on the balance of probabilities the deceased possessed a firearm that he fired wounding Hussein in the leg. 
        
       
       
        
        The agreed statement of facts continues: 
        
       
       
        
        Immediately after Hussein had fallen to the ground, [the offender] produced a self-loading .38 calibre pistol from somewhere on his person and fired five rounds at [the deceased]. Five spent .38 cartridges were found at the scene. All were fired from the same gun, which has never been recovered, nor its whereabouts identified to police. [The deceased] was mortally wounded by [the offender’s] gunfire and later died in hospital from those injuries. 
         
         
        The offender immediately fled from the scene and evaded police until his arrest on 3 December 2002. 
         
         
        Dr Duflou carried out an autopsy on the deceased and observed six gunshot wounds to the chest area of the deceased, his left arm and hand. He formed the opinion that the wounds were caused by five gunshots. There were no signs of gunpowder burns, powdering or tattooing on the deceased’s wounds indicating that the shots were probably fired a short distance from the deceased.” 
        
       
      
    8 In relation to subjective matters his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The offender was born in Lebanon and is aged 30. He has one prior conviction in respect of possessing a prohibited drug in 2002 but that is a matter that can be disregarded for present purposes. He is married with 3 children aged 6, 4 and 2 years. I sentenced his wife for an offence of hindering police by providing them with misleading information about the whereabouts of the offender and by otherwise assisting him to avoid apprehension. Other than the offences arising from these incidents, both the offender and his wife have been worthwhile citizens in the community and there are a large number of testimonials as to the offender’s good reputation in the community. They speak highly of his work ethic, his loyalty and diligence and suggest that the conduct giving rise to the present offences is out of character. 
         
         
        There is a psychiatric report prepared by Dr Nielssen in evidence. The offender has never suffered any serious psychiatric illness or mental disorder. However, he has experienced a number of traumatic incidents arising from the involvement of members of his family in conflicts occurring in Lebanon before the offender migrated to Australia and he suffered some loss of hearing as a result of heavy shelling of the neighbourhood in which he lived. As a result it appears that the offender’s intellectual abilities have been diminished. He came to Australia at around the age of 16 years in 1990 and at that time was unable to speak English. Eventually he found a job as a panel beater. Apart from some minor involvement with cocaine, the offender had no problem with alcohol or drugs. 
         
         
        The psychiatrist believed that a head injury suffered by the offender in his childhood might have resulted in some impairment of frontal lobe function resulting in diminution of impulse control. He also thought that the exposure to trauma during childhood was likely to have resulted in an increased startle response. The psychiatrist believed that an increased level of arousal in response to gunshots was another factor contributing to the offender’s behaviour at the time of the shooting. The psychiatrist assessed the offender as having good prospects of rehabilitation. 
         
         
        There was also a psychological report in evidence. Tests indicated that the offender’s IQ falls in the bottom 2 per cent of the population. He was found to lie in the borderline range. The psychologist formed the opinion that the offender had difficulty in thought planning and conceptualising issues resulting in a diminished capacity to fully think through problem situations free from emotional bias, particularly in times of emotional duress. The psychologist thought this would indicate that the offender would tend to act on the spur of the moment without thinking fully through the consequence of his behaviour.” 
        
       
       
      The discount for the plea 
       
      
    9 As I have stated, senior counsel for the applicant submitted at the hearing that the applicant should be sentenced on the basis that he entered his plea of guilty at the earliest reasonable opportunity warranting a discount in the range of 25%. The Crown Prosecutor supported this submission. The Crown Prosecutor indicated that until he was briefed in the matter, the clear view of those then prosecuting the applicant was that no charge less than murder would be accepted in respect of the shooting of the deceased. However, after counsel became involved there were discussions about the prospect of a plea to manslaughter and the prosecutor decided to accept that plea because of what he apparently perceived to be a difficulty in the Crown negativing self-defence. 
     
      
    10 His Honour did not accept that submission. In so finding his Honour indicated that it was always open to the applicant to indicate that he was prepared to plead guilty to manslaughter on the basis of excessive self-defence even in committal proceedings. His Honour was of the opinion that the fact that the Crown might not have accepted the plea is not to the point. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Until relatively recently the offender has done nothing to indicate that he was willing to facilitate the administration of justice and, notwithstanding that his plea has avoided a relatively lengthy trial, its utilitarian value is not of the order justifying the maximum discount: see  
        R v Dibb  
        [2003] NSWCCA 117. With respect I do not accept that the Crown concession was a proper one. I believe that an appropriate discount is one of 15% for each of the pleas of guilty.” 
        
       
       
      The applicant’s criminality 
       
      
    11 Having determined the appropriate discount for the plea his Honour considered the objective criminality and subjective circumstances of the applicant. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
       
        
        “As I have already indicated it is clear from the number of shots fired by the offender and the locations where the deceased was struck by the bullets that the offender acted with intent to kill. True it is that, before the offender shot him, the deceased had already shot and wounded the person who was trying to restrain him from acting violently against the offender. But at the time the shots were fired it seems that the deceased was disarmed by the weapon falling to the ground and spilling its rounds. I take the plea of excessive self-defence to acknowledge that, before the offender fired at the deceased, he was aware that the deceased was unarmed, otherwise it is hard to see how the self-defence would be excessive if the offender believed that the deceased would be able to fire the weapon at him. Further, the shooting has to be seen in the context of the offender’s involvement in serious criminal acts of violence against other members of the Lebanese community as part of a dispute arising between factions in that community and immediately prior to his confrontation with the deceased. 
         
         
        This type of conduct, particularly when it involves the use of weapons, is a scandalous breach of the peace of the community and has no part in civilised society in any country let alone in suburban Sydney. When people come to this country fleeing civil unrest or warfare in some other country, they come here to live as law-abiding members of this community and abide by the standards that this society requires of its citizens. I am prepared to accept that there are aspects of the offender’s personality that might indicate impulsiveness in his reaction to the danger he believed that the deceased posed to him and to the shooting of his uncle. But as I have indicated, the shooting of the deceased cannot be viewed in isolation but as part of a violent conflict that was developing between factions of this section of the community. Although I know little about the offender’s possession of the weapon, I assume he at least became armed with it prior to the second confrontation with the deceased as according to the facts he produced the weapon from his person before firing it. 
         
         
        Notwithstanding the difficulties that the offender suffered in his youth in Lebanon and the material in the psychiatric and psychological report, it is appropriate to visit upon the offender a condign sentence denouncing this type of conduct and reflecting general deterrence to a very significant degree so as to send the message to others in this society that this type of criminally violent behaviour within community groups will not be tolerated for whatever reason, and particularly when it involves the use of firearms. There is nothing in my view in the material contained in the reports placed before me that could possibly excuse or even explain this conduct. The offender, in an atmosphere of developing violence for which his faction was clearly responsible, was involved in a confrontation with a person he knew to be able to resort to violence, and I have no doubt the offender was prepared to respond in kind if necessary. Simply put the offender was shortly before the killing involved with a group of thugs seeking to establish their importance in the community by acts of violence against members of their rival faction and who were spoiling for a showdown as the tension increased.” 
        
       
       
      The non-parole period 
       
      
    12 His Honour then turned to consider the concession by the Crown Prosecutor that an appropriate non-parole period should be 4 to 5 years. His Honour assumed that this was on the basis of a concession that the offender should receive a discount of 25%. His Honour said of the submission: 
     
      
       
        
        “Quite frankly I do not understand why the Crown should be making such a concession in respect of a charge of manslaughter where it is difficult to determine the appropriate range of sentences for any given factual situation and in a case of multiple offences where there is a real question as to the assessment of the overall criminality. I made it clear to [counsel for the defendant] that I did not consider myself bound in any way by that concession and he accepted that this was so. The cases to which I was referred during the course of submissions did not indicate to me that the concession of the Crown was an obviously appropriate one to make. 
        
       
       
        
        But in any event I have simply approached the task in accordance with normal sentencing principles and determined for myself what I believe the overall head sentence and non-parole period should be, based upon my finding of whether there are special circumstances and what effect that finding should have upon the minimum period of custody that the offender is to serve. Having differed from the Crown’s concession to a marked degree, I have taken that fact into account but I am not persuaded that the sentence I intend to impose is outside the appropriate range although I concede it is a high one.” 
         
        
       
      
    13 His Honour then turned to consider the relevant provisions of s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Because the offences were committed prior to 1 February 2003 the now repealed s 44 of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         applies. There are in respect of each of the offences the mitigating factors listed in s 21A(3) encompassed by his prior good character, lack of relevant record, and his remorse. His prospects of rehabilitation and the likelihood of re-offending depend largely upon his further relationships with persons within the community. If the factional strife flares up again, there is a possibility that he will re-offend if he chooses to become involved in it. It is not irrelevant that the factions seemed to revolve around the two car-repair businesses, one of which is owned by his wife. However, I am prepared to sentence the offender on the basis that given the time that has passed there is little likelihood of the strife leading up to the shooting still continuing and that he will avoid again becoming violently involved in factional strife in the community if it arises again. Therefore, his prospects of rehabilitation are probably good. It may be that, if necessary, he will be able to benefit from some form of treatment as suggested by the psychologist. 
         
         
        The first offence for which the offender is to be sentenced is the malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm on 9 June. That was an offence that was provoked but was an intentional striking of the victim in order to discipline him. This is the most serious of the offences on the second indictment because of the injury inflicted. It was the incident that gave rise to the series of events that resulted in the shooting of the deceased. There are no aggravating features listed under s 21A(2) present. I make it clear that I have not taken into account that the offence was in company because it is an element of a more serious offence. 
         
         
        The other offences on the second indictment are of no great seriousness in themselves although they are unprovoked acts of gratuitous violence. But they are part of a course of conduct leading up to the shooting and set the atmosphere for the confrontation between the offender and the deceased. It was inevitable because of those offences that there would be further and escalating violence between the two factions and, in particular, the offender and the deceased. Again there is none of the aggravating factors present in s 21A(2) that should impact on the sentence that are not elements of the offences charged or an element of a more serious offence. The applicant was not the person who struck the blows in either case but he was part of the violent group who were largely acting in his cause. They were at the premises of Just Vans so that the offender could find out where Hammoud’s brother had gone. 
         
         
        The manslaughter is in my opinion a serious example of the offence notwithstanding the threat of violence exhibited by the deceased. As I have already indicated, the offender himself was taking an active and, I believe, leading role in the escalation of animosity and violence leading up to the shooting. The plea of guilty to manslaughter accepts that there was no immediate danger to the offender at the time of the killing justifying the repeated shooting of the deceased although I accept that his over-reaction was in part due to the matters referred to in the reports before me. But I have no doubt that it was also to a greater extent the result simply of the aggressive attitude of the offender and those supporting him to the deceased and those associated with him leading up to their final confrontation. It would clearly have been foreseen that there was a real risk that the deceased would draw his weapon and I believe that the offender had prepared himself for that contingency. 
         
         
        The offence is one that carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. Because the offence embraces a range of conduct that happens to result in the death of a person, it is difficult to discern an appropriate range to apply to any particular case. It is not particularly helpful to try to categorise the type of manslaughter to obtain some guidance as to what the sentence might be. However, the sentence imposed in this case must reflect the fact that the offence involved the unlawful taking of human life and must recognise that the offender acted with an intention to kill. There was only one aggravating feature in the commission of the offence being the use of the firearm, but that is one of grave seriousness. As I have already noted, there must be a significant degree of general deterrence because of the use of a firearm and because the shooting occurred in circumstances of escalating violence between factions in the community in which the offender had a very significant role. The non-parole period must reflect that fact and denounce such conduct.  
         
         
        I have been referred to a number of decisions of this Court concerned with sentencing for manslaughter as a result of excessive self-defence. As Mr Barker appropriately noted, they offer only limited assistance because of the differing circumstances of the offences. However, I have had particular regard to the decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
        Cioban v R 
         [2003] NSWCCA 304 and  
        R v Trevenna 
         [2004] NSWCCA 43. I consider that the present offence is considerably more serious objectively than the offences considered in either of those two cases because of the circumstances in which the shooting occurred. 
         
         
        In  
        Cioban 
         only one shot was fired after the offender had retreated and was pursued by his attacker. The shot was fired with reckless indifference to human life when the offender was actually being attacked by a younger, fitter man although he was unarmed. The Court allowed the appeal and sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for 6 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years. That was a sentence imposed after trial. 
         
         
        In  
        Trevenna 
         a sentence of 7 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months was imposed upon an offender who shot her husband after a fight during which the deceased had attempted to strangle her and threatened her with a cricket bat. The offender had obtained the firearm from under a bed during the course of the attack. The sentence was imposed after a late plea of guilty. 
         
         
        I have reviewed the other cases provided to me but they have little relevance because of their varying facts. They certainly do not provide some sort of tariff for manslaughter by excessive self-defence, nor do they suggest that the concession made by the Crown was justified or appropriate. 
         
         
        I have been referred to the factors identified by Santow JA in  
        Trevenna 
         and taken them into account insofar as they indicate the seriousness of any particular offence although the weight to be given to such factors will depend upon the particular case. There were other factors in the present case to which I have referred that show the present offence to be a serious one. 
         
         
        There has been a delay in sentencing of a little over three years. I take into account that the offender has over that period been in some uncertainty as to his fate and was for much of that time facing a charge of murder. This is not a case, however, of sentencing for a stale crime. Had there not been this delay the sentence would have been longer. 
         
         
        For the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm I intend to impose upon the offender a fixed term sentence by reason of the severity of sentence for the offence of manslaughter. It will be the equivalent of the non-parole period I would have imposed for that offence calculated by taking into account a head sentence after discount of about 2 years 6 months. 
         
         
        For the offences in the second and third counts on the second indictment the offender will for the same reason be sentenced to fixed terms again being the equivalent of the non-parole period that I would have imposed on sentences of about 15 months. They will be concurrent with each other and with the sentence for the offence of manslaughter. That is because I see them as substantially part of the events leading to the manslaughter offence, occurring as they did on the same day and being part of the reason for the violent confrontation between the offender and the deceased. However, these sentences will be cumulative upon the first offence on the second indictment because I believe that to be a separate and distinct act of criminality even though it led to the events giving rise to the other offences. 
         
         
        I find that there are special circumstances by reason of the material contained in the psychological report. But there can only be a minor adjustment of the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period because of the need of the latter to reflect the seriousness of the offence and the importance of general deterrence. I do not believe that there is any need for a lengthy period on parole because, as I have indicated, there is little likelihood of re-offending unless the offender becomes involved again in factional strife within the community in which he lives. He will either have learned his lesson from these offences or not and there is little need for extensive supervision. The minimum period is in my opinion the very least that could be imposed. At one point I was minded not to find special circumstances given the length of the parole period that would arise from an application of the statutory ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period but I did so to some degree in recognition of the disappointment that the offender might feel due to the Crown’s concession not being adopted by the Court.” 
        
       
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    14 There are three grounds of appeal, ground 3 having 8 elements. The grounds are as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. The sentence is manifestly excessive. 
       
       
      2. The sentencing judge failed to take adequate account of sentences in other cases and sentencing trends. 
       
       
      3. The sentencing judge erred in the following respects: 
       
       
        
        (i) in finding the appellant did not offer a plea of guilty to manslaughter at the earliest reasonable opportunity and in rejecting the submissions of both the Crown and appellant in this regard; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) in finding that 4 to 5 years was not an appropriate non-parole period and in rejecting the submissions of both the Crown and appellant in this regard; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) in failing to accord adequate significance to the Crown Prosecutor’s submissions as to the appropriate discount and the appropriate non-parole period; 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) in failing to restrict his fact finding to the statement of facts agreed upon by the Crown and the solicitor for the appellant; 
        
       
       
        
        (v) in finding that ‘but at the time the shots were fired it seems that the deceased was disarmed by the weapon falling to the ground and spilling its rounds;’ 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) in finding that ‘I take the plea of excessive self-defence to acknowledge that, before the appellant fired at the deceased, he was aware that the deceased was unarmed, otherwise it is hard to see how the self defence would be excessive if the appellant believed that the deceased would be able to fire the weapon at him;’ 
        
       
       
        
        (vii) in finding ‘there is nothing in my view in the material contained in the reports placed before me that could possibly excuse or even explain this conduct;’ 
        
       
       
        
        (viii) in failing to accord adequate significance to the special circumstances including the personal testimonials, the report of Mr Watson-Munro and the report of Dr Nielssen. 
        
       
      
    15 It is convenient to consider ground three before the other grounds. 
     
      
       
      Ground Three 
       
      
    16 3.(i) The discount for a plea of guilty was comprehensively considered by this Court in R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. The decision is a discretionary one for the sentencing judge which will be significantly informed by consideration of the time at which the plea was given.  
     
      
    17 The circumstances of the present case are not uncommon. The appellant maintained his plea of not guilty at committal and for a lengthy period thereafter, which required the Crown to marshal resources in the expectation of having to prosecute a defended trial. Shortly before that trial the accused bargained for a reduced charge in consideration for a plea. Because of the need for the Crown to prepare for the trial the utilitarian value of the plea was significantly diminished as against the circumstance where the appellant pleaded guilty at or before the committal. 
     
      
    18 In my opinion in these circumstances it will be a rare case where it is appropriate to make a finding which entitles the offender to a discount of 25%. A lesser discount will most likely be inevitable. 
     
      
    19 In the present case it was submitted that the applicant could not have offered a plea to a charge of manslaughter in circumstances where the Crown was seeking to maintain the murder charge. It was said to be of no utility because the applicant knew it would not be accepted. It was also submitted that, in some way the offer of a plea to manslaughter would have compromised the applicant’s capacity to defend the murder charge. 
     
      
    20 This submission must be rejected. If a plea had been offered and rejected the matter would have passed without comment and the trial would have been conducted without the jury being aware of the applicant’s preparedness to plead to a lesser charge. Such an offer is made on a “without prejudice” basis: (see Chapter 20, Prosecution Guidelines of Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW)). However, if it had been offered, the Crown would have had an early opportunity to avoid the necessity to apply significant resources to the preparation of the trial. If offered, but not accepted, the applicant would nevertheless be able to point to an offer which entitled him to the full benefit of the available discount: R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117; R v Nguyen [2005] NSWSC 600 at [52]. 
     
      
    21 3.(ii) and (iii) The agreement between the prosecutor and the applicant was referred to as a plea agreement, the expression used to describe such an arrangement in GAS v The Queen (2004) 217 CLR 198. The limitations inherent in such an agreement were considered and explained in GAS. The relevant principles, as outlined by the Court at 210-11, should be restated: 
     
      
       
        
        “First, it is the prosecutor, alone, who has the responsibility of deciding the charges to be preferred against an accused person  
        Barton v The Queen  
        (1980) 147 CLR 75 at 94-95. The judge has no role to play in that decision. There is no suggestion, in the present case, that the judge was in any way a party to the ""plea agreement"" referred to. The appellants, through their counsel, evidently indicated to the prosecutor that, if a charge of manslaughter were to be substituted for the charge of murder, they would plead guilty, and the prosecutor filed a new presentment on that understanding. However, the charging of the appellants was a matter for the prosecutor.  
        
       
       
        
        Secondly, it is the accused person, alone, who must decide whether to plead guilty to the charge preferred. That decision must be made freely and, in this case, it was made with the benefit of legal advice. Once again, the judge is not, and in this case was not, involved in the decision. Such a decision is not made with any foreknowledge of the 
          
        sentence that will be imposed. No doubt it will often be made in the light of professional advice as to what might reasonably be expected to happen, but that advice is the responsibility of the accused's legal representatives.  
        
       
       
        
        Thirdly, it is for the sentencing judge, alone, to decide the sentence to be imposed  
        R v Olbrich  
        (1999) 199 CLR 270. For that purpose, the judge must find the relevant facts  
        Cheung v The Queen  
        (2001) 209 CLR 1 at 9. In the case of a plea of guilty, any facts beyond what is necessarily involved as an element of the offence must be proved by evidence, or admitted formally (as in an agreed statement of facts), or informally (as occurred in the present case by a statement of facts from the bar table which was not contradicted). There may be significant limitations as to a judge's capacity to find potentially relevant facts in a given case  
        R v Olbrich  
        (1999) 199 CLR 270 at 278. The present appeal provides an example. The limitation arose from the absence of evidence as to who killed the victim, and the absence of any admission from either appellant that his involvement was more than that of an aider and abettor.  
        
       
       
        
        Fourthly, as a corollary to the third principle, there may be an understanding, between the prosecution and the defence, as to evidence that will be led, or admissions that will be made, but that does not bind the judge, except in the practical sense that the judge's capacity to find facts will be affected by the evidence and the admissions. In deciding the sentence, the judge must apply to the facts as found the relevant law and sentencing principles. It is for the judge, assisted by the submissions of counsel, to decide and apply the law. There may be an understanding between counsel as to the submissions of law that they will make, but that does not bind the judge in any sense. The judge's responsibility to find and apply the law is not circumscribed by the conduct of counsel.  
        
       
       
        
        Fifthly, an erroneous submission of law may lead a judge into error and, if that occurs, the usual means of correcting the error is through the appeal process. It is the responsibility of the appeal court to apply the law. If a sentencing judge has been led into error by an erroneous legal submission by counsel, that may be a matter to be taken into account in the application of the statutory provisions and principles which govern the exercise of the appeal court's jurisdiction. “ 
        
       
      
    22 From this statement of principles it is plain that any agreement in the nature of a plea agreement can have only limited practical effect. If it includes an agreement as to the facts which may be incorporated into an agreed statement of facts the capacity of the sentencing judge to decide the relevant facts will be affected and, if no other evidence is tendered, may be confined to the facts which have been agreed. 
     
      
    23 With respect to any aspect of the agreement which relates to the appropriateness of any particular sentence, or a component of it, the Crown’s agreement is confined to an undertaking to make a submission to the sentencing judge consistent with the terms of that agreement. The agreement can neither bind the judge nor be given any greater weight than is appropriate to a submission of counsel with knowledge of the facts relevant to the offence and the offender. It must of course be carefully considered but carries no greater weight than any other submission which the Crown may make in the sentencing process. If it were otherwise the fundamental assumption that it is for the judge to determine an appropriate sentence would be seriously compromised. 
     
      
    24 The role of an agreement between the prosecutor and an accused in the ultimate penalty has caused some difficulties in civil enforcement proceedings in the Federal Court. Notwithstanding an acknowledgement that it is for the Court to determine the appropriate penalty the approach has been taken that, if the agreed penalty is within the appropriate range, the court will accept it, even if the judge would have imposed a different penalty from within the permissible range: see Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] ATPR 41-993. That approach is not without its critics who have sometimes expressed themselves in strong language: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Derstepanian & Anor [2005] FCA 1121 and Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Vizard (2005) 219 ALR 714. The approach taken by Barrett J in the New South Wales Supreme Court in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Elm Financial Services Ltd & Ors (2005) 55 ACSR 411 at 413 acknowledged the Full Federal Court’s position in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285 and Mobil Oil but nevertheless his Honour stated that “the court is in no way constrained by the parties agreement.”  
     
      
    25 I apprehend that the role of an agreement between the parties in civil penalty proceedings may be the subject of continuing discussion, if not debate, and the principles may not be finally settled. However, when sentencing for crimes in the criminal context the role of the court is fundamental and in my view cannot be displaced or qualified by any agreement of the parties. That agreement can only extend to an understanding of the facts to be placed before the Court and the submissions which will be made by the Crown. Whether the sentence which the Crown submits is appropriate happens to fall within or outside the appropriate range is irrelevant. The Court will consider that submission together with the submission on behalf of the offender but must then determine the appropriate sentence for itself. 
     
      
    26 In my opinion the sentencing judge was correct in rejecting the joint submission arising from the agreement between defence counsel and the Crown in relation to the non-parole period. Having regard to the objective criminality of the matters for which the applicant was sentenced, and in particular the circumstances of the manslaughter offence, a non-parole period of four to five years was entirely outside the available range. The non-parole period which his Honour determined was appropriate as was the discount for the plea of guilty. The difficulties arising from the present case would be avoided if prosecutors at first instance kept in mind the principles in GAS v The Queen, and followed the practice laid down in Chapter 28, Prosecution Guidelines of the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW). 
     
      
    27 3.(iv), (v), (vi) These matters may be dealt with together. With respect to the matter raised by sub-ground (v) the relevant facts are contained in paragraphs 14 and 15 of the document incorporating the agreed facts. The essential elements may be restated as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “14. While holding [the deceased] in a ‘bear hug’ face-to-face Hussein was shot in the top front part of his left thigh. … Witnesses reported hearing two loud gun shots about the time Hussein was seen to collapse to the ground. … The gun had dropped to the ground. … and spilled forth these unspent cartridges. 
        
       
       
        
        15. Immediately after Hussein had fallen to the ground, [applicant] produced a self-loading .38 calibre pistol from somewhere on his person and fired five rounds at [the deceased] ….” 
        
       
      
    28 It is true, as the applicant submitted, that the agreed facts do not expressly state the sequence in which the events occurred. However, the dropping of the gun by the victim is included in paragraph [14] and the facts in relation to the shooting follow in paragraph [15]. Neither party submitted to his Honour that this was not the sequence in which the events occurred and accordingly the finding which his Honour made that at the time the applicant fired the fatal shots the deceased was disarmed “by the weapon falling to the ground and spilling its rounds” was available. 
     
      
    29 The suggestion made in the appeal was that his Honour should have found that it was the shooting of the victim by the applicant which caused the victim to drop his gun and accordingly the applicant should have been sentenced on the basis that the victim was in a position to shoot at the applicant when the applicant fired. There are two difficulties with this proposition. Firstly, as I have indicated it was not advanced at the hearing. Secondly, it would be difficult to understand in those circumstances how the defence made by the applicant could be found to be excessive. It was submitted that the excessive defence was confined to the firing of five rounds when a lesser number may have sufficed. However, the events relating to the firing of successive shots was not explained and there was no evidence as to whether any one or more of the bullets was the cause of the victim’s death. 
     
      
    30 His Honour was required to reconcile the claim of excessive self-defence with the facts tendered, including the agreed facts. To my mind the only finding which his Honour could have made was that the applicant was aware that the deceased had dropped the gun, but that it might be retrieved and present a danger to him justifying the discharge of his own weapon. His Honour did not err in making this finding. 
     
      
    31 Unquestionably the findings his Honour made were open and no error is revealed. 
     
      
    32 3.(vii) The sentencing judge found that there were “aspects of the offender’s personality that might indicate impulsiveness in his reaction to the danger he believed that the deceased posed to him and to the shooting of his uncle.” This conclusion appears to have been based on the findings of Mr Watson-Munro, a psychologist and Dr Neilssen a psychiatrist. The opinions of both these persons were of course based upon the version of the events given to them by the applicant. 
     
      
    33 Mr Watson-Munro considered that the difficulties which the applicant had in his development gave rise to a state of “hypervigilance, significant anticipatory anxiety, sleep disturbance and a low threshold for frustration. The aggregate of these symptoms reflects a diagnosis of an adjustment disorder which I believe is of significant relevance to the dynamics surrounding the current offences … This appears to be very relevant to what allegedly occurred at the time of the shooting and the setting of Mr Ahmad holding a genuine fear that his life was about to end.” 
     
      
    34 Dr Nielssen considered that the applicant did not report any symptoms of anxiety disorder prior to the offences but that these symptoms came after. However, he reported that the applicant was, when a child, knocked out for a considerable time when he was hit on the forehead by a rock. Although he could find no evidence of impaired frontal lobe function he was prepared to give the applicant the benefit of the doubt in considering the “likely effect of the injury is subtle underlying impairment in the speed of information processing, particularly in the presence of multiple stimuli.” 
     
      
    35 Apart from the finding which I have referred to in relation to the applicant’s personality his Honour also found that “his over reaction was in part due to the matters referred to in the reports before me.” His Honour was referring to the evidence of Mr Watson-Munro and Dr Nielssen. Accordingly, his Honour had regard to the reports of these experts and in my opinion the sentences which his Honour imposed do not reflect any misuse of that material. 
     
      
    36 3.(viii) There was evidence before the sentencing judge of the regard in which the applicant was held by those in the community with whom he has had dealings. His Honour found that the applicant apart from this offence was a person of good character, had demonstrated remorse and may have good prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour expressly noted the large number of testimonials to the applicant’s good character and also referred to the material of Dr Nielssen and Mr Watson-Munro. His Honour also had regard to the delay, a little over three years, in sentencing and appropriately recognised the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    37 The ultimate sentence reveals a non-parole period which is 68% of the head sentence. This, of course, is less than the statutory period and in my opinion was within the appropriate range having regard to the objective circumstances of the offences and the subjective features of the applicant. A finding of special circumstances which allows a variation from the statutory ratio is a discretionary matter: R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704; R v AEM Snr [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [154]; R v Holmes & Ratu [2003] NSWCCA 258 at [28]. In my opinion the discretion available to his Honour did not miscarry. 
     
      
       
      Other matters 
       
      
    38 In his submissions in reply senior counsel for the applicant complained that the submissions advanced by the Crown in this appeal are at odds with the submissions made to the sentencing judge in relation, in particular, to factual matters and the concession in relation to the appropriate non-parole period. It was submitted that: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is a sad state of affairs when the Crown and defence amicably reach a specific agreement upon the basis on which a man pleads guilty to a serious crime and, on appeal, the Crown abandons the agreement and its concession and makes submissions entirely contrary to the concessions made to the court below. Whatever the precise legal principle involved, the Crown ought to honour its agreements and this Court should be slow to permit the Crown to abandon specific positions taken (and vigorously taken) on the hearing before the sentencing judge.” 
        
       
      
    39 The applicant accepted, correctly, that the Crown is not bound on an appeal by the position taken by a Crown Prosecutor in the court below. In R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 this Court held that the Crown is not debarred on an appeal from taking a different stance from that taken at first instance, but that the court in the exercise of its discretion is entitled to take into account the fact that the Crown had acquiesced in the course that was taken by the sentencing judge. The application of this principle commonly arises when a Crown appeal is advanced in circumstances where agreements or concessions have been made by the Crown before the sentencing judge. In those circumstances the court will be slow to quash a sentence which has been framed upon concessions made before the sentencing judge. This is a reflection of the significant inhibitions upon this Court intervening when the Crown complains that a sentence was inadequate. 
     
      
    40 Where a convicted person brings an appeal the administration of justice is aided by the Crown abiding by agreements or concessions made at the sentencing hearing, only departing from them where it has become apparent that an understanding of the relevant circumstances has changed or on further consideration the agreement or concessions were not reasonably open. In a case such as the present, where the sentencing judge did not accept the Crown submission and did not sentence on the basis of the concessions and agreements made by the parties, a change in the Crown’s position may be more likely than if the sentence imposed accords with the agreement. 
     
      
    41 Irrespective of any agreement by the Crown the role of the appellate court is to consider whether the sentencing judge has erred when determining the sentence. That consideration will be assisted by the submissions of both the appellant and the Crown. If, after proper consideration of the situation, the Crown has come to the view that the conclusion of the sentencing judge was correct, notwithstanding the position adopted at the original hearing, the Crown should not be inhibited in making its altered position known to the Court. However, if, after adequate reflection, the Crown maintains its original position that should also be made plain to the appellate court. 
     
      
       
      Ground One and Ground Two 
       
      
    42 It is convenient to deal with these two grounds together. It is submitted that the sentence imposed was out of line with those provided in a number of other cases to which his Honour was referred. 
     
      
    43 In R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377 Spigelman CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As has frequently been stated, manslaughter is almost unique in its protean character as an offence. (See in particular the observations of Gleeson CJ in  
        R v Blacklidge 
         (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 December 1995, esp pp2-3.) In its objective gravity it may vary, as has been pointed out, from a joke gone wrong to facts just short of murder ( 
        R v Weinman 
         (1987) 49 SASR 248 at 252;  
        R v Hoerler 
         (2004) 147 A Crim R 520 at [39]).  
         
         
        It is also relevant to recognise that, although manslaughters can be characterised in different ways, particularly in the various contexts which may reduce what would otherwise be a murder to manslaughter, the degree of variation  
        within  
        any such category is generally also over a wide range. Matters of fact and degree arise in all categories of manslaughter. 
         
         
        For example where diminished responsibility is relied upon, the extent to which culpability is ‘diminished’ can vary considerably from case to case. Similarly, although it is possible to characterise a number of cases as “child-killing by a parent or carer”, it may never be possible to identify a sentencing pattern or tariff from the whole body of such cases. (See  
        Hoerler 
         supra.) This is not only because the number of cases in a particular category may be too few to establish a pattern or tariff. It is also because, within any such category, the relevant circumstances can vary over a wide range. This is also true in the case of manslaughter by reason of excessive self-defence (see  
        R v Trevenna 
         (2003) 149 A Crim R 505).  
         
         
        The test established by s418 of the  
        Crimes Act 
         is whether “the conduct is a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them”. Such a test must depend on the characteristics and conduct of the deceased and also the nature of the response, in all of the circumstances of the particular case, on the part of the accused. A test of such a wide-ranging character is unlikely to lead to anything in the nature of a sentencing pattern or tariff in which the decisions on one case are of any particular utility for another.” 
        
       
      
    44 In the present case the sentencing judge found that the manslaughter was a “serious example of the offence notwithstanding the threat of violence exhibited by the deceased.” His Honour found that the applicant had taken a leading role in the escalation of animosity and violence between different groups of Lebanese people leading up to the shooting. His Honour found that the applicant accepted that there was no immediate danger at the time which justified shooting the deceased. Importantly, his Honour found that the applicant acted with an intention to kill and that the use of a firearm was an aggravating feature of “grave seriousness.” The circumstances of the offence warranted a significant degree of general deterrence. 
     
      
    45 In his reasons for judgment in Forbes Hall J included a detailed analysis of many of the sentences which have recently been imposed for the offence of manslaughter. A review of those decisions led his Honour to join with the Chief Justice in upholding an appeal in relation to the severity of a sentence for manslaughter imposed upon that appellant. A similar review of those cases in my opinion comfortably discloses that having regard to the findings which his Honour made as to the circumstances of the offence in the present case the sentence of nine years four months with a non-parole period of six years for the manslaughter was well within the appropriate range. Furthermore, having regard to the serious nature of the other offences for which the applicant was sentenced, the overall sentence and the manner of its structure were not excessive. 
     
      
    46 These grounds of appeal are not made out. 
     
      
    47 Although I would grant leave to appeal I would dismiss the appeal.

     Judgment 
    1 HODGSON JA: On 22 November 2004, the appellant was indicted before Phegan DCJ at Parramatta District Court on the following charges:(1) That he on 25 October 2003 at Smithfield in the State of New South Wales, did assault [the complainant], thereby occasioning actual bodily harm. (2) That he on 6 November 2003 at Smithfield in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant], without her consent and knowing that she did not consent, and at the time of the commission of the offence, he maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm upon her.(3) That he on 6 November 2003 at Smithfield in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant], without her consent and knowing that she did not consent.2 The first count was under s.59 of the Crimes Act 1900, and carried a maximum penalty of 5 years’ imprisonment. The second count was under s.61J of the Crimes Act, and carried a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment. The third count was under s.61I of the Crimes Act, and carried a maximum penalty of 14 years’ imprisonment.3 The appellant pleaded not guilty to each count, and was tried before his Honour and a jury. On 29 November 2004, the jury returned verdicts of not guilty to count 1, but guilty to counts 2 and 3.4 On 27 May 2005, the appellant was sentenced as follows. On count 2, to a non-parole period of 4 years to commence on 29 August 2004 and to expire on 28 August 2008, with the balance of term of 2 years to expire on 28 August 2010. On count 3, to a non-parole period of 3 years’ imprisonment to commence on 29 August 2004 and to expire on 28 August 2007, with a balance of term of 1 year to expire on 28 August 2008. 5 The appellant appeals against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against his sentences.6 The appeal against conviction is brought on two grounds, namely (1) that the verdicts of guilty were against the evidence and the weight of the evidence, and (2) the verdicts of guilty were unsafe and unsatisfactory. The submissions in support of those grounds go extensively into detailed facts of the case, and in order to understand and consider those submissions, it is convenient to set out first the circumstances of the case that were either common ground or clearly proved and not the subject of substantial dispute.CIRCUMSTANCES7 The appellant and complainant were in a de facto relationship from 1980 onwards, and were married in 1992. There are two children of the relationship, namely a daughter F born 1981 and a son L born 1982. 8 The relationship of the appellant and the complainant deteriorated significantly in the period of about twelve months before the alleged offences. 9 In about July and August 2002, the complainant travelled alone to Poland to visit her family. The appellant objected to this and was upset about it, and this created tension between them. 10 In late 2002, the complainant moved out of the family home at Smithfield to a rented unit in Parramatta, taking her daughter with her. The son remained with the father in the family home. After about six months, the complainant moved back to the family home, and after this the daughter moved out. The complainant then used what had been the daughter’s bedroom as a study, and perhaps also for sleeping, although there is a dispute about this.11 In the latter part of 2003, the complainant initiated counselling for herself and the appellant, going first to a family doctor, and then to a psychologist. An appointment was arranged with a psychiatrist, and on 23 October 2003, both attended at the rooms of this psychiatrist. Following that attendance, the complainant went to Fairfield police station in order to obtain an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO). Apparently, she was too late on that day, and she returned on the next day, when an interim AVO was made, which prohibited the appellant inter alia from engaging in conduct that intimidated the complainant, assaulting, molesting, harassing, threatening, or otherwise interfering with the complainant, and entering premises at which the complainant resided or worked. The complainant’s work address was specified in the order, but not her residential address; and according to the complainant, the reference to residence was a mistake. 12 The AVO was served on the appellant at the family home on the afternoon of Saturday 25 October, at a time when the complainant was absent. Their son L arrived home subsequently, and he gave some explanation of the AVO to the appellant, whose ability to read English is limited. 13 There is a dispute as to what happened after the complainant arrived home. However, it is common ground that at some time the complainant was inside the house with the appellant and L, the appellant was speaking angrily to the complainant, and the complainant wished to telephone the police. It is common ground that she was prevented from doing so on her own mobile phone (which was taken from her) or on the land line, after which the complainant ran out the back door of the house and was yelling loudly “Police, help, police”. The appellant caught up with her and put his hand over her mouth. L then pulled the appellant away from the complainant, and the appellant got into his truck and drove away. 14 The incident when the appellant put his hand over the complainant’s mouth was what was alleged to amount to assault occasioning actual bodily harm, the subject of count 1; and there was a dispute about the degree of force used and other aspects of this incident. There was also a dispute as to whether L went off in the truck with his father.15 It is also common ground that at 6.52pm on 25 October 2003, Constables Kate Howes and Daniel Smith attended at the Smithfield house, and spoke to the complainant and L in the front yard of that house. However, there is a dispute as to whether this occurred before or after the incident involving the appellant putting his hand over the complainant’s mouth: the complainant said this occurred before that incident, and the appellant and L said it occurred after the incident. 16 In any event, it is common ground that Constable Howes took notes in her notebook, on the basis of which she prepared a statement dated 12 November 2003, a relevant part of which was read in the trial as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        On Saturday 25 October 2003 at 6.52pm I attended 1 Megan Avenue, Smithfield, with Constable Daniel Smith. I was greeted in the front yard by [the complainant] and her son [L]. [The complainant] handed me a copy of an interim apprehended violence order. I read over the document and I saw that [the complainant] had taken out the order against her husband [TV]. I spoke to [the complainant] and her son L about the order and made some notes in my notebook. [the complainant] looked very scared and was shaking. I said to [the complainant] ""What has happened today?"". [The complainant] said 
         ""My  
        husband was served this paperwork today by police and when they left he threatened me. He said he would kill me and that I was a Polish slut and I deserved to die for going to the police"". I said ""Did you see the police serve this paperwork on your husband?"". [The complainant] replied ""Yes"". I made further notes in my notebook and said to [the complainant] ""I will have to go back to work and check that the order was served and that it is enforceable. If it is I will get a statement off you. Do you know where he has gone?"". [The complainant] said ""No. When he saw you coming he left in his truck”. 
        
       
      
    17 Later the same evening, the complainant went with her daughter to the Fairfield police station, where she again spoke to Constable Howes. Constable Howes read the following part of her statement of 12 November 2003 at the trial: 
     
      
       
        
        At about 11.30pm I was at the Fairfield Police Station. I was approached by Constable Smith who informed me [the complainant] had come into the station to see us. I walked to the front station area and I saw [the complainant] sitting with her daughter. I said to [the complainant] ""What has happened?"". She said ""My husband was waiting for me when you left the house. He got me inside and tried to kill me, strangle me. He was so strong and I could not call police"". I said ""Have you got any injuries?"". [The complainant] said ""Yes, all around my neck is sore"". Sorry. I had a look at [the complainant]'s neck and I could see redness right around the front and sides of her neck. I spoke with Constable Smith and he took a statement from [the complainant].  
        
       
      
    18 Constable Smith did not give evidence at the trial, and the statement that had been made by the complainant did not get into evidence at the trial. No photographs of the complainant were then taken at the police station; but according to the complainant, after she went home, her daughter took two photographs of her, which became Exhibit B at the trial. These photographs show some marks on the complainant’s upper lip. 19 There was little contact between the appellant and the complainant between 25 October 2003 and 5 November 2003. 20 On the evening of 5 November 2003, the complainant returned home, at which time the appellant was there, and L and his girlfriend were also there. A friend of the appellant, named Tony, was also there early that evening.21 The appellant and Tony left the house for some time, and during their absence L and his girlfriend left the house at about 8.30pm. Between then and about 11pm, the complainant was in the house on her own, and she got into her nightdress. 22 The appellant returned to the house with Tony at about 11pm. The complainant asked the appellant to move his car so her car was not blocked, and this was done. After Tony left, there was a call made to 000. There is a dispute as to who made this call and in what circumstances. There was evidence from Vodaphone records to the effect that the line was then open for 28 seconds, and nothing was recorded. 23 It is common ground that for a time the appellant and complainant were then together in the smaller bedroom, used by the complainant as her study. According to the complainant, there was sexual activity in that room, without her consent, involving digital penetration. According to the appellant, there was no sexual activity at all in that room. 24 It is common ground that the complainant then went to the toilet, and that after this the appellant and the complainant were together for a time in the main bedroom. It is common ground that sexual activity occurred in that room involving both penile and digital penetration. According to the complainant, this was without her consent, and according to the appellant it was with her consent. 25 It is common ground that the complainant then showered and that the appellant subsequently went to sleep in the main bedroom. 26 At 1.52am on 6 November 2003, the complainant sent the following SMS message to her daughter: 
     
      
       
        
        Tusha call Fairfield police immediately. Tell them I sent you this SMS now. He raped me by terrorism force under repeated threat of killing me now. I can't talk. He is in the bed not sleeping. Tell them I said he'll escape to the back yard to be some of them there. Ask them if you could forward this SMS to them. Do not reply. 
        
       
      
    27 Also, at 1.55am, the complainant sent another SMS message to her friend in Poland. 28 At 2.18am on 6 November, Constable Howes and Senior Constable David Smith responded to a radio message, and the following material from Constable Howes’ statement dated 12 November 2003 was read at the trial: 
     
      
       
        
        We responded to a radio message for a domestic at Megan Avenue, Smithfield. We arrived at 2.24am. I walked to the front door, knocked on the flyscreen door. A short time later [the complainant] answered the door. She was whispering and said ""He is in the bedroom, be quiet. If he hears you he will run away. Go through quietly, I think he is asleep"". I noticed that [the complainant] was wearing pyjamas however they were shaggy in appearance and her breast was hanging out of it. She looked very distressed and was sweating. Senior Constable Smith and I walked through the front door down a small hallway and past a small bedroom. I saw another room with the door closed but with a small gap. I used my leg and opened the door. I saw a figure on the curtain getting up out of bed. I turned the light on to the bedroom and saw [TV] standing next to the bed. He was wearing only his underwear and he looked as though he had just woken up. The room also smelt strongly of alcohol. I said ""[TV] you're under arrest"". [TV] replied ""What for? This is my house, don't listen to what she says"". I said ""[TV] you’re under arrest for assault and breaching your AVO last week. I have been looking for you for a while. You are not obliged to say or do anything unless you wish to do so. Do you understand that?"". [TV] just looked at me and I said ""Do you understand that?"". [TV] just shook his head at me. I went on to say ""Anything that you say or do will be recorded and may be used as evidence. Do you understand that?"". [TV] said ""Whatever, this is my home, how come you come into my home? Why can't I be here?"". I said ""[TV] get dressed and we will take you back to Fairfield Police Station"". [TV] got dressed and a short time later Senior Constable Smith walked [TV] out of the bedroom and outside of the premises. As [TV] was walked out of the premises I heard [the complainant] sobbing and stating ""Please, please, he has been terrorising me for the last three hours, he has had me in the bedroom raping me, sexually assaulting me, humiliating me, I have been a prisoner in my home. He tried to suffocate me"". I could see that [the complainant] was extremely distressed and she was talking very fast. I said ""[the complainant] calm down. He has gone now and will not come back. You need to slow down and tell me what has happened to you so l can understand it"". I took [the complainant] to the bedroom area and said ""Can you explain what has happened and where it has taken place?"". [the complainant] pointed to the small bedroom and said ""This is where he has raped me and terrorised me. He used a condom but in this bedroom he took me in here and he suffocated me, pushing my head into the pillow. This went on for hours and he would not let me call the police. When he  
        went to  
        sleep I sent an SMS to my daughter to call police and you came, thank God. I thought he was going to kill me. He would not let me go to the toilet and I wet the bed and other things on it. He made me go to the toilet while he watched and then he made me shower to get rid of the evidence. It even broke the bed, have a look at it, it's broken it's broken the bed"". I looked into the main bedroom and I could see that the end of the bed was broken. I took [the complainant] into the loungeroom and told her to wait. I walked outside and spoke to Senior Constable Smith. He in turn contacted the supervisor, Sergeant Telfer(?) (sic), who attended shortly after. I went back into the house and sat with [the complainant]. I established a crime scene and made sure no further persons entered the hallway, bedrooms or bathroom. [the complainant]'s daughter, [F], also arrived at the premises. I spoke with her and she showed me an SMS message on her phone that she had received from her mother. This was the message that prompted her to contact police on behalf of her mum.  
         
         
        At about 3am staff from the ambulance attended and later took [the complainant] to Liverpool Hospital. I stayed at the scene and waited for crime scene to attend. Crime scene attended at about 3.45am. I went with crime scene back into the premises and explained to them what I had been told by the victim. About 4.30am Detective Senior Constable Hazell arrived at the premises and I spoke with him. Shortly after Senior Constable Smith and I left the location and resumed further duties. 
        
       
      
    29 At about 4.30am on the same morning, Detective Senior Constable Hazell attended at the house. Senior Constable Kendell, a crime scene examiner, was also there. Detective Senior Constable Hazell looked around the house with Senior Constable Kendell. The police did not then take possession of any condom or condom packet, or any item of bed clothes. However, a condom and condom packet was brought to the police by the complainant some days later, and DNA matching that of the appellant was recovered from the condom. Senior Constable Kendell did not give evidence at the trial.30 Photographs taken on 6 November 2003 of the two bedrooms and of the bathroom were put into evidence at the trial. So also were 24 photographs of the complainant taken on 7 November 2003, showing bruising on her wrists and both arms, including what appear to be quite extensive bruises on her left arm.ISSUES31 The issues before the jury were essentially:(1) Was the incident when the appellant placed his hand over the complainant’s mouth an assault occasioning actual bodily harm?(2) Were there two separate occasions of sexual activity, one in each bedroom?(3) In relation to the sexual activity, was it proved that the complainant did not consent and that the appellant did not believe she consented?(4) If there was a separate occasion of sexual activity in the smaller bedroom, did the appellant at that time maliciously inflict actual bodily harm on the complainant?32 Of course, the onus was on the Crown to establish an affirmative answer to each of these questions beyond reasonable doubt. Critical to all issues was the credibility of the complainant’s evidence and of the appellant’s evidence, and that in turn was affected by the credibility of L’s evidence. 33 The issues that have been raised on appeal in support of the first two grounds of appeal, to the effect that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable, may conveniently be considered under three headings:1. The significance of L’s evidence.2. Deficiencies of the complainant’s evidence and the Crown’s case generally.3. The significance of the not guilty verdict on count 1.I will deal with these issues in turn. SIGNIFICANCE OF L’S EVIDENCESubmissions34 The appellant was unrepresented at the hearing of the appeal, and relied principally on written submissions, which, he informed the Court, had been prepared by the barrister who represented him at the trial. 35 In these submissions, it was put that L’s evidence was destructive of the complainant’s evidence and the Crown case generally, and it should have been accepted by the jury or at least raised a reasonable doubt. 36 It was put that L’s evidence showed that the alleged assault, on the occasion when the appellant put his hand over the complainant’s mouth, occurred before the police visit, and that the complainant’s evidence to the contrary was false. It also showed that important aspects of her account of the alleged assault were false, especially her evidence that, when she arrived home, the appellant stormed out of the house to confront her, her evidence that the appellant stomped on the land line telephone (L’s evidence was that he did this), and her evidence that the appellant, when he put his hand over her mouth, squeezed her mouth hard, lifted her up, and attempted to snap her neck. 37 It was submitted that L was a witness concerned to tell the truth, and not to assist either the appellant or the complainant; and that his evidence destroyed the complainant’s credibility, so as to make it unreasonable to accept her evidence concerning the alleged sexual assaults, or at least to raise a reasonable doubt about that evidence. 38 In relation to the injuries alleged to have been caused by the alleged assault, it was submitted that it could be inferred from the circumstances that the police noted only redness of the neck at 11pm, and that the photographs suggesting injuries to the mouth were taken later than that, that the complainant “manufactured” her injuries.Disposition39 In my opinion, it was open to the jury to consider L a partisan and unreliable witness. 40 Although he professed to love his father and mother equally, his admitted actions at the time of the incident when the appellant’s hand was placed over the complainant’s mouth could be taken as indicating otherwise. L’s evidence was that, during 2003, the appellant would scream out and yell names at the complainant, getting angry and using rude words like “bitch” and “you slut” and words like that; and that the complainant would ask the appellant to leave her alone. The complainant had then obtained an AVO, and, when the complainant came to the house after it had been served, the appellant said to the complainant “What’s this bullshit? Why put this on for me?”, to which the complainant replied “I don’t want to talk to you. Leave me alone”; and then the appellant kept asking her “Why did you get this for on me. What did I do for you to put an AVO on me”, using an angry voice. Then, when the complainant went to telephone the police, L joined with the appellant in physically preventing her from using a telephone to call the police, on L’s own account stomping on the land line telephone to prevent this, and then physically preventing her from going out the front door of the house. In all the circumstances, these actions of L could be considered as showing disregard for his mother’s interests and concerns, and support for his father against those interests and concerns.41 L also gave evidence in relation to the bruises on the complainant shown in the photographs to which I have referred, which could be regarded as contrived, and in one instance could be regarded as having been made up on the spot to damage the prosecution case. On being asked about the bruises, L said that the complainant bruised easily, supporting this by reference to something that happened to her when water-skiing, said she “always had bruises”, and also said there were bruises on her hands on 5 November 2003 before the incidents complained of in the second and third counts. There had been no suggestion of this last matter to the police earlier, and the jury could well have taken the view, as submitted by the Crown Prosecutor, that it was something made up on the spot to damage the prosecution case.42 Next, there was L’s evidence that the complainant just wanted to get the appellant arrested in relation to incidents concerning the AVO; and his statement to the police that he believed his parents had consensual sex, and that the complainant made up a story about sexual assault “so she can get half the house and get Dad put in jail”. Having regard to L’s own account of what happened on 25 October, and his inability to know what happened on 6 November, this could be taken as showing significant bias against the complainant.43 Next, L’s evidence that the police visit on 25 October occurred after the incident when the appellant put his hand over the complainant’s mouth could have been considered unbelievable. According to L’s account, after the complainant had been physically prevented by himself and the appellant from using her mobile phone or the land line phone to telephone the police, had fled from the house screaming “Help police”, and had the appellant’s hand put over her mouth to stop screaming, the complainant said not one word about this sequence of events to the police when they subsequently arrived at the house; and this, according to L, when the complainant was attempting to use the AVO to have the appellant arrested and get rid of him. I myself find this highly implausible, and the jury could well have considered it unbelievable, and could have considered that this order of events was invented to give support to the appellant’s version that nothing seriously untoward happened on the occasion when he put his hand over the complainant’s mouth. 44 Further, L gave evidence that “there was no force at all” when the appellant placed his hand over the complainant’s mouth in attempting to stop her screaming. This could be considered highly implausible, in circumstances where the complainant was fleeing from the appellant and screaming for the police. To stop the complainant fleeing and to stop her screaming would, it would seem, inevitably require an appreciable degree of force.45 For those reasons, I do not think it can be said that L should have been treated by the jury as an independent and impartial witness whose evidence could be confidently accepted. On the contrary, I think the jury could properly have regarded L as a highly partisan and unreliable witness.DEFICIENCIES OF COMPLAINANT’S EVIDENCE AND CROWN CASE GENERALLYSubmissions46 It was put on behalf of the appellant that the complainant’s behaviour indicated that she planned to set up the appellant for the sexual assault allegation. At the very least, there were deficiencies in her evidence and the Crown case that should have left the jury with a reasonable doubt. The submissions relied on the following matters.(1) While the complainant claimed to be working on a university assignment between 8.30pm and 11pm on 5 November, in fact she spent long periods on the telephone to her daughter, and sending SMS messages to her friend in Poland. (2) Although she claimed to be frightened of the appellant, she made no attempt to leave the house or contact the police at any time during the evening of 5 November. (3) When the appellant arrived back at 11pm, she asked him to move his car and moved her own car without taking the opportunity either to leave or to contact the police. (4) Immediately afterwards, she claimed that she tried to dial 000 and was stopped; and yet the line was open for 28 seconds and nothing was recorded. The timing and lack of recording was far more consistent with the appellant’s version that it was he that called 000 to give the appellant an opportunity to speak to the police if she so wished, an opportunity which she did not take.(5) There were important conflicts between the complainant’s statements to the police concerning the alleged sexual assaults and her evidence at the trial. In particular, in her statement she said a condom was used in the small bedroom, whereas in her evidence she said it was used in the main bedroom; and in her statement, she said the attempt to smother her was by pushing her head into a pillow, whereas in her evidence she said it was by way of a blanket being pushed on to her face. (6) When confronted in the witness box with the inconsistency between the appearance of the blanket in the photograph put into evidence, and her evidence as to what had happened, she invented on the spot a theory that the appellant had made up the blanket. (7) The appellant gave bizarre evidence that when she could not control herself, and did “wee and poo”, and she knew the appellant “was licking it”. (8) Despite forensic inspection of the scene, there was no evidence in support of her evidence about “wee and poo”.(9) It was highly implausible that, having raped her, the appellant would have allowed her to have her mobile phone; and highly implausible that, in her allegedly terrified state, she would have sent a long SMS message to her daughter and another SMS message to her friend in Poland. (10) The injuries shown in the photographs gave little support to her case, having regard to the evidence of L and the appellant that she bruises easily and having regard to her capacity for deception. (11) The complainant’s evidence that, when he was woken by Constable Howes on the morning of 6 November 2003, the appellant swore profusely conflicted with Constable Howes’ account of what the appellant said on that occasion.(12) There was no basis on which the jury could find malicious infliction of actual bodily harm in the events that occurred in the small bedroom, the subject of the second count: even accepting that bodily harm occurred, it was not shown beyond reasonable doubt when that bodily harm occurred.Disposition47 I will deal in turn with the particular contentions I have identified.48 I do not think there is any force in the submission numbered (1): the complainant could well have been working on her assignment but at times been on the telephone or sending SMS messages. As regards (2), (3) and (4), the complainant gave explanations for these matters which were not implausible, and which the jury could have accepted. The circumstance that the 000 line was open for 28 seconds, with nothing being recorded, could be considered a little odd, on either the complainant’s or the appellant’s account of what happened. I do not think it counts strongly against the complainant’s version.49 As regards (5) and (6), we were not referred to any cross-examination that explored these possible inconsistencies, and I have not been able to find such cross-examination in my reading of the evidence. It is not clear that the two versions in each case are inconsistent, and in the absence of cross-examination, I do not think these points count strongly against the complainant’s evidence. Nor do I think the explanation offered by the complainant concerning the appearance of the blanket in the photograph, which the complainant saw for the first time in the witness box, is a matter that counts strongly against her credibility. 50 As regards (7), in relation to the complainant’s evidence that the appellant was “licking it”, it was not entirely clear what was the “it” being referred to. Conceivably, it could have been the “wee” or the “poo”, but also it could have referred to the complainant’s genital region. Again, we have not been referred to any cross-examination of the complainant on this matter, and I have not been able to locate any. I do not think this is a matter that counts strongly against the complainant’s evidence.51 As regards the absence in the Crown case of any evidence concerning bed clothes or night attire showing evidence of “wee” or “poo”, I do not think this is damaging to the complainant’s credibility. There was no cross-examination as to its quantity or where it went. The complainant’s evidence was that her night attire was bundled up in the bathroom. The police did not locate a condom used on the occasion, and the complainant’s evidence was that she found the condom later on in a less than obvious place in the garden. On the complainant’s evidence, she was compelled to shower, so as to remove evidence. The lack of evidence concerning bed clothes and night attire is an absence of something that could have made the Crown case stronger, but in my opinion it does not count heavily against the complainant’s evidence.52 As regards (9), the appellant went to sleep, and short of some kind of physical imprisonment of the complainant, he could not then prevent the complainant contacting the police. In those circumstances, to ensure that she did not have a mobile phone would not have made an enormous difference. The actual message sent by the complainant to her daughter could have been considered by the jury entirely consistent with the complainant’s evidence as to her state of mind at the time. 53 As regards (10), in my opinion the injuries displayed in the photographs could be regarded as giving substantial support to the complainant’s case. The jury could properly have regarded the evidence of the appellant and L, as to the complainant bruising easily, as an implausible attempt to explain what, on the face of it, seemed quite strong evidence supporting the complainant’s version. 54 As regards the absence of expletives from Constable Howes’ version of what the appellant said when he was woken up on 6 November, Constable Howes was not asked any questions as to her practice as to the inclusion or exclusion of expletives that did not significantly relate to the substance of what was being said. The jury could have taken the view that proper practice would be to record expletives if expletives were used; but in circumstances where that matter was not explored in cross-examination, again this does not seem to me to be something that counts strongly against the complainant’s credibility. 55 As regards (12), the complainant’s evidence that, on the occasion of sexual activity in the small bedroom, her head was rammed repeatedly against the wall, coupled with the evidence of redness on the top of her head after the incident, was enough to support a finding that the appellant maliciously caused the complainant actual bodily harm at the time of the sexual activity in the small bedroom. 56 Generally, in my opinion, the complainant’s case did receive further support from the evidence of a broken bed, and by her physical state and her distress observed by Constable Howes when she first came to the house in the morning of 6 November 2003. Subject to what I say in relation to the significance of the not guilty verdict on count 1, in my opinion no case is made out that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable.SIGNIFICANCE OF NOT GUILTY VERDICT ON COUNT 1Submissions57 The submission here was that the verdict of not guilty on count 1 must mean that the jury found the complainant to be an unreliable witness on this matter. This, coupled with the other submissions, means that the jury should at least have had a reasonable doubt on counts 2 and 3.Disposition58 The not guilty verdict on count 1 does not necessarily mean that the jury considered the complainant’s evidence unreliable on this matter. The jury could have accepted that the complainant’s evidence as to her own observations and experiences was reliable, and yet not been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant meant to do any more than to stop her screaming, and might not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that any injury that did occur to her was other than entirely accidental. 59 Although as a matter of strict law, such a view may not justify a finding of not guilty to a charge of assault, or even assault occasioning actual bodily harm, if actual bodily harm resulted, this could give a reasonable explanation of the jury verdict. Certainly, the trial judge did not direct the jury that, even if they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to do more than stop the complainant screaming or that he applied any more force than necessary to do this, and were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that any injury to the complainant was other than accidental, nevertheless they could still convict the appellant of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 60 In my opinion, all the submissions advanced on behalf of the appellant, considered individually and cumulatively, are insufficient to show that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable. There is no complaint as to how the matter was left to the jury by the primary judge. The kind of issues raised on the appeal were put to the jury by Counsel for the appellant and fairly left to the jury by the judge. The jury was in a position to make an assessment of the complainant, and of the appellant and L, and in that respect had a substantial advantage over this Court. It may be commented that, in some respects, the complainant gave evidence in a melodramatic fashion, but this too was fairly before the jury. 61 For all these reasons, in my opinion the appeal against conviction fails. SENTENCE62 The appellant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences on the ground that the sentences are manifestly excessive. 63 However, the submissions focused on an alleged inconsistency in the trial judge’s reasons between, on the one hand, a finding that the “risk of re-offending is extremely remote” and, on the other hand, a finding that this was a case where the sentences imposed “must reflect a very real element of special deterrence”. 64 The trial judge gave very lengthy and very careful reasons for the sentences he imposed. There is some tension between the two statements referred to in the appellant’s submissions. However, they can be reconciled on the basis that the latter was stated in the context of a statement that the appellant was committed to refraining from any further contact with the complainant or from asserting any claim to any sort of ongoing relationship with her, making the risk of re-offending against her extremely remote; whereas the former was stated in the context of a finding that the appellant had not shed attitudes towards women conducive to the conduct that occurred of the general kind in these offences, and that it was necessary to bring home to the appellant the reality and seriousness of the offences. 65 In those circumstances, in my opinion the apparent tension between the two statements is insufficient to vitiate the primary judge’s reasons for the sentences. 66 In my opinion, the totality of the sentences, namely a non-parole period of 4 years and an additional term of 2 years, could not possibly be regarded as excessive. 67 I would refuse leave to appeal from the sentences.ORDERS68 For those reasons, I propose the following orders:1. Appeal against conviction dismissed.2. Leave to appeal against sentences refused.69 GROVE J: I agree with Hodgson JA.70 ADAMS J: I agree with Hodgson JA.

     REGINA v Salim MISKI 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The respondent, Salim Miski, pleaded guilty and was sentenced on four counts. The Crown appeals the sentences pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The sentences were imposed on 20 October 2005.  
     
      
    2 The respondent pleaded guilty to one count of robbery in company committed on 14 March 2004, two counts of robbery armed with an offensive weapon, namely a black pistol, both committed on 26 March 2004 and one count of robbery armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife committed on 27 March 2004. Each offence was a contravention of s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment is provided. 
     
      
    3 The offences were committed whilst the respondent was on parole having been discharged from custody on 13 November 2003 being four months before he committed the first of the offences for which he was sentenced. 
     
      
    4 The sentencing judge sentenced the respondent as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count 1 
      : a fixed term of 3 years to commence on 18 February 2005 and expire 17 February 2008; 
       
       
      Count 2 
       After taking into account the matter on the Form 1 – non-parole period of 2 years 4 months to commence on 20 October 2005 and to expire 17 February 2008, and a balance of term of 1 year 5 months to expire 19 July 2009; 
       
       
      Count 3:  
      Non-parole period of 2 years 4 months to commence 20 October 2005 and to expire 17 February 2008, and a balance of term of 1 year 5 months to expire 19 July 2009; 
       
       
      Count 4:  
      Fixed term of 3 years to commence 18 February 2005 and to expire 17 February 2008. 
       
      
    5 The total sentence imposed was 4 years and 5 months with a non-parole period of 3 years. The non-parole periods in relation to counts 2 and 3 are completely subsumed by the sentences on counts 1 and 4, the terms of which run concurrently. 
     
      
    6 The matter on the Form 1, which, in accordance with the respondent’s request his Honour took into account when sentencing upon the second count, was an offence of “being carried in a conveyance, taken without consent” contrary to s 154A of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      Count 1 – Robbery in company 
       
      
    7 About 2.50 am on 14 March 2004 the respondent and a co-offender entered the Prime Service station at Blakehurst. He was armed with a screwdriver, as was the co-offender. The respondent was not wearing a head covering although his co-offender had a t-shirt wrapped around his head. The respondent approached the male attendant who was standing behind the counter. He held the screwdriver towards the victim and said, “Don’t be smart, just give us the money or else.” The victim handed him $770.00 from the till. The respondent then demanded the victim’s wallet. The victim handed over his wallet which contained $80.00. The offence was recorded on a security video recorder. 
     
      
       
      Count 2 – Robbery armed with an offensive weapon 
      
     Form 1 – Carried on conveyance 
     
      
    8 About 7.20 am on 26 March 2004 the respondent met with two co-accused. The two co-offenders were driving a Toyota Soarer registration XKA 719 which had been stolen. The respondent was informed that the vehicle was stolen by the co-offenders. He was conveyed in the car for a number of hours. At about 8.35 pm the same day, the respondent and his co-offenders arrived at the 7 Express service station on Railway Parade, Carlton in the stolen vehicle. The respondent and the co-offender entered the service station where they approached the female attendant. The respondent was armed with a black coloured handgun. He pointed the gun at the victim’s head and said “Hand over the cash.” While the respondent held the gun to the victim, the co-offenders removed a large number of cigarettes. All three then left taking a large amount of cigarettes and approximately $400 cash. 
     
      
    9 The respondent wore a hood, but this fell off when he stepped behind the counter. Again the offence was recorded. 
     
      
       
      Count 3 – Robbery armed with an offensive weapon 
       
      
    10 About 10.30 pm on 26 March 2004, the respondent and two co-offenders arrived at Budget Petrol on the Princes Highway, Arncliffe, in the stolen vehicle XKA 719. All three entered the store. The co-offenders wore balaclavas while the respondent had no head covering. The three approached the male attendant and the respondent produced a black pistol and pointed it at the attendant. He demanded that the attendant open the till. One offender jumped the counter and pulled open the cash register. All three offenders removed cash, phone cards and a large number of cigarettes before leaving in the stolen vehicle. The total cash stolen was $2300. 
     
      
       
      Count 4 – Robbery armed with an offensive weapon 
       
      
    11 On 27 March 2004 the respondent entered the Lodge Motel on New South Head Road, Edgecliff. He inquired of the receptionist as to the cost of a room for one night, and the cost for three nights. He then sat down in a chair and appeared to make a telephone call. The respondent then ran through the door that lead behind the counter and produced a 30cm knife. He pointed the knife at the receptionist’s chest, about 50 cm away, and demanded money and that he open the till. The manager came out of the office and the respondent turned to him and pointed the knife at his head. The respondent picked up two $100 bills from the counter. The receptionist opened the till and the respondent took about $300 from the money tray. He demanded both men’s wallets, but neither had wallets in their pockets. The respondent demanded the safety box. He pushed the manager and went into the office. The two men ran out of the motel. The respondent levered himself over the counter by placing his hands on it. The respondent escaped with $1200 cash. 
     
      
       
      Post offending conduct 
       
      
    12 The respondent left New South Wales on 20 April 2004 and was arrested in Melbourne on 21 April 2004 on outstanding warrants. He was subsequently sentenced to a 10 month term of imprisonment which expired on 17 February 2005. 
     
      
    13 On 17 March 2004 NSW police interviewed the respondent by way of ERISP at the Port Phillip Bay Prison, Victoria. He made full admissions in relation to the offences on the indictment. These admissions were supported by fingerprint evidence recovered from the stolen vehicle and clear surveillance footage taken from the Prime Service station on 14 March 2004 and the 7 Express Service Station on 26 March 2004. 
     
      
    14 On 17 February 2005 the respondent was arrested by Victorian Police outside the Port Phillip prison. He was taken before the Melbourne Magistrates Court where an extradition warrant was issued for his return to New South Wales. On 18 February 2005 he was conveyed to St George Police Station and charged. He was refused bail. 
     
      
    15 Fingerprints located on the counter of the Lodge Motel were identified as matching the respondent’s. On 27 March 2005 the respondent was interviewed by way of ERISP in relation to the armed robbery the subject of count 4. He denied any knowledge of the offence but made full admissions once the interview was terminated. These admissions were recorded in a police notebook and signed by the respondent. 
     
      
    16 Subsequent to the sentences being imposed on these matters, the respondent was sentenced, on 12 January 2006 to a term of imprisonment for one month to commence 17 February 2008 and expire on 16 March 2008 for the offence of possess prohibited drug (steroids). The Crown submitted that in the event the Crown appeal is successful and the court proceeds to resentence, consideration should be given to varying the commencement date of this sentence pursuant to s 59 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
       
      Subjective features of the respondent 
       
      
    17 The respondent was aged 24 years at the date of sentencing. He has a criminal history which the sentencing judge described as “an unenviable criminal record.” He has been sentenced for offences including goods in custody, larceny, various offences involving dishonesty, assault, stealing, breaking and entering, obtaining benefits by deception, obtaining money by deception, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, larceny, possession and use of cannabis. Most of these offences have been committed on more than one occasion. An examination of his record reveals that in the 4½ years before he was sentenced he had only a period of some 4 months out of prison and in that period of time he was on parole. The offences for which he was sentenced occurred when he was on parole. 
     
      
    18 The respondent left his family home at the age of 16. He has been addicted to heroin since his teenage years. The sentencing judge found the robberies took place so that the respondent could obtain funds to acquire drugs. 
     
      
    19 Evidence was tendered before the sentencing judge of the respondent’s desire to rehabilitate himself. His Honour said of this desire: 
     
      
       
        
        “It has been submitted on behalf of the prisoner that the prisoner is now anxious to rehabilitate himself. In evidence before me the prisoner said that he hoped to speak to counsellors whilst he was in gaol in relation to his drug habit.” 
        
       
       
        
        It is the desire of any sentencing body to see to it that a person of the age of the prisoner does succeed in any rehabilitation attempts. And I have taken that into account in setting the non-parole period. I have also taken into account what has been stated by the clinical forensic psychologist, Mr Taylor, in his report of 15 September 2005 that the prisoner is to be assessed as having a moderate likelihood of recidivism. It can only be hoped that the risk as identified by Mr Taylor does not occur. But as I have stated I regard his age and the possible rehabilitation is a special circumstance to be taken into account in relation to the sentences imposed upon the prisoner.” 
        
       
      
    20 Having regard to the respondent’s criminal history he will have to make a considerable effort if he is to avoid reoffending. No doubt any prospect he has of avoiding problems in the future will depend upon his capacity to overcome his drug addiction. However, I am not persuaded that a finding of special circumstances would be appropriate so as to provide a greater non-parole period than provided by the Parliament. 
     
      
    21 In part, the respondent’s submissions depended upon an understanding of the sequence of the relevant events. An agreed chronology of those events indicates that the respondent was released to parole on 13 November 2003 and between 14 March 2004 and 27 March 2004 committed the relevant offences. He left New South Wales on 20 April 2004 and was arrested in Victoria the following day for offences committed in 1999 and 2000. 
     
      
    22 On 23 April 2004 an order was made revoking his parole in New South Wales. When interviewed in Victoria on 17 May 2004 the respondent made admissions in relation to offences 1, 2 and 3. On 4 June 2004 he was sentenced in Victoria for the Victorian offences and a term of 10 months imprisonment was imposed.  
     
      
    23 On 17 February 2004 the respondent was released from custody in Victoria and was then arrested and extradited to New South Wales. He was charged on 18 February 2004 with offences in New South Wales which activated his parole revocation and at that time had a term of 9 months 5 days before his existing sentences would expire.  
     
      
    24 In May 2005 the respondent made admissions in relation to count 4 and on 21 July 2004 was committed for sentence. He was sentenced on 20 October 2005.  
     
      
    25 On 26 October 2005 the Crown posted a letter warning that it may appeal the sentences to this Court. There is no evidence that the respondent received the letter although in the ordinary course this would have occurred. There is no evidence to suggest that he did not receive it. 
     
      
    26 On 22 November 2005 the respondent completed the period of revocation of his parole. The Crown filed the Notice of Appeal on 19 December 2005.  
     
      
       
      The Crown submissions 
       
      
    27 The Crown submitted that the sentences which his Honour imposed do not adequately reflect the criminality of the respondent and are manifestly inadequate. It is submitted that this is reflected in a number of ways.  
     
      
    28 Although his Honour provided for an accumulation of the head sentences in relation to counts 2 and 3 by providing the same fixed term in relation to counts 1 and 4 no accumulation of the non-parole periods is provided. By making the sentences for each of counts 1 and 4 and counts 2 and 3 concurrent with each other and ordering that the sentences on counts 2 and 3 be only partly cumulative it is submitted his Honour has failed to impose an overall sentence that properly reflects the criminality of the respondent. 
     
      
    29 The Crown accepts that the count of robbery in company, the armed robbery offences, together with the offence on the Form 1 were committed in a period of less than 2 weeks such as may arguably justify more concurrence than would usually be appropriate. However, it is submitted that they were wholly separate from the offence upon which the parole order had been revoked, and separate from the 1999-2000 offences for which he served a 10 month sentence prior to extradition. Accordingly, it is submitted that the respondent’s crimes could not be regarded as offences committed as part of a single, discrete episode of criminality: (see R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 at [8]). 
     
      
    30 The Crown submitted that this Court should be careful to ensure that public confidence in the administration of criminal justice is not impinged upon by a perception that a person who commits multiple offences may receive a sentence normally considered appropriate in relation to but one of those offences. 
     
      
    31 The Crown further submitted that by reason of the fact that his Honour backdated the commencement of the sentences on counts 1 and 4, each fully concurrent with each other, and provided for them to commence on the same date as the commencement of the revocation of the parole period, the respondent has not been required to serve additional time in custody for the revocation of his parole. 
     
      
    32 In his brief remarks on sentence the sentencing judge stated that: “The offences are all offences in respect of which the guideline judgment in Henry is applicable.” However, his Honour did not go on and explain the consequences which followed from this determination and the Crown submitted that his Honour was in error. 
     
      
    33 The Crown submitted that the circumstances of the respondent were distinguishable from the factual circumstances postulated in the guideline judgment in R v Henry & Ors [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346. The circumstances contemplated by Spigelman CJ in Henry were as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i) Young offender with no or little criminal history; 
       
        
        (ii) Weapon, like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury; 
        
       
       (iii) Limited degree of planning; 
       
       (iv) Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof; 
       
        
        (v) Victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver; 
        
       
       (vi) Small amount taken; 
       
        
        (vii) Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case. 
        
       
      
    34 The guideline also applies to robbery in company: see R v Murchie (1999) 108 A Crim R 482; R v Poihipi [2001] NSWCCA 306 at [31]. 
     
      
    35 For these types of cases Henry indicates that a full term sentence between four and five years will generally be appropriate. Of course, as Spigelman CJ indicated, there may be circumstances of a particular offence or offender which will justify a sentence above or below that range. 
     
      
    36 In the present case the Crown submitted that each of the offences committed by the respondent was a worse offence than that contemplated in Henry. Critical to the distinction in the present case was the fact that the respondent had an extensive criminal history, in each armed robbery offence he was in company and that at the time of committing all the offences the respondent was subject to parole. This was, it was submitted, an important circumstance of aggravation: R v Fernando (2002) NSWCCA 28 at [40]-[42]. 
     
      
    37 The Crown submitted that although the respondent is not an old offender, he cannot be said to have an insignificant criminal history. Furthermore, both counts 3 and 4 required planning, involving as they did the use of a replica pistol and a stolen car. The amounts taken were not small, being the amounts of $850, $1400, $2300 and $1200. Having regard to all of these matters the Crown submitted that the starting point for the sentences should have been beyond the range set out in Henry. 
     
      
    38 The Crown accepted that the respondent pleaded guilty to all of the offences and, leaving aside the fact that having committed the offences he left the jurisdiction, had done so at the first reasonable opportunity. However, it is submitted that if Henry was the appropriate reference for the decision he was not entitled to the full discount for the utilitarian value of his plea, because a plea of guilty, albeit a late plea of guilty, is one of the characteristics of the kind of offence described in Henry. Notwithstanding the fact that in accordance with Henry a head sentence would generally be in the range of four to five years his Honour has set individual head sentence for each offence below the bottom end of the range, namely 3 years fixed term in relation to counts 1 and 4 and 45 months in relation to counts 2 and 3.  
     
      
    39 It was submitted that because his Honour applied a discount of 25% in accordance with the guideline judgment in R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383 on top of the Henry guideline the respondent has in fact received an effective discount of 35% for his plea of guilty in circumstances where there was no evidence of remorse or contrition and in any event there was a strong Crown case. 
     
      
    40 The Crown accepted that the sentencing judge was entitled to find that the respondent had some favourable subjective circumstances and to take those circumstances into account when sentencing the respondent. However, it was submitted that those circumstances carry little weight having regard to the need to ensure that a sentence imposed in relation to armed robbery reflects adequate provision for general deterrence: R v Spiero (1979) 22 SASR 543.  
     
      
    41 The need for general deterrence was emphasised by the Chief Justice in R v Sharma (2002) NSWCCA 142 at [74] where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Armed robberies of the character involved in the present proceedings, committed by young persons, generally with an addiction problem, are so prevalent that the objective of general deterrence is entitled to significant weight in the process of sentencing for this offence, notwithstanding the youth of the typical offender.” 
        
       
      
    42 The Crown emphasised that in Sharma the offender was actually nineteen years old, but nearly twenty, at the time of committing the offences for which he was sentenced. In the present case the respondent is now aged 24 although at the time at which he committed the offences he was aged 22. Far from being a mitigating factor it was submitted that the respondent’s age places him squarely within the category of a typical Henry offender. 
     
      
    43 The Crown also submitted that although his Honour indicated he was taking into account the Form One matter when sentencing in relation to the second count, the sentence imposed failed to properly have regard to the other offence. It was submitted that an additional penalty was required: see Attorney General’s Application under s 37 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No 1 of 2002) (2002) 137 A Crim R 180 at [40]-[42] per Spigelman CJ. 
     
      
    44 Because the sentencing judge imposed the same sentence for count 2, as for count 3, taking into account the matter on the Form One, each sentence to be served concurrently, it was submitted that his discretion has miscarried. 
     
      
    45 It was submitted that the respondent’s criminal history, his previous drug and property convictions demonstrate a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law raising a strong need for specific deterrence. The offences were committed in circumstances where they constitute a serious breach of parole which constitutes a serious aggravation of the offence: R v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28 at [41]-[42]; R v Vranic, NSWCCA, 7 May 1991, unreported. 
     
      
    46 The Crown accepted that there are significant inhibitions which have often been expressed by this Court in relation to Crown appeals. Although in this case the individual errors identified may not justify intervention, the Crown submitted that the ultimate sentences imposed by his Honour are manifestly inadequate and fail to reflect the objective seriousness of the respondent’s crime.  
     
      
       
      Respondent’s submissions 
       
      
    47 The respondent accepted that “the sentences, both individually and in totality, are lenient.” However, it was submitted that leniency alone, even if manifest, provides no basis for this Court’s intervention. Only if patent or latent error such that a sentence is not only lenient but, also, impermissibly so will intervention be justified. 
     
      
    48 In relation to the Crown’s submission that the sentencing judge has provided inappropriately for concurrency it was submitted that there is a substantial degree of temporal and causal connection between all of the offences. It was submitted that his Honour was not required to indicate the additional term imposed in relation to the matter on the Form One and that it should be accepted that his Honour did assimilate that matter appropriately when imposing the sentence as part of the overall sentencing process. 
     
      
    49 The respondent emphasised the fact that this Court has repeatedly indicated that it maintains a residual discretion not to interfere when the Crown appeals a sentence. In R v Hernando (2002) 136 A Crim R 451 Heydon JA said at 458: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown submissions correctly acknowledge that if this court is to accede to the Crown’s desire that the respondent be sentenced more heavily, it must surmount two hurdles. The first is to locate an appellable error in the sentencing judge’s discretionary decision. The second is to negate any reason why the residual discretion of the Court of Criminal Appeal not to interfere should be exercised.” 
        
       
      
    50 One basis upon which the Court may exercise its residual discretion in favour of a respondent is by reason of the delay in the bringing of the Crown appeal: see R v Hallocoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67; R v Gip (2006) NSWCCA 115. 
     
      
    51 In the present case the respondent accepts that the Director of Public Prosecutions provided a warning letter to the respondent at an early stage. The appeal was also brought within a reasonable time having regard to the administrative tasks involved in obtaining a transcript and making a formal decision to bring an appeal. However, the respondent emphasised that a significant period of delay nevertheless has occurred since the date of sentencing and the hearing of this appeal. It is this delay which the respondent emphasised will bring unnecessary hardship to the respondent and should persuade this Court not to intervene. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    52 This Court has, on many occasions, taken care to emphasise the principles governing appeals by the Crown. They were clearly defined by Wood CJ at CL in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “… it is important to note the principles which apply in relation to the determination of a Crown appeal against sentence: 
         
         
        (a) The normal restriction upon appellate review of the exercise of a discretion, as set out in  
        House v The King  
        (1936) 55 CLR 449, applies to crown appeals against sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen  
        (2000) 202 CLR 321; with the result that this Court cannot merely substitute its opinion as to the appropriate sentence, for that of a sentencing judge:  
        Lowndes v The Queen  
        (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671; rather, it may interfere only where error either latent or patent is shown;  
        R v Tait  
        (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388;  
        Wong & Leung v The Queen  
        (2001) 76 ALJR 79 at para 58 and 109. 
         
         
        (b) Appeals by the Crown should generally be rare;  
        Malvaso v The Queen  
        (1989) 168 CLR 227 at 234, and unless there is a clear error of principle identified, it would be exceptional for the Court to interfere;  
        R v Baker  
        [2001] NSWCCA 85. 
         
         
        (c) A Crown appeal against sentence is concerned with establishing matters of principle “for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons”: per Barwick CJ in  
        Griffiths v The Queen  
        (1977) 137 CLR 293 but this power extends to doing what is necessary to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing, that is, where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand:  
        Everett v The Queen  
        (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299;  
        Dinsdale v The Queen  
        (2000) 202 CLR 321, at para 61 and 62, and  
        Wong & Leung v The Queen  
        at para 109. 
         
         
        (d) The Court has a lively discretion to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it should have regard to the double jeopardy that a convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal:  
        R v Allpass  
        (1993) 72 A Crim R 561,  
        R v Papazis  
        (1991) 51 A Crim R 242 at 247, and  
        Wong & Leung v The Queen  
        at para 110. 
         
         
        (e) A sentence which is imposed as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal will generally be less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court:  
        R v Holder & Johnston  
        (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 256, and will generally be towards the lower end of the available range of sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen  
        at para 62.” 
        
       
      
    53 Wood CJ at CL referred to R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 where Spigelman CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The authorities make it clear that Crown appeals should be rare. It may be that the present practice does not reflect that restriction, nevertheless, successful Crown appeals should be rare. This is particularly so with respect to that category of appeals in which no particular error can be identified in the sentencing process and the Crown must rely on an assertion of manifest inadequacy as a basis for a conclusion that some error of principle must have occurred.”[19] 
        
       
      
    54 In Dinsdale Gaudron and Gummow JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “In the circumstances of the present case, the question for the Court of Criminal Appeal was whether the result reached by the trial judge had been “upon the facts …. unreasonable or plainly unjust [so that] the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law imposes in the court of first instance.” Was the sentence ‘manifestly wrong’?” [22] 
        
       
      
    55 Notwithstanding the reluctance of this Court to intervene when the Crown brings an appeal I am satisfied that the sentences which his Honour imposed in relation to these offences were so far below that which was appropriate that this Court must quash the sentences and resentence. I accept the Crown submissions that his Honour’s sentencing discretion miscarried by reason of his failure to distinguish the respondent’s circumstances from those considered in Henry. Both the serious nature of each offence and the fact that the respondent has a significant criminal history required a sentence greater than that suggested as appropriate in Henry. The seriousness of the offences and the respondent’s history of offending requires a sentence which properly meets the need for specific deterrence. 
     
      
    56 This was not one connected episode of criminality and the respondent should not have been sentenced on that basis. When a series of serious offences have been committed the sentences imposed must mark out the criminality of each offence. The sentences imposed failed to do this. 
     
      
    57 I am also satisfied that by providing a discount of 25% for the respondent’s guilty plea his Honour fell into error. The guideline sentence in Henry already incorporates a 10% discount for a plea and accordingly to provide a discount in the order of 35% was excessive. 
     
      
    58 With respect to the sentence imposed in relation to count 2, I also accept that error has occurred. For the reasons submitted by the Crown some additional penalty was required to be imposed because of the matter on the Form One. However, the two offences were so intimately related that only a modest increase in the head sentence was required. 
     
      
    59 Although there has been a delay between the sentencing and the hearing of this appeal I do not believe that delay provides any adequate reason for this Court not to intervene. The sentences which were imposed provide for the incarceration of the respondent until at least 17 February 2008. Delay will be a more significant factor when the time an offender has left to serve is twelve months or less. In the present case the Crown gave early notice that an appeal was being considered and there is no submission that any delay in the matter being heard was the responsibility of the Crown. 
     
      
    60 The respondent submitted that if resentencing the Court should accept that the respondent is at a cross-roads in his life. Having now been sentenced and punished for a series of serious offences it was submitted that the respondent has acknowledged his offending and is determined to reform. It is also submitted that the court should accept the respondent when he says that he is now seeking to rehabilitate himself from his drug addiction and accordingly it should be accepted that he has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    61 I accept that there is some evidence of the respondent’s desire to reform. However, having regard to his criminal history including offending when on parole I maintain considerable reservations as to whether this can be achieved. I do not believe a finding of special circumstances is justified. 
     
      
    62 I accept that the respondent pleaded guilty and is accordingly entitled to an appropriate discount. However, because I am satisfied that the respondent’s criminal history takes the sentence required beyond that provided by the guideline in Henry I will, in determining sentence, allow a full discount of 25%. I can discern no relevant distinction in the criminality involved in each offence and propose that the respondent be sentenced accordingly. In my opinion the following sentences should be imposed: 
     
      
       
      Count 1 
       
      A non-parole period of four years to commence on 18 February 2005 and expire on 17 February 2009 and a balance of term of 1 year and 4 months to expire on 17 June 2010. 
       
       
      Count 2 
       
      Taking into account the matter on the Form 1 a non-parole period of 4 years to commence 18 November 2005 and expire on 17 November 2009 and a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months to expire on 17 May 2011. 
       
       
      Count 3 
       
      A non-parole period of 4 years to commence on 18 February 2006 and expire on 17 February 2010 and a balance of term of 1 year and 4 months to expire on 17 June 2011. 
       
       
      Count 4 
       
      A non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months to commence on 18 August 2006 and expire on 17 May 2010 and a balance of term of 1 year and 9 months to expire on 17 February 2012. 
       
      
    63 Accordingly, the total non-parole period is 5 years and 3 months and the balance of the term is 1 year and 9 months. 
     
      
    64 In relation to the other offence relating to the possession of a prohibited drug, although it would be usual to provide an identifiable penalty for such offence, I am satisfied that having regard to the sentence I now propose it is not necessary to reconsider that matter.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff, Warwick Dean McDonald, is currently detained at the Long Bay prison hospital. He asserts that he is entitled to be released and he seeks relief by an order in the nature of habeas corpus. The defendants are the Commissioner of Corrective Services and, for reasons which will appear, the Minister for Health. The plaintiff seeks other relief, but that is not urgent and I am not asked to deal with it. 
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    2 On 9 August 2005 the plaintiff was received at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre, Silverwater, having been remanded in custody upon a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (and another charge to which it is unnecessary to refer). On 17 and 18 August 2005 two medical practitioners, one of whom was a psychiatrist, certified that the plaintiff was suffering from a mental illness, the nature of which is not material for present purposes. On 22 August 2005 Dr Michael Paton, acting under delegation from the Chief Health Officer of the Department of Health, ordered that the plaintiff be transferred to a hospital “as defined in the Mental Health Act, 1990”, and notified the Mental Health Review Tribunal of that order. 
     
      
    3 The order was made, and the notification to the Tribunal was given, in accordance with s97 of the Mental Health Act, which provides:  
     
      
       
        
        (1) If it appears to the Chief Health Officer on the certificates, in the form set out in Schedule 3, of 2 medical practitioners, one of whom is a psychiatrist, that a person imprisoned in a prison is a mentally ill person, the Chief Health Officer may order that the person be transferred to a hospital. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The Chief Health Officer must notify the Tribunal in writing of any order made under this section. 
        
       
      
    4 Pursuant to that order, and while he was still on remand, the plaintiff was transferred to the prison hospital at Long Bay on 11 September 2005. It is this procedure which lies at the heart of the issue which I must determine. 
     
      
    5 The plaintiff’s transfer to the hospital brought into place s100A(1) of the Mental Health Act, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        A forensic patient transferred from a prison to a hospital must be transferred back to a prison not later than 7 days after the patient is transferred from the prison, unless the Chief Health Officer or an authorised person is of the opinion: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) that the patient is a mentally ill person or the patient is suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) that other care of an appropriate kind would not be reasonably available to the patient in prison. 
        
       
       
      I shall turn later in these reasons to the expression “forensic patient” used in that subsection.  
       
      
    6 On 16 September 2005, on the basis of a further psychiatric report furnished three days earlier, Mr Richard Mathews, an authorised person within the meaning of s100A(1), certified that the plaintiff fell within pars (a) and (b) of that subsection. The certificate asserted that the plaintiff was mentally ill or mentally disordered and that other care of an appropriate kind would not reasonably be available to him in prison. Accordingly, the plaintiff remained in the hospital.  
     
      
    7 Section 86(1) of the Mental Health Act requires the Mental Health Review Tribunal, as soon as practicable after a person is transferred to a hospital under s97, to review the case of that person and to make a recommendation to “the prescribed authority” as to the person’s continued detention, care or treatment in the hospital. By cl 19(1) of the Mental Health Regulation 2000, the prescribed authority for present purposes is the Minister for Health.  
     
      
    8 On 27 October 2005 the Tribunal recommended that the plaintiff remain in the hospital, and in due course the Minister approved that recommendation. That approval is given force by s86(4), which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        If a recommendation is made under this section to the prescribed authority in respect of a person, the prescribed authority may, subject to the regulations, make an order for the person’s detention, care or treatment in the place (being a hospital, prison or other place) and in the manner specified in the order. 
        
       
       
      During the whole of this process the plaintiff was still a remand prisoner. However, on 30 November 2005 he was sentenced in a Local Court for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm to imprisonment for fifteen months, with a non-parole period of seven months, to date from 23 August 2005. The total sentence being less than three years, the sentencing magistrate made an order under s50 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
      1999 directing the plaintiff’s release at the end of the seven month non-parole period, that is, on 22 March 2006.  
       
      
    9 Although that parole order is the order of a court, the State Parole Authority has the power under s130 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 to revoke it. On 21 March 2006 the Authority purported to do so. However, after representations from the plaintiff’s solicitor, the Authority rescinded its revocation and directed that he was to be released by 4pm on 1 April 2006. Nevertheless, he remains in the prison hospital. To understand why that is so it is necessary to examine some further provisions of the Mental Health Act. 
     
      
       
      The Mental Health Act 
       
      
    10 “Forensic patient” is defined in Sch 1 of the Mental Health Act (the dictionary). The definition embraces four classes of people, expressed in pars (a) to (d). Paragraphs (a) and (d) are concerned with people who, under the Mental Health (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1990, have been found unfit to be tried, or whose fitness for trial is in question, and people found not guilty by reason of mental illness. Those paragraphs of the definition are immaterial for present purposes. However, pars (b) and (c) are expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (b) a person who is detained in a hospital pending the person’s committal for trial for an offence or pending the person’s trial for an offence, or 
        
       
       
        
        (c) a person who has been transferred to a hospital while serving a sentence of imprisonment and who has not been classified by the Tribunal as a continued treatment patient … 
        
       
       
      The expression “continued treatment patient” in par (c) need not concern us. The plaintiff fell within par (b) of the definition when he was transferred to the prison hospital on 11 September 2005. 
       
      
    11 Procedures relating to forensic patients are to be found in Chapter 5 of the Act. An important provision is s82, the relevant parts of which are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) The Tribunal may, at any time, and must, at least once every 6 months, review the case of each forensic patient and make a recommendation to the Minister:  
         
          
          (a) as to the patient’s continued detention, care or treatment in a hospital, prison or other place, or 
           
          … 
           
          (c) as to the patient’s release (either unconditionally or subject to conditions). 
          
         
         
        (2) The Tribunal must review the case of a forensic patient and make a recommendation to the Minister under this section if requested to do so by the Minister, the Attorney General, the Minister for Corrective Services, the Chief Health Officer or a medical superintendent. 
         
        …….. 
         
         
        (4) The Tribunal may not recommend the release of a forensic patient unless it is satisfied, on the evidence available to it, that the safety of the patient or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the person’s release. 
         
         
        (5) The Tribunal may not recommend the release of a forensic patient who:  
         
        …. 
         
         
          
          (b) has been transferred to a hospital while serving a sentence of imprisonment and has not served the term of the sentence or, if a non-parole period has been set in relation to the sentence, the non-parole period. 
          
         
        
       
      
    12 Sections 83 and 84 deal with recommendations by the Tribunal for the release of forensic patients. Section 84 enables the Minister, subject to certain qualifications and conditions which are not presently material, to order such a person’s release. 
     
      
    13 Sections 101 to 108 deal with the termination of a person’s classification as a forensic patient. Sections 101 to 104 are concerned with people who have been found not guilty by reason of a mental illness or unfit to be tried. Sections 105 to 107 are concerned with people who have been sentenced. Section 105 ensures that a person serving a term of imprisonment for which no non-parole period has been set ceases to be a forensic patient on the expiry of that term. Section 106, dealing with persons serving a sentence of imprisonment for life, need not concern us. 
     
      
    14 However, s107 is important. It provides: 
     
      
       
        
        A person who, while serving a term of imprisonment for which a non-parole period has been set, has been transferred to a hospital from a prison ceases to be a forensic patient:  
         
         
        (a) on the expiry of the term of imprisonment, or 
         
         
          
          (b) if the non-parole period has expired - on unconditional release by order of the prescribed authority following a recommendation of the Tribunal, or 
          
         
         
          
          (c) if the non-parole period has expired and the person has been released by order of the prescribed authority subject to conditions - on the expiry of any time specified in the conditions as being a time during which those conditions, or any of them, are to be complied with, or 
          
         
         
          
          (d) on being classified by the Tribunal as a continued treatment patient, or 
          
         
         
        (e) on being transferred to a prison, 
         
         
        whichever first occurs. 
        
       
      
    15 Another important provision is s108, dealing with remand prisoners, to which I shall turn later. 
     
      
       
      The Motion 
       
      
    16 The plaintiff was represented by Mr Beckett of counsel and the defendants by Mr Cogswell SC. I am indebted to both of them for their capable and well researched submissions, written and oral. The urgency of the matter means that I am unable in this judgment to give all their arguments the detailed consideration they deserve. 
     
      
    17 Mr Cogswell submitted that the basis of the plaintiff’s present detention is the Minister’s order under s86(4) of the Mental Health Act that he remain in the hospital, following the Tribunal’s recommendation of 27 October 2005. He argued that the plaintiff remains a forensic patient and, as such, is subject to the procedures in Chapter 5 of the Act. This is so even though his non-parole period has expired, although Mr Cogswell acknowledged that by virtue of s107 he would cease to be a forensic patient upon the expiry of his sentence. In effect, he argued, the question of the plaintiff’s release during the balance of his sentence has become a matter for the Minister, on the recommendation of the Tribunal, not the Parole Authority. This was said to be consistent with pars (b) and (c) of s107, which appear to envisage the oversight by the Tribunal and the Minister of a forensic patient such as the plaintiff after the expiration of his or her non-parole period.  
     
      
    18 This, Mr Cogswell argued, is also consistent with the objectives of the Mental Health Act to be found in s4, which embrace the necessity of providing hospital care to some mentally ill people on an involuntary basis. Provision for involuntary detention of people in the community in a hospital, also subject to the review and recommendation of the Tribunal, is to be found in Chapter 4 of the Act. For people in the prison system, said Mr Cogswell, those provisions are more or less mirrored in Chapter 5. Thus, within the terms of that Chapter, the release of forensic patients is a matter for the Minister on the recommendation of the Tribunal, and by s82(4) the Tribunal may not recommend the release of such a patient unless it is satisfied “that the safety of the patient or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the person’s release”. All this, he argued, is consonant with the tenor of the Act as a whole, which seeks to ensure the humane treatment of the mentally ill while protecting the public.  
     
      
    19 Mr Cogswell pointed out, however, that Chapter 5 is subjected to the requirements of the criminal justice system. Thus, by s82(5)(b), the Tribunal cannot recommend the release of a forensic patient who has been transferred to a hospital while serving a sentence during the term of that sentence or, if a non-parole period has been set, during that period. Equally, ss105 & 107 ensure that a forensic patient cannot be detained as such after the expiry of his or her sentence. 
     
      
    20 Mr Beckett put his submissions on behalf of the plaintiff on three alternative bases. I received in evidence copies of the various warrants issued in the Local Court which led to the plaintiff’s being detained in the prison system from 9 August 2005, when he was first remanded in custody. There were subsequent court appearances prior to the case finally being dealt with on 30 November 2005, each resulting in a further remand in custody. On all those occasions appropriate warrants requiring him to be received and kept in custody, pursuant to s181(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, were issued. On his being sentenced on 30 November 2005, a warrant of commitment under s62 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act was issued, directed to the Governor of the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre, Silverwater.  
     
      
    21 Put shortly, Mr Beckett’s first submission was that the plaintiff’s status as a forensic patient did not affect his right to release by virtue of the parole order made by the sentencing magistrate. He argued that the various procedures under the Mental Health Act to which I have referred did not create “a separate detention” of the plaintiff, and were no more than directions as to his placement within the prison system during the period of his confinement authorised by the warrants. That period, he said, ended upon the expiration of the non-parole period and, by the terms of the court’s parole order and by virtue of s131 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act, he should then have been released. Indeed, he argued that the effect of the Parole Authority’s recission of its decision to revoke the parole order is that the plaintiff became entitled to release on the date specified in the order, 22 March 2006. However that may be, he said, the plaintiff is certainly entitled to release now. 
     
      
    22 The difficulty with that submission is that the plaintiff undoubtedly became a forensic patient, by virtue of par (b) of the definition in Sch1 of the Act, upon his transfer to the hospital on 11 September 2005. His status as such cannot be ignored. A question arises, however, whether that remained his status after he was sentenced. This brings me to Mr Beckett’s second submission, which I find persuasive.  
     
      
    23 I referred earlier to the sections of the Mental Health Act providing for the termination of a person’s classification as a forensic patient. It will be remembered that ss105 & 107 each deal with people who had been transferred to a hospital from a prison “while serving a term of imprisonment…”. The only reference to persons on remand is to be found in s108, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        A person on remand who has been transferred to a hospital ceases to be a forensic patient: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) on release (which the Minister is hereby authorised to order or to otherwise ensure) following advice by the Director of Public Prosecutions to the Minister that the person will not be further proceeded against in respect of the offence in relation to which the person has been remanded, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) on being transferred to a prison, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        whichever first occurs. 
        
       
      
    24 By its terms, that section appears to be confined to the termination of a person’s classification as a forensic patient during the remand period. There is no express provision dealing with the position of a remand prisoner who is in due course sentenced. Nor, for that matter, is there any such provision for a remand prisoner who is later released on bail or ultimately acquitted of the charge or charges which led to the remand. On the face of it, this could lead to the ludicrous position that a remand prisoner who did not meet either of the conditions in s108 could be detained as a forensic patient indefinitely.  
     
      
    25 Mr Beckett’s argument was that a person transferred to a hospital whilst on remand ceases to be a forensic patient when the period of remand comes to an end. Adopting the terms of par (b) of the definition, he said that that status is terminated once a person’s trial is no longer pending. The plaintiff’s trial came to an end on 30 November 2005, when he was sentenced. (There is no issue that the word “trial” includes a summary hearing, whether defended or after a plea of guilty.) 
     
      
    26 As I have said, Mr Cogswell’s position was the plaintiff is subject to s107 of the Act (and, for that reason, is entitled to release upon the expiry of his sentence). The difficulty arises because that section is expressed to apply to a person “who, while serving a term of imprisonment…, has been transferred to a hospital…”. Unquestionably, when the plaintiff was transferred to the hospital on 11 September 2005 he was not yet serving a term of imprisonment. Mr Cogswell sought to meet this difficulty in two ways. 
     
      
    27 Firstly, he argued that in retrospect the plaintiff could be said to have been serving a term of imprisonment on the date of his transfer, because the sentencing magistrate backdated his sentence to 23 August 2005. Secondly, and alternatively, he argued that the words “has been transferred to a hospital” should be understood as an adjectival phrase describing the “person” with whom the section is concerned. Recasting the opening words of the section in that way, he said, they would read: 
     
      
       
        
        A transferred person who is serving a term of imprisonment…ceases to be a forensic patient…” 
        
       
      
    28 Mr Beckett was prepared to embrace the first of those arguments if I rejected his submission that the plaintiff’s status as a forensic patient came to an end when he ceased to be a remand prisoner. In that way, the spectre of indefinite detention could be avoided. However, in my view, both interpretations strain the plain language of the section and are unacceptable. The opening words of s107 (like s105) are clear. They refer to a person who was serving a term of imprisonment at the time when he or she was transferred to a hospital. 
     
      
    29 The status of the person at that time cannot be altered retrospectively. If the person had not been sentenced at the time of the transfer, a backdated sentence passed subsequently does not alter the fact that he or she was a remand prisoner at the relevant time. Equally, Mr Cogswell’s alternative argument amounts to a significant distortion of the opening words of the section. Indeed, he acknowledged in oral argument that “it may stretch the language a bit”.  
     
      
    30 Accordingly, I am persuaded by Mr Beckett’s submission that the plaintiff ceased to be a forensic patient when his court proceedings were completed. The only source of his detention thereafter was the commitment warrant issued by the court on that day. Presumably, a further order for transfer to a hospital could have been made under s97 of the Mental Health Act after he was sentenced. He would then have become a forensic patient by virtue of par (c) of the definition in the Schedule. Indeed, that course may well have been taken if the commitment warrant had been observed according to its terms, and the plaintiff had been delivered into the custody of the Governor of the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre.  
     
      
    31 However that may be, no such order has been made and the plaintiff is now entitled to be released. Whether he should have been released on 22 March 2006 or the date later specified by the Parole Authority, 1 April 2006, is not a matter which I need to determine. Of course, on his release, he may still be subject to involuntary detention in a hospital under Chapter 4 of the Act. 
     
      
    32 Such provision as the Mental Health Act makes for persons transferred to a hospital while on remand is clearly unsatisfactory, and amendment would appear to be called for to clarify the position. I have done the best I can to interpret the relevant part of the Act in a purposive manner, while recognising that it is legislation dealing with the liberty of the subject and having regard to the legislative intention of the Act as a whole expressed in s4(2): 
     
      
       
        
        It is the intention of Parliament that the provisions of this Act are to be interpreted and that every function, discretion and jurisdiction conferred or imposed by this Act is, as far as practicable, to be performed or exercised so that: 
         
          
         
        
       
       
        
        -(a) persons who are mentally ill or who are mentally disordered receive the best possible care and treatment in the least restrictive environment enabling the care and treatment to be effectively given, and 
         
         
          
          (b) in providing for the care and treatment of persons who are mentally ill or who are mentally disordered, any restriction on the liberty of patients and other persons who are mentally ill or mentally disordered and any interference with their rights, dignity and self-respect are kept to the minimum necessary in the circumstances. 
          
         
        
       
      
    33 I should record that Mr Beckett’s third alternative submission involved the interpretation of the opening words of s107 in a different context, in the light of the decision of James J in Hamilton v Director General, Department of Health & Anor (unreported, 13 April 1995). In the event, it is not necessary that I determine that matter. 
     
      
    34 I shall consult the parties about the terms of the order I should I make and, if necessary, I shall hear argument on costs.

     Hesham ELSOBKY v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Hesham Elsobky, pleaded guilty in the District Court to a charge of accessory after the fact to armed robbery, an offence carrying a maximum sentence of imprisonment for fourteen years. Nield DCJ sentenced him to imprisonment for two and a half years, comprising a non-parole period of one year and three months and a balance of term of the same length, dating from 10 May 2005. The non-parole period will expire on 9 August 2006, about two and a half months hence. 
     
      
    3 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against that sentence. He appeared unrepresented, and relied upon written submissions and some accompanying documents which he had forwarded to the registry. He supplemented this material by oral argument. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    4 The facts can be stated shortly. The victim of the armed robbery was the applicant’s wife and the perpetrator of the robbery was a young lady named Cassandra Collins. The applicant had been in an intimate relationship with Ms Collins, although he was still living with his wife at the time. 
     
      
    5 In the early evening of 18 January 2003, outside a church at Liverpool, Ms Collins threatened the victim with a knife and seized her handbag. The victim struggled and suffered some lacerations to her left forearm and hand before being pushed to the ground by Ms Collins. Ms Collins then ran to a car parked in a nearby street, which was occupied by the applicant. He drove her from the scene. Later that night he was arrested, in circumstances which need not be outlined, and a search of the car revealed some of the items from the victim’s handbag concealed under the lining in the boot.  
     
      
    6 The applicant was originally charged with complicity in the armed robbery and, indeed, he was to face trial for that offence in the District Court, jointly with Ms Collins. It was at a late stage that he pleaded guilty to the charge of accessory after the fact. Judge Nield reduced the sentence he would otherwise have passed by fifteen percent in recognition of that plea. 
     
      
    7 Ms Collins was also sentenced by Judge Nield, after being found guilty at trial. She was sentenced to imprisonment for eight years with a non-parole period of five years. She appealed against conviction and sentence and, as it happens, judgment in her appeal was handed down on the day the present application was heard. The appeal against conviction was dismissed. Her appeal against sentence was allowed only to the extent of altering its commencement date to incorporate a period of pre-trial custody.  
     
      
       
      Subjective case 
       
      
    8 The applicant was thirty-six years old at the time of the offence and is now thirty-nine. He was born in Egypt. He married the victim in that country and they had three children there. The family migrated to this country in 1997 and he is now an Australian citizen.  
     
      
    9 Shortly after their arrival in Australia, his wife suffered serious spinal injuries in a motor vehicle accident. At the end of 2004 she sustained a further injury to her back and to her ankles. She has continued to experience significant disabilities, originating in the car accident. The applicant had been the primary carer for her and for the three children. In addition, their youngest son suffers from urethral and bladder problems. He has required operative treatment in the past and will require more in the future. He is incontinent and needs to wear pads or nappies.  
     
      
    10 The applicant was receiving a carer’s payment. His only employment in this country was in the earlier part of 2003, when he worked as a packer until he himself sustained a back injury. Thereafter he also received worker’s compensation payments. 
     
      
    11 Although she was the victim of the offence, his wife gave evidence in the sentence proceedings to the effect that she was dependant upon him for her own personal care and for the care of the children. As to the youngest child, in particular, she said that she was unable to attend to his personal needs arising from his condition because of her disabilities and because, in any event, he was embarrassed to have her do so. His Honour accepted that the family would “suffer greatly” from the applicant’s being imprisoned, and it was for this reason that he found special circumstances justifying a departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period.  
     
      
    12 The applicant has a criminal record, to which it is not necessary to refer except to note that in July 2001 he was dealt with in a Local Court for assaulting his wife and contravening an apprehended domestic violence order which she had been granted. For the assault he was fined and for the contravention of the apprehended domestic violence order he was placed on a two year bond. That bond was current at the time of the subject offence.  
     
      
       
      The application 
       
      
    13 Much of the material which the applicant had produced in writing, and which he addressed orally, related to developments since he had been sentenced. Some of it dealt with difficulties he was experiencing in prison, but most of it was devoted to the present position of his family. Strictly, of course, this material could be received only if the Court decided that it should intervene and re-sentence him. That said, the information he supplied about his family was much as one might expect following his incarceration and did not disclose anything significantly different from the evidence which was before his Honour.  
     
      
    14 The thrust of his application was that inadequate recognition had been given to his plea of guilty and to the hardship his family would suffer from his being imprisoned, and that the sentence is manifestly excessive. I shall deal with each of those matters in turn.  
     
      
       
      Plea of guilty 
       
      
    15 According to the applicant, his barrister in the sentence proceedings gave him to understand that agreement had been reached with the Director of Public Prosecutions that he would not be imprisoned if he pleaded guilty. He adduced no evidence to that effect, and the proposition is inherently improbable. If he does believe that to have been the position, it may be the result of some misapprehension of the advice which his counsel had tendered to him. He did not seek to go behind his plea of guilty.  
     
      
    16 He said that, in any event, he should have been afforded a twenty-five percent discount of sentence for his plea. That figure is at the top of the range of discount for a plea of guilty propounded in R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. It is well settled that the discount to be allowed for a plea of guilty is very much in the discretion of the sentencing judge in each case, and depends upon the nature of the case and the timing of the plea. Here, the plea was entered at a very late stage of the proceedings. To recognise it by a discount of fifteen percent was well within the proper exercise of his Honour’s discretion.  
     
      
       
      Hardship to family 
       
      
    17 The primary thrust of the applicant’s argument was that his Honour gave inadequate weight to the hardship his family would suffer from his imprisonment. The effect of the evidence, he asserted, was that they could not cope without him.  
     
      
    18 The credibility of his wife’s evidence about that matter in the sentence proceedings was challenged but, as I have said, his Honour accepted that to imprison the applicant would cause the family great suffering. However, his Honour went on to observe that the effect of his imprisonment upon the family was not “unusual or exceptional”, and that, unfortunately, “a wife and children suffer greatly when a husband and father is sentenced to a period of imprisonment for having committed an offence.” 
     
      
    19 Those observations are consistent with well-settled authority about the relevance to sentence of the hardship the imprisonment of a person might cause to others. It is sufficient to refer to R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510, per Gleeson CJ at 515 – 7. The Chief Justice said (at 515): 
     
      
       
        
        Sentencing judges and magistrates are routinely obliged, in the course of their duties, to sentence offenders who may be breadwinners of families, carers, paid or unpaid, of the disabled, parents of children, protectors of persons who are weak or vulnerable, employers upon whom workers depend for their livelihood, and many others, in a variety of circumstances bound to result in hardship to third parties if such an offender is sentenced to a term of full-time imprisonment. 
        
       
      
    20 The Chief Justice referred (at 516) to a passage from the judgment of Wells J in R v Wirth (1976) 14 SASR 291 at 295 – 6: 
     
      
       
        
        Hardship to spouse, family, and friends, is the tragic, but inevitable, consequence of almost every conviction and penalty recorded in a criminal court… It seems to me that courts would often do less than their clear duty – especially where the element of retribution, deterrence, or protection of society is the predominant consideration – if they allowed themselves to be much influenced by the hardship that prison sentences, which from all other points of view were justified, would be likely to cause to those near and dear to prisoners. 
        
       
      
    21 It is for those reasons that it is only in exceptional cases that a sentence will be reduced because of the effect upon others of an offender’s imprisonment. In the present case, his Honour did make an allowance for the predicament of the family by a significant reduction of the non-parole period which would have otherwise have been produced by the application of the statutory proportion. The usual proportion (seventy-five percent) of a sentence of two and a half years would have been a non-parole period of one year, ten months and two weeks. That period was reduced by seven and a half months to one year and three months. There is no error in his Honour’s approach.  
     
      
       
      Manifestly excessive? 
       
      
    22 Finally, the applicant argued that the sentence is excessive and that, for that reason alone, it should be reduced. That argument also must be rejected.  
     
      
    23 As I have said, the offence carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for fourteen years. That the applicant would be prepared to be involved in any way in the robbery of his disabled wife is, to say the least, an unattractive feature of the case. Moreover, he was on a bond at the time and sentencing courts have always taken a very serious view of the commission of offences by persons subject to conditional liberty. In R v Readman (1990) 47 A Crim R 181, Maxwell J said (at 184): 
     
      
       
        
        This Court has repeatedly stated that the commission of an offence by an offender who is in the community on conditional liberty, whether that be on bail, on a recognisance, or on parole, will be considered as a matter that aggravates the offence. 
        
       
      
    24 In all the circumstances, it was clearly open to his Honour to impose a full-time custodial sentence and the length of the sentence was, again, well within the proper exercise of his Honour’s discretion. 
     
      
    25 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    26 HOEBEN J: I agree with Hidden J.

      2004/33 Regina v Glenn Allan Waters 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 On 3 March 2006 the offender pleaded guilty to a charge that on 10 January 2005 he did murder Gregory Lansdowne. He comes before me for sentence. 
     
      
    2 The deceased was 29 years of age when he met his death. He had, for some time, pursued a lifestyle of living on social security, not working, drinking heavily and using drugs. He became homeless and generally lived in squats in the Parramatta area or slept under bridges.  
     
      
    3 Victim impact statements from his parents were read, testifying to the effect upon them of the deceased’s death and the loss of their hopes that one day their son would change his ways and become reconciled with them, a hope destroyed by the actions of the offender. I have had regard to the victim impact statements to the extent permitted by law – R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76.  
     
      
    4 The deceased’s lifestyle brought him into contact with other people who were similarly placed, including the offender, and a Ms Lawrence with whom the offender had a close relationship.  
     
      
    5 At the time he met his death the deceased was living in a derelict fire-damaged house in Parramatta. The offender, Ms Lawrence and others had shared that accommodation for a time but had moved to another house shortly before the deceased’s death. At the time of his death the deceased was sharing the accommodation with a Ms Ritchie. 
     
      
    6 Ms Lawrence claimed the deceased owed her $20. The offender claimed the deceased owed him $60. The offender also was of the opinion that the deceased was endeavouring to commence a relationship with Ms Ritchie, whilst her boyfriend, a friend of the offender, was in gaol. 
     
      
    7 On 10 January 2005 the offender and Ms Lawrence consumed a considerable quantity of alcohol and the offender used some drugs. In the evening they decided to visit the deceased. Shortly after 11pm they proceeded to the deceased’s squat. The offender told police in an electronically recorded interview on 17 January 2005 that in the course of walking to the deceased’s squat he became angry at the deceased and wanted to teach him a lesson. He took a metal pipe 2.5 – 3 feet long which was attached to a shovel handle from the backyard of the deceased’s squat with the intention of hitting the deceased with it.  
     
      
    8 There was evidence from a Mr Lambert that the offender and Ms Lawrence had taken the metal implement when they left the house to visit the deceased. If this was the case it may be the offender’s intent to strike the deceased with it was formed earlier than he admits. However I am unable to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the offender had an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased when he left the house where he was residing. Accordingly it is unnecessary to determine whether the metal implement was taken from the house where the offender was living or from the backyard of the squat. 9 The offender and Ms Lawrence entered the squat through the back door. The deceased had been asleep in his bed. Ms Ritchie was in another bed in the same room. Ms Lawrence went to Ms Ritchie and pulled a doona over her head. The deceased awoke and the offender struck him with the pipe attached to the shovel handle. The offender told police in his record of interview that he hit the deceased in the head first then in both knees then could not stop himself and continued to hit the deceased, swinging at the upper body and that, all up, he hit him about eight times before leaving. He, Ms Lawrence and Ms Ritchie returned to the house where the offender was then living. He was arrested on 17 January 2005 and charged with the murder of the deceased. 
     
      
    10 The deceased’s death was caused by blunt trauma to the head. There was extensive disruption to the facial bones which would have occluded the airways. There was evidence of aspiration of a small bone fragment indicating the facial trauma had occurred during life and this was further substantiated by the pattern of expirated blood in the region of the facial area at the scene. There was further evidence of blunt trauma on the body principally involving the lower limbs, but also on the left of the chest and left upper arm. The injuries were consistent with an attack using the metal pipe attached to the shovel handle.  
     
      
    11 I am satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the offender, when he entered the squat, intended to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased and that was his intent when he first struck the deceased in the head and knees.  
     
      
    12 Thereafter he continued to strike the deceased, but I am unable to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the offender had, by then, formed an intention to kill the deceased as opposed to intending to continue to inflict grievous bodily harm. I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that at all times during the assault the offender intended to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased. 
     
      
    13 The offender did not give evidence. The reports of the psychiatrist, Dr Westmore, and a letter from the offender’s parents, provide the following profile of the offender. He was born on 4 December 1975. He was the eldest of three children and grew up in a happy, stable family. He was educated to the end of year 10 and was an average scholar. He had poor teacher relations and was suspended on a few occasions. On leaving school he commenced, but did not complete, an apprenticeship as a plasterer. He worked as a plasterer and palette racker but ceased working in 2003. He started using illicit drugs in his teenage years and has used a wide range of drugs along with bingeing on alcohol. His behaviour led to the dislocation of his relationship with his family and he was living as a homeless person on social security. He has an eight year old child from a past relationship. He has a current partner, a letter from whom was tendered and considered by the Court. 
     
      
    14 Dr Westmore, following examination of the offender on 3 August 2005 reported: 
     
      
       
        
        He was not suffering from a major depressive illness. No psychotic symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations were displayed or described. He was alert and attentive and [the doctor] thought of average intelligence … Obviously his longer term management should involve drug and alcohol counselling which hopefully will be extended into the community on his release.  
        
       
      
    15 Dr Westmore re-examined the offender on 24 October 2005 when the offender gave a history of depression when he was aged 17 or 18. Dr Westmore concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        There is nothing in his history to suggest he suffered a profound or depressive illness in his teenage years and his mood state disturbance, as he reports it, is likely to have been of an adjustment disorder or reactive type. 
        
       
       
      He noted the offender acknowledged using some cannabis since coming into custody. He also noted the offender acknowledged what he had done was “very wrong” and that that had only hit home a few months ago and then it hit hard. 
       
      
    16 In a letter dated 8 March 2006 Dr Westmore stated: 
     
      
       
        
        It would be reasonable to assume that Mr Waters’ re-offending risk will be significantly reduced if he can enter into total and extended sobriety from all illicit drugs and alcohol use. If he continues to use drugs in prison then that will be a poor prognostic feature but the real test will occur when he returns to the community and is challenged by the ready availability of drugs and alcohol. I cannot say how vulnerable he is to peer pressure or how committed he might be towards rehabilitation and sobriety … It is likely he will spend an extended period in custody and he will suffer the effects of institutionalisation. On his release he will require considerable community social based support to help him readapt to community living and maintain his sobriety.  
        
       
      
    17 There was tendered on behalf of the offender a report by a pharmacologist, Dr Neering, as to the effect of the offender’s drug and alcohol consumption on the day in question. I infer from the report that Dr Neering had some doubt as to the reliability of the offender’s estimate of his drug and alcohol consumption on that day. No submissions were directed to this report by Senior Counsel for the offender. I regard the consumption of drugs and alcohol by the offender on that day as a neutral factor neither aggravating nor mitigating the offence.  
     
      
    18 The offender’s criminal record contains convictions for numerous motor vehicle offences and a number of convictions for stealing and malicious damage as well as a conviction for possession of an offensive weapon. There are no convictions for crimes of violence.  
     
      
    19 Senior counsel for the offender submitted that the objective features were that the offence was extremely grave; the motive seemed to have been trivial, at most a grossly misplaced loyalty to a friend and that the Court would find that when the assault commenced there was an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm followed by a loss of control but that the Court would not find beyond a reasonable doubt the offender had formed an intention to kill.  
     
      
    20 Senior counsel for the offender submitted that the subjective features were primarily the plea of guilty, a degree of remorse or at least the acceptance of responsibility; that the offence was out of character in the absence of a record for violence; and that there were grounds for optimism that the offender’s lifestyle would change for the better as a result of the imprisonment, the reconnection of contact with his family and assistance which was now available to him. 
     
      
    21 The offender, when arrested, admitted to police that he had killed the deceased. However he did not enter a plea of guilty at the first opportunity and was committed for trial. On 2 December 2005 when first arraigned he pleaded not guilty and his trial was listed to commence on 1 May 2006. On 14 February 2006 the Crown was informed the offender intended to withdraw his plea and enter a plea of guilty. This occurred on 3 March 2006. 
     
      
    22 Senior counsel for the offender submitted that the utilitarian value of the plea should be assessed at or about 25%. This submission appears to be supported by the Crown.  
     
      
    23 The utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10 – 25% discount on sentence. The determination of where, within such a range, the discount should fall in a particular case is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge. There are two circumstances which will generally affect the appropriate level of discount in a particular case namely: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) The time at which a plea is entered. A plea entered at committal has more significant utilitarian benefit than a plea entered at first listing, which in turn has the greater benefit than a plea entered at the beginning of trial; and  
        
       
       
        
        (ii) The complexity of the issues about which evidence will have to be gathered and adduced affects the value of the plea. The greater the difficulty of assembling the relevant evidence and the greater the length and complexity of the trial, the greater the utilitarian value of a plea –  
        R v Thompson  
        (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 [152] – [154] and [160]. 
        
       
      
    24 The plea of guilty was not entered at the earliest opportunity nor was the case one of such complexity as to justify a significantly higher utilitarian value than otherwise would have been appropriate. I have had regard to the various matters advanced by senior counsel for the offender in support of the appropriateness of a 25% discount. However in my opinion the appropriate discount for the utilitarian value of the plea is 20%. 
     
      
    25 I accept there is an element of remorse now present and that the offence is out of character in the absence of a record of violence. Whether the offender will take advantage of opportunities afforded him by his imprisonment will depend upon his attitude which at this time, in my opinion, cannot be predicted with any degree of confidence. 
     
      
    26 Senior counsel for the offender has submitted there are grounds for finding special circumstances in that the offender will be required for the first time to serve a lengthy period of imprisonment, he has not been convicted of an offence of violence before and there will be a huge adjustment required of him upon his return to the community. 
     
      
    27 I have given consideration to whether I should make a finding of special circumstances for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 such as to justify a departure from the statutory proportion between the balance of the term of the sentence and the non parole period. There will undoubtedly be a large adjustment required of the offender upon his return to the community. It will be necessary for him to have the benefit of supervision upon his release from custody with a view to ensuring that he does not lapse back into alcohol and drug abuse. However, the sentence which I feel it necessary to impose is such that the application of the statutory ratio will produce an adequate period under supervision. I am not persuaded that special circumstances are established in this case. 
     
      
    28 The maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment (Crimes Act 1900 s 19A(1)). It was submitted for the offender, and accepted by the Crown, that this was not a case where it would be appropriate to impose a life sentence. I agree.  
     
      
    29 The offence occurred after the introduction of the standard non parole period provisions contained in Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The table contained in that division provides a standard non parole period for murder of 20 years in the case of an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness - Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 s 54A. 
     
      
    30 The standard non parole period provided for in the table to Division 1A was intended to apply to sentences imposed after conviction following trial and not to sentences imposed where, as here, a plea of guilty has been entered, R v Way [2004] 60 NSWLR 168, R v Tobar [2004] NSWCCA 391 at [30]. However the role of the standard non parole period is that of a reference point to be compared with the sentence which is provisionally reached after an assessment has been made of the relative seriousness of the subject offence, and of the various aggravating and mitigating factors as well as any other subjective factor that may be present, including in particular the fact that the offender entered a plea of guilty – R v Way at [122]. 
     
      
    31 Senior counsel for the offender submitted that the appropriate non parole period in the circumstances of this case would be 13 or 14 years with a parole period in the vicinity of 7 years thus producing a head sentence of about 20 years. He contended that had the standard non parole period had application, the matter would have fallen below the middle of the range of objective seriousness due to the state of mind of the offender and his intention being to inflict grievous bodily harm rather than to kill the deceased, his loss of control and the circumstances of his life. 
     
      
    32 Although the Crown commended to the Court the sentence proposed by senior counsel for the offender he said that had the standard non parole period had direct application the offence would have been at least in the middle of the range of objective seriousness.  
     
      
    33 I have taken into account the purposes of sentencing stated in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 s 3A and the statutory requirements of s 21A of that Act.  
     
      
    34 This matter involved an unprovoked and brutal attack upon a virtually defenceless person. Having regard to the seriousness of the offence and the subjective and mitigating factors raised and, using the standard non parole period as a reference point, I have concluded that the appropriate starting point is imprisonment for 25 years less the plea discount of 20%. I do not find any special circumstances such as would justify a variation of the statutory proportion between the non parole period and the period on parole. Accordingly the sentence will be imprisonment for a non parole period of 15 years with a balance of term of 5 years. 
     
      
    35 The offender has been in custody since 17 January 2005 in respect of this offence. I propose to backdate the commencement of the term of imprisonment to that date. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    36 Glenn Allan Waters I sentence you to imprisonment for a non parole period of 15 years to commence on 17 January 2005 and expire on 16 January 2020 and to a balance of term of 5 years commencing on 17 January 2020 and expiring on 16 January 2025. The overall sentence accordingly is one of imprisonment for 20 years to date from 17 January 2005 and expire on 16 January 2025. The non parole period of 15 years is to date from 17 January 2005 and expire on 16 January 2020. The last mentioned date is the earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole.

     MARTIN V. THE TRUSTEES OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH OF THE ARCHDIOCESE OF SYDNEY 
     
     
     Judgment 
    1 GILES JA: Like Hodgson JA, whose reasons I have read in draft, I find whether reasonable care was not exercised extremely difficult.2 Students engaged in the activities at the camp were not to be coddled, and were to be challenged. There was a risk of falling and injury when mounting either ramp of Mt Kosciusko, even with full instruction and supervision, but that did not mean that students should not engage in the activity or that their school would be liable to them. The reasonable care required of a school had to take into account the nature of the Mt Kosciusko activity and that an inherent risk was to be accepted. There must be remembered in determining whether there has been a failure to take reasonable care that the hind-sight of focus on the happening of a foreseeable risk must not distort the determination, and the observations of Ipp JA in The Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the Archdiocese of Sydney v Kondrajian [2001] NSWCA 308 at [66] - 
     
      
       
        
        “66 The question of what amounts to reasonable care in a given case must be seen in the context that it is neither practicable nor desirable to maintain a system of education that seeks to exclude every risk of injury. Otherwise, as Morris LJ said in  
        Wright v Cheshire County Council 
         (1952) 2 All ER 789 at 796 ‘only inactivity and inanition could be planned’. And as McNair J observed in  
        Jeffrey v London County Council 
         (1954) 52 LGR 521 at 523:  
         
         
          
          ‘[S]chool authorities…must strike some balance between the meticulous supervision of children every moment of the time when they are under their care, and the very desirable object of encouraging the sturdy independence of children as they grow up…’.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    3 I have concluded, not without doubt, that reasonable care was not exercised, but for slightly different reasons from those of Hodgson JA. 4 On the well-known instruction of Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 at 47-8, it had to be asked what a reasonable man would do in relation to the risk of injury, a task calling for “consideration of the magnitude of the risk and the degree of the probability of its occurrence, along with the expense, difficulty and inconvenience of taking alleviating action and any other conflicting responsibilities which the defendant may have”.5 To this was added s 5B of the Civil Liability Act 2002 - 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        5B General principles 
         
        (1) A person is not negligent in failing to take precautions against a risk of harm unless:  
         
          
          (a) the risk was foreseeable (that is, it is a risk of which the person knew or ought to have known), and 
           
          (b) the risk was not insignificant, and 
           
          (c) in the circumstances, a reasonable person in the person’s position would have taken those precautions. 
          
         
        
        
        (2) In determining whether a reasonable person would have taken precautions against a risk of harm, the court is to consider the following (amongst other relevant things):  
         
          
          (a) the probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken, 
           
          (b) the likely seriousness of the harm, 
           
          (c) the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm, 
           
          (d) the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    6 As appears from the reasons of Hodgson JA, the evidence of instruction on how to climb the Mt Kosciusko ramps, and on how to deal with slipping and falling, was at best sketchy, and the girls said that they were not instructed or did not recall being instructed on how to climb safely. It may be that that alone did not mean failure to take reasonable care; the plaintiff did not lead evidence of what instruction should have been given, and to an extent the challenge properly presented to the girls was to achieve a difficult climb. Further, there was the evidence that the Mt Kosciusko activity had been undertaken by a great many students without serious incident, use which may well have included sketchy instruction and wet conditions.7 However, the defendant was required to respond, through Ms Stavert and Mr Hill, to the risk of injury foreseeable on the particular occasion. Two or perhaps three girls preceding the plaintiff had slipped, and it should have been evident that they were having difficulty in keeping their footing on the ramp. This would have been due to one or a combination of an incorrect climbing technique and wet shoes, compromising the grip of the shoes on the ramp as they ascended holding onto the rope. While one girl did succeed in climbing, the slipping of the two or three girls should have alerted those supervising the activity to a risk considerably greater than the inherent risk, and to the need to meet it by correcting the climbing technique or the slipperiness from wet shoes or, if that could not be done, calling off the activity of climbing the right-hand ramp. 8 There was an increased risk, one which could come home when a girl was two or three metres above the ground, and a “spotter” or ”catcher” could well not prevent or alleviate injury from falling from that height; another of the students acting as a “spotter” or “catcher” would be quite unlikely to do so. The increased risk was foreseeable and not insignificant, and if a girl did slip and fall from a height (as the two or three girls had not – they slipped at an early point in the climb) there could be a quite serious injury. It was easy to meet the increased risk in the manner abovementioned, and to let the girls undertake the less risky challenge of climbing the other ramp with the horizontal logs.9 Ms Stavert’s attention was given to the other ramp with the horizontal logs. If Mr Hill was giving attention to the right-hand ramp on which the plaintiff slipped, he did not intervene. The failure to appreciate, or to respond to, the increased risk of injury was within the particular of failure in instruction and supervision, and reasonable care was not exercised.10 It was not submitted that there was the materialisation of an obvious risk of a dangerous recreational activity engaged in by the plaintiff (Civil Liability Act s.5L).11 I agree with Hodgson JA as to damages, and with the orders his Honour proposes.12 HODGSON JA: On 1 June 2005, Acting Judge Boulton gave judgment for the defendant with costs, in proceedings in which the appellant had sued the respondent for damages for personal injury, arising out of an accident that occurred on 9 November 2000. The appellant appeals from that judgment.CIRCUMSTANCES13 The appellant was born on 14 July 1986, and in 2000 she was a Year 8 student at All Saints Catholic Girls’ College at Liverpool. 14 In November 2000, the College conducted a two-day camp for Year 8 students at Cataract Scout Park, Baden Powell Drive, Appin. Students were to depart by bus from the school at 9am on Thursday 9 November and return at 3pm on Friday 10 November. In the letter to parents enclosing a parental permission form, the camp was described as an “adventure-style camp”, with aims including to “develop skills in coping with obstacles”. 15 At the camp, the girls were divided into groups of between 15 and 20, each group being supervised by a teacher and an instructor from the camp. The appellant was in a group supervised by a teacher Ms. Stavert and an instructor Mr. Hill. 16 The appellant’s group completed a number of activities in the morning of 9 November, including a water slide. They were then taken to “Challenge Valley”, which was an obstacle course in the bush.17 The accident in which the appellant was injured occurred at an obstacle called Mt. Kosciusko, a structure having a platform about 3.8 metres above the ground which could be reached by either of two ramp-like structures. The ramp on the left consisted of horizontal logs forming a rough stairway, which could be climbed with the assistance of a knotted heavy-duty rope which hung from the platform or somewhere above the platform. The ramp on the right consisted of what has been called a timber plank, which also could be climbed with the assistance of a knotted heavy-duty rope hanging from the platform or somewhere above the platform. From the diagram which was in evidence, it would seem that each of these ramps was about 2.4 metres wide, and angled at about 60 degrees or a little more from the horizontal. 18 Before reaching Mt. Kosciusko, the appellant’s group had gone through obstacles involving contact with muddy water, so that their clothes and shoes had become wet. At the time the appellant’s group attempted to climb this obstacle, Mr. Hill was positioned on the platform and Ms. Stavert was positioned near the ramp consisting of horizontal logs. 19 The girls in the appellant’s group were given the option of climbing either ramp. A number of girls chose to climb the ramp consisting of horizontal logs, that is the ramp on the left. The appellant went to the ramp on the right, and was the fourth or fifth girl to attempt to climb that ramp. One of the girls preceding the appellant climbed it successfully, while the other two or three failed and dropped back to the ground without injuring themselves. 20 The appellant then attempted to climb this ramp, and got about half way up the ramp, and then fell back to the ground. There was some question whether the fall was caused by slipping or loss of balance or both; but it is clear that the appellant must also have lost her grip on the rope. The fall caused her to break her left leg, about three inches above the ankle. 21 Mr. Hill filled out an accident report on the day of the accident, which stated the time of the accident as being 5.15pm. The report gave the following account of what happened: 
     
      
       
        
        Whilst climbing activity Mt. Kosiosko (sic) Daniella slipped and lost balance and started to swing the girls spotting her could not catch her at (sic) this stage she dropped and that is when the break occurred on the right leg 3 inches above ankle. 
        
       
      
    22 The appellant was taken to Campbelltown Hospital. A nail was inserted by Dr. Dave in her leg. She underwent further surgery on 13 November, and there was a delayed closure on 14 and 16 November. The appellant is now left with noticeable scars on her leg, and she has some ongoing problems with her leg. ISSUES AT TRIAL23 The Statement of Claim included the following particulars of negligence: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) Instructing the Plaintiff to attempt to negotiate an obstacle course that was dangerous.  
         
        (b) Instructing the Plaintiff to attempt to climb up a wooden plank that was slippery and dangerous due to the presence of mud and water on the planks.  
         
        (c) Failing to warn the Plaintiff that attempting to climb the plank was dangerous. 
         
        (d) Failing to properly instruct and supervise the Plaintiff in relation to the camp activities including negotiating the obstacle course and attempting to climb the wooden plank.  
        
       
      
    24 The Defence alleged contributory negligence, but that is no longer an issue. 25 Factual issues contested at the trial included the following:(1) Were the relevant activities compulsory or did the appellant believe they were?(2) What, if any, instructions or warnings were given?(3) Were there “spotters” or “catchers” in position to assist the appellant if she fell?(4) Was the plank slippery?(5) Did the appellant slip or lose her balance?(6) What was the prior history of incidents at Mt. Kosciusko?26 Evidence was given by the appellant and five other students. For the respondent, evidence was given by Ms. Stavert and another teacher Ms. Leigh. By the time of the hearing, Mr. Hill was living in Canada, and a statement of his made on 14 January 2005 was admitted into evidence. DECISION OF PRIMARY JUDGE27 The primary judge made the following factual findings, among others:(1) The girls were encouraged to try each obstacle, but they could and did decline some tasks.(2) Mr. Hill described the task of each obstacle, and demonstrated climbing the right side of Mr. Kosciusko. (3) The plank climbed by the appellant was dry (but had some residual dried mud from previous use). (4) The appellant lost her balance and fell. (5) Mt. Kosciusko had previously been used for a large number of secondary school pupils without incident.He did not make a finding whether or not there was a spotter in place at the foot of the ramp climbed by the appellant. He said that if the safety of the system depended on an inexperienced person acting as a spotter, the system would be defective; and that the case did not hinge on the presence or absence of spotters, because the appellant did not make any allegation of negligence on this ground.28 The primary judge found that the allegation of “failure to properly instruct and supervise” was not sustained. He found the plank was not slippery and dangerous; and that climbing the plank was challenging, but not inherently dangerous. He found there was no evidence as to what remedial action could or should have been taken, apart from stopping participation in the activity altogether. No form of warning was suggested other than a warning that the activity was dangerous, and the primary judge found that such a warning was not warranted.29 The primary judge considered s.5B of the Civil Liability Act 2002. He found that the risk of the activity was small, and that having regard to the benefit of adventure activity to secondary pupils, there were no further precautions that a reasonable person should have taken. 30 He assessed damages, against the possibility of a successful appeal, as follows: non-economic loss at 25% of the most extreme case, $26,000; past out-of-pockets $3,769.10; future out-of-pockets $10,750; future economic loss $20,000; giving a total of $60,519.10.GROUNDS OF APPEAL31 The appellant appeals on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The judgment was against the evidence and the weight of the evidence.  
         
        2. Insufficient reasons were given for the entering of a verdict for the respondent.  
         
        3. Having found that the activities the appellant performed prior to attempting Mount Kosciusko were intended to leave participants with wet clothing and shoes the trial judge erred in failing to find that it was reasonable for the respondent to make no allowance for that before directing the appellant to attempt the obstacle.  
         
        4. The trial judge erred in failing to hold that as the appellant had been instructed that activities in Challenge Valley were compulsory she therefore believed she was required to attempt the obstacle known as Mount Kosciusko.  
         
        5. The trial judge erred in failing to find that the appellant had slipped because of a combination of mud and water on her shoes and the surface of the obstacle.  
         
        6. Having found that of the 4 or 5 girls who attempted the climb before the appellant only 1 had succeeded whilst the others fell the trial judge erred in finding that the obstacle had been used without prior incident.  
         
        7. The trial judge erred in accepting the evidence of Mr Hill which was contrary to the evidence of the appellant and the other students called without giving any or any adequate reasons and without making any findings of credit.  
         
        8. The trial judge erred in giving undue weight to the affidavit of Mr Hill when he was not available for cross examination. 
         
        9. The trial judge erred in finding that the activity was adequately supervised when there was no evidence the students had been warned of risk, advised to dry their shoes, instructed what to do if they started to fall, or given any further instructions after previous falls in circumstances where there was no protection available if a student fell.  
         
        10. The trial judge erred in finding there was an onus on the appellant to formulate an appropriate warning.  
         
        11. The trial judge's finding of non economic loss was manifestly inadequate.  
         
        12. The trial judge's allowance of future economic loss was manifestly inadequate.  
        
       
      
    SUBMISSIONS ON LIABILITY APPEAL32 Ms. Norton SC for the appellant submitted that there was error by the primary judge in not finding that the appellant slipped on the plank, and in not finding that the plank itself was slippery, at least for girls with wet shoes. Ms. Norton submitted that, in the circumstances of that day, when three out of four (or perhaps two out of three) girls had slipped back, this indicated that there were problems, either because of the prevailing conditions or because the girls were not climbing the obstacle correctly. Although these girls fell from a low height and did not injure themselves, the fact that they fell showed that there was a possibility of a fall from a greater height with a substantial risk of injury. Accordingly, the respondent or its agents should either have stopped the use of the smooth ramp, or at least made sure there were precautions in place to minimise the risk of injury in the event of a fall from higher up, for example, by adequate use of spotters or catchers. 33 Ms. Norton submitted that the absence of spotters was relied on by the appellant below, and was within the particulars of negligence; and the need for spotters was supported by Mr. Hill’s statement. Accordingly, the primary judge was in error in simply dismissing the issue of spotters as irrelevant. 34 Ms. Norton submitted that all the girls gave evidence that they were not given instructions on being spotters or catchers. This evidence should have been accepted over the unsworn statement by Mr. Hill that he “instructed each student how to be a spotter”, with no indication in the statement of what he actually said to each student. At the very least, Ms. Stavert, who was next to the easy ramp consisting of logs, should have been positioned below the more difficult smooth ramp.35 Mr. Harrison SC, for the respondent, submitted that the object of the camp, and of this obstacle in particular, was that the girls be given a challenge. This obstacle was difficult, but that did not mean that it was dangerous or an unreasonable risk. There was no evidence that anything untoward had previously happened on this obstacle, the statement of Mr. Hill that thousands had negotiated the obstacle without incident was the only evidence on the matter, and the primary judge was correct to accept it. It was reasonable to accept that the prior use had been in all conditions, and there was no evidence suggesting it was dangerous to undertake the obstacle after rain or with wet shoes. 36 Mr. Harrison submitted that the fact that two or three girls slipped and fell on their feet did not suggest a real problem requiring the activity to be stopped. It was quite normal that some challenging obstacles would not be completed, as had been the case with the monkey bars on the same day. The positioning of a spotter or catcher would not have made any difference. The positioning of another 14-year-old girl at the bottom of the ramp would not be a sufficient precaution if there were a substantial risk of injury by a fall from high up on the ramp, and would not have ameliorated this accident. The primary judge was correct to treat the issue of spotters as irrelevant. 37 Accordingly, Mr. Harrison submitted, the primary judge was correct in not being satisfied that there was an unreasonable risk, or that the activity should have been stopped, or that there was some precaution that should have been taken that was not taken. DECISION ON LIABILITY APPEAL38 It was an important part of the appellant’s case that her shoes were wet, and that the plank was slippery, at least for someone with wet shoes. The finding of the primary judge to the effect that the appellant lost balance and did not slip was in my opinion an error, and one which had the potential to affect the result in the case. 39 The primary judge apparently overlooked that, in his statement made on the day of the accident, Mr. Hill wrote that the appellant “slipped and lost balance”. In circumstances where the evidence was that two or three girls in front of the appellant slipped, where the appellant’s own evidence was that she slipped, and (as the primary judge found) their shoes were wet, a finding that the appellant lost balance rather than slipped, on the basis of Mr. Hill’s later statement that the appellant lost balance, was an error. This error is disclosed particularly in the primary judge’s assertion, as supporting a finding that the appellant did not slip, that Mr. Hill’s two statements were consistent: their consistency in relation to losing balance did not count against a finding that the appellant slipped, in circumstances where the statement made on the day of the accident asserted that the appellant slipped. 40 The question then is, does this materially affect the primary judge’s decision, and if so, should this Court make a contrary finding; or are there other reasons for setting aside the primary judge’s decision? 41 Other findings of the primary judge which in my opinion are not affected by error are to the effect that the appellant had a choice (she plainly had a choice at least as to whether to attempt to climb the obstacle by the log ramp or the smooth ramp), and the finding that the obstacle had been used in the past by a very large number of secondary school pupils without incident. However, it is also the case that the appellant was a 14-year-old girl who was encouraged to tackle challenging obstacles; and the evidence did not establish the circumstances of prior uses of the obstacles. On the latter matter, however, there is force in Mr. Harrison’s submission that it is reasonable to assume that the usage in the past had been in all conditions, including wet conditions.42 As to the presence of spotters, there is force in the view taken by the primary judge that, if the system were unsafe without them, it would not be made safe by them; and also in the submission of Mr. Harrison that the presence of spotters would not have ameliorated this accident. 43 However, there is also force in Ms. Norton’s submission that Mr. Hill’s statement suggested that the use of spotters was one part of the safety precautions considered appropriate for this obstacle; and also in her submission that the prior slipping of two or three girls indicated there was some problem on this day. Those girls apparently did not fall far; but if another girl reached a height of two or three metres above the ground and then slipped and fell, there would plainly then be some risk of injury. The respondent led little evidence as to how the risk of injury from a fall from the upper part of the ramp was addressed. Mr. Hill’s statement said that he gave instructions “on how to safely negotiate the obstacle”; but he did not indicate what it was he said, in particular about what a girl was to do if she slipped and lost her footing on the upper part of the ramp. For example, he did not say that his instructions dealt with the question whether or not in those circumstances the girl should make sure that she held on to the rope and let herself down by the rope. His statement also said that he instructed each student how to be a spotter; but again, his statement did not indicate what it was he said, in particular about what the spotter was to do if another girl was falling from a height of two or three metres or more. 44 Another obstacle mentioned in the evidence was the obstacle called “monkey bars”; and the evidence was that many girls dropped from them into muddy water. It seems reasonable to assume that they did not drop more than (say) about one metre, and if so, that would suggest there was no risk of any significant injury from those circumstances; but in the case of Mt. Kosciusko, there was a possibility, which could not be ignored, of a fall from a height of up to 3.8 metres, particularly in circumstances where the girls had wet shoes and two or three had already slipped from lower heights. The incident-free history of the obstacle could be taken to indicate that there was no need for particular precaution; but as mentioned above, the evidence did not establish the circumstances of previous use, and did not establish what safety instructions were given to the girls either as climbers or spotters. 45 In all these circumstances, I find the questions whether the primary judge’s error was material, and if so whether this Court should be satisfied that reasonable care was not exercised, extremely difficult. However, I have come to the view that the following is the correct analysis. 46 The appellant and the other girls with her attempting to climb the plank had wet shoes. Two or three girls in front of the appellant slipped on the plank, indicating that there was a significant risk that the appellant would slip. If she slipped high up the plank, there was a significant risk of injury. All of the girls said they were not, or did not recall being, instructed on how to climb safely or how to act as spotters. The respondent was in a position to lead evidence as to what precautions were in place and/or what instructions were given for safe climbing and/or acting as spotters, so as to reduce the risk of the injury from a fall from high up the plank, but did not lead such evidence. The appellant did in fact slip and fall from a height of nearly two metres. She did not hold on to the rope and did nothing else to minimise the impact from such a fall, and was not assisted by any spotters. 47 In those circumstances, I would hold that the primary judge’s error in relation to whether the appellant slipped was sufficiently material to vitiate his decision, so that this Court is required to form its own view. 48 I would infer that the appellant did not know what to do if she slipped high on the ramp, because she was not told what to do in those circumstances; and I would also infer there was no properly instructed spotter in place. (This is both because of the evidence of the girls, and because of the lack of evidence from Mr. Hill as to what he said in relation to giving instructions to climbers and spotters.) The risk of injury from a fall from high up the ramp was materially increased because the appellant was not told what to do and because there was no properly instructed spotter in place. The reasonable response to the foreseeable risk of injury from a fall from high up the plank was to give instructions as to what to do in the case of slipping high on the plank and to have a properly instructed spotter in place, and this was not done. The appellant’s injury was a realisation of the resulting increased risk. In those circumstances, the respondent failed to properly instruct and supervise the appellant in relation to the climbing of the plank, so that particular (d) of negligence was made out; and the appellant’s injury was caused thereby. 49 I would add that, if I were wrong to conclude that the risk could have been reasonably dealt with by proper instructions to climbers and spotters, then I would agree with Giles JA that the reasonable response to the risk would have been to restrict climbing to the log ramp.50 For those reasons, I would allow the appeal and give judgment in favour of the appellant.APPEAL ON DAMAGES51 The appellant suffered a fracture to her left leg. She developed compartment syndrome, and this required procedures which left her with significant scarring on both sides of her left calf.52 The primary judge made the following findings, which were not challenged on appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        The Plaintiff fractured the tibia and fibula of her left leg. Her treatment for the injury and subsequent complications is set out succinctly by Dr. Max 
          
        Ellis, a specialist surgeon in his report dated 24th September 2001:  
         
          
          ""She was injured while on a school camping expedition on the 9.11.2000. She was climbing a plank and fell and broke her left tibia and fibula. The soft tissues were intact, the skin was not broken. She was taken by ambulance to Campbelltown Hospital and admitted for 11 days. Operative reduction of the fracture by intramedullary nailing was performed on the 11.11.2000. Postoperatively the foot became extremely swollen in the back slab and was cold and dorsiflexion of the ankle produced extreme pain. On the 12.11.2000 medial and lateral fasciotomies were performed. The wounds were partially closed on the 14.11.2000 and again on the 16.11.2000 
          "".  
          
         
         
        A more detailed account of her treatment is set out in the report of her treating surgeon Dr Chandra Dave dated 12th September 2001. None of this is contentious and there is no need for me to repeat it here.  
         
         
        Dr Max Ellis was called to give some brief evidence on the part of the Plaintiff. The Defendant's Counsel objected to Dr Ellis giving further evidence in chief outside the four corners of his reports. In the face of these objections I allowed Dr Ellis to give the evidence which mainly concerned:  
         
        (i) The Plaintiffs knee disability particularly the state of the patella and underlying cartilage;  
         
        (ii) The fibrosis in the leg muscle consequent upon the compartment syndrome; 
         
        (iii) The effect of both upon the Plaintiffs ability to run and her athletic ability.  
         
         
        Dr Ellis had taken a somewhat less sanguine view than Dr Bliss of the Plaintiffs disabilities in his earlier reports. His explanation of the muscle fibrosis which is not referred to by Dr Bliss was persuasive and I prefer his opinion on this aspect of the matter. He was also more forthright than Dr Bliss in rejecting the prospect of revision of scarring of the leg and again I prefer his opinion. He considered that the 15% loss of the efficient use of the left lower limb was permanent - again taking a more serious view than Dr Bliss who referred to some ""minor disabilities"" and ""not … much in the way of disability"". He thought there would be some disadvantage suffered by the Plaintiff in satisfying the entry test to the Police Force again differing from Dr Bliss who thought her ability to work as a Police Officer unaffected. In his report Dr Ellis had described this ambition as ""not significantly jeopardised"". In all of these matters I prefer the opinions of Dr Ellis. His opinions do not fall outside the range of opinions already expressed and insofar as this was the case I reject the objections that were made to his evidence. I found the clarification of these issues by Dr Ellis quite useful.  
        
       
      
    53 He then went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        There is no loss of expectation of life in the present case. However, the Plaintiff might expect to experience pain in her leg and knee on exertion or if required to stand for long periods. Her ability to engage in strenuous sport will be lessened. The significant scarring to the inner and outer sides of her lower leg will be permanent. She is not altogether indifferent to the appearance of her leg and expresses a preference for the wearing of jeans to conceal the scars.  
         
         
        Very significantly these injuries occurred early in her life at age fourteen. She had a troubled convalescence with the development of compartment syndrome and the insertion of the intramedullary Nail. I assess the percentage of the most extreme case at 25%. 
        
       
      
    54 On future economic loss, the primary judge said this: 
     
      
       
        
        The difficulty here is that at the time of injury the Plaintiff was a school student. She currently works in the food outlet but I am not provided with evidence of her earnings. She says that from time to time she needs to be seated during her work. She hopes to become a Police Officer but may be somewhat disadvantaged - on entry though on the evidence ""not significantly"" - in that occupation. Reference is made in the evidence to her unsuitability for strenuous activity.  
         
         
        I am not provided with evidence as to the potential earnings of the Plaintiff as a Police Officer. I would expect that in her current occupation in a food outlet she would be earning at the rate of the lower paid persons in the community and that were she to miss out on appointment to the Police Force she would incur a significant financial detriment over her earning years.  
         
         
        However in the absence of more detailed evidence as to earnings and as to the likelihood of her failing the entry test it is only available to me to adopt a nominal figure to reflect some compensation for the interference with her ability to earn income in the future:  
        
       
      
    55 Mr. Norton submitted that it was an error to refer to a percentage of “the” most extreme case, and submitted that the appropriate range was 30%-33% of a most extreme case. She submitted that the allowance of $20,000.00 of future economic loss for a person just embarking on her working life was inadequate. The appellant’s evidence was that her leg was already giving her difficulty at work, and her condition was such that it could prevent her engaging in her chosen career in the Police Force, or at least hamper her significantly in that career. 56 Mr. Harrison submitted that the awards were well within the range open to the primary judge. 57 Non-economic loss is a matter of impression. The appellant’s scarring is significant and justified substantial compensation. However, in my opinion an award of 25% of a most extreme case is a reasonable one in the circumstances. But for the scarring, I think a substantially lower award would have been appropriate.58 The matter of future economic loss is also a matter of impression in the circumstances of this case. However, I think the award of $20,000.00 is manifestly inadequate, for a person just embarking on her working life with an injury that has the potential to have more than a trivial effect on that working life. I would allow $40,000.00 as a buffer.ORDERS59 For those reasons, I propose the following orders.1. Appeal allowed.2. Judgment below set aside.3. In lieu thereof, judgment for the appellant in the sum of $80,519.10, to take effect as from 1 June 2005. 4. Respondent to pay appellant’s costs of the proceedings. 5. Respondent to pay appellant’s costs of the appeal, and to have a Suitors’ Fund certificate if otherwise eligible.60 IPP JA: I agree with Hodgson JA.

    1 SANTOW JA:  
     
      
      INTRODUCTION 
       
      A danger or risk may be relatively commonplace. But is it also an obvious risk? And what follows if it is, for the inadvertent plaintiff? Consider one who claims in negligence but was actually unaware of an obvious risk, does it matter that he or she  
      ought 
       to have been aware of the risk, in the sense that a reasonable person would have been? In what way, if at all, has the meaning of “ 
      obvious risk 
      ” and its consequences at general law been altered by the  
      Civil Liability Act 
       2000 (NSW) (“the Act”)? These are significant questions posed by the present appeal.  
       
      
    2 The appellant hotel-occupier challenges the determination of Graham DCJ that it was liable to the plaintiff entrant. She slipped on concealed unbuffed polish on the hotel’s wooden floor, left by the cleaner still cleaning nearby, who was also held liable. Essentially the appellant’s submissions come to this. The risk which led to the first respondent’s injury on the premises was entirely commonplace. It was a risk so obvious that she ought to have anticipated it, even if she did not. The trial judge, Graham DCJ, so held when attributing contributory negligence at 20%. That she did not see concealed unbuffed liquid polish on a wooden floor upon which she slipped was, it is said, nothing to the point. She ought to have been aware of a cleaner carrying out floor-polishing in the vicinity of her fall and appreciated its attendant hazard. Taking reasonable care for her own safety she should have avoided the recently polished area, appreciating the risk of slipping if she did not. The trial judge appears to have concluded that she was not actually aware of the polishing and cleaning going on and hence the danger of slipping on spilt polish. That was why he determined she had been contributorily negligent. The appellant’s case is that he should have gone further and concluded that the plaintiff failed altogether, in failing to take reasonable care for her own safety.  
     
      
    3 The appellant calls in aid the Act. It contends that there was, in terms of the definition in s5F of the Act, an “obvious risk” to the plaintiff which led to her injury. That is, “a risk that, in the circumstances, would have been obvious to a reasonable person in the position of that person” (s5F(1) definition). It submits the risk was in any event “patent” or “a matter of common knowledge” so as to be included within the statutory definition (s5F(2)), the risk so known being that cleaners can leave unbuffed polish. Moreover, the Act provides that a risk can be obvious “even though the risk (or a condition or circumstance that gives rise to the risk) is not prominent, conspicuous or physically observable”, (s5F(4) being here the concealed liquid polish rendering the floor slippery). And a risk can be obvious even though “it has a low probability of occurring” (s5F(3)). Here it had a not insignificant probability of the risk materialising, because the floor was rendered slippery by unbuffed polish.  
     
      
    4 The trial judge did not deal with the effect of the Act. The appellant hotel-occupier, whom he held predominantly liable (80%), seeks to rely, inter alia, on the effect of the Act to challenge that determination. The cleaner, held to a lesser liability of 20%, joins with the hotel-occupier in resisting liability altogether. It also resists the hotel-occupier’s attempt to re-apportion liability so the cleaner would bear a greater proportion.  
     
      
    5 The first respondent’s position is straightforward. The trial judge made no error in his careful and comprehensive review of the evidence and in his findings. The Act’s limited application would have made no difference to the result, the trial judge’s findings being unassailable.  
     
      
    6 The immediate cause of the injury is not in dispute. Diana Hutton-Potts, plaintiff and now first respondent, slipped while walking on a recently polished hotel floor, on which some unbuffed liquid polish lay hidden. A cleaning operation was still going on in the vicinity of the spot where she fell. The cleaner was near enough to be observed. But Ms Hutton-Potts did not remember seeing a man polishing the floor before her fall saying she would have been careful if she had. That aspect is disputed.  
     
      
    7 There was a warning sign which Ms Hutton-Potts did not see, likely to have been obscured by the cleaner standing alongside. The specific danger of the actual unbuffed liquid polish was hidden in the sense that the unbuffed polish was not readily visible. The hotel-occupier, in control of the premises could readily have denied access to the area where the cleaning was going on and failed to do so. He did provide the (obscured) warning sign.  
     
      
    8 The factor of control on the hotel-occupier’s part weighed heavily at trial. This was because the hotel-occupier (the appellant C G Maloney Pty Ltd “Maloney” trading as Bondi Hotel) was in full control of the premises where the accident occurred. The trial judge held the hotel-occupier to be predominantly liable, apportioning liability at 80%. He also found carelessness on the part of the cleaner (the second respondent, Kidgloves Australia Pty Ltd, “Kidgloves”), in not removing the unbuffed polish. Accordingly Kidgloves was also held to be in breach of a duty of care owed to Mrs Hutton-Potts, with its liability assessed at 20% as between it and the hotel-occupier. That apportionment is also challenged by the appellant on appeal, despite well-established constraints on appellate interference with such apportionment of liability.  
     
      
    9 The plaintiff’s damages at trial were reduced by 20% for her contributory negligence, a finding not challenged on appeal. Rather the appellant contends that on the true facts of the case and by application of the principles in Phillis v Daly (1988) 15 NSWLR 65, it should not as occupier of the hotel been held liable at all.  
     
      
    10 As between appellant hotel-occupier and cleaner, the appellant contends:  
     
      
      (a) that the trial judge should have found that the cleaner was in breach of an implied term in the cleaning services contract, that it would perform its obligations with reasonable care and skill, thereby entitling the appellant to indemnity or damages for breach in an amount equivalent to its liability to the plaintiff, and  
      (b) on the facts found by the trial judge, the contribution ordered to be paid by the cleaner to the appellant was insufficient and outside the range of a sound discretionary judgment.  
      
    11 Aside from the challenge to liability and contribution, both appellant and cleaner contend that the damages awarded to the plaintiff for non-economic loss and cost of future medical treatment were excessive. It was contended that insufficient weight was given to the nature and severity of a pre-existing condition affecting the plaintiff’s knee, which should have reduced damage, in particular for non-economic loss, by 50%. Finally, it was contended that the link between any need for ongoing physiotherapy and hydrotherapy and the negligence of the appellant was so attenuated and unjustified by any evidence that no amount should be allowed at least for the hydrotherapy or a substantial reduction made.  
     
      
    12 Finally, there is a challenge to the exercise of discretion by the trial judge in relation to the costs order. Though the appellant and the cleaner were required to pay the plaintiff’s costs of the proceedings on a solicitor-client basis, the appellant was then ordered to pay the whole of the cleaner’s solicitor-client costs of the proceedings. They included the costs of the plaintiff ordered against the cleaner.  
     
      
    13 It was contended that the trial judge’s discretion miscarried in that he made an error of principle, took into account an irrelevant matter and made an order so unreasonable that the Court would infer it was made in error. Weighing heavily in the exercise of that discretion was that, following an arbitration on 27 May 2004 some three weeks before the trial commenced, the appellant made a formal “offer of contribution” whereby it offered to contribute 25% towards any damages recovered by the plaintiff plus costs. That offer was not accepted, in circumstances where the amount awarded to the plaintiff was more than $100,000 above the sum awarded by the arbitrator and where the arbitrator had found each of the defendant’s 50% liable. The trial judge placed particular emphasis on Pt 39A r26 of the District Court Rules which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Pt 39A r26] Offer to contribute 
         
        26 The Court may take an offer to contribute (or offer of contribution) into account in determining whether it should order that the offeree should pay the whole or part of:  
         
          
         (a) the costs of the offeror, or  
         (b) any costs which the offeror is liable to pay to the plaintiff.”  
         
        
       
       
      SALIENT FACTS  
      
    14 What follows is essentially uncontroversial, save where otherwise indicated.  
     
      
    15 The first respondent, Ms Hutton-Potts, sued the appellant, Maloney, and the second respondent, Kidgloves, for injury sustained when she slipped and struck her right knee at the Bondi Hotel.  
     
      
    16 She sued the appellant as occupier of the premises and the cleaner as contractor providing cleaning services at the premises. The second respondent was a “family” company with only one employee, Mr Elder.  
     
      
    17 On 5 December 2000 sometime between about 7.40am and 9.30am, the first respondent was walking through the bar area of the Bondi Hotel on the timber floor, near the entrance to the poker machine room, when she slipped and fell. She alleged that she slipped due to a polishing substance left on the timber floor by the cleaner Kidgloves and not readily visible as a liquid film. She claimed that her fall was caused by the negligence of the appellant as occupier in control of the premises and/or the second respondent as cleaner who had left that oily film there.  
     
      
    18 No formal plan of the hotel was provided. The layout of the hotel can be gleaned from the photographs (Blue, 7-8, 117-119) and the sketch plan drawn by Mr Fing, an employee of the appellant for many years in the Gaming Room of the hotel (Blue, 127). Mr Fing’s evidence was that the only available entry for patrons at that time of the morning was through the entry on Campbell Parade leading to the reception area, which is north of the main entry on Campbell Parade. The judge gave a detailed description of the premises (Red, 27U-30V).  
     
      
    19 The incident was alleged to have created a specific injury of its own and also to have rendered symptomatic what was a significant degenerative arthritic condition in her right knee that had been hitherto asymptomatic. She had also developed consequential injuries to her back and neck attributable to the posture which she has adopted as a result of the knee injury.  
     
      
       
      First Instance Judgment  
      
    20 The first instance judgment contains a careful review of the evidence and comprehensive findings, which I have summarised below. Only in the very limited areas where factual matters or findings are still in dispute do I need to deal with them in more detail, doing so under “Disposition” below.  
     
      
       
      Findings of Credit 
      
    21 There were two matters going to the first respondent’s reliability as a witness:  
     
      
      (a) Since about 1998, the first respondent has had a number of breakdowns or psychotic episodes. She had been treated for schizophrenic illness since about 1992. Shortly after the incident at the hotel she was admitted to hospital on a couple of occasions with further psychiatric problems. She has taken medication for her psychiatric condition (Red, 26H-P).  
      (b) The first respondent essentially felt that she was all right on the day she injured her knee and expected that it would recover in due course. It was only at a later time, when the symptoms became more serious, ultimately requiring a series of treatments by a specialist, that she realised the importance of the incident (Red, 26P-X).  
      
    22 In light of those two circumstances, the first respondent was not the easiest witness to examine or to evaluate as a witness (Red, 26X-27C).  
     
      
    23 The first respondent was apparently doing her best to tell the truth (Red, 40C).  
     
      
    24 Mr Elder, the principal of the second respondent, impressed the trial judge as an honest witness and one who was generally accurate and otherwise a reliable witness (Red, 39L).  
     
      
    25 The trial judge concluded that there was no real inconsistency between the two accounts and, to the extent that there might be, he concluded that the first respondent’s account was the more reliable account (Red, 39V-40C).  
     
      
       
      Findings of Fact 
      
    26 The first respondent gave in evidence in chief and maintained in cross-examination the following account of events occurring on the morning of the incident.  
     
      
    27 She arrived at the hotel, parked in the car park behind the hotel, and walked around the hotel (Red, 30W).  
     
      
    28 She was unable to recall whether she came through the main entrance or through the reception entrance but it was one or other of those and she inclined to believe that it was the reception entrance that she used (Red, 31C-F).  
     
      
    29 She said that she was not aware that there was an entry at the rear of the hotel leading to the car park until she was ushered out that way after her fall (Red, 31F-L).  
     
      
    30 Having arrived through one of the entrances on Campbell Parade, she checked the Gaming Room to ascertain whether there were many people there. (The Gaming Room operates 24 hours a day. The Starfish Bar was closed in the sense that no-one was serving drinks, but it was not physically closed off) (Red, 31L-V).  
     
      
    31 Having checked out the Gaming Room and discovered that it was very quiet, she decided to go to the toilet. She initially intended to go to the toilets in the Starfish Bar but recalled that they were sometimes dirty. She said she decided to make her way to other toilets that she believed were somewhere downstairs from the reception area (Red, 33N-V).  
     
      
    32 She left the Gaming Room, took a few steps towards the toilets on the other side of the Starfish Bar (Red, 37J), then turned to head towards the other toilets. As she turned she slipped and fell onto her hands and knees, striking her right knee against the door of the Gaming Room, or the corner of the doorway of the Gaming Room. She said she felt, on her hand and on her clothing, a sticky or oily substance (Red, 33Y-34H). (The trial judge considered that description of the substance to be generally consistent with the likely feeling of the residue of a mixture which Mr Elder, the principal of the second respondent, used on that floor as part of his duties) (Red, 34H-J).  
     
      
    33 The first respondent stayed in the hotel for some time. She was not greatly concerned about her knee because she thought the accident was a transient incident. Given that she had never previously experienced symptoms of arthritis and was an active woman, able to engage in skiing, running etc, the incident might well have been regarded by the first respondent as not a matter of any great moment (Red, 34K, R-W, 35H-K).  
     
      
    34 Mr Fing, who had been an employee of the appellant in the Gaming Room for many years, did not see the incident but became aware of it afterwards and made a diary note. His evidence confirms that the first respondent told him that she had fallen, but now seemed “okay”.  
     
      
    35 The only eyewitness other than the first respondent was Mr Elder, the principal of the second respondent. He was working in the bar, spraying the polishing mixture on the floor and then buffing and polishing it with his polishing machine. He was in the position marked with an “X” on the sketch plan. He gave evidence that:  
     
      
      (a) He saw the first respondent more or less adjacent to the door from the gaming area, three or four steps away from the entrance to the Gaming Room, at the place marked “P” in the sketch.  
      (b) The area where he first saw her had already been sprayed and buffed.  
      (c) A sign indicating “wet floor” was placed at the place marked S on the sketch, east of where he first saw the first respondent (Red, 38D-X).  
      (d) The trial judge accepted that these positions were correctly marked (Red, 40S-V).  
      (e) Mr Elder said that the first respondent was “sneaking” or “scurrying” towards the Gaming Room and was looking at him as she proceeded towards the entrance to the Gaming Room. She appeared to stumble or slip at the entrance to the Gaming Room (Red, 39E-K).  
      
    36 The trial judge considered his actual description of what Mr Elder saw to be by no means substantially or significantly inconsistent with the account given by the first respondent. He preferred her account to the extent there was any inconsistency. He observed that what was consistent with the general description given by the first respondent was her decision to change direction and head towards the corridor (Red, 39M-V).  
     
      
    37 The trial judge accordingly accepted that the first respondent had established, on the balance of probabilities, that she had left the Gaming Room by the door into the Starfish Bar and that she did so for the purpose of visiting the toilets before commencing a session of playing the poker machines. The trial judge accepted that she initially intended to head for one set of toilets but changed her mind and turned in order to make her way through the swinging doors heading towards reception. Because of that manoeuvre, she slipped on a substance on the floor and banged her knee against the edge of the doorway (Red, 40H-P). However, he observed that “she ought to have seen there was a man there [Elder] with a polishing machine, apparently going about his duties” (Red, 41F-G).  
     
      
    38 While it might be assumed that the Gaming Room would not be particularly busy during those hours, nonetheless a part of the hotel was functioning.  
     
      
    39 Patrons attending that room might be expected to, and were permitted to, have access to toilets, perhaps most particularly the toilets which could be accessed by crossing the Starfish Bar.  
     
      
    40 No barriers had been erected and no signs had been placed anywhere upon the possible entrances, to preclude patrons from entering that area and no attempt had been made by a sign or otherwise to dissuade patrons from using those toilets (Red, 41H-42E).  
     
      
    41 The trial judge accepted that the first respondent was a regular patron (Red, 32U-X).  
     
      
    42 It might be anticipated that, as a public place with regular patrons, patrons would tend to make their own way to the toilets without seeking permission, let alone the accompaniment of an attendant (Red, 42F-J). Mr Fing gave evidence that patrons were permitted to use the toilets in the Starfish Bar if escorted by an attendant. The trial judge considered this to be a highly unlikely method of permitting patrons to use the toilet (Red, 32E-T).  
     
      
    43 In those circumstances, the appellant and the first respondent must have known of the likelihood of patrons gaining access to that area for the purpose of using the toilets (Red, 42K-N).  
     
      
    44 Furthermore, the evidence disclosed that, between those hours when the Starfish Bar was closed, 4am to 9am, there were a number of persons who were likely to be passing through or gaining access to that area. That includes staff of the hotel and tradespersons and cleaners employed at the hotel (Red, 42N-T).  
     
      
       
      Findings of Law or Mixed Fact and Law 
      
    45 In circumstances where there was that degree of access to a part of the hotel which was not serving liquor, there was clearly a duty of care owed to persons such as the first respondent to take reasonable care for their safety (Red, 43L-O). That finding was not disputed on appeal.  
     
      
       
      Whether there was a duty owed and/or breached by the appellant  
      
    46 The trial judge held that the appellant could not escape liability by relying upon the principle that the second respondent was an independent contractor for whom the appellant was not liable. Mr Elder was described as a fairly tiny cog in the general wheel of the operation of the hotel. His contractual obligations related to treatment of the floor which was but part of the multitude of operations required to maintain the conduct and operation of the hotel (Red, 44M-V).  
     
      
    47 The appellant was in overall control of the premises. It was the appellant who could decide whether to bar entry to the Starfish Bar. This was a matter over which the second respondent had no measure of control. The (cleaning) operations were being conducted for the benefit of the appellant in premises which were substantially under the control of the appellant.  
     
      
    48 In the circumstances, the failure to take steps (such as warning the first respondent, erecting signs that entry was not permitted or perhaps not permitted at all except in the company of hotel employees) amounted to a breach of the duty of care which the appellant owed the first respondent and those who fell within her general category (Red, 44V-45L).  
     
      
    49 The second respondent’s habits and practices in relation to his fortnightly treatment of the floor were so consistent as to have been habits and practices known to the appellant’s relevant servants or agents, such as the duty manager. The hotel management knew or ought to have known when it was that this potentially dangerous operation was being conducted on their behalf and for their benefit. The hotel management ought to have known of the appreciable risk of patrons or other lawful entrants in the hotel coming to grief, if they slipped on the mixture that was used. The mixture itself had been arrived at in consultation with the principal of the second respondent (Red, 45P-46C).  
     
      
    50 The appellant had an obligation:  
     
      
      (a) to warn the first respondent of the danger, to ensure that the floor was clear of slipping hazards;  
      (b) to institute a proper system of cleaning and maintenance and to maintain in place such a system, and  
      (c) to warn the first respondent of the presence, or possible presence, of polish on the floor but failed to do so by way of a sign or signs (Red, 46D-L). The trial judge was satisfied that the appellant was under a duty of care and that it failed to take reasonable care for the safety of the first respondent in the arrangements which it made for the conduct of the treatment of the wooden floor in the Starfish Bar (Red, 46U-X). I observe here that the simplest and most effective means to obviate the risk to patrons from cleaning operations, would have been simply to deny access to the potentially hazardous area, a matter well within the practical control of the hotel-occupier. This could have been by roping off the area or by some other such barrier. The trial judge appears to place greater reliance on a warning sign though it proved ineffective in the events that happened. Moreover, any system of cleaning and maintenance must be subject to human fallibility. However, later in the judgment (Red, 51 I-R) the trial judge does contemplate, in the alternative precluding the presence of the first respondent or ensuring the risk was brought home to her, presumably by more prominent warning signs. Whether duty owed and/or breached by second respondent 
      
    51 The trial judge was also satisfied that the second respondent was also liable in negligence to the first respondent for this fall, for the following reasons.  
     
      
      (a) The second respondent was actually carrying out the work and it was aware of what was actually being done, and of which parts of the floor had been sprayed, which parts had been buffed and polished and how long it would take for the floor to dry out.  
      (b) The second respondent was aware of the risk of slipping on any residue of that spray which remained after the polishing of the area, and  
      (c) The second respondent, through the regular attendance at the hotel by its principal, must also have been aware of the likelihood of the presence of persons within the area of the Starfish Bar room and thus of the risk that there would be persons who could slip or fall on any residue left on the floor (Red, 47C-O).  
      
    52 The second respondent had taken some steps to alleviate the risk as follows:  
     
      
      (a) The method of working included doing one square metre at a time, polishing it, then moving on to spray and buff the next square metre. That was not particularly hazardous, though there remained the residual risk relating to any residue that remained;  
      (b) The presence of Mr Elder with the polishing machine, in the close vicinity of the first respondent, was something which ought to have been able to have been observed by a person taking reasonable care for their own safety;  
      (c) The second respondent had placed one sign in the area but the trial judge was not satisfied that it was visible to the first respondent, accepting her evidence that she did not see a sign, and  
      (d) Mr Elder did not, nor in the circumstances is it likely that he could have, made the place any more secure in the sense that there was no evidence that he had authority to lock any doors or rope areas off etc (Red, 47R-48R).  
      
    53 Nonetheless, given Mr Elder’s knowledge of the likelihood of persons being within that area while he was working, he had an obligation to take reasonable care to ensure that the cleaning process was conducted in relative safety. To leave an oily film on the floor was an act of negligence on the part of the second respondent (Red, 49D-F).  
     
      
       
      Trial Judge’s Overall Conclusion on Liability  
      
    54 The negligence of the appellant and the second respondent was a causal factor in the production of the slipping and falling and injury to the first respondent’s knee (Red, 49G-H).  
     
      
    55 Accordingly, the trial judge was satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the respondent had established negligence on the part of the appellant and second respondent (Red, 49I-K).  
     
      
       
      Contributory negligence 
      
    56 The trial judge observed that the problem with the obvious risk argument was that what caused the first respondent to slip, on the balance of probabilities, was a residue of a mixture of linseed oil and either methylated spirits or turps. It was not readily visible. Mr Elder was aware that it was possible that such a residue could remain after polishing. It was clear that this particular area where the first respondent fell had been treated that morning, and by Mr Elder’s account, within twenty minutes or so at the outside, before her fall. The first respondent herself felt on her hand and clothing a substance consistent with the residue of that mixture (Red, 43O-44G).  
     
      
    57 The appellant and second respondent therefore were performing an operation for the benefit of the hotel which carried with it a risk of injury to a person even taking reasonable care for their own safety, who might step on an area which was still slippery with a residue (Red, 44G-L).  
     
      
    58 However, the trial judge was satisfied that the appellant and second respondent made out the defence of contributory negligence. They made out that the first respondent failed to keep a proper lookout while walking through the bar area, and failed to take reasonable care for her own safety (Red, 49V-50H). In particular, the first respondent, acting reasonably for her own safety, should have seen the presence of Mr Elder and, had she done so, would have realised that he was engaged in some form of polishing operation with the machine, which was large. She conceded that, had she been aware of the sign or of the presence of the cleaner, then she would have taken more care for her own safety (Red, 50G-V).  
     
      
    59 On the other hand, the observations that the first respondent ought to have made would have alerted her generally to the possible existence of some risk on the floor, but would not of itself have alerted her to the precise risk which eventuated when she slipped on the residue (Red, 50V-51H).  
     
      
    60 Thus the apportionment, as between plaintiff and defendants, was one which should fall heavily upon the defendants given that:  
     
      
      (a) they were obviously in overall control of the situation;  
      (b) they were the persons responsible for, or actually carrying out, the operations, and  
      (c) they were the persons who could have taken measures to preclude the presence of the first respondent or ensured that she had brought home to her the risk of such a residue being present (Red, 51I-R).  
      
    61 The trial judge assessed the appropriate proportion of contributory negligence as being 20% which should be deducted from any verdict (Red, 51R-T).  
     
      
       
      Cross-claims 
      
    62 There were cross-claims between the appellant and second respondent. In the trial judge’s view, the two tortfeasors each contributed to the injury sustained by the first respondent in such a way that they have a significant contribution as between themselves (Red, 51U-52L). (The appellant appeals against the contribution ordered to be made by the second respondent.)  
     
      
    63 As to the contribution of the appellant, it was clearly in overall control of the premises and of the operations conducted on the premises.  
     
      
    64 Moreover, it was in the appellant’s interests that there were patrons, workers, tradespeople etc entering those premises at time when the second respondent was carrying out its limited role (Red, 52M-R).  
     
      
    65 As to the contribution of the second respondent, it was the second respondent who was actually executing work as an independent contractor albeit for the benefit of the appellant.  
     
      
    66 Moreover, the second respondent had the direct and primary responsibility of ensuring that the treatment of the floor was carried out in a way which embodied reasonable care and skill. The second respondent failed to reach that standard; whether it be regarded as tortious or contractual matters little (Red, 52S-53C).  
     
      
    67 The overwhelming responsibility should be reflected in an apportionment which would mean that the appellant must bear 80% of the verdict and the second respondent 20% (Red, 53C-F).  
     
      
       
      Damages 
      
    68 At 48 years of age, the first respondent clearly already had degenerative arthritic changes (Red, 53L).  
     
      
    69 The evidence of the first respondent and her treating GP of 14 years establishes that she was symptom-free prior to this injury (Red, 53M-P).  
     
      
    70 She was able to run, jump and was fond of skiing and the beach. She was fairly proud of the appearance of her legs (Red, 53P-Y).  
     
      
    71 She has suffered significant pain and discomfort and restrictions on her mobility (Red, 54C-D).  
     
      
    72 No claim was made for economic loss (Red, 54E).  
     
      
    73 In respect of non-economic loss, the medical evidence is essentially all one way, that is, that the injury to her knee on 5 December 2000 caused a discrete injury of its own in her knee but also triggered or made symptomatic underlying degenerative change. While it might be assumed that, at some point in the future, the first respondent would have suffered some symptoms from those degenerative changes, the evidence did not disclose when that would have been (Red, 54F-L).  
     
      
    74 The first respondent was still quite active at the age of 48 and that activity, including skiing and running, had not produced any symptoms (Red, 54L-O).  
     
      
    75 She has:  
     
      
      (a) experienced arthroscopy for some repair to her right knee,  
      (b) had fluid drained from her knee on a number of occasions, and  
      (c) pain, which is intermittent when she is sedentary, but which is significant and continuous while she is active on her right knee.  
      
    76 Those activities which she enjoyed before she no longer enjoys.  
     
      
    77 The appearance of her right knee and calf has led her to be cautious as to where she bathes. She does not wear skirts that might reveal her knee (Red, 54P-55D).  
     
      
    78 Over four years, the injury has produced a significant change in the first respondent’s life (Red, 55D-F).  
     
      
    79 Her prognosis is not attractive having regard to the fact that:  
     
      
      (a) she has been undergoing physiotherapy and hydrotherapy for some time at the recommendation of medical practitioners and she will into the future continue to need significant measures of physiotherapy and perhaps hydrotherapy (Red, 55F-K),  
      (b) even with that treatment, she has now reached the stage where she will need a partial knee replacement (Red, 55K-M),  
      (c) the medical evidence discloses the likelihood of a need for a total knee replacement, albeit for some time in the future. There may be a requirement for additional replacement operations in the future (Red, 55R).  
      
    80 The trial judge considered the appropriate figure for non-economic loss to be 40% of a most extreme case, which is $160,000. The trial judge took into account:  
     
      
      (a) the age of the first respondent,  
      (b) the number of years she has already had to suffer pain, disabilities and restrictions on her activities,  
      (c) her substantial life expectancy,  
      (d) the probability of a need for further surgery and continuing treatment suggest that this is likely to have a significant impact on the first respondent’s life for the rest of her life, and  
      (e) the measure of relief and increase in mobility resulting from the operations she will have (Red, 56D-57C).  
      
    81 Out of pocket expenses were agreed at $9,689.75 (Red, 57C-H).  
     
      
    82 As far as physiotherapy was concerned, the trial judge considered that there was clearly a benefit to the first respondent and that she clearly intended to keep at it, albeit once a month rather than twice a month (Red, 58T-Y). The trial judge halved the figure claimed for physiotherapy ($25,000 reduced to $12,500) but allowed a further $2,500 for the contingency that there may be a need for more intensive physiotherapy because of the fluctuations in the impact of the knee problems on the first respondent. The trial judge therefore allowed $15,000 for future physiotherapy (Red, 59F-Q).  
     
      
    83 While the first respondent had only recently commenced hydrotherapy, she had clearly given thought to the future and struck a balance in her mind between the two forms of physiotherapy, which would mean a concentration on hydrotherapy (Red, 59R-V). The trial judge found that the probability of a requirement for two sessions of hydrotherapy per week was made out as a matter of probability and the trial judge allowed the entirety of the amount claimed: $45,495 (Red, 59W-60D).  
     
      
    84 The trial judge was satisfied that the claim for future GP visits of $3,939.87 was made out (Red, 60D-K).  
     
      
    85 The partial knee replacement is due to take place immediately. The full value of that operation is appropriately to be allowed in the sum of $16,500 (Red 60L-R).  
     
      
    86 The need for a total knee replacement, deferred for 10 years, is also made out on the evidence and the trial judge allowed the sum of $16,332.40 as claimed (Red, 60S-X).  
     
      
    87 There was a strong case for a general allowance of a physiotherapy and hydrotherapy buffer for the period leading up to an operation and for the period after the immediate aftermath of the operation (costs of therapy in the immediate aftermath being factored into the cost of the operation). Calculation was difficult and perhaps even speculative, but the trial judge considered that the best present estimate of what would be an appropriate buffer was $10,000 (Red, 60X-61X).  
     
      
    88 The total damages amounted to $276,957.02 with 20% deducted for contributory negligence. This resulted in a verdict of $221,566.02 against the appellant and second respondent (Red, 61X-62G).  
     
      
    89 There was a verdict for the second respondent against the appellant in the sum of $177,252.81. There was a verdict for the appellant against the second respondent in the sum of $44,313,20.  
     
      
       
      Costs 
      
    90 I shall deal with these separately at the conclusion of this judgment.  
     
      
       
      DISPOSITION 
      
    91 Because there remains a conflict between appellant and respondents as to what Ms Hutton-Potts must have appreciated of the risk from the cleaning operation, I first turn to the actual evidence that Ms Hutton-Potts and Mr Elder gave about the circumstances of her accident, immediately before her fall.  
     
      
    92 It is not in dispute that she had walked out of the poker machine room with her intended path being to the ladies toilet, her fall taking place on a wooden floor surface in what was called the Starfish Room (T, 4). Before she fell she observes it as “just a wooden floor” but “didn’t notice how slippery it was” (T, 4.50-.53). She observed that as she “went down” “it just looked rather shiny”. As she fell, touching it with her hands, it was “just sort of slippery and on my hands it felt a bit oily …” (T, 5.4-.8). Her evidence was consistent that before she fell she did not notice anything in particular about the floor itself.  
     
      
    93 That being her evidence in chief, and cross-examination, she was pressed about whether she saw the cleaner before the fall. According to his evidence, and as stated in her expert’s report (T, 53.4-.12), Mr Elder was standing nearby and actually polishing the floor, having just applied polish to the timber floor at the time and about to use the polishing machine to buff the polish into the timber floor. Her response when pressed that this was said in her expert’s report was “well I think he might have got it a bit wrong, because I don’t remember, when I’m thinking back to it now I don’t remember seeing a man polishing the floor, if I had I would have been careful, if I saw someone polishing” (T, 53.20-.23). She added that the person concerned could have been simply mopping up water and she reiterated that she did not observe what he was doing (T, 53.29-.35).  
     
      
    94 She readily conceded that had she seen someone polishing and then about to buff the floor, she should have taken care but added that she did not remember seeing anyone and there was nobody there polishing the floor “because he only came up to me after, I remember” (T, 53.45-.48).  
     
      
    95 The trial judge accepted Mr Elder as an honest witness describing him as “generally accurate and otherwise a reliable witness”. While observing that ultimately there was “no real inconsistency between the two accounts” he nonetheless concluded that the plaintiff’s account “is the more reliable account in any event” as “she was apparently doing her best to tell the truth here” (Red, 39W-40D). It appears therefore that the trial judge accepted that Mr Elder was in the vicinity but not that she was actually aware of his presence doing the polishing. Rather, “she ought to have seen there was a man there with a polishing machine, apparently going about his duties” (Red, 41F-H) [emphasis added]. Moreover, when dealing with whether she had been contributorily negligent, he again expressed his conclusions in terms of what she “ought” to have been aware of rather than what she was actually aware of (Red, 50G-51H).  
     
      
    96 Thus he concludes  
     
      
       
        
        “… whilst the observations which the plaintiff  
        ought 
         to have made would have alerted her, generally, to the possible existence of some risk on the floor, it would not have, of itself, alerted her to the precise risk which eventuated when she slipped on the filmy residue of the spray mixture.” (Red, 51E-H). [emphasis added]  
        
       
      
    97 It was open to the trial judge on the evidence so to conclude and there is no basis for appellate interference with that conclusion.  
     
      
    98 Turning to the implications of this evidence and the inferences to be drawn from it the following could be concluded as to the nature of the risk which came home to cause her accident: 
     
      
      (a) Ms Hutton-Potts was not actually aware of the cleaning operation though she ought to have been;  
      (b) the unbuffed polish was a hidden hazard and thus not itself an obvious one, subject to any implications from (c) and (d) below;  
      (c) while it could be said that the danger from an ongoing cleaning operation whereby a wooden floor is polished so as to be left slippery is at the least not unusual, she was not actually aware of that cleaning operation and thus of its attendant hazards; but  
      (d) exercising reasonable care for her own safety she ought at least to have been aware of the cleaning operation.  
      
    99 The appellant in argument criticised the trial judge’s reasons for failing to refer at all to the Act; in particular to its definition of “obvious risk” in s5F and to the substantive provisions of ss5G and 5H which attach these legal consequences to an obvious risk, namely:  
     
      
      (a) that the injured person is presumed to be aware of obvious risks though the presumption is rebuttable (s5G); and  
      (b) there is no proactive duty to warn of an obvious risk (s5H).  
      I quote those provisions below:  
       
        
        “ 
        5F Meaning of “obvious risk”  
         
        (1) For the purposes of this Division, an  
        obvious risk 
         to a person who suffers harm is a risk that, in the circumstances, would have been obvious to a reasonable person in the position of that person.  
         
        (2) Obvious risks include risks that are patent or a matter of common knowledge.  
         
        (3) A risk of something occurring can be an obvious risk even though it has a low probability of occurring.  
         
        (4) A risk can be an obvious risk even if the risk (or a condition or circumstance that gives rise to the risk) is not prominent, conspicuous or physically observable.  
         
        5G Injured persons presumed to be aware of obvious risks  
         
        (1) In determining liability for negligence, a person who suffers harm is presumed to have been aware of the risk of harm if it was an obvious risk, unless the person proves on the balance of probabilities that he or she was not aware of the risk.  
         
        (2) For the purposes of this section, a person is aware of a risk if the person is aware of the type or kind of risk, even if the person is not aware of the precise nature, extent or manner of occurrence of the risk.  
         
        5H No proactive duty to warn of obvious risk  
         
        (1) A person (the defendant) does not owe a duty of care to another person (the plaintiff) to warn of an obvious risk to the plaintiff.  
         
        (2) This section does not apply if:  
         
         (a) the plaintiff has requested advice or information about the risk from the defendant, or 
          
         (b) the defendant is required by a written law to warn the plaintiff of the risk, or  
          
         (c) the defendant is a professional and the risk is a risk of the death of or personal injury to the plaintiff from the provision of a professional service by the defendant.  
         
        (3) Subsection (2) does not give rise to a presumption of a duty to warn of a risk in the circumstances referred to in that subsection.”  
        
       
      
    100 Unaided by any deeming effect of the Act, it could not be said that Ms Hutton-Potts, being actually unaware of the cleaning and polishing operation nearby, and failing to see an invisible film on the floor, had succumbed to an “obvious” risk when she suffered her fall. But even if it were an obvious risk either at general law or by virtue of the partially objective test under the statute, what are the legal consequences?  
     
      
    101 The statutory consequences in ss5G and 5H, where an obvious risk is found, operate in aid of the general law in two respects:  
     
      
      (a) in assisting the common law defence of voluntary assumption of risk, by introducing a rebuttable presumption of awareness of the relevant risk (“volenti”), and 
      (b) in obviating any common law duty of care to warn of an obvious risk to the plaintiff (with limited exceptions not relevant here).  
      
    102 Thus there can be no need to warn of a risk one is presumed to know (s5G) nor any proactive duty to warn of an obvious risk (s5H). But liability for negligence is not coterminous with situations calling for warning. A warning may be insufficient to discharge the duty of care or may even be irrelevant to its discharge, depending on the circumstances.  
     
      
    103 The High Court decision in Brodie v Singleton Shire Council; Ghantous v Hawkesbury City Council (2001) 206 CLR 512 and High Court decisions since demonstrate that finding an obvious risk, while relevant to the scope of the duty of care and whether it has been discharged in any particular case, does not produce a preordained outcome to those questions.  
     
      
    104 In Temora Shire Council v Stein [2004] NSWCA 236, Giles JA (with whom Hodgson JA and Pearlman AJA agreed) reviewed the New South Wales Court of Appeal cases which followed Brodie and concluded at [31] that they “firmly establish that the content or breach of the duty of care of a council (or other entity responsible for a public area) involves regard to the obviousness of the risk to a pedestrian exercising reasonable care for his or her own safety” [emphasis added]. After reviewing the cases, Giles JA said (at [37]-[42]):  
     
      
       
        
        “Obviousness to the careful pedestrian has been spoken of sometimes as going to the duty of care, and sometimes as going to breach of the duty of care. Reference to the content of the duty of care may have brought a slide to the existence of a duty of care. On the one approach, risk of harm is not foreseeable if the defect in the footpath is obvious to the careful pedestrian; on the other approach, there is no breach in failing to remedy the defect if the defect is obvious to the careful pedestrian. The language used in the cases has not been uniform, or always consistent… 
         
         
        In most situations it will not matter, but for a number of reasons it seems to me that the preferable approach is that obviousness of the risk to the careful pedestrian goes to breach of the duty of care… 
         
         
        On my reading, the reasoning in the joint judgment in  
        Brodie v Singleton Shire Council 
         and  
        Ghantous v Hawkesbury City Council 
         made the proposition that persons using the road will themselves take ordinary care one of the matters in the balancing of matters in accordance with  
        Wyong Shire Council v Shirt 
        . On the approach that obviousness of the risk to the careful pedestrian goes to breach of the duty of care, if there is a foreseeable risk then in the balancing of matters the response of the reasonable council takes into account that pedestrians are able to see and avoid imperfections and “will be expected to exercise sufficient care by looking where they are going and perceiving and avoiding obvious hazards … ” [see at [163]]… 
         
         
        In the balancing required in accordance with  
        Wyong Shire Council v Shirt 
         the obviousness of the risk to the careful pedestrian will not be the only consideration, although it is likely to be dominant…  
         
         
        Taking reasonable care can involve what is reasonably expected as well as what is obvious, and what is obvious in hindsight must be considered together with the occasion to perceive it at the time. In this respect, and more generally, the matters for consideration will include whether the defect was “in the nature of a trap”.  
         
         
        In the balancing exercise, the ultimate issue is what reasonable care required. All the circumstances of the risk presented to the careful pedestrian must be considered…”  
        
       
      
    105 More recent High Court authority similarly appears to support the proposition that failure to avoid an obvious risk does not necessarily constitute a failure to exercise reasonable care for one’s own safety, although it has treated obvious risk as a relevant factor, even an important one, in determining whether there be liability. Obviousness of risk also bears on the need for a warning and on contributory negligence. It must be remembered that a warning is by no means the only proper response to a hazard and in some cases may be an inadequate or irrelevant response.  
     
      
    106 Thus the High Court discussed the relationship between obviousness and breach of duty in the recent case of Vairy v Wyong Shire Council (2005) 80 ALJR 1. A majority of judges agreed that the obviousness of a risk of injury is not determinative of breach; Gleeson CJ and Kirby J at [7]-[8], Gummow J at [55], Hayne J at [162]. Gleeson CJ and Kirby J did however consider it to be a relevant factor in the context of deciding what steps ought to have been taken by the local authority to satisfy its duty of care. For example, they said “the obviousness of the danger can be important in deciding whether a warning is required” [8]. McHugh J, however, emphasised that obviousness of risk goes to the issue of contributory negligence and rarely to the discharge of the defendant’s duty: [46]; see also Hayne J at [162]; Thompson v Woolworths (Qld) Pty Ltd (2005) 79 ALJR 904 at [37]. However, in Thompson, McHugh J formed part of a majority which said that the obviousness of a risk was often a factor relevant to what reasonableness requires as a response.  
     
      
    107 On the other hand, Callinan and Heydon JJ in Mulligan v Coffs Harbour City Council (2005) 80 ALJR 43 (heard with Vairy), went further, considering that obviousness could be conclusive in determining breach. In their view, obviousness conditions the response or the necessity for any response to a risk of danger; Mulligan [77] and [78]. That view can be reconciled with the majority if one emphasises the word “could” as I have just done.  
     
      
    108 Thompson v Woolworths (Qld) Pty Ltd (supra) explains in a joint judgment of the Full Court that one reason why an obvious risk may not necessarily exculpate a defendant is that “If the obviousness of a risk, and the reasonableness of an expectation that other people will take care of their own safety, were conclusive against liability in every case, there would be little room for a doctrine of contributory negligence”. The High Court went on though to emphasise the relevance of the obviousness of a risk in these words “On the other hand, if those considerations were irrelevant, community standards of reasonable behaviour would require radical alteration.” (at [37] and see earlier at [35] to [36]).  
     
      
    109 I turn now to the effect of the Act starting first with whether, in terms of the definition of “obvious risk” in the Act in s5F(1), subjective unawareness precludes the risk being obvious. Section 5F(1) is predicated upon what is obvious in the circumstances to “a reasonable person”, that hypothetical person being however “in the position” of the person concerned (Ms Hutton-Potts). The test is thus objective, but taking into account at least the surrounding circumstances and at least personal characteristics such as whether the plaintiff was a child.  
     
      
    110 Ms Hutton-Potts’ evidence is that she simply overlooked the presence of Mr Elder, or if she did see him, did not appreciate that he was polishing the floor as distinct from say, mopping up water. The warning sign was likely to have been obscured by Mr Elder.  
     
      
    111 While even a reasonable person can be momentarily inadvertent in such circumstances, there is no challenge to the finding that Ms Hutton-Potts was contributorily negligent to the extent of 20%.  
     
      
    112 Moreover, the finding of the trial judge is that “the observations which the plaintiff ought to have made, would have alerted her generally to the possible existence of some risk on the floor” [emphasis added]. That is to say, not alert the hypothetical reasonable person in the position of the plaintiff to an obvious or patent risk, but only to a possible one. Indeed had the former been the case, it is difficult to imagine a holding of contributory negligence at so low a level as 20%, certainly without aid of the definition in the Act.  
     
      
    113 I do not consider that the remaining sub-sections of s5F render the statutory definition of “obvious risk” applicable to these circumstances. The spilt polish being left rendering the floor slippery was not a “patent risk” to the unaware so rendering it an obvious risk; the most that could be said was that it was arguably common knowledge that cleaners on occasion do their job carelessly so that spilt polish might be a possibility; s5F(2). Of course if it were well-known to the plaintiff that a particular cleaner was excessively careless and regularly left polish on the floor, that would be a case converting the mere possibility of some risk into a patent risk, arising as a matter of common knowledge. But this was never such a case.  
     
      
    114 Nor do ss(3) and (4) of s5F convert the risk of spilt polish into an “obvious risk” in the statutory sense. Those provisions merely provide, in using the word “can” that the matters there specified do not preclude a risk from being an obvious one under the definition in s5F(1). They do not deem the risk to satisfy that definition. That the slip had “a low probability of occurring” is no part of the trial judge’s reasoning. But even if it had been, nothing follows from that fact save that the risk is not precluded from being obvious by that factor. Likewise nothing here follows from the fact that the risk (concealed surface polish) was “not prominent, conspicuous or physically observable” (s5F(4)).  
     
      
    115 But even were the risk, in the statutory sense obvious, what follows? Section 5G of the Act makes clear that the presumption is rebuttable that a person who suffers harm from an obvious risk is presumed to have been aware of the risk of harm. It is rebutted if the person proves on the balance of probabilities that he or she was not aware of the risk. It is clear enough from the trial judge’s reasoning that he was so satisfied and it was open to him on the evidence so to conclude.  
     
      
    116 In my judgment, s5G(2) leads to no different conclusion. Given Ms Hutton-Potts was held, impliedly at least, to be unaware of the cleaning and polishing operation she would have been unaware not only of the actual risk that came home but of “the type or kind of risk” to which she was exposing herself.  
     
      
    117 Section 5H of the Act exonerates the appellant from a duty to warn, where there is “an obvious risk to the plaintiff”. But here the single warning sign was ineffective; it was not, in terms of Mason CJ’s judgment in Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 at 47-8 a sufficient or appropriate response to this risk or hazard. As I have explained, at general law an obvious risk, apart from being at least a relevant factor in determining breach of duty, may excuse the need to warn (or bear on contributory negligence). That is likewise so under the Act. But none of this is to the point. What was called for by way of an effective and appropriate response, as I explain, was not a warning sign but denial of access to the area where the polishing was taking place until the polish could dry.  
     
      
    118 I have earlier set out the reasoning of the trial judge in some detail. I agree with the conclusion the trial judge reached. There is nothing in the reasoning of Phillis v Daly (supra) upon which the appellant seeks to rely, that mandates any different result.  
     
      
    119 Clearly the danger to a person in the position of the plaintiff from unguarded polishing operations gave rise to a duty of care on the part both of the hotel-occupier and the cleaner. The question is what would have sufficed to discharge that duty in the circumstances. That brings into play the well-known principles enunciated by Mason CJ in Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (supra) at 47-8:  
     
      
       
        
        ""In deciding whether there has been a breach of the duty of care the tribunal of fact must first ask itself whether a reasonable man in the defendant's position would have foreseen that his conduct involved a risk of injury to the plaintiff or to a class of persons including the plaintiff. If the answer be in the affirmative, it is then for the tribunal of fact to determine what a reasonable man would do by way of response to the risk. The perception of the reasonable man's response calls for a consideration of the magnitude of the risk and the degree of the probability of its occurrence, along with the expense, difficulty and inconvenience of taking alleviating action and any other conflicting responsibilities which the plaintiff may have. It is only when these matters are balanced out that the tribunal of fact can confidently assert what is the standard of response to be ascribed to the reasonable man placed in the defendant's position.  
         
         
        The considerations to which I have referred indicate that a risk of injury which is remote in the sense that it is extremely unlikely to occur may nevertheless constitute a foreseeable risk. A risk which is not far-fetched or fanciful is real and therefore foreseeable. But, as we have seen, the existence of a foreseeable risk of injury does not in itself dispose of the question of breach of duty. The magnitude of the risk and its degree of probability remain to be considered with other relevant factors.""  
        
       
      
    120 A reasonable person in the position of the hotel-occupier should have done more than place a warning sign that could easily be overlooked. Being in control of the premises, it should have roped off the area being cleaned or otherwise prevented access. No great expense or inconvenience was thereby entailed in removing the appreciable risk of not trivial physical injury for hotel entrants. That was sufficiently part of the reasoning of the trial judge and in my opinion it was correct. Similarly, the cleaner was careless in failing to remove the unbuffed polish.  
     
      
    121 There is nothing in the reasoning of Phillis v Daly which warrants any different conclusion. As Samuels JA observed at [67], “what is reasonable ‘will vary with the circumstances of the plaintiff’s entry upon the premises’”. Here the plaintiff was at risk from the cleaning and polishing operations once the plaintiff was permitted on the premises while these were being carried out. Reasonable care for the safety of such persons called for preventing access to the hazardous area or at the very least a multiplicity of warning signs marking an artificial barrier to persons to keep off. Nor is the cleaner exculpated by the hotel-occupier’s failure to take such steps. As the evidence bore out there was close collaboration of the cleaner with the hotel-occupier in carrying out the cleaner’s tasks, with the hotel-occupier in charge.  
     
      
    122 For the appellant’s contractual argument designed to attribute the whole liability to the cleaner, the appellant was permitted to add a further ground 2A to its Grounds of Appeal. That ground was that “on the facts found by the trial judge, he ought to have found the second respondent in breach of the implied term alleged, namely that the second respondent would perform its obligations under the contract with the appellant with reasonable care and skill. It was said to follow that the appellant was entitled to damages for breach in an amount equivalent to its liability to the first respondent.”  
     
      
    123 The short answer is that it was not alleged to be an implied term, nor could it readily be found, that the second respondent would indemnify the appellant for any loss or damage including that caused by the appellant’s own negligence. That being so, and accepting that the trial judge’s finding on the issue of apportionment stands (see below), it must be taken that the appellant was liable independently of the second respondent to the extent of 80%. I would agree with the second respondent’s submissions that s9 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1965 operates so as to produce the same result in respect of the contractual claim by the appellant against the second respondent as is provided by s5(1)(c) of the earlier 1946 Act in respect of the claim for contribution as between joint tortfeasors.  
     
      
    124 The second respondent’s written submissions correctly state the position:  
     
      
       
        
        “7. In terms of section 9, the Appellant has suffered damage (i.e. its liability to the first respondent) partly because of its failure to take reasonable care and partly because of the ‘wrong’ of the second respondent, with ‘wrong’, by virtue of the definition in section 8, including  
        a breach of a contractual duty of care that is concurrent and co-extensive with a duty of care in tort 
        .  
         
         
        8. Accordingly, by subsection 9(b), the damages recoverable for the contractual breach  
        are to be reduced to such extent as a Court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant’s share and the responsibility for the damage 
        .  
         
         
        9. Thus, conformably with the findings on apportionment in tort, the damages for breach of contract must be reduced by 80%.  
         
         
        10. As to the pleading point, the second respondent submits that the mandatory language of section 9 ( 
        the damages…  
        are to be 
         reduced 
        ”) means that it is unnecessary to plead section 9.”  
        
       
       
      Conclusion  
      
    125 There is no basis for concluding otherwise than that both the appellant and second respondent were in breach of a duty of care to the first respondent, essentially for the reasons of the trial judge. While the trial judge did not refer to the Act, its provisions so far as they deal with “obvious risk” and its legal consequences do not alter that conclusion.  
     
      
       
      Apportionment of liability  
      
    126 The trial judge apportioned liability as between appellant and second respondent at 80%/20%. His reasons for doing so relied primarily upon the fact that the appellant was clearly in overall control of the premises and of the operations conducted thereon, including the cleaning operations. He clearly considered it in the interests of the hotel-occupier that these should be carried on concurrently with patrons (as well as workers and trades people) coming on to those premises rather than having its trade interrupted for the necessary cleaning to occur. As Kirby J stated in Neindorf v Junkovic (2005) 80 ALJR 341 at 355, “To this day, the common law continues to recognise that, all other things being equal, a higher standard of care is owed by those with contractual or economic interests in the presence of an entrant on their premises.”  
     
      
    127 Moreover, as was said by the second respondent in its written submissions:  
     
      
       
        
        “The second respondent was a ‘family’ company with one employee, Mr Elder, and the system of work which he followed was devised in consultation with the appellant. At a factual level. Mr Elder was much more like an employee of the appellant than an independent contractor. Control of access to a part of the premises whilst floor polishing was being undertaken was essentially within the province of the appellant. Notwithstanding that the immediate cause may have been cleaning material which had not yet dried, the type of accident which occurred was plainly foreseeable and excluding other persons until any residue dried was the most obvious preventative step. The appellant, with overall responsibility for access to different parts of the premises must accept the primary responsibility for not excluding other persons from the area where polishing was being carried out, particularly as it was conducting itself as if it were the employer of Mr Elder.”  
        
       
      
    128 As has again been affirmed by the High Court in Annikin v Sierra (2004) 79 ALJR 452 at 460 [50] in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ “It is accepted that the decision [of apportionment] of the trial judge is ‘not lightly reviewed’” Podrebersek v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Ltd (1985) 50 ALJR 492 at 494; Liftronic Pty Ltd v Unver (2001) 75 ALJR 867 at 868 [2]; Joslyn v Berryman (2003) 214 CLR 552 at 578-579 [84], 601-602 [157]. It was open to the trial judge to attribute the predominant causal potency in bringing about the plaintiff’s injury to the failure of the party in control of the premises to prevent access to the hazardous area.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion  
      
    129 There is no basis for appellate intervention in altering the apportionment made by the trial judge of liability between appellant and second respondent.  
     
      
       
      DAMAGES  
      
    130 The appellant challenges the determination of damages in two specific areas. The first is damages for economic and non-economic loss. An assessment of 40% of the most extreme case was said to be beyond the range of sound discretionary judgment. It was submitted that 30% of a most extreme case should be the appropriate award.  
     
      
    131 The second area of attack is in relation to the amount allowed for physiotherapy and hydrotherapy expenses ($15,000 in the first case, $45,495 in the second case) on two bases, namely  
     
      
      (a) they were in absolute terms too high in the circumstances, and  
      (b) they should have been reduced by 50% on account of Dr Bodel’s assessment by reference to the effect of pre-existing degenerative changes would have had quite apart from the accident.  
      
    132 On the first challenge, in monetary terms the difference between 30% and 40% of the most extreme case is $68,000. The complaint is that the trial judge failed to take into account, or sufficiently into account, the pre-existing degenerative changes which were found to be present in the first respondent’s knee, though asymptomatic. However, it is clear that, from his reasoning as I have earlier set it out (Red, 54F-L), the trial judge did take those matters into account albeit he did not make a specific quantification of that effect. I deal below with other aspects of the evidence on this point when considering the challenge to the physiotherapy and hydrotherapy expenses; that evidence was more particularly focussed on that claim in the appellant’s argument on appeal.  
     
      
    133 I do not consider that the difference here between 30% and 40% is significant or that 40% is outside the range of a sound discretionary judgment. It was after all in relation to an injury which has rendered a previously symptom-free degenerative condition to the knee no longer asymptomatic. Moreover, the effect of the knee injury is that the significant pain, discomfort and restrictions on her mobility means that she is no longer able to run, jump or undertake skiing and has an embarrassment about the appearance of her legs. Moreover, she has suffered not only arthroscopy for some repair to her right knee but has had fluid drained from her knee on a number of occasions and suffers intermittent pain when she is sedentary and significant and continuous pain while active on her right knee.  
     
      
    134 The trial judge also dealt with her unattractive prognosis.  
     
      
    135 In those circumstances I consider that there is no proper basis for interfering with the trial judge’s discretion in assessing her economic and non-economic loss at 40% of the most extreme case so as to produce $160,000. The matters which the trial judge took into account were properly regarded as relevant.  
     
      
    136 Turning to the physiotherapy and hydrotherapy, it should be noted that the trial judge halved the figure claimed for physiotherapy from $25,000 to $12,500. He then allowed a further $2,500 for the contingency that there may be a need for more intensive physiotherapy because of fluctuations in the impact of the knee problems upon her.  
     
      
    137 So far as hydrotherapy is concerned, the trial judge, as I have said, allowed the entirety of the amount claimed, namely $45,495.  
     
      
    138 I should first deal with Dr Bodel’s evidence, given on behalf of the defendants at trial. At Blue, 42V he recorded his observations as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “On clinical testing this lady has medial compartment osteoarthritis in the right knee and the fall on 5.12.2000 has caused some additional structural damage in that knee, although there was evidence clinically of pre-existing pathology although it had been previously asymptomatic.  
         
         
        The patient has had an arthroscopy which helped a little. A long term prognosis is guarded because of the medial compartment osteoarthritis and eventually she will need a total knee replacement. In part, the need for that will arise as a result of injury on 5.12.2000 but there are also longstanding constitutional factors contributing to the pathology which is now present in the knee.”  
        
       
      
    139 In an addendum of 7 October 2003 (Blue, 44) he attributed 50% of the disability to the injury and 50% to a pre-existing condition.  
     
      
    140 The appellant then contends that the trial judge failed to apply the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in Seltsam Pty Ltd v Ghaleb [2005] NSWCA 208. It is convenient the I here quote from the appellant’s written submissions which in turn quote the relevant passage from Ghaleb in the judgment of Ipp JA at [103] and [105]:  
     
      
       
        
        “The principle to be applied, in a case like the present has been expressed in  
        Seltsam Pty Ltd v Ghaleb 
         [2005] NSWCA 208 and concerns the interplay between  
        Watts v Rake 
         (1960) 180 CLR 158 and  
        Purkess v Crittenden (1965) 114 CLR 164 on the one hand and Malec v J C Hutton Pty Ltd  
        (1990) 169 CLR 638 on the other.  
         
         
        After reviewing these authorities Ipp JA at [103]:  
         
         
          
          Therefore, according to Malec:  
           
           
          (a) In the assessment of damages, the law takes account of hypothetical situations of the past, future effects of physical injury or degeneration, and the chance of future or hypothetical events occurring.  
           
           
          (b) The Court must form an estimate of the likelihood that the alleged hypothetical past situation would have occurred.  
           
           
          (c) the Court must form an estimate of the likelihood of the possibility of alleged future events occurring.  
           
           
          (d) These matters require an evaluation of possibilities and are to be distinguished from events that are alleged to have actual occurred in the past which must be proven the balance of probabilities.  
          
         
         
        And at [105] his Honour said:  
         
         
          
          Where a Defendant alleges that the Plaintiff suffered from a pre-existing condition, the evidential onus as explained in  
          Watts v Rake 
           and  
          Purkess v Crittenden 
           remains on the Defendant and must be discharged by it. Nevertheless, to the extent that the issues involve hypothetical situations of the past, future effects of physical injury or degeneration, and the chance for future or hypothetical events occurring, the exercise of ‘disentanglement’ discussed in those cases is more easily achieved. That is because the Court is required to evaluate possibilities in these situations – not proof on a balance of probabilities.  
          
         
         
        Mason P agreed with Ipp JA. And Basten JA at [208] agreed with the statement of principle at [103] but not its application to the appeal as, in his Honour’s view, it had not been squarely raised. (See also  
        Commonwealth of Australia v Elliot 
         [2004] NSWCA 360 at [81]).”  
        
       
      
    141 However, the trial judge noted that the prognosis for the first respondent’s right knee was poor (Red, 55) and was not blind to the possibility that the underlying degenerative change in the first respondent’s right knee may, at some time in the future, have become symptomatic even without the accident. Thus the trial judge said (Red, 54):  
     
      
       
        
        “Whilst it may be assumed that, at some point in the future, the plaintiff would have suffered some symptoms from those degenerative changes, the evidence does not disclose when that would have been.”  
        
       
       
      Moreover, the trial judge accurately summarised the effect of the medical evidence (Red, 54):  
       
       
        
        “… the medical evidence is essentially all one way, that is that the injury to her (right) knee on 5 December 2000 caused a discrete injury of its own in her knee, but also triggered or made symptomatic underlying degenerative change.”  
        
       
      
    142 I agree with the submissions of the first respondent that the trial judge did therefore take into account these matters in assessing damages both for non-economic loss and future medical treatment. In particular he recognised the impossibility on the evidence of any meaningful prediction of when in the future the pre-existing degenerative changes might cease to be asymptomatic and manifest themselves.  
     
      
    143 Nor is Dr Bodel’s evidence to be understood as providing any accurate quantification of when, absent the injury, it would have become symptomatic at some time in the future. Dr Bodel’s comment that “There are also longstanding constitutional factors contributing to the pathology which is now apparent in the knee” and his attribution of 50% of the disability to pre-existing degenerative changes does not justify in logic a corresponding reduction in damage of 50% for the reasons earlier explained. In those circumstances, I agree with the submissions of the first respondent that any reduction of damages on this hypothetical basis, though clearly required to be considered by the trial judge, was in fact estimated and was properly modest. Thus I would not take this factor into account in considering either the damage for non-economic loss or, relevantly in the present context, what was allowed for other physiotherapy and in particular hydrotherapy.  
     
      
    144 As to the figure for hydrotherapy, it is undoubtedly the case that the evidence for its need was relatively insubstantial. It first emerged (Black, 10E) in response to a question about pain, where the plaintiff said, “I’ve been doing a bit of hydrotherapy and that’s helping a little bit, I think that the pain because its helping to develop my muscles a bit”.  
     
      
    145 This was at a time when she had commenced at the hydrotherapy some two and half weeks before 17 June 2004 (Black, 10G).  
     
      
    146 At Black, 12W the plaintiff said she was going twice a week.  
     
      
    147 At Black, 13H-L she confirmed that she intended to do this hydrotherapy twice a week because “they said I should have my muscles prepared, ready for the knee replacement”. She went on to say that she proposed to continue with it “because they seemed to be helping and it doesn’t put any pressure on the knee”.  
     
      
    148 She commenced the hydrotherapy on the recommendation of a Dr Lewington who was said to be a back specialist whom she had seen on one occasion only at the request of her GP. No report from Dr Lewington was tendered.  
     
      
    149 While there was some evidence of lower back pain, I agree with the appellant’s submission that the evidence did not provide a sufficient basis to support the extraordinarily generous allowance of $45,495 so that it was outside a sound discretionary judgment. While it is difficult to form any accurate estimate, I would reduce it by two-thirds to $15,000. However, I do not consider that any reduction in the allowance for physiotherapy is appropriate. Nor do I consider any reduction to the other items sought by the appellant should be made as I do not consider that the determination by the trial judge was outside the permissible range of discretionary determination.  
     
      
       
      COSTS  
      
    150 The appellant also appeals against the costs order made in favour of the second respondent (the cleaner Kidgloves). The trial judge ordered the appellant and second respondent to pay the first respondent’s solicitor and client costs of the proceedings (Red, 69D-F). As between those original two defendants (and now appellant and second respondent), the trial judge then ordered the appellant to pay the second respondent’s solicitor client costs of the proceedings, including the costs of the first respondent ordered against the second respondent (Red, 70V-X). The trial judge made this latter order having reviewed the history of the proceedings, and in particular, having regard to an offer to contribute made by the second respondent on 27 May 2004. He made the order pursuant to Pt 39A r26 DCR which deals with an offer to contribute in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “The Court may take an offer to contribute (or offer of contribution) into account in determining whether it should order that the offeree should pay the whole or part of:  
        (a) the costs of the offeror, or  
        (b) any costs which the offeror is liable to pay to the plaintiff.”  
        
       
      
    151 The history of the proceedings is as follows. The first respondent commenced proceedings on 7 January 2003. The second respondent was first joined to the proceedings at the suit of the appellant by way of cross-claim. An arbitration took place in February 2004. Each defendant was found equally liable to the plaintiff. The second respondent applied for a rehearing, and on 27 May 2004, filed and served an offer to contribute in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “The [second respondent] offers to contribute 25% plus costs towards any damages which may be recovered by the [first respondent] against the [appellant].”  
        
       
       
      The appellant did not accept the offer.  
       
      
    152 The outcome of the rehearing before Graham DCJ was more favourable to the second respondent than the arbitration. Although the amount awarded to the first respondent was more than $100,000 above the sum awarded by the arbitrator, the trial judge ordered that the appellant bear 80% of the liability and the second respondent 20%. Thus the contribution recoverable from the second respondent was reduced from 50% to 20%. Moreover, the second respondent’s offer to contribute was more favourable to the appellant than the 80/20 result.  
     
      
    153 In light of the fact that the result of the rehearing was to produce “a preponderance of liability on the appellant in terms of contribution” (Red, 69P-Q) and that, in terms of the actual sums involved, the second respondent’s liability was reduced by some $15,000 or 26% (from $59,000 to $44,000), the judge concluded that:  
     
      
       
        
        “In all of those circumstances, both the rules and their rationale point to a requirement that the [appellant] should pay the second [respondent’s] costs of the cross-claim and, indeed, of the proceedings.” (Red, 70C-E)  
        
       
      
    154 The appellant submits that the trial judge’s discretion underlying the costs order in favour of the second respondent miscarried in that he:  
     
      
      (a) made an error of principle,  
      (b) took into account an irrelevant matter, and  
      (c) made an order that was so unreasonable in the circumstances that the Court will infer it was made in error.  
      
    155 The appellant acknowledged that Pt 39A r26 DCR empowered the Court to make a costs order which varied from the general rule that the right to contribution extends to costs payable to the plaintiff in addition to the damages: James Hardie & Co Pty Ltd v Wyong Shire Council (2000) 48 NSWLR 679 at 684. However, it submitted that the trial judge made an error of principle in departing from the general rule.  
     
      
    156 The appellant emphasised that rule 26 merely empowers the Court to take into account an offer to contribute. In this regard it is to be distinguished from r25 which mandates a certain costs order to follow failure to accept an offer of compromise. Discussing a provision identical to r26 in the SCR (Pt 52A r24), Young CJ in Eq said that “no automatic consequence flows from the non-acceptance of an offer to contribute”: Diamond v Simpson (No 4) [2004] NSWCA 57 per Young CJ in Eq at [62]. The appellant submitted that in the present case, mere failure to accept an offer to contribute does not justify an “exceptional” costs order the effect of which is to render the appellant liable for the whole of the costs of the proceedings.  
     
      
    157 A costs order is a matter of practice and procedure within the discretion of the trial judge. An appellate court should be slow to interfere with such discretionary determinations. In any case, it is apparent from the wording of Pt 39A r26 that it expressly contemplates that an offeree may be ordered to pay the whole of both the costs of the offeror and of any costs which the offeror is liable to pay to the plaintiff. Thus the orders made were within the range of orders expressly contemplated by rule 26.  
     
      
    158 The orders made also give effect to the legislative intention that costs sanctions be imposed where an offer to settle proceedings is not accepted. Rule 26 should be read in the context of rule 25 and Practice Note 42. I consider this to be so, even though r25 is concerned with offers of compromise and Practice Note 42 does not specifically or in terms refer to offers to contribute. Practice Note 42 clearly states that “rejection of an offer that should have been accepted will have serious consequences in costs”; these being not only solicitor and client costs from the date of the offer but costs of the whole proceedings. Thus in Bouras v Grandelis [2005] NSWCA 463 Giles JA observed at [32]:  
     
      
       
        
        “… Practice Note 42 made plain that the amendments were intended to increase the effectiveness of the system of offers of compromise, and in particular to increase the incentive to a plaintiff to make a reasonable offer of compromise. The incentive was increased by making the costs in r 25(4) the costs “in respect of the claim”, that is, all costs rather than costs from the date of the offer, unless the offer was made less than twenty-eight days before the trial when the entitlement was only to costs from the date of the offer. The incentive was increased by tightening the circumstances of an order otherwise.”  
        
       
      
    159 The objects of r25 include “providing for penalties in costs to be imposed on a party who rejects an offer of compromise”: Pt 39A r25(1A)(c)(1).  
     
      
    160 Given the apportionment of liability, had costs followed the event the appellant would likely have been liable for approximately 80% of the costs of the proceedings. Thus the orders made effectively impose an additional burden on the appellant of only about 20% of the overall costs. It cannot be said that to impose this additional burden, in light of the offer to contribute, would be “exceptional” or a “radical departure” from the general rule set out in James Hardie.  
     
      
    161 The appellant further submitted that the trial judge erred in principle in making a Bullock order for the benefit of an unsuccessful defendant in the absence of any conduct by the appellant to justify it. However, the trial judge did not purport to make a Bullock or similar order; he made an order based on failure to accept an offer to contribute.  
     
      
    162 The appellant’s submission that the trial judge took into account an irrelevant consideration was faintly pressed. Insofar as the trial judge took into account that the appellant’s own offer to contribute (made a week before that of the second respondent) proved wide of the mark (having offered 30% contribution), it does not appear that this consideration was a significant factor in the trial judge’s reasoning nor determinative of the result.  
     
      
    163 There is some force in the appellant’s submission that the second respondent’s offer was uncertain in its terms, at least in respect of the percentage contribution the second respondent would make to payment of the first respondent’s costs and whether this was restricted to payment of the first respondent’s costs up until the date of the offer or extended beyond that date. However, having refused the offer without seeking to clarify its terms, the appellant cannot now rely on uncertainty.  
     
      
    164 For all of these reasons, it is clear that the trial judge did not err in the exercise of his discretion in making the costs award so as to justify appellate intervention.  
     
      
       
      OVERALL CONCLUSION AND ORDERS 
      
    165 Apart from one item of damages (hydrotherapy, reduced from $45,495 to $15,000) the appellant fails entirely on both damages and liability. The second respondent on appeal supported the appellant in its attack on the first respondent’s damages and liability but concentrated its oral argument on damages.  
     
      
    166 In the circumstances, I would propose orders as follows:  
     
      
      (1) (a) Appeal allowed, but only as to the reduction of damages for hydrotherapy from $45,495 to $15,000;  
       
        
        (b) Orders 1, 2 and 3 of Graham DCJ to be varied accordingly, so that there shall be judgment  
         
          
          (i) for the plaintiff (first respondent) for $191,071.02 against the first and second defendants (appellant and second respondent);  
          (ii) judgment for the second cross-claimant (second respondent) against the cross-defendant (appellant) to the second cross-claim in the amount of $152,856.81, and  
          (iii) for the cross-claimant (appellant) against the cross defendant (second respondent) on the Amended Notice of first cross-claim in the amount of $38,214.20.  
          
         
        
       
      (2) Appellant to pay 80%, and second respondent 20%, of the costs of appeal of the first respondent and otherwise each is to bear their own costs of the appeal.  
       
      
    167 McCOLL JA: I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgments of Santow JA and Bryson JA. I agree with Bryson JA that the risk which caused the first respondent’s injury was not an obvious risk within the meaning of the Civil Liability Act 2002 and that the primary judge adequately dealt with the subject of obvious risk in his conclusion that the substance on which the first respondent slipped was not readily visible. I also would not join in Santow JA’s examination of the Civil Liability Act or the issue of obvious risk in the law of negligence.  
     
      
    168 I agree with Santow JA’s conclusions as to damages and with the orders his Honour proposes. 
     
      
    169 BRYSON JA: Section 5F of the Civil Liability Act 2002 is headed Meaning of “Obvious risk"" and it is in these terms:  
     
      
       
        
        5F 
          
         (1) 
         For the purposes of this Division, an obvious risk to a person who suffers harm is a risk that, in the circumstances, would have been obvious to a reasonable person in the position of that person. 
         
         (2) 
         Obvious risks include risks that are patent or a matter of common knowledge. 
         
         (3) 
         A risk of something occurring can be an obvious risk even though it has a low probability of occurring. 
         
         (4) 
         A risk can be an obvious risk even if the risk (or a condition or circumstance that gives rise to the risk) is not prominent, conspicuous or physically observable. 
        
       
      
    170 Other provisions in Div.4 Assumption of Risk deal with (s. 5G) Injured Persons Presumed To Be Aware Of Obvious Risks, (s.5H) No Proactive Duty To Warn Of Obvious Risk and (s.5I) No Liability For Materialisation of Inherent Risk. An effect of s.5G is that Ms Hutton-Potts is presumed to have been aware of the risk and harm if it is an obvious risk; she can displace this presumption. An effect of s.5H is that, if the risk was an obvious risk, neither of the persons whom she sued had a duty of care to her to warn of that obvious risk. ""Obvious risk"" is also used in Div.5 Recreational Activities. 
     
      
    171 These provisions are not a complete statement of the application of the law of negligence to her claim; they deal only with limited parts of the application of that law. If s.5G operated and Ms Hutton-Potts were presumed to have been aware of the risk of harm that would not wholly dispose of the issues on her claim. The duty of care which she alleged went further than a duty to warn of a risk. 
     
      
    172 The course of argument requires consideration whether Ms Hutton-Potts’ injury was caused by an obvious risk of such an injury occurring. 
     
      
    173 Much depends, in the application of provisions dealing with obvious risk, upon the degree of generality or precision with which the risk is stated. Rejecting more highly generalised statements, such as that bad things sometimes happen in hotels or that people sometimes fall over when walking on floors, the risks which confronted Ms Hutton-Potts can be stated at several different degrees of intensity. In a room in a hotel where a cleaner is polishing the floor with a buffing machine there is a risk that a recently polished floor will be slippery, because it is polished. I do not think that it would be correct in fact to see this as the risk which matured. If it were to be said that that risk was obvious it would, in the application of the meaning of “obvious risk” to the facts, have to be said that a reasonable person in the position of Ms Hutton-Potts who entered the room would have seen that Mr Elder was in the room, and would have gone further and considered what he was doing, and would have gone further and noticed that he was buffing the floor with a buffing machine; and that it would have been obvious to the reasonable person who did those things that there was a risk of slipping on the floor because it was recently polished. 
     
      
    174 However that would not be enough to show that Ms Hutton-Potts suffered harm from an obvious risk, because it was not the recent polishing of the floor which caused her injury. A higher degree of intensity is required in stating the risk. Her injury was caused by there being polishing material on the floor which was not visible, and had not been removed in the buffing process. The finding that the risk which caused her injury was an obvious risk involves attributing to the reasonable person in her position discernment, as an obvious matter, that there may (even with a low degree of probability) be polishing material on the floor which was not visible. This is the risk which matured and caused her injury. Involved in this is not only advertence to what Mr Elder was doing, but advertence to the risk that he was not doing it properly. 
     
      
    175 When the risk is stated at this degree it is in my opinion quite unsustainable that it should be found as a fact that there was an obvious risk to which the provisions of Div.4 applied; obviously so. 
     
      
    176 I do not find it surprising that the Trial Judge’s reasons did not expressly deal with Div.4 or s.5F; they had no real claim on his Honour's attention. Judge Graham dealt with the subject of obvious risk without referring to the legislation, by saying that the mixture of linseed oil and spirits which caused Ms Hutton-Potts to slip was not readily visible. This disposed of the subject adequately and completely. It is not easy to understand why his Honour then decided that there was contributory negligence; but this part of the decision was not challenged on appeal. As there was not in fact an obvious risk of the kind to which s.5F refers, or of any kind, it is in my opinion unnecessary to discuss the meaning or effect of s.5F or the place of obvious risk in negligence law. I respectfully say that I do not join in Santow JA’s examination of those subjects. 
     
      
    177 It would be a difficult exercise to deal comprehensively with the provisions of Pt.1A Negligence, Div.2-8 of the Civil Liability Act 2002; these are among the provisions inserted in that Act by the Civil Liability Amendment (Personal Responsibility) Act 2002. There is no general statement of purposes or of objectives in either Act. Some of the provisions may have been intended to restate or declare parts of the law of negligence while others change parts of that law. I have not observed any overall purpose or scheme of the amendments which can be brought to bear on the construction of any particular provision. The application of each particular provision should be considered in its statutory context and in relation to the facts of each particular case in which a litigant claims to rely on it. Broad views and insights based on them should be deferred until there has been a significant accumulation of judicial experience on the operation of these provisions. 178 With these observations, I agree with Santow JA.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: Pursuant to the liberty reserved on 29 May 2006, the appellant made further submissions in regard to costs seeking a reduction in the costs payable by the first respondent to 80% of the costs otherwise recoverable. The first respondent in turn by written submission dated 8 June 2006, apart from pointing out a minor adjustment to the figure for damages to be made under the slip rule (agreed by the appellant on 19 June 2006) sought to rely upon an offer of compromise as a basis for being paid indemnity costs from 13 January 2006. In the alternative it was submitted by the first respondent that the order for costs should not be disturbed on the basis that the appeal was successful to a minimal extent only.  
     
      
    2 We consider that the correct approach is in fact to make no alteration to the order for costs either by way of reduction or by way of substitution of indemnity costs. In the circumstances we do not consider that there is any basis for altering the order for costs, given the counterbalancing considerations and the relatively modest sums involved.  
     
      
    3 The minor adjustments to the figure for damages are made by consent under the slip rule.  
     
      
    4 Accordingly the orders of the Court are to substitute for the orders made on 29 May 2006, the following orders:  
     
      
      (1) (a) Appeal allowed, but only as to the reduction of damages for hydrotherapy from $45,495 to $15,000;  
       
        
        (b) Orders 1, 2 and 3 of Graham DCJ to be varied accordingly, so that there shall be judgment  
         
          
          (i) for the plaintiff (first respondent) for $197,169.61 against the first and second defendants (appellant and second respondent);  
          (ii) judgment for the second cross-claimant (second respondent) against the cross-defendant (appellant) to the second cross-claim in the amount of $157,735.68, and  
          (iii) for the cross-claimant (appellant) against the cross defendant (second respondent) on the Amended Notice of first cross-claim in the amount of $39,433.93.  
          
         
        
       
      (2) Appellant to pay 80%, and second respondent 20%, of the costs of appeal of the first respondent and otherwise each is to bear their own costs of the appeal.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hislop J. 
     
      
    2 HISLOP J: On the 26 May 2002 Simon Raha, with others, broke and entered the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories (‘AGAL’) and stole a safe and other items. The safe was a cube of concrete reinforced with steel with a weight estimated at approximately 450 kg. It contained drugs including heroin, cocaine, amphetamines and steroids with a value in excess of $2,000,000. An earlier attempt by Mr Raha and his cohorts to break and enter the premises on 5 May 2002 had been unsuccessful. 
     
      
    3 The appellant, a single man born on the 17 February 1976, was employed by AGAL as a technical officer. He was charged with being an accessory before the fact to the break enter and steal pursuant to the Crimes Act 1900 sections 112(1) and 346. The maximum penalty for the offence was imprisonment for 14 years. 
     
      
    4 The Crown case was that the appellant voluntarily provided Mr Raha with information about the location of the contents of the laboratory, security and alarm systems and provided a map of the layout of the relevant areas of AGAL in return for the payment of $10,000. 
     
      
    5 The appellant did not dispute his involvement in the offence as an accessory before the fact but raised duress as a defence. He gave evidence he had provided the information to Mr Raha under threats of harm to himself and his family. The trial was effectively confined to the issue of duress. 
     
      
    6 The appellant was convicted by a District Court jury on the 30 June 2004. On 3 September 2004 he was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months to commence on 3 September 2004. 
     
      
    7 The appellant has appealed against conviction and sought leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
       
      Conviction 
       
      
    8 The appellant relies upon five grounds of appeal against conviction. 
     
      
       
      Ground One – The directions on duress were erroneous in that they invited the jury to approach the issue by applying a purely objective test to the determination of questions regarding the reaction of the appellant to threats made to him and his ability to render those threats ineffective. 
      
    9 In R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 544-545 Hunt J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Mahoney JA agreed) suggested a form of directions which should be given in respect of the defence of duress. The direction was relevantly: 
     
      
       
        
        [4] What the Crown must establish is one or the other of two things. It does not have to establish both of them. The first is that, when the accused did those acts, there is no reasonable possibility that he did so by reason of a threat that death or really serious physical harm would be inflicted upon him or upon his family if he did not do those acts. 
        
       
       
        
        [5] If the Crown has failed to eliminate that particular reasonable possibility, it must establish in relation to any such threat which may reasonably have been made that there is no reasonable possibility that such was its gravity that a person of ordinary firmness of mind and will, and of the same sex and maturity as the accused, would have yielded to that threat in the way in which the accused did …  
        
       
       
        
        The judge should then explain how these directions may be applied to the facts of the particular case. Where the specific issues have been raised in relation to the facts of the particular case, the judge should, in the course of explaining the application of the law to those facts, direct the jury, for example: … [c] that the issue is whether the threat was still effective at the time when the crime was committed, and duress no longer operates if the Crown has established that the accused failed to take advantage of an opportunity which was reasonably open to him to render it ineffective. 
        
       
      
    10 Abusafiah was quoted with approval in R v Pimentel (Spigelman CJ, Dunford and Hidden JJ) [1999] 110 A Crim R 30 at [36] see also R v O’Brien (2003) NSWCCA 121 at [41]. 
     
      
    11 The Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book has provided a suggested duress direction which, drawing particularly upon Abusafiah, poses three questions: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Was [the accused] driven by [the alleged threats] to act as [he/she] did because [the accused] genuinely believed that if [he/she] did not act in this way, [he/she/member of the accused’s family etc] would soon be killed or seriously injured. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Would the threats that you have found were present have driven a reasonable person to act as [the accused] did 
        
       
       
        
        This is a somewhat more complicated question and requires you to look at the response of a reasonable person of ordinary firmness of mind and will, and of the same sex and maturity as [the accused], to the threats which faced [the accused], and in the circumstances in which [the accused] found [himself/ herself]. I shall refer to this person as “a reasonable person.” 
        
       
       
        
        3. Could [the accused] have avoided the effects of the duress by escaping from the threats without damage to [himself/herself/person threatened].  
        
       
       
        
        The law states that [the accused] cannot say that [he/she] could not avoid the effects of the duress if a reasonable person would have done so. 
        
       
      
    12 His Honour directed the jury, in writing and orally, essentially in terms of the suggested direction contained in the bench book. 
     
      
    13 At the hearing of the appeal appellant’s counsel accepted that Abusafiah and the questions suggested in the directions in the Bench Book accurately represented the law. However it was submitted his Honour, in his directions to the jury, erred in referring, on the second and third questions, to “a reasonable person” rather than to “a person of ordinary firmness of mind and will and of the same sex and maturity as the accused” and in referring to the second question as providing a purely objective test.  
     
      
    14 His Honour in his directions to the jury did, from time to time, make reference to “a reasonable person” in the context of the second and third questions. He also referred to an “objective test”. 
     
      
    15 However in his written directions to the jury on question two his Honour said that question: 
     
      
       
        
        … requires you to look at the response of a reasonable person of ordinary firmness of mind and will, of the same sex and maturity as the accused to the threats which faced the accused and in the circumstances in which he found himself.  
        
       
       
        
        I shall refer to this person as “a reasonable person.” The reactions of a reasonable person may or may not be the same as the reactions of the accused … You place a reasonable person of ordinary firmness of mind and will, and of the same maturity and sex as the accused, in his position, that is, in the setting and circumstances in which he found himself, when he drew a map and gave other assistance to Raha and you attribute to that reasonable person the knowledge he had of the person, ie Raha, offering the threats. 
        
       
      
    16 In his oral directions to the jury his Honour immediately before stating the three questions said: 
     
      
       
        
        Then to be duress it has to be such a nature that a person of ordinary firmness and strength of will – so you take someone of his age and maturity, the same maturity, same sex, a male and a person in his position, but a person of ordinary firmness and strength. So in a sense you are looking at an objective test. You say, what would a person, quite apart from him, what would a person of ordinary firmness and strength do a person of his age his maturity a man such as him, what would he do if this threat were made? Would that person have yielded to that threat? 
        
       
       
      At the conclusion of his discussion of the second question his Honour directed the jury: 
       
       
        
        So when you examine this question of what would have driven a reasonable person to act as he did, you have got to examine what he knew about this person and then you have got to examine what a person of reasonable firmness of mind and will of the same sex and maturity as the accused in the same circumstance in which he found himself. So it is a reasonable person. 
        
       
      
    17 Additionally, in discussing the third question, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        So in other words, would a reasonable person who had been forced to draw a map, a person of reasonable ordinary firmness of mind, same maturity and sex as the accused, would that person have contacted the police and told them what he had done and what was likely to happen, or would he contact Dr Westwood (his supervisor) with whom he is apparently quite friendly, and tell him what had happened and what was likely to happen. And then thus taken advantage of that opportunity and escaped from the threats. 
        
       
      
    18 There were other references to “a person of ordinary firmness of mind and will and of the same sex and maturity as the accused” in the summing up. In my opinion, on a fair reading of the written directions and summing up, the jury was adequately informed that the expression “a reasonable person” was used by his Honour as a shorthand expression for “a reasonable person of ordinary firmness of mind and will, and of the same maturity and sex as the accused” and the jury would have so understood such references.19 His Honour referred in his directions to the second test as an objective test. It was submitted this detracted from the subjective element introduced into the second question by the reference to “maturity.” However his Honour made clear the sense in which he was referring to the test as objective in the direction quoted in paragraph [15] above.  
     
      
    20 The appellant further submitted there was error in identifying the onus of proof in relation to questions two and three. The essence of this submission was expressed in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        His Honour cast the test in terms of a decision as to whether a reasonable person may have yielded or “on the other hand” may not have done so. This is not a proper application of law where the onus is on the Crown to prove a matter beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
      
    21 However this submission focuses on part only of his Honour’s direction. The full context was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Now you may decide that a reasonable person may well have yielded in the same way the accused said he did. On the other hand you may decide a reasonable person may not have yielded. But the focus has got to be on this objective test of a reasonable person. What would a reasonable person have done? Not just what he would have done. Although as I say you may come to the conclusion that a reasonable person may well have done what he did. That is matter for you to consider. If the Crown satisfies you there is no reasonable possibility that a reasonable person would have yielded in this way then you would answer this question no. 
        
       
      
    22 His Honour pointed to the possibility of the competing views as to the response of the reasonable person and then to the burden of proof upon the Crown. In my opinion it has not been demonstrated that his Honour’s direction as to the onus of proof was erroneous or misleading. He similarly referred to the possibility of competing views in respect of question three and in a number of places in the summing up referred to the onus which rested upon the Crown.  
     
      
    23 The appellant further submitted that his Honour failed to give sufficient emphasis to the evidence in the case from which it might be concluded the appellant was immature and the relevance of such evidence to the second and third questions. 
     
      
    24 There was evidence from which the jury could have concluded the appellant was immature for his age. The parties addressed the jury at some length on this issue. His Honour, in his summing up, reminded the jury of the evidence as to the appellant’s character and the evidence of the witnesses and put that evidence fairly and clearly before the jury. His Honour reminded the jury of the demeanour of the appellant throughout the trial and in the course of his evidence. 
     
      
    25 In my opinion the arguments as to the appellant’s immaturity and its impact were fairly and adequately summed up by his Honour to the jury. 
     
      
    26 The appellant submitted in respect of question three that the Crown was required to establish that the appellant had a reasonable opportunity to escape the influence of the threat and he had failed to take advantage of that opportunity. There was evidence from which it could be concluded that there was reasonable opportunity for the appellant to bring the intentions of Mr Raha to the attention of his supervisor and the police well before the attempted break and enter and the later break enter and steal and that he failed to avail himself of that opportunity. His Honour in his written directions to the jury said: 
     
      
       
        
        Where, as the Crown contends in this case, the accused had a reasonable opportunity to avoid the threats and exercise his own will, then you must ask yourselves whether the Crown has satisfied you beyond reasonable doubt that there was such an opportunity, and that no reasonable person in the circumstances confronting the accused, that is, with like risks in respect of any alternatives open, in the face of the same threats, and with the same knowledge concerning Simon Raha, would have failed to take advantage of that opportunity and avoided or escaped from those threats. 
        
       
       
        
        If the Crown satisfied you beyond reasonable doubt that this question should be answered yes, then the defence of duress has failed. 
        
       
       
        
        If the Crown has failed to satisfy you that the question should be answered yes, then the accused is entitled to a verdict of not guilty. 
        
       
      
    27 The appellant also submitted: 
     
      
       
        
        The jury were directed in terms that the threat need only be continuing until the offence was committed. However there were no directions that if the jury found that the threat was not continuing following the commission of the offence, including when requests were made in relation to identifying stolen drugs, following the arrest of Mr Raha, or at the time of the appellant’s record of interview that this could not be weighed against the appellant if they considered that at the time of the principal offence the threats had been real and continuing. This was important as there was significant emphasis at the trial on the fact that the appellant had admittedly lied to the police in his record of interview. 
        
       
      
    28 There is difficulty in understanding this submission. However the jury was told that the Crown must prove that the appellant had a reasonable opportunity to avoid the threats and exercise his own free will. Having regard to the clarity of his Honour’s directions there was no need to give the direction contended for in relation to the post event circumstances.  
     
      
    29 The appellant submitted: 
     
      
       
        
        The jury were directed that they could take into account the appellant’s relationship with his family “in deciding what sort of relationship he has with these people and what sort of man he is but you cannot take into account their circumstances in deciding whether he be guilty or not guilty. It is submitted that the appellant’s relationship with his family was of great importance in assessing the subjective component of the tests on duress when it was clearly asserted in the evidence that his family had been threatened with serious injury or death and that the fear of this occurring had operated strongly in his mind at the relevant time and thereafter.” 
        
       
      
    30 The comment from the summing up which is relied upon by the appellant was made in the context that the jury was to determine the appellant’s guilt or innocence dispassionately, and divorced from feelings of sympathy for the appellant or his family. In this context his Honour referred to the circumstances of the appellant’s family, his father being unable to come to court and his mother and sister being very affected by the matter. No error has been demonstrated. 
     
      
    31 It was submitted that his Honour was in error in stating “there is no other fact in the case that would suggest duress apart from the appellant’s evidence” as he did not have regard to the evidence given by other witnesses as to the appellant’s manner. However the context in which his Honour made the remark was in explaining that for the issue of duress to be raised there had to be evidence, which, in the circumstances of this case where there was no other witness to the threats, had to come from the appellant. This did not involve error. 
     
      
    32 Subsequent to the completion of the hearing of the appeal the appellant sought and was granted leave to file additional submissions and the Crown leave to reply. The principal additional submission was that his Honour, in directing the jury, placed the emphasis upon the notion of “a reasonable person” without sufficient regard to the relevant personal characteristics of the appellant. This submission seeks to expand questions two and three to have regard to the accused’s background and other personal characteristics. 
     
      
    33 The essence of the appellant’s submission was that the well established principles for which R v Abusafiah is authority must be reconsidered and questions two and three should be reformulated so as to encompass considerations based on the background and other personal characteristics of the accused. It was submitted Hunt J in Abusafiah, by reason of reference to Stingel v The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 312, a decision of the High Court relating to provocation, erred in rejecting the proposition that the background and other personal characteristics of the accused should be taken into account in the defence of duress. 
     
      
    34 In support of his submission that the background and other personal characteristics of the accused should be taken into account the appellant referred to decisions in other States namely R v Runjanjic (1991) 56 SASR 114, R v Williams (1997) 97 A Crim R 119 (Victoria), Rice v McDonald (2000) 113 A Crim R 75 (Tasmania) and to the speech of Baroness Hale in R v Hasan [2005] 2 Crim App 314. 
     
      
    35 However, as the Crown observed in its submissions, Hunt J in Abusafiah rejected the analogy between provocation and duress; the comments of Baroness Hale relied upon were made in relation to possible law reform whereas the English authorities do not favour a more subjective approach (see Lord Bingham in R v Hasan); the Tasmanian decision of Rice and the Victorian decision of Williams were influenced by legislation in those States. The Crown submitted there was no basis to reformulate the principles so as to encompass the background and other personal characteristics of the accused.36 I reject the appellant’s submission. The first question involves a subjective test which is relatively easy to assert yet difficult to disprove. The second and third questions impose limitations upon the availability of the duress defence in order to contain the defence within sound and proper limitations. These limitations are policy based with the intent that there is a measure of control of the duress defence. 
     
      
    37 Abusafiah has been authority for a significant period and has been applied without question. If the matter is to be reconsidered it may be a matter for the legislature, utilising the consultative process available to it, to undertake such reconsideration.38 The remaining submission advanced, by leave, was that:  
     
      
       
        
        The relevance of conduct of the appellant after the conduct in which he said to have acted under duress to the determination of the question whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that he was not acting under duress at the time of the commission of the offence. 
        
       
      
    39 The proposition sought to be advanced by the foregoing submission is not clear. The submission sought to draw upon an analogy with the law of necessity. However whilst there may be some overlap between duress and necessity it is of no relevance in the present case. In any event to succeed in a defence of necessity the accused must have been afforded no reasonable opportunity for an alternative course of action which did not involve a breach of the law – R v Rogers (1996) 86 A Crim R 542 at 547.That was not the case here. 
     
      
    40 For the above reasons I reject ground one. 
     
      
       
      Ground Two - The directions given by the trial judge on the manner in which the jury should deal with the appellant’s evidence were erroneous. 
       
      
    41 The appellant was interviewed at length by the police. He gave evidence at the trial that the majority of what he had told the police at the interview was lies. He said the truth was he acted under duress. He said he lied to the police because he was afraid Mr Raha’s friends were still around and he did not think the police would believe the truth. 
     
      
    42 His Honour directed the jury that it had to “scrutinise [the appellant’s] evidence” and “to give careful consideration to [the appellant’s] credibility.” 
     
      
    43 The appellant submitted this direction was only given in relation to the appellant’s evidence and could only have had the effect that his evidence had to be scrutinised more carefully that the evidence of any other witness for no reason other than he was the accused. In fact his Honour also directed the jury to have regard carefully to the character evidence given by other witnesses. 
     
      
    44 The direction to which objection was taken was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        Lastly in this direction I want to say to you that he has admitted telling lies to the police during his record of interview but said that he has given you the truth in the evidence in this case. Now that in itself creates a question mark which obviously you should consider. A person tells lies to the police and then says, but what I have said here in Court is true.” He gave evidence … he did not have to give any evidence. Since he chose to give evidence it is for you to scrutinise his evidence and give careful consideration to it. 
        
       
      
    45 In this context it was appropriate for his Honour to make the comments which he did. The direction would not have led the jury to evaluate the appellant’s evidence in a way which was impermissible. Accordingly I would dismiss this ground of appeal.  
     
      
       
      Ground Three – The directions on the manner in which the jury might use evidence that the appellant had told lies were inadequate. 
       
      
    46 The Crown, in cross-examination and in addressing the jury, advanced the proposition that the appellant’s lies were evidence of the appellant’s consciousness of guilt. 
     
      
    47 His Honour directed the jury as to lies in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        Generally it could be said telling lies damages the credibility of the person who tells them, but you must remember that there are many reasons that people tell lies. Sometimes panic can be a reason or fear or confusion or wanting to distance himself from events … his telling of lies may have been because of fear of Mr Raha. If you think that that is a reasonable possibility, then you should not hold against him that he told lies to the police. However if you don’t think that was a reasonable possibility you are entitled to give serious consideration of whether you think the evidence he gave was the evidence of a credible witness and that goes of course back to the very important first test in the duress area of a genuine belief. He was not a credible witness you might have difficulty in accepting that he had a genuine fear of anything.  
        
       
       
        
        He has no onus of proving anything. The Crown must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. Even if you consider there are doubts about his credibility it does not necessarily mean the Crown has proved its case. So you may think, well I am not sure about his credibility. I do not think very highly about someone who just tells lies to the police. Nevertheless I will look carefully of every aspect of this case before I come to any certain conclusion that might be against him. 
        
       
      
    48 The appellant submitted that where the Crown had clearly suggested in cross-examination and address that the fact that an accused had told lies entitled a finding that there was on his part a consciousness of guilt, a direction should be given to the jury in the terms set out in Zoneff v The Queen (2000) 200 CLR 234. His Honour had failed to do so. 
     
      
    49 However the Zoneff direction is only appropriate in cases where the Crown was not relying upon lies as evidence of guilt. In cases where lies are being relied upon as evidence of consciousness of guilt it is appropriate to give a direction in accordance with Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193 where at 210 it was held: 
     
      
       
        
        Thus, in any case where a lie is relied upon to prove guilt, the lie should be precisely identified, as should the circumstances and events that are said to indicate that it constitutes an admission against interest. And the jury should be instructed that they may take the lies into account only if they are satisfied, having regard to those circumstances and events, that it reveals a knowledge of the offence or some aspect of it and that it was told because the accused knew the truth of the matter about which he lied would implicate him in the offence, or, as was said in  
        Reg v Lucas,  
        because of “a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth.” 
        
       
       
        
        Moreover the jury should be instructed that there may be reasons for the telling of the lie apart from the realisation of guilt. 
        
       
      
    50 Although his Honour’s direction did not employ the precise language of Edwards the effect of it was appropriate. Error has not been demonstrated.  
     
      
       
       
      
     
     
      
       
      Ground Four – The learned trial judge erred in his direction to the jury as to how they could treat evidence and observations as to the appellant’s distress.  
       
      
    51 The appellant’s evidence was that he was in fear of Mr Raha at the time of the offence and subsequently and this was manifested by the display of distress on his part.  
     
      
    52 The Crown cross-examined the appellant to the effect that he exhibited no apparent signs of distress at his place of work following the occurrence of the offence, in telephone conversations with Mr Raha which had been intercepted and in his interview with police until he appreciated the extent of the evidence assembled against him and that the distress displayed by him was not the result of fear of Mr Raha but the fear of the devastating effect of conviction on his family.  
     
      
    53 The appellant throughout much of the trial sat behind his counsel sobbing. He sobbed most of the time whilst in the witness box. It was not suggested by the Crown that this display of distress was false, rather it was submitted it stemmed from his concerns as to the effect on his family should he be convicted. 
     
      
    54 The appellant has submitted the jury was not given directions warning them not to engage in consciousness of guilt reasoning or that they should not reason that the accused was giving false evidence as it was in his interest not to be convicted of the crime. 
     
      
    55 His Honour in respect of the appellant sobbing during the Trial directed the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        The accused himself, throughout much of the Trial to my observation, sat behind his counsel sobbing. The accused in the witness box sobbed most of the time. It is very unusual in Australia to see men sobbing, particularly for great lengths of time, but you must not hold that against him, the fact that he is sobbing. That is his personality and the way he presents himself here is the way he is. The fact that he sobs should not make you feel sorry for him or thinking that you should do something to help him. Nor should it make you have contempt for him because you do not think highly of men who sob. You have to separate the sobbing from the evidence and what he says and what is said about him. That is a very important thing … 
         
        On one view of it the accused might be regarded as coming over to the jury as a person who is rather cowardly … that however may be a false impression, you have got to think carefully about it, the fact that he is crying and being upset. It may also have something to do with the stress of this case. Stress of course can cause emotion in many people. But if you come to the conclusion that he was someone who seemed himself to lack courage, he just seemed to be easily dominated, that does not itself satisfy the test of duress. 
        
       
      
    56 In my opinion, these directions were adequate.  
     
      
       
      Ground Five – The learned trial judge erred in his directions to the jury on the use they could make of evidence of the appellant’s good character  
       
      
    57 The appellant had no prior convictions. Evidence was given at the trial by the appellant and a number of witnesses as to his good character. 
     
      
    58 His Honour directed the jury that the evidence of good character could be taken into account in relation to credibility and in relation to, “assessing whether it is likely he would commit such a serious offence as this.” He also told the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        You give good character evidence such weight as you think fit, but I have got to tell you that there are people of good character who do commit crimes. Obviously enough, until such a person commits his first crime, he is regarded as a good character and there are many even prominent people in our community who until they are convicted are regarded as people of good character. 
        
       
       
      His Honour then gave some examples of the latter and concluded: 
       
       
        
        However, taking all that into account, evidence of good character is certainly something which could be said to be strongly in favour of any person who comes to Court facing trial. 
        
       
      
    59 The appellant submitted his Honour erred: 
     
      
       
        
        a) In not directing the jury in the terms of  
        Attwood v The Queen  
        (1960) 102 CLR 353 at 359 that evidence of good character, if accepted, can be taken into account as making it unlikely that he committed the crime charged. 
        
       
       
        
        b) That the suggestion that every criminal was a person of good character at one stage of his/her life tended to induce the jury to attach less importance to the evidence of good character than it was entitled to receive.  
        
       
      
    60 A person may be regarded as of good character until he commits his first crime and it is not inappropriate for a judge to allude to this fact. The question is rather, whether the summing up, as a whole, was unfair to the appellant. In my opinion it was not.  
     
      
    61 His Honour said of the character witnesses: 
     
      
       
        
        But the point about it all is really that they are saying they regard him as someone with character. They know in some way or other he is mixed up in a serious criminal matter. They find it difficult to believe that he could be because the person that they know is an honest and upright individual, a fond family member, a church-goer, a decent and honest member of the community. 
        
       
      
    62 Although the precise language in Attwood was not used the direction given by his Honour met the purpose for which it and similar decisions are authority. 
     
      
    63 In any event the appellant was represented by experienced and competent Counsel at the trial. Whilst Counsel sought some variation of the directions as to good character proposed by his Honour in his written directions he did not take any objection of the type now made, presumably because he detected no error or unfairness in his Honour’s directions in this regard. 
     
      
    64 As a result of the failure to take the point at the trial leave is required (Criminal Appeal Rules rule 4). I would refuse leave in the circumstances. 
    Sentence65 The appellant relies upon four grounds in support of the application for leave to appeal against sentence.  
     
      
      Ground 1 - The learned judge erred in his findings as to the test to be applied in relation to duress by rejecting duress as a matter having no significance in the sentencing proceedings. 
       
      
    66 Appellant’s counsel at the sentencing hearing submitted his Honour should sentence the appellant on the basis that although he was guilty, nevertheless his will was overborne, and the verdict was given on the basis either the jury did not think that he had an explanation for not going to the police or that he was not a person of reasonable fortitude. 
     
      
    67 On the application for leave to appeal on sentence the appellant relied upon the above submission. Alternatively it was submitted that the sentencing judge expressed questions two and three in purely objective terms and that the findings on sentence rejecting duress were in error owing to his Honour’s reliance on an application of these fundamentally erroneous tests. 
     
      
    68 However his Honour determined the question of duress by reference to question one not to questions two or three. Question one is a purely subjective test. His Honour held he was unable to accept that the jury convicted the appellant on either of the bases suggested by his Counsel. He held the jury was correct to reject duress, there was no satisfactory basis for accepting that the appellant was under any pressure or any threat of any kind whatsoever, and that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant became involved in the venture voluntarily. 
     
      
    69 In R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 this Court held at 378: 
     
      
       
        
        Subject to certain constraints, it is the duty of the judge to determine the facts relevant to sentencing. Some of these facts will have emerged in evidence at the trial; others may only emerge in the course of the sentencing proceedings. The fixing of an appropriate sentence ordinarily involves an exercise of judicial discretion, and it is for the judge to find the facts which are material to that exercise of discretion … The primary constraint upon the power and duty of decision making referred to above is that the view of the facts adopted by the judge for purposes of sentencing must be consistent with the verdict of the jury. 
        
       
      
    70 The view of the facts adopted by his Honour for the purpose of sentencing was open to him and was consistent with the verdict of the jury. It was reached by his Honour after an analysis of the evidence and with particular regard to his observations of the appellant’s demeanour. Furthermore the appellant’s submission that the tests as to questions two and three expressed by his Honour were erroneous is not accepted for the reasons which appear earlier in this judgment. Accordingly this ground is rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 - The learned judge erred in the application of s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and in making findings as to aggravating factors for the purpose of sentence. 
       
      
    71 His Honour, in his remarks on sentence, said: 
     
      
       
        
        Aggravating factors that are specifically referred to in s 21A in the current context are that the principal crime itself was a violent offence. The offender abused a position of trust. It was a planned criminal activity. 
        
       
      
    72 The reference to “violent offence” was presumably a reference to Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 s 21A(2)(b) namely, “the offence involved the actual threat and use of violence.” It was submitted by the appellant and conceded by the Crown that this factor refers to violence to the person not to property. As there was no violence to the person involved in the offence it was accepted his Honour should not have taken this aspect into account as an aggravating feature. 
     
      
    73 The reference to “planned criminal act” is presumably a reference to s 21A(2)(n) – “The offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity.” 
     
      
    74 The appellant submitted the case against him was that he was an accessory before the fact by virtue of assisting or abetting the criminal enterprise in the planning stages, the planning activity was thus an element of proving the offence against the appellant and, as it was an element of the offence, additional regard could not be had to it in sentencing as to do so would involve the double counting prohibited by the concluding words of s 21A(2) – R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193 at [22]. 
     
      
    75 It was submitted by the Crown that it was appropriate for his Honour to consider the degree of the planning and organisation when determining the level of the appellant’s misconduct. However that may be his Honour, in simply stating, “it was a planned criminal activity” did not embark upon any such consideration nor is it apparent to what extent this consideration, if at all, impacted upon the ultimate sentence. In my opinion it would be unproductive to pursue this issue as the effect of a somewhat higher degree of planned criminal activity would have no noticeable effect on sentence.  
     
      
       
      Ground 3 - The learned trial judge erred in his assessment of the applicant’s criminality and  
       
      Ground 4 - A lesser sentence is warranted in law. 
       
      
    76 His Honour made the following findings positive to the appellant: 
     
      
       
        
        a) Before his involvement in this matter (the appellant) could only be regarded as a man of good character and a man who worked hard. Anybody viewing him on what was known of his activities would conclude that he was a hard working man who had a good public service job and a career with the possibility of future advancement. He attended Church regularly and was close to members of his extended family. He has close family members who have spoken well of him.  
        
       
       
        
        b) The appellant did not have a criminal record. 
        
       
       
        
        c) It is probable the appellant will not get involved in criminal activity again. He is young and there are thus very good chances of rehabilitation. These factors constitute special circumstances. 
        
       
       
        
        d) The appellant instructed his counsel not to put the Crown to strict proof of issues other than duress, this resulted in a saving of time and expense which can be taken into account in assessing sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        e) The appellant was prepared to offer assistance to the authorities by giving evidence against Mr Raha. Mr Raha ultimately pleaded guilty. It was quite unclear what the value of the appellant’s assistance might be. It was to be treated as being some evidence of remorse and as indicating he should perhaps get a lesser sentence than he otherwise would get. 
        
       
      
    77 His Honour made the following findings adverse to the appellant: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          a) The jury was correct to reject duress. There was no satisfactory basis for accepting he was under any pressure or any threat of any kind whatsoever. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          b) there was nothing in the appellant’s background which would explain anything which would mitigate the offence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          c) The function of AGAL inter alia was to manufacture drugs of addiction in order to create samples which were almost totally pure. The samples were used for drug testing in other government laboratories throughout Australia. They were used inter alia for the forensic testing of drugs seized by police from drug importers and dealers, the theft of the safe containing the near pure drugs caused considerable delay in remanufacturing samples thus interfering with the criminal justice system.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          d) The thieves were in a position to make very significant sums of money from the sale of the drugs. The sale of the drugs onto the streets created further criminal activities.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          e) The theft could not have got off the ground if the appellant had not added his willing support to it.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          f) The appellant’s actions involved a gross betrayal of trust by him. He was aware of this and that the theft would sabotage the work of the laboratory and put the drugs into the illegal market place. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          g) The principal crime was a violent offence. It was a planned criminal activity. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          h) Those who engage in commercial criminal activities of this kind are deserving of the imposition of penalties of a most severe type. 
          
         
        
       
      
    78 His Honour inter alia made the following comments in determining sentence: 
     
      
       
        
         
        a) The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years. It is rarely given. 
         
         
        b) Statistically the maximum sentence given normally, and then only rarely, is something in the order of 7 years. 
         
         
        c) This particular crime is in a category where a much greater head sentence was warranted.  
         
         
        d) I intend to give in the head sentence allowance for his previous good character and the positive matters that I have mentioned. I also have found special circumstances and I intend to make allowance for that. 
         
         
        e) I had considered whether I should regard this as a crime of the worst type and whether that would require me to sentence him to 14 years imprisonment. However I think his role is less than that of Raha although not a great deal less. 
        
       
      
    79 His Honour made no reference to the guideline judgment in R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 in his remarks on sentence. The appellant submitted an examination of Ponfield shows that the seriousness of an offence of break enter and steal is enhanced if other factors, a selection of which were included in the submission, were present. As none of the factors selected by the appellant were present in this case the appellant submitted the case lacked several of the aggravating elements which would render it in or approaching the worst category for offences of this kind. 
     
      
    80 However the factors listed from Ponfield by the appellant were incomplete, making no reference to factors included in the Ponfield guidelines such as: 
     
      
       
        
        (ii) The offence is the result of professional planning, organisation and execution. 
        
       
       
        
        (viii) The value of the stolen property to the victim, whether that value is measured in terms of money or in terms of sentimental value 
        
       
      
    81 Nor was reference made in the appellant’s submission to the adoption and endorsement by Grove J, with whom Spigelman CJ and Sully J agreed, at [45] of the observation of Lord Bingham CJ in R v Brewster (1998) I Cr App R 220 at 225: 
     
      
       
        
        The seriousness of the offence can vary almost infinitely from case to case. It may involve an impulsive act involving an object of little value (reaching through a window to take a bottle of milk, or stealing a can of petrol from an outhouse). At the other end of the spectrum it may involve a professional, planned organisation, directed at objects of high value. 
        
       
       
      Grove J regarded this observation as, “entirely pertinent to offences contrary to s 112 of the  
      Crimes Act 
      ”. 
       
      
    82 In my opinion the principal offence was at the upper end of the spectrum of break enter and steal under the Crimes Act 1900 s 112(1). The criminality of the appellant though less than that of the principal offender, was nevertheless significant. 
     
      
    83 However the comments of Grove J in Ponfield at [19] must be borne in mind. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        Whilst the maximum sentence for an offence is always a relevant consideration in the exercise of the sentencing discretion a particular difficulty arises in this respect with s 112. The offence is expressed in terms of breaking and entering and then committing a felony. In the normal course the relevant felony is stealing, however it need not be. There are many other felonies which, at least in theory could be the subject of a charge under s 112 and which are more serious then stealing. It would be unusual where such a felony had been committed for the Crown not to proceed with charges for that felony, which in many cases would carry a penalty greater then the fourteen years for which s 112 provides. Nevertheless, the fact that s 112 does, in terms, apply to the full range of felonies renders the maximum less than usually useful as an indicator for sentencing where the felony involved in a particular case is not one of the more serious felonies. 
        
       
      
    84 I agree with his Honour, the sentencing judge, that this is a serious offence. However I am unable to agree that the criminality was such as to justify a starting point close to 14 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    85 The appellant submitted:  
     
      
       
        
        … the sentence imposed failed to reflect the applicant’s prior good character, lack of prior convictions, remorse and his Honour’s positive finding that he was unlikely to re-offend, that he had demonstrated a willingness to facilitate the administration of justice by his instructions to counsel to run the trial “economically”, that he had offered to assist the authorities in the prosecution of others, he was remorseful and had good prospects of rehabilitation. A lesser sentence was warranted in law in accordance with s 6(3) of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act 
         1912. 
        
       
      
    86 His Honour expressly stated he took the above matters into account in the head sentence and also took into account special circumstances in determining the non parole period. The non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months was indicative that these special circumstances were taken into account to a significant extent. However the impact of the factors referred to above on the head sentence is not so apparent. 
     
      
    87 In my opinion the criminality of the appellant was high for the reasons stated by his Honour (save for his comments recorded in paragraph [76(g)] which I leave out of account). However, it was less than that of the principal. There were a number of factors favourable to the appellant. Regard must also be had to the comments of Grove J in Ponfield as to the breadth of s 112(1) and to the pattern of sentencing referred to by the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    88 In my opinion the appropriate sentence is one of 7 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 4 years and 6 months. 
     
      
       
       
      Orders 
       
      
    89 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Appeal as to conviction dismissed. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Leave to appeal on sentence granted. 
        
       
       
        
        3. Appeal on sentence upheld. 
        
       
       
        
        4. Sentence quashed. In lieu thereof the appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years commencing on 3 September 2004 and expiring on 2 September 2011 with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months commencing on 3 September 2004 and expiring on 2 March 2009. 
        
       
      
    90 ROTHMAN J: I agree with Hislop J.

      2005/1094 - REGINA v Faheem Khalid LODHI 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT - - On cross-examination of accused in relation to asserted deliberately misleading material in exhibit “VV”; see p 1034 of transcript. 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: A contentious issue has arisen between the Crown and the defence in relation to an area of questioning raised in the cross-examination of the accused. 
     
      
    2 The Crown has taken the accused to a job application he made to the firm of Thomson Adsett Architects. This document is in evidence and, as I recall it, is part of exhibit “VV”. 
     
      
    3 The background to the questions the Crown now wants to ask arise out of relatively extensive cross-examination that has occurred yesterday afternoon and this morning in relation to asserted untruths in exhibit “S1” and exhibit “OO”. 
     
      
    4 In relation to these documents, the accused has insisted before the jury that he did not intend to hide his true identity and that, to the extent that it might seem that he has, he says that these entries were just mistakes or misunderstandings of one kind or another on his part. So, it is against that background that the Crown turns to the job application. 
     
      
    5 The Crown wants to put to the witness that in preparing this apparently carefully written document details of the accused's work experience between June 2000 and June 2002, there is deliberately misleading material, that is, material that would have led his potential employer to assume that he had been full-time employed with Ausko World Constructions in that period of approximately two years here in Australia. The truth is that for about 13 months of that time, the accused worked in Pakistan, although, as Mr Boulten SC correctly points out, he was working in one way or another in Pakistan during this time as an architect. 
     
      
    6 The issue which arises here requires an examination of the credibility rule and the exception to it in s 103 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    7 The starting point I think is s 55 of the Evidence Act which provides that evidence is relevant in the proceedings being evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect directly or indirectly the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceedings. 
     
      
    8 Sub-section (2) of s 55 provides that, in particular, evidence is not taken to be irrelevant only because it relates only to the credibility of a witness. So evidence that goes to credibility may be relevant in a particular trial, but only if it satisfies sub-s (1), that is to say, it is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect directly or indirectly the assessment of the probability of a fact in issue. 
     
      
    9 I am prepared to find that this material that the Crown wishes to raise does satisfy the relevancy hurdle. Nevertheless, the situation is very much then affected by s 102 of the Evidence Act. That section says evidence that is relevant only to a witness's credibility is not admissible. 
     
      
    10 Section 103 contains the exception that has been the subject of principal debate in the proceedings here this morning. This is critical to the outcome of the matter. 
     
      
    11 Section 103 states: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in cross-examination of a witness if the evidence has substantial probative value. 
         
         
        (2) Without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard in deciding whether the evidence has substantial probative value, it is to have regard to: 
         
         
        (a) whether the evidence tends to prove that the witness knowingly or recklessly made a false representation when the witness was under an obligation to tell the truth, and 
         
         
        (b) the period that has elapsed since the acts or events to which the evidence relates were done or occurred.” 
        
       
      
    12 The critical question is whether the evidence the Crown seeks to adduce is evidence that has substantial probative value. The expression “probative value” is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act although the definition is not of direct application 
     
      
    13 In Regina v RPS (NSWCCA, unreported, 13 August 1997) the meaning of the words ""substantial probative value"" in s 103(1) was considered. Hunt CJ at CL stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 103 of the  
        Evidence Act 
         limits cross-examination as to credit to adducing evidence which has 'substantial probative value'. The 'probative value' of evidence is defined in the s 3 Dictionary as meaning 'the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue', but both the context in which that phrase appears and the subject matter of s 103 indicate that that definition does not apply. 
        
       
       
        
        That is made clear by the terms of sub-s (2), which demonstrate that the evidence must have probative value in relation to the credit of the witness. Evidence adduced in cross-examination must therefore have substantial probative value in the sense that it could rationally affect the assessment of the credit of the witness. 
        
       
       
        
        Such an interpretation accords with the intention of the Law Reform Commission. 
        
       
       
        
        The addition of the word 'substantial' nevertheless imposes a limitation upon the common law, when almost anything was allowed upon the issue of credit unless it clearly had no material weight whatsoever upon that issue. That limitation is an important one.” 
        
       
      
    14 The Crown correctly pointed to the remarks of Hunt CJ at CL in this passage to which I have referred where his Honour had said that the word ""substantial"" imposes a limitation upon the common law and that limitation, I agree, is an important one. 
     
      
    15 What, then, is the import of the word ""substantial"" where it appears in s 103? In my opinion, the word ""substantial"", when used in relation to the probative value of the evidence in s 103(1), should be contrasted with the use of the word ""significant"" in relation to the probative value of evidence to be admitted under s 97(1) as an exception to the tendency rule. It has been held for the purpose of this subsection that ""significant"" means ""important"" or ""of consequence"", and before evidence can be admitted under that provision, it must be more than merely relevant. It may have less than a substantial degree of relevance; (see Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457 at 459). 
     
      
    16 In Fowler (SCNSW, Dowd J, 6 May 1997), his Honour held that evidence would be admitted under s 103(1) if it had a real persuasive bearing on the reliability of the witness, although I take his Honour to have been in fact referring to credibility. 
     
      
    17 The word ""substantial"" is a word that should be given its full import, in my view. 
     
      
    18 It seems to me that before evidence can have substantial probative value in respect of the credit of a witness, it must have such potential to affect the jury's assessment of the credit of the witness in respect of the evidence he or she has given that the credit of the witness cannot be determined adequately without regard to it. If the probative value of the evidence can be any less than this, there does not appear to me to be any real distinction between the terms ""significant probative value"" and ""substantial probative value"" as they are used in the Act. 
     
      
    19 To my mind, there must be such a connection between the evidence to be admitted and the credit of the witness at the time of giving the evidence that the former is likely to affect the latter in a substantial way. That seems to me to be the import of the matters set out in s 103(2) to which the Court must have regard when determining whether the evidence is of sufficient probative value so as to justify admission, notwithstanding the credibility rule. 
     
      
    20 Those matters set out in sub-ss 2(a) and (b) in s 103 are not the only matters the Court may take into account when determining whether to admit the evidence, but they do highlight the fact there must be a real correlation between the evidence to be admitted and the credit of the witness. In addition, they are reliable indications as to the type of evidence that will satisfy the statutory hurdle. 
     
      
    21 There are perhaps two other matters that might have a relevance, although I do not think that they do in the present matter. First, one always needs to bear in mind the provisions of ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act. I don't think any issue arises under those sections in the present matter. 
     
      
    22 Secondly, I think it is always important to bear in mind that the credibility rule is concerned to a significant extent with preventing a situation from arising where issues that are essentially side issues may tend to sidetrack the tribunal of fact, that is the jury in this case, from the real issues in the proceedings. 
     
      
    23 That brings me then to really the nub of the arguments. The Crown concedes, and I think very fairly so, that not every lie that is told has substantial probative value. Far from it. We are all familiar with little white lies that are told, sometimes to get people out of an embarrassing situation, sometimes even to avoid hurting or confronting other people. Those sort of lies stand at one end of the spectrum. At the other end, there are the types of lies that are envisaged in sub-s 2 of s 103 of the Evidence Act. I gave an example during the course of the argument that seems to me to have some substance: where, for example, a person may fill out the form required for the provision of a pension or social services and, in that form, make deliberately false and misleading statements, in circumstances where if the truth were told the person would not be entitled to the pension or social benefit concerned. Such a lie stands at the opposite end of the spectrum. 
     
      
    24 The question which arises here is, what are we really dealing with? The Crown categorises the statements in the job application form as statements which would be considered very important by the potential employer and such a potential employer would expect an applicant for a job to be scrupulously honest in relation to matters such as work experience. 
     
      
    25 Mr Boulten, on the other hand, says that, as the evidence shows, the applicant was working as a project manager for a building company during part of the relevant two year period and he left that job because he was not entirely satisfied with it. He went back to Pakistan and in fact worked as an architect on several projects there for over a year. So Mr Boulten says that the probative value is really less in the present context because the lie, if it be a lie, is simply one of telling an employer that he was fully employed as a project manager in Sydney when the truth was that he was working as an architect in Pakistan. 
     
      
    26 The submissions I have outlined show how very close to the border this particular matter stands. It is possible to view the statements in the job application in the way the Crown puts them and the way Mr Boulten has put them. But, in my view, they do ultimately fall on the side of the line, perhaps only just so, advocated by the Crown and I am prepared to find that they are matters which would have a substantial probative value. 
     
      
    27 The starting point in my reasoning is the assumption, which I think is proper to make for the purposes of the section, that a lie was involved in the format of the material in Exhibit “VV”. It is true, as Mr Boulten argued, that there may be an explanation for the lie which will rob the credit issue of its sting. But for the purposes of the ruling, I think it is appropriate to assume, as I have said, that the material was an untrue representation. Secondly, I agree with the Crown that a potential employer would consider it important that a potential employee should provide truthful information about his or her past working experience. Thirdly, this is particularly so in the case of a qualified and registered architect whose professional standards should be beyond reproach. Fourthly, the accused has put himself forward as a person of high religious standards and a person who struggles for inner perfection and moral virtue. 
     
      
    28 I think that credibility is very much in issue in this trial and the question which arises is: Does the fact that the accused has told a lie, if that be the fact, about his work experience in the written document I have identified carry with it the type of probative value that I have identified as being necessary under s 103? For the reasons I have given, I conclude that it does, although I should say that it perhaps passes that hurdle, by a relatively small margin. I am prepared to allow the Crown to ask the question.

      JUDGMENT  
        
      - on application re evidence via video-link with Pakistan; see page 770 of transcript 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: An application has been made on behalf of the accused. The nature of the application makes it necessary to consider s 39A of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. 
     
      
    2 The background to the present matter is an earlier application made by the accused under s 15YV of the Crimes Act (Commonwealth) for an order that the evidence of certain witnesses who are in Pakistan be taken by way of audio visual link. Although I have not made formal orders to that effect, I have indicated that it is my intention to do so, and I have also indicated my general satisfaction that the matters required under the audio link legislation to which I have made reference have been satisfied. The Crown Prosecutor several days later, indicated that information had come into his possession making it clear that Pakistan, in determining whether to allow its citizens to give evidence in the trial, require a “Mutual Assistance” request from the Commonwealth of Australia. This official attitude in turn, led to the making of the application for a Certificate under the “Mutual Assistance” legislation. 
     
      
    3 The basis of the present application emerges from the proposition advanced on behalf of the accused that it is necessary and in the interests of justice that the evidence be taken in Pakistan, and that it is as a consequence in the interests of justice for the Attorney-General to make an application for mutual assistance to the Pakistani authorities. 
     
      
    4 The legislation requires the Court, if it is considering issuing a Certificate, to take into account a number of matters. They are matters that must be taken into account. The legislation also enables the Court to take into account any other matter that it considers appropriate in coming to a conclusion that it is in the interests of justice for the Attorney-General to make a request under the relevant section of the Act. 
     
      
    5 I am satisfied in general terms with each of the matters set out in the legislation. I shall briefly state my reason. As to the first, whether Pakistan is likely to grant the request, of course it would be presumptuous of me to make a categorical finding in that regard but I do, from all of the material that has been shown to me, find that there is no reason to suppose other than the request would be granted. 
     
      
    6 As to the second matter, it is necessary to consider the extent to which the material would not otherwise be available. Strictly speaking, this may not require consideration to be given as to whether the evidence is by video-link or not, but it seems to me that, in any event, the material would not otherwise be available because of a combination of factors; those include the age of the accused's father Khalid Khan Lodhi, the business interests of other witnesses, and the obvious expense and difficulty for this group of people from Pakistan to be brought to Australia. By contrast, the taking of their evidence in Pakistan by way of video-link will be much less expensive and much less disruptive to their lives. In the case of the accused's father, it is possibly unlikely that he would be able to come to Australia, in any event, because of his age and health. In addition, there is no other source in Australia from which the evidence may come. 
     
      
    7 Mr Boulten, senior counsel for the accused, has described in brief terms the basis on which the material is said to be probative, and I am satisfied that it is both probative and on the face of it admissible in the proceedings. These are the third and fourth considerations. Moreover, I am satisfied that the Court would be likely to admit the evidence in the proceedings. I have not heard the evidence in detail, and of course the Crown may have some objection to some part of it, but in general terms I think I may safely say I am satisfied of those two matters that arise under sub-sections (c) and (d) of s 39A. 
     
      
    8 The nature of the evidence is threefold. First, to assist the accused in proving that he was in fact interested in importing to and exporting from Pakistan certain materials of a chemical and electrical nature. These materials are likely to be consistent with some of the materials referred to in the evidence the Crown relies upon to prove that the accused was engaged in carrying out acts in preparation for a terrorist act within the meaning of the legislation in the Criminal Code Act. Secondly, there will be evidence to suggest that the accused is a person of good character. Thirdly, there is evidence to suggest that the accused is not and has not been a member of the Lashkar-e-Taiba organisation, and that he has had no involvement with that organisation. 
     
      
    9 This brief statement of the nature of the evidence to be led from the five witnesses, in one form or another and to one degree or another, makes it plain why the evidence is probative in the proceedings. 
     
      
    10 The final matter under the legislation is that I have to be satisfied in relation to the issue as to whether the defendant would be unfairly prejudiced if the material were not available in the trial. That seems to me in the light of the nature of the material I have identified, to be a self-evident fact. I am positively satisfied that the defendant would be unfairly prejudiced if the material were not available. 
     
      
    11 Mr Boulten has also suggested that I am entitled to take into account my preliminary views about whether an order should be made under s 15Y of the Crimes Act (Commonwealth) for the taking of evidence by way of video-link, and I accept that this is an appropriate matter to take into account. 
     
      
    12 The Crown has not raised any objection to the certification that is sought on behalf of the accused, and the Attorney-General, who has been given notice of the application, does not wish to be heard. 
     
      
    13 In those circumstances, I certify that it is in the interests of justice for the Attorney-General to make a request to Pakistan under part 2 of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 that evidence be taken in Pakistan and broadcast to Australia via video-link from the following witnesses for the purposes of the criminal trial of Faheem Khalid Lodhi: Sameer Khan Lodhi, Khalid Khan Lodhi, Arif Amanullah, Majed Khan and Athar Saeed. 
     
      
    14 I have been provided with a form of certificate by Mr Boulten on behalf of the accused and I have now signed that document and dated it 12 May 2006. 
     
      
    15 I would respectfully request that the Attorney-General recognise the urgency of the situation in relation to the making of a request to the Pakistani government, and I would also respectfully suggest that it be brought to the attention of the Pakistani authorities that, if it be at all possible, those authorities act with a degree of urgency in responding to the application. The reason for that is that we are at a point in the trial of the accused where the Crown case will shortly be closed and where the accused's case will begin. It would be potentially very disruptive to the trial if any substantial delay were to occur in relation to the availability of these witnesses for the accused. It is in those circumstances that I repeat my respectful requests to both the Australian government and the government and authorities in Pakistan that the matter be dealt with urgently and with all possible expedition.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Donald Richard Maxwell appears for sentence today having pleaded guilty to one offence of carrying on a financial services business without holding an Australian Financial Services licence. The maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for two years. 2 Mr Maxwell became involved with some developers known as the Bell Development Group and the Central Development Group. They were developing a number of properties. They wished to have investors provide money to them. The offender agreed to act as an intermediary between potential investors and the developers. He set up a business and placed advertisements in newspapers, soliciting investments. A number of people responded to those investments. Through the efforts of the offender substantial amounts of money were invested with the developers. The offender was paid a commission on the funds invested. Most of the money invested by those people was lost.3 The amount of money invested through the offender was significant, totalling more than a million dollars. The offender received a substantial commission for his work in obtaining those investments. None of the principal of the money invested by any of the three people referred to in the agreed statement of facts has been repaid.4 It is important in assessing the criminality of the offender’s conduct to bear in mind the relationship between the loss suffered by the investors and the offence. This is not a case where the offender, through fraud or deception, persuaded people to invest in something that he knew to be a dodgy investment. In fact he himself invested some of his own money, and lost it as well. 5 The investors were encouraged by the appearance of things being above board. One investor, Mr McGregor, asked if the offender had a licence, to which he replied, “You don’t need to worry about that.” Mr Sollner, another investor, believed the offender to be qualified. Mr Moore says that if he knew that the offender was not licensed it would have made a difference to his decision as to whether to invest his money in the investments with the developers. Thus, the investors believed that the offender was operating above board, but in fact he was carrying on business, as is recognised by his plea of guilty, without a licence when he should have had one. 6 A licensee is required to do a number of things. Those are set out in s 912A of the Corporations Act. Also of relevance is s 912B. It is agreed that if Mr Maxwell had a licence, he would have been obliged to arrange for compensation arrangements under s 912B. It seems therefore that had the offender complied with his obligations it is less likely that the investors would have suffered the loss that they have suffered.7 Of course had Mr Maxwell applied for a licence he may not have got one anyway. One of the purposes of the licensing regime is to ensure that only people of good fame and character are able to hold themselves out as financial advisers. Mr Maxwell was not of good fame and character. In 1999 he was convicted of a number of dishonesty offences. Potential investors who see a person holding themselves out as being a financial adviser are entitled to assume that the person is of good fame and character and has compensation arrangements put in place. That is why, when people such as Mr Maxwell carry on business as financial advisers without being licensed to do so, the offence they commit is a serious one.8 It was said on behalf of Mr Maxwell that he was somewhat ignorant of his obligations to be licensed. The submission was put that he started committing this offence only a short time after the requirement that a financial adviser be licensed was introduced. That submission does not accord with the evidence. Mr Maxwell gave evidence that he was told by a lawyer that he did not need a licence as long as he did not give financial advice. The offender now accepts that he gave financial advice. He seems to suggest that he did not realise that at the time, but I have difficulty with that evidence. Much of what the offender said to Mr McGregor, Mr Moore and Mr Sollner is clearly financial advice and any reasonable definition of that term would encompass a large part of what the offender said to the investors.9 The offender is now sixty nine years of age. He has been married and divorced twice and has children, some of whom provide him with ongoing emotional support. Of course that support has been important since the offender was charged with this offence. 10 From the material provided in the statement of facts and also from a pre-sentence report, it appears that the offender was a builder who entered a period of semi-retirement. He was introduced to the developers and was persuaded to become a consultant to them, obtaining investments as I have described earlier. 11 Mr Pontello submits that it is a mitigating factor that at no stage did the offender knowingly give false advice and that he put his own money in the investment, which tends to indicate that what he was suggesting to the investors was something he truly believed. That is not however a mitigating factor of this offence. It is not a mitigating factor of an offence that the offender did not commit a more serious offence.12 Mr Pontello also submits that the role played by the offender was a reactive one in that there were no high pressure sales tactics and the offender did not target specifically vulnerable people. That appears to be the case. The offender did not target the naïve deliberately. Indeed, because he believed the investments were sound, he did not need to do so.13 It is an aggravating factor of this offence that the offender was on a bond when he committed it, albeit that the bond was in its late stages. I do not consider it is an aggravating factor that the offender was in a position of trust in relation to the three investors, at least not as I understand what the concept of a trust involves. He was more in a position of a salesperson, albeit one that was giving advice.14 The offender pleaded guilty, although it was conceded that this was a late plea. I will recognise that that plea had utilitarian value, and perhaps more appropriately given that this is a Commonwealth offence, demonstrates a willingness to assist in the criminal justice process.15 The Crown submitted that in the case of serious criminal conduct, a full time custodial sentence is appropriate, unless there are exceptional circumstances. Courts have held that full time custodial sentences are appropriate in the absence of exceptional circumstances for a number of offences, in particular, and most well known, for those of commercial drug supply, but I am aware of no authority which suggests that that consideration applies to this type of offence. Indeed, given that the maximum penalty is only two years, I would be most surprised to see a decision along those lines.16 It is not the case that it is up to the offender to demonstrate that a full time custodial sentence is inappropriate. However, the offence was nevertheless serious. The offender knew that he should have been licensed. He knew that his three investors were acting on his advice and the consequence of him not being licensed is, as I have said, that it is more likely that the three investors have suffered the loss they have suffered.17 I am satisfied the offender is remorseful for what he has done. It was never his intention that the investors would suffer any loss at all. Perhaps his main motivation in what he did was to gain a commission, and perhaps because of that he was prepared to advise the investors to invest more with the developers than he would otherwise. But I accept that now that he realises those people have lost their money through his work, he is sorry for what he has done. He has also agreed with ASIC to a pecuniary penalty of $110,000 plus payment of ASIC’s costs of $55,500. It is to be noted that the offender is unlikely to be able to meet those obligations having no assets of any substance and now being on the pension.18 I am satisfied that the offence is of such seriousness, aggravated as I have said by the fact that it was committed while he was on a bond, that a custodial sentence is appropriate. However, I will order that that sentence be served by way of periodic detention. I am satisfied that a head sentence of twelve months is an appropriate sentence which best recognises the need to deter others who may be tempted to operate unlicensed, to punish the offender for what he has done, and which takes into account that the offender is 69 years of age.19 The order I make therefore is this. The offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of twelve months. He is to be released under a recognisance release order after eight months. He is to enter into a bond to be of good behaviour at the end of that eight month period the bond is for 4 months and the surety sum is $100. The offender is to attend the Parramatta Periodic Detention Centre at 8.30am on 27 May 2006 in order to commence serving his sentence of periodic detention.20 Now Mr Maxwell, what I have ordered is a period of imprisonment which will be served by period detention. You have to attend gaol every weekend for a period of eight months or as advised by the Corrective Services authorities. You have to turn up to the Parramatta Periodic Detention Centre on 27 May this year at 8.30am to start serving your sentence. After that you’ll be told what time and what day to attend, probably the Friday evening. At the end of eight months you will no longer have to attend every weekend upon you entering into a bond to be of good behaviour. That bond will last for four months. If you breach that bond, that is if you are not of good behaviour during that period of four months, then the order can be revoked and you can return to custody. If you fail to turn up in the period of eight months every weekend then you can be brought back before this Court and I can make alternative arrangements as to your custody. Do you understand?21 OFFENDER: Yes sir.

    Johnson J 12 May 200611118/06Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Anthony William O’Conner (also known as O’Connor) and Anor 
     
      
       
      
    JUDGMENT 
     
      
    1 JOHNSON J: By Summons filed on 8 March 2006, the Plaintiff, the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW), seeks relief under s.69 Supreme Court Act 1970 arising from a direction made on 8 February 2006 by the Second Defendant, Magistrate Roger Prowse, that a witness be required to attend to give evidence at committal proceedings concerning the First Defendant, Anthony William O’Conner. 
     
      
    2 The Plaintiff seeks, in the alternative, a declaration and relief in the nature of mandamus under s.69 Supreme Court Act 1970 or an order granting leave to appeal under s.57(1)(b) Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (“Appeal and Review Act”) and, if leave is granted, further relief under s.59 Appeal and Review Act.  
     
      
    3 The proceedings relate to a direction under ss.91 and 93 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 made by the Second Defendant at Goulburn Local Court on 8 February 2006 requiring a prosecution witness (whom I will describe as “V”) to attend and give evidence at committal proceedings concerning the First Defendant.  
     
      
       
      The Present Hearing 
       
      
    4 The hearing of the Plaintiff’s Summons commenced before me in the Duty Judge list on 1 May 2006. Mr Arnott SC appeared for the Plaintiff, Mr Siva of Counsel appeared for the First Defendant. In accordance with usual practice, a submitting appearance was filed on behalf of the Second Defendant. 
     
      
    5 A number of affidavits were read for the Plaintiff and the First Defendant. Two deponents were cross-examined on their affidavits. The hearing was adjourned until yesterday, 11 May 2006 when submissions were completed. Having formed a concluded view with respect to the matter, it is appropriate that I proceed to judgment. The First Defendant is in custody. The committal proceedings ought proceed without further delay. 
     
      
       
      The Alleged Offences  
       
      
    6 On 15 November 2005, the First Defendant was arrested at Goulburn and charged with six counts of aggravated sexual assault upon V involving a threat to inflict actual bodily harm on V by means of an offensive weapon, a knife, contrary to s.61J(1) Crimes Act 1900. In addition, the First Defendant was charged with robbing V of certain property, being $360.00 in cash and two mobile phones, whilst being armed with an offensive weapon, a knife, contrary to s.97(1) Crimes Act 1900. The alleged offences were said to have been committed at Figtree on 22 May 2005.  
     
      
    7 It is appropriate to refer to the nature of the charges brought against the First Defendant. V was a sex worker who operated from a motel room. She alleges that the First Defendant sexually assaulted her at knife point and stole her money and mobile phones. 
     
      
    8 The prosecution alleges that at about 6.30 pm on Sunday, 22 May 2005, in response to an advertisement inserted in a local newspaper under the “Escorts and Adult Services” section, the First Defendant attended Room 50 in the Sovereign Motel, Figtree, in the Wollongong area. After telling the First Defendant that the cost for her services would be $160.00, it is alleged that the First Defendant handed V the sum of $200.00. When she turned away to get his change, he pulled a knife and pointed it at her stomach, threatening to kill her if she did not comply with his wishes. It is alleged that the First Defendant tied V’s hands behind her back with plastic cable ties and placed silver duct tape around her eyes, mouth and head. Whilst she lay on the bed, he then forced her to fellate him (Charge 1). He then applied lubricant to her vagina and performed vaginal/penile intercourse (Charge 2). When V complained of sore wrists, the First Defendant then tied her hands up with duct tape and cut the plastic cable ties from her wrists. He then forced her to fellate him again (Charge 3), again penetrated her vagina with his penis (Charge 4) and then inserted a dildo into her vagina (Charge 5). At one stage, V states that she felt the blade of a knife between her legs and the point being pushed against her thighs.  
     
      
    9 The final sexual act alleged involved the First Defendant pushing his penis into V’s mouth, again forcing her to fellate him to the point of ejaculation. She was told not to spit out his semen (Count 6).  
     
      
    10 It is alleged that the First Defendant then stole $360.00 in cash from V’s handbag together with two mobile phones. Before leaving the motel room, he warned her to lie face down on the bed for 10 minutes or she would be killed. 
     
      
    11 After the First Defendant left the motel room, V unbound her hands, called the motel manager and the police were contacted. The police arrived at the scene at about 7.30 pm and investigations commenced. 
     
      
    12 The First Defendant was not arrested until six months later, on 15 November 2005. He lived in Victoria and was a construction worker. This involved interstate work and, at the time of the alleged offences, he was working and living in the Wollongong area. The delay in his being charged was due to the fact that he went overseas. He was, in fact, born in Dublin and has a strong Irish accent. When interviewed by police by way of ERISP, the First Defendant denied any involvement in the offences or being at the motel at the time. He did, however, make some admissions which the prosecution contends are significant. 
     
      
    13 When the First Defendant was charged on 15 November 2005, his fingerprints were taken and a buccal swab was taken from him for the purpose of DNA analysis.  
     
      
       
      Proceedings in the Local Court 
       
      
    14 The First Defendant appeared before the Goulburn Local Court on 16 November 2005 and the proceedings were adjourned until 21 December 2005. Bail was refused. 
     
      
    15 The proceedings came before the Second Defendant sitting at Goulburn Local Court on 21 December 2005. On that day, it appears from the evidence that Mr Love, a solicitor from the DPP, appeared as prosecutor and Mr Bartlett, solicitor, appeared for the First Defendant. The Second Defendant directed that the police brief of evidence be served by 25 January 2006 with the matter being listed for election/reply on 8 February 2006. A notation on the bench sheet for that day indicates that the proceedings were adjourned for committal proceedings or application under s.91 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 on 8 February 2006. The First Defendant was directed to serve by 3 February 2006 any written submission in support of an application under s.91 that any prosecution witness be required to attend for cross-examination at the committal proceedings. The First Defendant was again refused bail and the matter was adjourned until 8 February 2006.  
     
      
    16 The evidence before me reveals that a partial prosecution brief of evidence had been served on the First Defendant or his legal representative on 20 December 2005 (Annexure A, Affidavit of Kristine Chapman, 12 April 2006; paragraph 4, Affidavit of Helen Langley, 10 March 2006; paragraph 6, Affidavit of Michael Bartlett, 24 April 2006). Mr Bartlett understood the directions made on 21 December 2005 to mean that the balance of the prosecution brief of evidence was to be served by 25 January 2006 with the First Defendant to reply to that material on 8 February 2006 (paragraph 6, Affidavit of Michael Bartlett, 24 April 2006). 
     
      
    17 I am satisfied, on the totality of the evidence before me, that prior to 3 February 2006, the prosecution had served on the First Defendant’s solicitor the prosecution brief with the exception of certificates relating to DNA analysis and what is described as the SAIK kit results concerning the physical examination of V at Wollongong Hospital. In particular, by that time, the First Defendant’s solicitor had been provided, at least, with the following: 
     
      
       
      (a) statement of Senior Constable Manuel Rosete dated 7 November 2005 - he attended the Sovereign Motel, Figtree on 22 May 2005, made observations of V and took photographs and other investigatory steps and, on 15 November 2005, was involved in the arrest and ERISP interview of the First Defendant and the taking of the buccal swab from him for DNA analysis; 
       
       
      (b) statement of Senior Constable David Turner dated 27 November 2005 - he attended the Sovereign Motel, Figtree on 22 May 2005 with Senior Constable Rosete and made observations of V and the premises; 
       
       
      (c) statement of Sergeant Christopher Francis Taylor dated 22 November 2005 - he was the first police officer to the scene at the Sovereign Motel, Figtree at 7.30 pm on 22 May 2005 and made observations of V and the premises; 
       
       
      (d) statement of Constable Liam Watson dated 6 October 2005 - he attended the Sovereign Motel, Figtree on 22 May 2005 and took possession of certain exhibits; 
       
       
      (e) statement of V dated 22 May 2005 - describing the circumstances leading up to and including the alleged offences committed on her on  
        
      that day; 
       
       
      (f) an ERISP interview between police and the First Defendant at Goulburn Police Station on 15 November 2005 comprising some 272 questions and answers; 
       
       
      (g) certificate of fingerprint analysis dated 22 November 2005 of Detective Sergeant Nicholas John Barrett - with respect to the finding of the 
        
      fingerprints of the First Defendant on items located in room 50 in the 
        
      Sovereign Hotel, Figtree; 
       
       
      (h) statement of Senior Constable Darren Peter Knott dated 26 September 2005 concerning fingerprint examination of duct tape and a glossy black handbag; 
       
       
      (i) 21 photographs of Room 50, Sovereign Motel, Figtree on 22 May 2005 and the contents of that room; 
       
       
      (j) four photographs taken at 8.00 pm on 22 May 2005 depicting V with duct tape still attached to her body. 
       
      
    18 Mr Arnott SC, for the Plaintiff, pointed to the following important features in the prosecution case: 
     
      
       
      (a) immediate complaint by V to the police; 
       
       
      (b) finding by the police of the cable tie in the motel room; 
       
       
      (c) when police arrived at the motel room, not only did V still have the duct tape around her wrists, it was entangled in her hair (photographs of V in this state were taken and included in the prosecution brief), but 
      ,  
      in addition, 
        
      police observed that her hands were noticeably slightly swollen and red from her blood circulation having being restricted; 
       
       
      (d) the First Defendant’s fingerprints were found on a piece of duct tape and on the outside of V’s black glossy handbag; 
       
       
      (e) the First Defendant’s DNA (semen) was found on the oral, pharyngeal and cheek/face smear swabs taken from V; 
       
       
      (f) although the First Defendant denied completely that he was in the room with V or had sexually assaulted and robbed her, he admitted to police 
        
      in the ERISP interview 
        
      being in Wollongong at the time of the offences (ERISP Q/A43-45), using duct tape in the course of his work (Q/A214-5), regularly using the services of sex workers (Q/A87-92, 119-121) and preferring to visit them at their house or motel rather than attend brothels (Q/A96-100). 
       
      
    19 Shortly after 3.30 pm on Friday, 3 February 2006, Mr Bartlett sent by facsimile to Mr Love of the Wollongong Office of the DPP, a written application and written submission seeking that V attend to give evidence at the committal proceedings under ss.91 and 93 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. I shall return to aspects of this submission later in this judgment. 
     
      
    20 On 6 February 2006, advice was sent to the Police Prosecutors at Goulburn by Alison Dunn, Manager Support Services at the Wollongong Office of the DPP that Mr Love, solicitor, would be appearing in the four matters (including the First Defendant’s matter) in which the DPP was a party and which were listed at Goulburn Local Court on 8 February 2006 (paragraph 4, Affidavit, Joanne Meiers, 13 April 2006).  
     
      
    21 On Monday, 6 February 2006, Kristine Chapman, a solicitor in the Wollongong Office of the DPP, received Mr Bartlett’s s.91 application and submissions which had been transmitted by facsimile on the afternoon of 3 February 2006. On 6 February 2006, Ms Chapman attempted to contact Mr Bartlett, but was unsuccessful (paragraph 4, Affidavit, Kristine Chapman, 12 April 2006).  
     
      
    22 On 7 February 2006, Ms Joanne Meiers, a Prosecution Officer, Administration, at the Wollongong office of the DPP, was advised that Mr Love would not be attending Court the following day because he was suffering from a dislocated shoulder (apparently suffered on 6 or 7 February 2006) and was unable to drive a motor vehicle for any long distances. Mr Love verbally advised Ms Meiers of instructions he required to be sent for the matters in his practice which were in the list at Goulburn on 8 February 2006. Ms Meiers then required Ms Chapman to provide instructions in the First Defendant’s matter.  
     
      
    23 Ms Chapman was unable to attend Goulburn Local Court on 8 February 2006 in place of Mr Love as she was appearing in the DPP list at the Wollongong Local Court that day. Accordingly, Ms Chapman gave Ms Meiers instructions to be transmitted to the Goulburn Police Prosecutors. She told Ms Meiers: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have only just got the section 91 submissions so I will need a two-week adjournment. This is a Wollongong matter so can the matter be adjourned to Wollongong Local Court?”  
        
       
       
      Ms Meiers prepared a facsimile which was transmitted to the Goulburn Police Prosecutors at about 3.00 pm on 7 February 2006. That document included the following instructions: 
       
       
        
        “S91 representations from defence received 7/2/06. This office will require two weeks to respond. Matter should be returned to Wollongong LC for hearing. DPP list day at Wollongong is every Wednesday at 11.45 am.” 
        
       
      
    24 Because Mr Love was unable to drive through injury, on 7 February 2006 he wrote to the Registrar at Goulburn Local Court to advise of his non-attendance on 8 February 2006. The letter, which was addressed to the Second Defendant care of the Registrar, was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “I wish to advise the Court that due to a recent injury, I will be unable to attend Goulburn Local Court on Wednesday 8 February 2006. Due to the timing of the injury, there are no solicitors available to attend in my place. As a result, the Police Prosecutor has been asked to appear on behalf of the DPP in the following matters: 
        
       
       
        
        1. Murray Alan FITZSIMMONS H 25812106 
        
       
       
        
        2. Adon John BURNS H 25866762 
        
       
       
        
        3. Joshua Luke SHARWOOD H 25092121;  
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
               
                
                 
                  
                  H 25778708 
                  
                 
                
               
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        4. Anthony William O’CONNER H 270 82082 
        
       
       
        
        I note that a DPP solicitor will be present at Goulburn Local Court on Friday 10 February 2006. Should the DPP be required to appear in any of the above matters, it would be appreciated if the matter could be adjourned to 10 February 2006.” 
        
       
      
    25 The evidence before me reveals that the facsimile transmission of this letter was unsuccessful but that this was not realised at the time. Had this letter been received, the course of events on 8 February 2006 may have been altered significantly. An explanation was provided in the letter to the Court that an adjournment was needed due to a recent injury to Mr Love and that no other DPP solicitor was available to attend Goulburn Local Court in his place on 8 February 2006. It was noted that a DPP solicitor would be present at that Court on Friday 10 February 2006 and stated that, if the DPP was required to appear in any of the four stated matters (including the First Defendant’s matter), it was requested that the matter be adjourned to 10 February 2006. However, this letter was not received at the Goulburn Local Court.  
     
      
    26 On 7 February 2006, Ms Chapman attempted to contact Mr Bartlett and left a message for him to contact her. On 8 February 2006, when Ms Chapman arrived at work, there was a voicemail message from Mr Bartlett returning her call.  
     
      
    27 Ms Chapman rang Mr Bartlett at about 8.40 am on 8 February 2006. At that time, Mr Bartlett was driving to the Goulburn Courthouse. Affidavits of Ms Chapman and Mr Bartlett have been read in these proceedings and both were cross-examined before me. Although there is some difference in detail as to their recollections of the telephone conversation, there is, in my view, no dispute as to the substance. Ms Chapman indicated that she had recently received Mr Bartlett’s s.91 application and submission and that the prosecution would seek an adjournment for two weeks. Ms Chapman informed Mr Bartlett that Mr Love was injured and could not travel to Goulburn and thus Ms Chapman had been allocated the matter. Ms Chapman informed Mr Bartlett that the s.91 application was opposed and that an adjournment was needed by the prosecution to respond to the application. Mr Bartlett indicated that he would oppose the adjournment application.  
     
      
       
      The Hearing on 8 February 2006 
       
      
    28 In due course, on Wednesday 8 February 2006, the First Defendant’s matter was called on before the Second Defendant sitting at the Goulburn Local Court. The matter was No. 36 in the Court list. After some discussion concerning the return of a subpoena directed to the Commissioner for Police, the topic of the s.91 application arose for consideration: 
     
      
       
        
        “BARTLETT: Your Honour we were in court on 21 December and on that occasion I made a - I brought it to the Court’s attention I intended to make an application under section 91 for the complainant to attend court. Your Honour made certain directions in relation to the matter, namely that my application was to be served on the DPP by 3 February, which it was. There were no directions to file it so I’d hand it up. I have prepared the written application. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I don’t usually need to see them, that’s why I don’t usually make those directions, but I don’t mind you handing it up now. The person to whom it ought be directed is the DPP and -- 
        
       
       
        
        BARTLETT: It has been served on the DPP and certainly it’d be my application for that application to proceed today, your hearing on or your decision on whether the complainant should attend to give evidence at committal. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Is there anyone here from the DPP? 
        
       
       
        
        BARTLETT: Your Honour I received a phone call from a Miss Chris Chapman whilst I was travelling to court to say she wasn’t coming and she would be seeking - asking the police to seek an adjournment. We’d oppose that. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: So do you have any instructions, sergeant? 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: As always your Honour I appear by default on behalf of the DPP when they don’t turn up. I can simply ask that this matter be adjourned as I don’t have what you would call the proper instructions. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well I don’t mind standing it down so you can ring them and try and get some. 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: Perhaps that might be the best thing your Honour, I certainly haven’t spoken …  
        (not transcribable) 
         … 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: How did these become served on the DPP? You faxed them? 
        
       
       
        
        BARTLETT: I faxed them; I faxed them on 3rd and Miss Chapman confirmed she’d received them. She said she didn’t get them till Monday. Certainly I faxed them on Friday so I assume there is some delay in them getting from the fax machine to her desk. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Oh well depends what time you faxed them I suppose, what time they popped out the other end. All sorts of things, but she might have been in court and didn’t go back to the office, who knows? 
        
       
       
        
        BARTLETT: I don’t know. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Anyway how long do you think that’ll take you? 
        
       
       
        
        BARTLETT: Well they’re in writing, I mean -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: No no no, sorry I meant the prosecutor. How long do you think it’ll take you or someone on your behalf to contact the DPP to find out if they have any other bases for their application for an adjournment apart from what they’ve told you so far which appears to be nothing? 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: It shouldn’t take long to contact them, the only problem is that I haven’t seen that letter, those instructions in writing. It’s just that I imagine I’ll have to discuss it with them at some stage too. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Oh well not before 12? 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: Thank you. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Is that going to inconvenience you? 
        
       
       
        
        BARTLETT: No your Honour …” 
        
       
      
    29 Further discussion ensued between his Honour, Mr Bartlett and the Police Prosecutor concerning the ability of the First Defendant to appear in person from custody or by way of audio visual link and the matter was stood in the list until 2.00 pm.  
     
      
    30 Given the issues raised in these proceedings, it is appropriate to set out the contents of Mr Bartlett’s written submission which had been served on 3 February 2006: 
     
      
       
        
        “The defendant seeks the attendance of V at the committal hearing of the above listed charges so that she can be cross examined about the contents of the statement that she made to police on 22/5/05. The defendant would raise the following issues to support this application: 
        
       
       
      1. V is the complainant in the charges laid by police against the defendant. There is no other person who directly witnessed the acts complained of by  
      [left blank] 
      . 
       
       
      2. The Police Brief Facts describe the complainant as a ‘casual sex worker’. The complainant confirms in her statement that these allegations arose after she had advertised sex in return for money. Her occupation as a prostitute raises an issue of whether she is a person of good fame and character. 
       
       
      3. The complainant has some criminal record for dishonesty. This record raises the issue of her credibility as a witness of truth. 
       
       
      4. The complainant had a charge dismissed under s32 of the Mental Health Act  
      [sic]  
      in 1988 (as stated in the Police record). Having a charge dismissed under these circumstances raises an issue as to her reliability as a witness. 
       
       
      5. The defendant has only one prior conviction. This was for lower range PCA in 1986. He is now 39 years old and has no record for violence or dishonesty. There is nothing in his Police record that would indicate he is either violent or dishonest. 
       
       
      6. In paragraph 9 the complainant states that the defendant gave her $200 prior to the alleged offences. She also states in paragraph 9 .. ‘I turned around to my vinyl bag (apparently with the $200) … When I turned back he said .. ‘You are being held up’’ In paragraph 16 the complainant states: … ‘at some stage he had taken the 4 X $50 back from my hands that he had given me.’ If her complaint is followed through from paragraph 9, when the defendant gave her $200 it is extremely unclear when he took the money back. The complainant’s evidence in paragraph 9 raises the inference she had put the $200 in her bag. Why can’t the complainant clearly state what happened to that $200? It is extremely unusual for an armed robber to initially give their victim cash monies. 
       
       
      7. The complainant states (paragraph 11): ‘he was speaking to himself in some type of foreign language.’ The defendant only speaks English. 
       
       
      8. The complainant alleges in paragraph 11 of her statement: … ‘he then winded tape around my eyes, mouth and head’. She later states in paragraph 11: ‘When he put the tape over my head I could still see a little bit.’ If tape was around her eyes one of those statements may be untrue. 
       
       
      9. The complainant states (paragraph 12) ‘He then wound some more tape around my eyes and I could see a soft black fabric on top of the tape partially covering my right ear’. How could she still see when two lots of tape had been wound around her eyes? How could she see her right ear? 
       
       
      11. The complainant states (paragraph 13): … ‘he then got on top of me and stuck his penis in my mouth.’ How did that happen when the complainant stated in paragraph 11 that her mouth was taped? 
       
       
      12. In paragraph 11 the complainant states her hands were initially tied behind her back at the wrists with plastic ties. In paragraph 13 she states ‘I felt more tape being wound around my hands.’ How did the defendant tie her hands with tape (as shown in the police photos) when her wrists were already held together with plastic ties? 
       
       
      13. In paragraph 13 the complainant states .. ‘he used something to cut the plastic binding around my hands.’ How did this happen when the complainant was (apparently) bound with the plastic binding ties and taped? Did the plastic binding fall to the floor or not? The police photos indicate a black plastic tie on the floor and a plastic tie still on the left wrist of the complainant under the tape. Why are the final resting positions for the two plastic ties so different? 
       
       
      14. In paragraph 13 the complainant states she felt a ‘hard sharp blade pushed between my legs and the sharp end was pushed up against both thighs.’ There is no medical evidence to corroborate this incident. The SAIK kit results from Wollongong Hospital are not part of the brief of evidence. The defence wants to clarify exactly where and how this alleged knife was used to try and ascertain why there is no corroboration of this assault. 
       
       
      15. In paragraph 15 the complainant states: …’he released my hands slightly but they were still bound.’ How did he release her hands slightly when they are allegedly bound with tape? The police photos do not appear to show tape that has been loosened. 
       
       
      16. In paragraph 15 the complainant states: … ‘he took the black fabric from my head’. How did she see what this item was when her eyes were taped? 
       
       
      17. I  
      [sic] 
       paragraph 16 the complainant states: … ‘I got up from the bed and unwound my hands free.’ If she was bound as she has previously described how could she simply unwind her hands free? 
       
       
      18. The police photographs show the complainant’s wrists have tape still wrapped around them after she unwound her hands free. Why is this tape still around the complainant’s wrists after she has claimed to have ‘unwound my hands free’? How did she unwind her hands? The police photos appear to show the tape is broken. If that is the case, how did the complainant break tape of that strength when her hands were behind her back? 
       
       
      19. In paragraph 17 the complainant states: … ‘I then rang the Motel manager and told him what had happened.’ This conversation appears to be the first complaint (if a complaint was made). No statement has been supplied from the Motel manager. The defence would seek to ask the complainant what she told the Motel manager. 
       
       
      20. In paragraph 17 the complainant states she spoke to some uniformed police. Sergeant Christopher Francis Taylor has supplied a statement in which he says he was the first police officer on the scene. He says that the complainant ‘told him something’. Sergeant Taylor has seen fit not to include possible evidence of complaint (if there was one). The defence wants to ask the complainant what she told Sergeant Taylor. 
       
       
      21. It is not clear from the brief of evidence how many pieces of tape were recovered and where they were recovered from. The defence need to clarify with V exactly how many pieces of tape were allegedly used so that her evidence can be checked against the exhibits recovered from the scene. 
       
       
        
        The defendant would submit that there are numerous inconsistencies in the statement of complaint made by V. The defendant would submit that in all the circumstances there are special reasons why it is in the interests of justice that he be given the opportunity to clarify these issues prior to trial, by cross examining the complainant at committal.” 
        
       
      
    31 Returning to the events at Goulburn Local Court on 8 February 2006, the matter was called on at a later time and the Second Defendant enquired as to whether the Police Prosecutor had spoken with the DPP. Once again, given the issues raised in these proceedings, it is appropriate to set out in full what was said: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: Have you been able to speak with the Crown, sergeant? 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: No I haven’t been able to speak to them but I do have -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: That’ll do, we’ll just wait, there’s just an inquiry that didn’t need Mr O’Conner to be physically present for you to answer it that’s all. Anyway he’s here now. Now take a seat there Mr O’Conner. Mr Bartlett indicated whilst you were being brought up that he was seeking the section 91 application to proceed, I asked the police prosecutor whether he’d been able to speak to the Crown and as you were coming he said that he hasn’t and that’s as much that’s occurred. 
        
       
       
        
        Now what were you going to go and say? 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: I have had them fax me some written instructions, I can put those - I’ll read those onto the record and I understand that they’re disputed but nevertheless they’re the instructions that I’ve got. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well firstly you’ve got my copy of Mr Bartlett’s submission. 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: Oh yes, I’ll return that your Honour. The fax instructions that I received are section 91 representations from the defence, received 7 February 2006, ‘This office will require two weeks to respond. The matter should be returned to Wollongong Local Court for hearing. DPP list day at Wollongong is every Wednesday at 11.45 am.’ We attempted to ring the person who sent those instructions to us, we’re told that they weren’t working today, they’ll be in tomorrow and that’s as far as we’ve got your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: So if they weren’t working today and they’re in tomorrow who sent those? 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: Yes it seems some - well I think what’s happened -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I mean people often come in on their days off and work when they’re not required to. 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: I can only assume that that may have happened this morning cause I note that the facts were sent this morning. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Oh they could’ve gone home, yes that’s true. 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: But I’m not able to assist cause we haven’t been able to speak to those people. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Bartlett what do you want to say? 
        
       
       
        
        BARTLETT: Your Honour I note the prosecutor has indicated the application was received on 7 February, I strongly dispute that. I faxed that application on 3 February in accordance with your directions. I have my fax coversheet here, it’s dated 3 February; I’ve noted in my diary I sent it on 3 February. 7th was yesterday, I did not send it on 7th, I sent it on 3rd. That information is wrong. 
        
       
       
        
        You gave directions on 21 December in this matter, the directions were that that application was to be sent to the DPP by 3 February, I complied with that direction. In my fax coversheet I indicated ‘Please find following, section 91 application for the attendance of  
        [V]  
        at the committal hearing for cross-examination. This application is before Goulburn Local Court on 8 February 2006, please contact me if you have any queries.’ Now I get a phone call at quarter to 9 on the way to court this morning, pull over to the side of the road and talk to a prosecutor who says ‘We’re not coming, I’ve told the police to get an adjournment.’ 
        
       
       
        
        In my respectful submission that is simply not good enough, the Court gave clear directions. My understanding of what was to occur was quite clear, that this application would be dealt with today, Mr O’Conner is in custody. The committal hearing is being held up so that this - your decision in this matter can be heard, and for the prosecutor to say ‘We’re not coming’ in my respectful submissions is simply not good enough. 
        
       
       
        
        I’d oppose the change of venue, there’s no reason given for that. In my respectful submission the application’s been made in writing, the application is supported by the case law and we’d ask your Honour to make the decision whether you want this  
        [V]  
        to attend for cross-examination or not. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Do you want to say anything about that sergeant? 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: Well your Honour I don’t think it was in for the committal of a section 91 today, I think it may have if -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: It was in today for a paper committal or a section 91 argument. Mr Bartlett had to give notification to the Crown by 3 February as to which witnesses he would be seeking to have directed to attend. He says that he did it. 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: Oh I can’t - I don’t have anything to say on that, I only have those limited instructions. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: But it was in for those two purposes, either a paper committal, if that was abandoned ie the section 91 argument, or it was in for determination of the argument. 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: The only other thing I can add is that the reason I imagine that it’s been asked that this goes back to Wollongong is cause the incident happened in that area, it happened in Figtree which I understand is in the Wollongong area and I understand it’s a matter where things such as this which is basically a hearing - well not a hearing, a total hearing, but a hearing should happen in the area where the situation occurred, and not sent to other courts for a hearing. 
        
       
       
        
        So that’s the only thing I could think that the DPP would want me to put in relation to the reason that it’s to go to Wollongong. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Oh I could work that part out. What do you think about the special circumstances argument advanced by Mr Bartlett? 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: The only thing I can say your Honour is that you have my instructions, I’m not in a position to argue that in any way. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Good. 
        
       
       
        
        BARTLETT: Your Honour -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I’ve always found in the past Mr Bartlett that when you’ve been successful you really don’t want to run the risk of then becoming unsuccessful. 
        
       
       
        
        BARTLETT: Thank you your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR  
        [sic] 
        : That never stopped me from going on at length though I must say, as others pointed out to me time and time again.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    32 Following a further interruption, Mr Bartlett continued with his submissions on the s.91 application: 
     
      
       
        
        “BARTLETT: Well your Honour the point I was going to make is you’ll note in my submissions one of the main concerns we have about the complainant’s evidence is how her hands are tied with tape and how the plastic ties came to be where they were, and certainly it would have been my application that she give evidence in the witness box and demonstrate how her hands were tied in that way to clarify the situation. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Isn’t it mandatory though? 
        
       
       
        
        BARTLETT: Beg your pardon? 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Isn’t it mandatory nowadays? Or is it not? 
        
       
       
        
        FURTHER DISCUSSION AS TO SUITABLE DATE 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: There’s been so many recent amendments that I have something lodged in my mind that it’s now mandatory, or if not mandatory, almost for complainants to have their evidence given in that fashion. 
        
       
       
        
        BARTLETT: Yes your Honour, I’ll research the matter. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Not only children. I understand what you’re saying, probably it has a lot of weight but I’ve got a vague memory of something coming, some amendment being made in the great legislative rush towards the end of the last year that made it compulsory almost. 
        
       
       
        
        FURTHER DISCUSSION AS TO SUITABLE DATE 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I’ll mark it CCTV so that we make sure that the facility’s there and I’ll hear from you on the day further, if I need to, if it isn’t a requirement. 
        
       
       
        
        BARTLETT: Yes, I’ll have to research that issue your Honour.” 
        
       
      
    33 At the conclusion of Mr Bartlett’s submissions, the Second Defendant gave the following judgment: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: This is a matter where Anthony O’Conner has made an application for the attendance of one - application to the Court for direction to be given for the attendance of one witness at a committal hearing. The witness sought to be cross-examined is the complainant in allegations of aggravated sexual assault. 
        
       
       
        
        In those circumstances the law quite clearly requires the accused to demonstrate special reasons why the complainant ought be called to give evidence, or be cross-examined either at large or in relation to particular aspects of her purported evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        I note that when the matter was before this Court on 21 December 2005 it was clearly stated by the Court that the brief was to be served by 25 January 2006, with the matter back on 8 February 2006 for what I termed a reply to the brief, which was then contemplating either a paper committal or a s 91 argument. 
        
       
       
        
        I made a further direction that if Mr Bartlett, on behalf of the accused, was to make such an application he had to provide notification to the Crown pursuant to the relevant subsection of the Act, by 3 February 2006, and Mr O’Conner was directed to attend by way of AVL link, and bail was refused as it has been ever since Mr O’Conner first appeared before this Court on 16 November 2005. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Bartlett says from the bar table, and no doubt can hand up the document if necessary, that he complied with the direction of the Court, and transmitted by way of facsimile the s 91 application to the Crown on 3 February 2006. I note that today, 8 February 2006, there is no attendance of Crown Solicitor. The police prosecutor has been forced to take up the matter at the last moment without adequate instructions, and in fact the matter had to be stood down for a number of reasons, one of which so that the police prosecutor could desperately attempt to contact the Director of Public Prosecution’s office in Wollongong to obtain some instructions of some sort in relation to the matter. Between the time of standing down two goals have been achieved, a) Mr O’Conner’s now before the Court so that Mr Bartlett could speak with him, and, secondly, the police prosecutor has obtained instructions of a very limited and brief nature from somebody at the Director of Public Prosecution’s office who’s no longer available, they not being at work today. 
        
       
       
        
        The police prosecutor has forlornly attempted to rebut and resist - I will withdraw the word ‘rebut’, resist Mr Bartlett’s application but can provide no grist to underpin his proposition. However, it is not up to the police prosecutor to prove the negative, so to speak, it is up - the onus is cast on Mr Bartlett to convince the Court on behalf of the accused that special circumstances exist. It seems to me, having regard to the decisions in the matter, and the material made out by Mr Bartlett on behalf of Mr O’Conner - which I now note they are different spellings of his surname, it is O’Conner on the charge sheet, and O’Connor on Mr Bartlett’s submission, but probably nothing as such turns on that - that having regard to those detailed submissions and given the nature of the case as advised to the Court in the two bail applications that have been made it would appear that the inconsistencies that Mr Bartlett says are redolent in the complainant’s statement are such that when taken together and considered as a whole and not individually there is a real chance that doubt could be raised in the Court’s mind as to whether any or all of the offences with which Mr O’Conner has been charged were actually committed by him, and that is especially so given what it is that he contends is the true situation pertaining.  
        
       
       
        
        In view of all of those matters taken together, as I said as a coagulation, I am satisfied that special circumstances do exist, that in the interests of justice  
        [V] 
         will be directed to attend cross-examination.” 
        
       
       
      
    34 Having made that direction, the Second Defendant adjourned the committal proceedings for hearing on 14 March 2006 at Goulburn Local Court. 
     
      
    35 Mr Bartlett informed the Court that no application was made for bail. The Police Prosecutor enquired as to the application for the matter to be transferred to Wollongong: 
     
      
       
        
        “PROSECUTOR: Hour Honour, just one thing, I’m sure I’ll be asked, -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Mm. 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: -- can I just ask, obviously the application to have the matter moved to Wollongong has been refused? 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Oh yes, sorry, I’ll say that as well. 
        
       
       
        
        I DO NOT PROPOSE TO MOVE THE MATTER FROM HERE TO WOLLONGONG. 
        
       
       
        
        If there was any such application on foot it would have been made previously. It may well have been, I’ve made no note of that. 
        
       
       
        
        I note that Mr O’Conner is being held at Goulburn, it would seem to me that the inconvenience to be occasioned to him moving him from Goulburn to Wollongong however, in custody, is far greater than any inconvenience that would be suffered by the complainant in attending not in custody at Goulburn. I was initially asked by the police prosecutor to remit the matter to Wollongong at a date some three weeks ago merely to fix another date to maintain or allow the Crown to be in a position to respond to an argument that they really ought to have been able to respond to today in accordance with the directions of the Court, and it seems to me that the balance of convenience rests in Mr O’Conner’s favour and THE MATTER WILL REMAIN HERE.” 
        
       
      
    36 On 8 March 2006, the present proceedings were commenced in this Court by Summons. As I have mentioned, the hearing of the Summons came before me as Duty Judge on 1 May 2006 and continued yesterday.  
     
      
       
      Nature of Relief Claimed by Plaintiff 
       
      
    37 The Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief and relief in the nature of mandamus under s. 69 Supreme Court Act 1970 with respect to the direction given by the Second Defendant on 8 February 2006 under ss.91 and 93 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The applicable principles on such an application were stated by Hunt J (as his Honour then was) in Waterhouse v Gilmore (1988) 12 NSWLR 271 at 276-278. In order to warrant the grant of declaratory relief in relation to committal proceedings, the circumstances must be “most exceptional” or some “special reason” must be shown: Sankey v Whitlam (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 25-26, 81-82; Waterhouse v Gilmore at 277B. The undesirability of this Court intervening in committal proceedings has often been stressed: Waterhouse v Gilmore at 277B. A claim for declaratory relief is not to be used as a means of appeal except in special circumstances: Waterhouse v Gilmore at 277C-D.38 As committal proceedings are purely executive in nature, it has been held that a Magistrate’s decision whether to commit for trial is not accessible to correction by this Court in the exercise of it supervisory jurisdiction at common law by way of prohibition or certiorari: Waterhouse v Gilmore at 275D-E. However, there is no obstacle to a grant of relief in the nature of mandamus under s.69 Supreme Court Act 1970  in relation to decisions given in the course of committal proceedings.  
     
      
    39 When mandamus is sought to command the relevant court to reconsider the matter before it according to law, it is usual practice to seek certiorari also in order to quash the erroneous determination and thus clear the way for the fresh consideration and determination of that matter. An inability to grant certiorari in relation to committal proceedings, however, will not stand in the way of a grant of mandamus: Waterhouse v Gilmore at 276C-D.  
     
      
    40 Relief in the nature of mandamus may be granted where there is an actual or constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction: Waterhouse v Gilmore at 276D-E; Saffron v Director of Public Prosecutions (1989) 16 NSWLR 397 at 399, 418-420.41 The requirements of procedural fairness (including the audi alteram partem rule) extend to committal proceedings and this Court may grant relief where denial of procedural fairness is demonstrated in that context: Tahmindjis v Brown (1985) 60 ALR 120 at 133-134. 
     
      
    42 There have been a number of decisions of this Court where relief in the nature of mandamus, either with or without declaratory relief, has been granted with respect to an order under s.91 and s.93 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (or their statutory predecessors in the Justices Act 1902) either requiring the attendance of a witness to give evidence in committal proceedings or declining to make such an order: Foley v Molan (Levine J, 20 August 1993, unreported, BC9301863); TS v George (Studdert J, 14 April 1998, unreported, BC9802154); Hanna v Kearney (Studdert J, 28 May 1998, unreported, BC9803179); Leahy v Price (Adams J, 28 September 1998, unreported, BC9804950); Dawson v Director of Public Prosecutions [1999] NSWSC 1147; JW v Director of Public Prosecutions [1999] NSWSC 1244; O’Hare v Director of Public Prosecutions [2000] NSWSC 430; Lawler v Johnson (2002) 56 NSWLR 1; McKirdy v McCosker (2002) 127 A Crim R 217; Director of Public Prosecutions v Rainibogi [2003] NSWSC 274 and Black v Director of Public Prosecutions [2003] NSWSC 442. 
     
      
    43 In the alternative to these remedies, the Plaintiff seeks leave to appeal under s.57(1)(b) Appeal and Review Act upon a ground that involves a question of law alone and contends that the order under challenge is an order made by a Magistrate in relation to a person in any committal proceedings for the purpose of that provision. The application for leave to appeal falls to be determined under s.58(1) Appeal and Review Act. If leave is given, the Court may determine an appeal against an order referred to in s.57(1)(b) by setting aside the order and making such other order as it thinks just or by dismissing the appeal: s.59(2).  
     
      
    44 Mr Siva submitted that the s.91 direction made on 8 February 2006 is not “an order that has been made by a Magistrate in relation to a person in any committal proceedings”. He submits that the s.91 order is not part of the committal proceedings, but is a step antecedent to the hearing of committal proceedings. Accordingly, he submits that such an order is not an order “in” the committal proceedings. 
     
      
    45 The Court may decline to exercise its jurisdiction to grant relief under s.69 Supreme Court Act 1970 where a statutory appeal is available: Meagher v Stephenson (1993) 30 NSWLR 736 at 738-9; Hill v King (1993) 31 NSWLR 654 at 656, 658-9. However, such a course is not mandatory. Even where a statutory avenue of appeal was available and may have been preferable, the Court has granted prerogative relief: Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Farley (2001) 51 NSWLR 494 at 500-501 (paragraph 24). In circumstances where it is contended that there is some doubt as to whether the statutory avenue of appeal, by leave, is available in this case, I will, in due course, give initial consideration to the Plaintiff’s application for declaratory relief and relief in the nature of mandamus. Mr Arnott SC submitted that this was the primary relief sought by the Plaintiff in this case. 
     
      
       
      Sections 91 and 93  
      Criminal Procedure Act 1986 
       
      
    46 Part 2 of Chapter 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (ss.47-120) provides for committal proceedings before the Local Court with respect to indictable offences. Division 3 of Part 2 of the Act (ss.71-96) provide for the adducing of prosecution evidence in committal proceedings. 
     
      
    47 Evidence for the prosecution must be given by written statements that are admissible as evidence: s.74(1). Written statements are to be served on the accused person: s.75. Section 91 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “91  
        Witness may be directed to attend 
         
         
        (1) The Magistrate may direct the attendance at the committal proceedings of the person who made a written statement tendered as evidence under this Division. The direction may be given on the Magistrate’s own motion or on the application of the accused person or the prosecutor. 
         
         
        (2) The Magistrate must give the direction if an application is made by the accused person or the prosecutor and the other party consents to the direction being given. 
         
         
        (3) In any other circumstance, the Magistrate may give a direction only if satisfied that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witness should attend to give oral evidence. A direction may not be given if the written statement has already been admitted in evidence. 
         
         
        (4) The written statement is not admissible in evidence in the proceedings after the direction is given unless the Magistrate withdraws the direction. This does not affect a statement admitted in evidence before a direction is given. 
         
         
        (5) A direction given on the application of the accused person or the prosecutor may be withdrawn only: 
         
         
          
          (a) on the application, or with the consent, of the applicant, or 
           
           
          (b) if the applicant fails to appear, on the application of the other party. 
          
         
         
        (6) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the determination of substantial reasons under subsection (3). 
         
         
        (7) If a person attends to give oral evidence because of a direction under this section, the Magistrate must not allow the person to be cross-examined in respect of matters that were not the basis of the reasons for giving the direction, unless the Magistrate is satisfied that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the person should be cross-examined in respect of those matters. 
         
         
        (8) A direction may not be given under this section so as to require the attendance of the complainant in proceedings for a child sexual assault offence if the complainant: 
         
         
          
          (a) was under the age of 16 years: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (i) on the earliest date on which, or 
             
             
            (ii) at the beginning of the earliest period during which, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             any child sexual assault offence to which the proceedings relate was allegedly committed, and 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (b) is currently under the age of 18 years. 
          
         
         
        (9) For the purposes of subsection (8): 
        
       
       
        
        child sexual assault offence 
         means: 
         
         
          
          (a) a prescribed sexual offence, or 
           
           
          (b) an offence that, at the time it was committed, was a child sexual assault offence for the purposes of subsection (8), or 
           
           
          (c) an offence of attempting, or of conspiracy or incitement, to commit an offence referred to in paragraph (a) or (b). 
          
         
         
          
          complainant 
          , in relation to any proceedings, means the person, or any of the persons, against whom a prescribed sexual offence with which the accused person stands charged in those proceedings is alleged to have been committed, and includes: 
          
         
         
          
          (a) in relation to an offence under section 80E of the Crimes Act 1900, the person who is alleged to have been the subject of sexual servitude, and 
           
           
          (b) in relation to an offence under section 91D, 91E or 91F of the Crimes Act 1900, the person under the age of 18 years who is alleged to have participated in an act of child prostitution, and 
           
           
          (c) in relation to an offence under section 91G of the Crimes Act 1900, the person under the age of 18 years who is alleged to have been used for pornographic purposes.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    48 Section 92 provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “92  
        When accused person may apply to have witness attend 
         
         
          
          (1) The accused person in any committal proceedings may not apply for a direction under section 91 unless the accused person has served on the prosecutor a notice requesting the attendance at the proceedings of the person who made the statement concerned. 
           
           
          (2) The notice must be served within the time set by the Magistrate. 
           
           
          (3) The last date for service of the notice set by the Magistrate must be at least 14 days before the time set by the Magistrate for taking the prosecution evidence in the committal proceedings. 
           
           
          (4) The Magistrate may specify a later date.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    49 Section 93 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “93  
        Victim witnesses generally not to be cross-examined 
         
         
          
          (1) Despite section 91, in any committal proceedings in which the accused person is charged with an offence involving violence, the Magistrate may not, under that section, direct the attendance of an alleged victim of the offence who made a written statement unless the Magistrate is of the opinion that there are special reasons why the alleged victim should, in the interests of justice, attend to give oral evidence. 
           
            
           
          (2) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the determination of any such special reasons.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    50 It was common ground in this case that the First Defendant was charged with an offence involving violence, as defined in s.94(1)(a) and (f) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 so that the provisions of s.93 were applicable in combination with those contained in s.91 of the Act.  
     
      
    51 The provisions now contained in ss.91 and 93 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 are the statutory successors to provisions enacted initially in this State more than a decade ago. In Kant v Director of Public Prosecutions (1994) 34 NSWLR 216 at 225D-E, Gleeson CJ (Clarke JA agreeing) observed that the general purpose of s.48EA Justices Act 1902 (the predecessor to ss.91 and 93) was not in doubt. The second reading speech revealed that the provision involved a restriction on cross-examination of victims so as to shorten the length of committal proceedings and to strike an appropriate balance between the rights of an accused person and the need to reduce the trauma that court proceedings impose on the victims of crime. Gleeson CJ noted the Minister’s statement that the result of the provision was that a victim would not have to suffer the trauma of giving evidence twice unless this is justified.  
     
      
    52 The nature and operation of the test involving the requirement of “special reasons” in the “interests of justice” has been considered in a number of decisions: B v Gould (1993) 67 A Crim R 297; R v Anderson (Court of Criminal Appeal, 15 February 1994, unreported); O’Hare v Director of Public Prosecutions; Director of Public Prosecutions v Rainibogi; TS v George; Tez v Longley (2004) 142 A Crim R 122. The meaning of the term “special reasons” was considered in those cases against the background of the particular factual circumstances of each case. In B v Gould, Studdert J provides examples of circumstances where “special reasons” might be found: 
     
      
       
      (a) if material placed before the Magistrate suggests that there is a real possibility that, if the alleged victim is subject to cross-examination, the accused person will not be committed to trial; 
       
       
      (b) if the alleged victim has given more than one version of an alleged offence and those versions are inconsistent. 
       
       
      These examples are pertinent to the present case. 
       
      
    53 A number of observations should be made about ss.91 and 93 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Section 91(2) provides that the Magistrate must give a direction for the attendance of a witness if an application is made by the accused person or the prosecutor and the other party consents to the direction being given. In my view, this provision extends to a witness who is caught by s.93(1) of the Act. It is necessary to read ss.91 and 93 together. There is no good reason to confine the ability for an order to be made by consent to a s.91 “substantial reasons” case only. In this regard, I note that s.48E Justices Act 1902, in the form in which it stood prior to repeal in July 2003, contained in s.48E(1A) a consent provision such as s.91(2) of the present Act. Section 48E(2) dealt with both “substantial reasons” and “special reasons” cases. It is clear that a consent order could have been made with respect to a “special reasons” case under s.48E of the repealed Justices Act 1902. In my view, there is no good reason to adopt a different construction with respect to ss.91 and 93 of the present Act.  
     
      
    54 That said, however, there is no question of consent arising in this case. Indeed, the prosecution made clear that the s.91 application was opposed. 
     
      
    55 Section 91(5) provides that a direction given on the application of the accused person or the prosecutor may be withdrawn only in defined circumstances. The effect of this provision appears to be that any argument that a direction for attendance of a witness may be revisited, as an interlocutory order, is excluded by statute: cf Director of Public Prosecutions v Scheibel (2004) 145 A Crim R 576 at 584-5; Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions [2005] NSWSC 129 at paragraph 10. For that reason, it was not open to the Plaintiff to have the matter relisted before the Second Defendant for the purpose of a fully argued application to withdraw or revoke the direction which had been given on 8 February 2006. That course was not open because of s.91(5) of the Act. Accordingly, there is utility in the proceedings brought by the Plaintiff in this Court.  
     
      
       
      The Plaintiff’s Grounds  
       
      
    56 The Summons contained four grounds alleging that the Second Defendant had erred in law in: 
     
      
       
        
        “(i) failing to provide proper reasons for his ruling under s91 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 that the victim of the alleged offences involving violence be called upon to give evidence at committal. 
         
         
        (ii) having failed to give proper reasons for directing the victim of the alleged offences involving violence be called, failing then to specify what topic or topics might be the subject of cross examination. 
         
         
        (iii) holding that, from the written submissions served by the first defendant in support of his application under s.91 and s.93 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, and the nature of the case as it appeared to the court in two bail applications, there were sufficient grounds for the court to find special reasons existed so that the victim of the alleged offences involving violence was directed to attend to be cross examined. 
         
         
        (iv) failing to comply with the procedural requirements pertaining to applications under ss.91 and 93 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 by Clauses 2.4 and 2.5 of the Local Court Practice Note 9/2003.” 
        
       
      
    57 At the hearing before me, Ground 4 was extended to include a claim that the Second Defendant had denied procedural fairness to the Plaintiff in the circumstances of the case. 
     
      
       
      Submissions of the Plaintiff 
       
      
    58 Mr Arnott SC submitted that the Plaintiff was denied procedural fairness on 8 February 2006. In support of this argument, he drew my attention to Local Court Practice Note 9 issued by his Honour Judge Price, the Chief Magistrate, on 13 August 2003, concerning procedures to be adopted for committal hearings in the Local Court for proceedings commenced on or after 7 July 2003. Practice Note 9 includes the following elements: 
     
      
       
        
        “2.  
        Case management after the first appearance 
        . 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          2.1 The Court will adjourn the matter for not less than eight weeks, allowing six weeks for service of the brief and two weeks for reply. 
           
           
          2.2 The matter will be listed for mention on the reply date. 
           
           
          2.3 On the reply date, any applications for a direction under s 91 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 will be considered either as a contested application or by consent. If by consent, agreement as per the Form 1 that forms part of this Practice Note is to be completed and signed by both parties and the presiding Magistrate. 
           
           
          2.4 If the s 91 application is contested or if s93 (special reasons) applies, the application will be set down for hearing at the earliest available opportunity. In such cases, a copy of the brief is to be delivered to the court not less than two days prior to the s 91/s 93 hearing, or as otherwise directed by the Court. 
           
           
          2.5 Submissions in support of contested s 91 applications are to be in writing, served on the other parties and filed with the court at least seven days before the application is heard. 
           
           
          2.6 If no application for a direction under s 91 is made, or a direction under s 91 is made by consent, the Court will set a date for a committal for trial or sentence on the first available date in the court diary.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    59 The Plaintiff submits that compliance with paragraphs 2.4 and 2.5 of the Practice Note in this case would have seen a longer period of time between the date when the s.91 application was served and the date when the matter was next before the Court. It was submitted that the Practice Note was intended to set down time standards which were to be followed. The Plaintiff submits that the Practice Note was not complied with in this case.  
     
      
    60 The Plaintiff submits that this factor, in combination with a number of other features, gave rise to a denial of procedural fairness in this case. Those additional features included (a) the inability of the DPP solicitor to attend court at Goulburn on 8 February 2006 for reasons which were made known to Mr Bartlett, but not to the learned Magistrate, (b) the approach taken by the Police Prosecutor which involved nothing more than the passing on of messages from the DPP with no active advocacy in support of the adjournment application or, for that matter, the s.91 application and (c) the refusal of the learned Magistrate to adjourn the matter at all although a significant question fell to be determined by his Honour but, in the absence of an adjournment, without any submissions or assistance from the prosecution on issues relevant to the application. The Plaintiff submits, in effect, that the application proceeded ex parte because no contribution at all was made by the Police Prosecutor to the substance of the argument once the adjournment was refused.  
     
      
    61 The Plaintiff relies upon Blazevski v Judges of the District Court of NSW (1992) 62 ALD 197 (10 November 1992, BC9101492), a decision of the NSW Court of Appeal, in support of the submission that denial of procedural fairness is demonstrated in this case. It was submitted that, as a result of the convergence of a series of unusual and unfortunate events, the learned Magistrate was left with a distorted picture as to the position of the DPP involving an apparently high-handed attitude that the proceedings ought be adjourned for two weeks because the prosecution said so. The true position was not made known to his Honour through a combination of factors involving the failure of Mr Love’s facsimile of 7 February 2006 to be transmitted, the factually erroneous message from Ms Meiers which was communicated and the fact that those who were present did not communicate to the learned Magistrate that it had been, at least, suggested that Mr Love’s injury had led to an unexpected inability for him to attend and the unavailability of any other DPP solicitor to do so at short notice. 
     
      
    62 It is submitted that the Plaintiff was deprived of the opportunity of making submissions in opposition to the application which would have had a material and significant impact upon the application.  
     
      
    63 The Plaintiff submits that his Honour failed to give reasons to enable his decision to be seen and understood: Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Limited (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 279; Downes v Director of Public Prosecutions [2000] NSWSC 1054 at paragraphs 14-19. His Honour’s reference to Mr Bartlett’s written submissions, and information provided in bail applications, did not amount to proper reasons. It was submitted that the written submissions canvassed a variety of matters and it is impossible to know which item or items the Magistrate considered as satisfying the test of “special reasons” in the “interests of justice” and why: Director of Public Prosecutions v Rainibogi at paragraph 49.  
     
      
    64 The learned Magistrate was not provided with the prosecution brief, or parts thereof, including the statement of V. It is clear that a range of documents, including V’s statement, were in the possession of the solicitor for the First Defendant as they were referred to in his written submission. The Plaintiff submits that the failure of the Second Defendant to give proper reasons is compounded by the manner in which the application was determined involving, on the face of it, a bare acceptance of the matters contained in the written submissions (or at least some or them) without the learned Magistrate conducting an independent process of examining any part of the brief, including V’s statement.  
     
      
    65 The Plaintiff submits that in regards to asserted inconsistencies in V’s account (being the only specific matter to which the Second Defendant referred) his Honour misunderstood the question to be asked. A desire for cross-examination for the purpose of affecting the credibility of a witness in the eyes of the Court does not amount to special reasons: Goldsmith v Newman and South Australia (1992) 59 SASR 404 at 410; R v Kennedy (1997) 84 A Crim R 341 at 352. The Plaintiff noted that there may be a justification for oral examination where inconsistencies result in a defendant not knowing the case which he has to meet. However, the Plaintiff submits that that is not this case. The Plaintiff pointed to the statement of Studdert J in B v Gould at 303-4 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Again, if the alleged victim has given more than one version of an alleged offence and those versions are inconsistent, this may warrant that the alleged victim attend for cross-examination under the section. I would caution however that the possibility always exists that a witness will be discredited and his or her testimony may be broken down in cross-examination. A recognition of that possibility and the confidence that the potential cross-examiner may express as to what may happen if he is given the opportunity to cross-examine could not of itself suffice to afford ‘special reasons’.” 
        
       
      
    66 Reliance was also placed upon the following observation of Sperling J in Boumelhem v Director of Public Prosecutions (2002) 135 A Crim R 454 at 458 (paragraph 23):  
     
      
       
        
        “As to the reference to inconsistent versions of events, there would be cases where it is not clear what version of events will be advanced as the case for the accused to meet. That may justify oral examination. But there is no such doubt in the present proceedings.” 
        
       
      
    67 The Plaintiff submitted that the matters relied upon in the First Defendant’s written submissions were not, in reality, inconsistencies of the type referred to in B v Gould and Boumelhem. The matters raised appear to rise no higher than a desire to clarify certain areas and, perhaps, to establish whether there is an inconsistency. That is not the concept which has been referred to in the authorities concerning the construction of this section. 
     
      
    68 The Plaintiff submits that his Honour accepted, without demur, the contention that there were inconsistencies in the complainant’s account and concluded “there is a real chance that doubt could be raised in the court’s mind as to whether any or all of the offences … were committed by [the defendant]”. The Plaintiff submits that his Honour’s short reasons do not disclose how he could come to this conclusion, let alone how he could accept the submission that there appeared to be inconsistencies “redolent in the complainant’s statement”. His Honour did not read the complainant’s statement. 
     
      
    69 The Plaintiff submits that his Honour did not give discrete consideration as to what topic or topics might be the subject of cross-examination and the limits of cross-examination: Director of Public Prosecutions v Rainibogi at paragraph 49. 
     
      
    70 The Plaintiff submits that, in the face of a very strong prosecution case, the areas of proposed cross-examination appeared to be a fishing expedition. Mr Arnott SC emphasises that the First Defendant had denied completely any involvement in the offence in his interview with police. Accordingly, the position taken by the defence, on that approach, involved an issue as to the identity of the offender. In this regard, although the learned Magistrate did not know that DNA evidence implicated the First Defendant, he was informed that there was fingerprint evidence implicating him in the offence. 
     
      
    71 After the hearing was adjourned from 1 May 2006 to 11 May 2006, Mr Siva provided a further written submission which states that his instructions were that the Second Defendant had been informed on a bail application on 21 December 2005 that the First Defendant now acknowledged that he had been in the room with V on 22 May 2005. There is no evidence before me that the Magistrate was so informed. Mr Bartlett swore an affidavit in the proceedings and attended on 1 May 2006 for cross-examination, but this matter was not raised on that day. Mr Arnott SC informed me at the resumed hearing that the prosecution did not know, at this time, whether such a statement had been made to the Second Defendant on 21 December 2005. I note, in this respect, that there is nothing in Mr Bartlett’s written submission of 3 February 2006 indicating that this was the position.  
     
      
    72 Mr Arnott SC submits that it would be erroneous to approach the resolution of the present matter upon the basis that this information, which was said to have been provided to the learned Magistrate at a bail application some six weeks before 8 February 2006 was, in some way, in his Honour’s mind at the time of his ruling on that day. Even if such an indication had been given at the bail application on 21 December 2005 (a matter about which I express no concluded view given the absence of evidence before me on the point), I am not prepared to accept, in the absence of any express statement in his Honour’s reasons and in the absence of any express statement in the written or oral submissions put to his Honour on 8 February 2006, that he did, in fact, take it into account. 
     
      
    73 In my view, the debate concerning this issue serves to highlight the inadequacy of the learned Magistrate’s reasons, a matter to which I will return later in this judgment.  
     
      
       
      Submissions of the First Defendant 
       
      
    74 Mr Siva submitted that there had been no denial of procedural fairness in this case. He submitted that Mr Bartlett had served his s.91 application and submission in accordance with the order of the Court and had made clear his intention to oppose an adjournment application on 8 February 2006. He submitted that the failure of the Plaintiff to communicate adequately with the Court or the Goulburn Police Prosecutor concerning the reasons for the adjournment application on that day was not a matter which should operate against the First Defendant. In substance, he submits that the learned Magistrate was informed of the prosecution application and the fact that it was opposed. He submits that Mr Bartlett was under no obligation to reveal to the learned Magistrate the fact that, as part of his conversation with Ms Chapman, he had been informed that an injury to Mr Love was said to be, in some way, linked to the adjournment application. 
     
      
    75 The First Defendant submits that the Police Prosecutor was present and made the adjournment application with such information as was available to him. The application was refused. The Police Prosecutor did not ask for an adjournment for a day or two. The only application was for a two-week adjournment and that application was refused. 
     
      
    76 Mr Siva submits that the Second Defendant’s reasons complied with the requirements of the law. He correctly instructed himself as to the onus of proof on the application and as to the need for the First Defendant to establish “special reasons”. Although his Honour’s reasons were short, Mr Siva submits that they revealed his thought processes sufficiently and involved a complete acceptance of Mr Bartlett’s written submissions. 
     
      
    77 Mr Siva submits that there is no obligation on the part of a Magistrate to identify, as part of a s.91 direction, the topics which are to be permissible areas for cross-examination. He submitted that s.91(7) operates at the time when the witness attends to give oral evidence and not at the time of the making of the s.91 direction. In any event, he submits that the appropriate conclusion is that his Honour directed that each of the areas specified in Mr Bartlett’s written submission were permissible areas of cross-examination. 
     
      
    78 Mr Siva submitted that Practice Note 9 had been amended since 1 January 2006 in a respect which was relevant to the present case. He submits, in any event, that there is no evidence that any person involved in the circumstances of this case was relying upon the provisions of the Practice Note to determine the procedures and times for steps to be taken where a s.91 application is to be made. 
     
      
    79 The First Defendant submitted that no case for declaratory relief or relief in the nature of mandamus had been demonstrated. The exceptional step of the Supreme Court interfering in committal proceedings which are presently on foot ought not be taken in this case. The s.91 direction had been given and the committal proceedings ought take place with V being called to give evidence in accordance with that direction. 
     
      
       
      Resolution of Competing Submissions 
       
       
      The Procedural Fairness Ground 
       
      
    80 In Blazevski, Kirby P (as his Honour then was) referred to cases where appellate courts will intervene on an appeal against the refusal of an adjournment and said at 200: 
     
      
       
        
        “In ‘particular circumstances’, therefore, appellate courts will resolutely intervene both for the assurance of justice and the manifest appearance of justice and to uphold the integrity of the system of justice. See  
        R v Sussex Justices; Ex parte McCarthy 
         [1924] 1 KB 256 (CA) at 258. Courts providing judicial review to rectify departures from the requirements of procedural fairness will likewise give relief for departures from such requirements which will have taken the trial court outside the proper exercise of its jurisdiction. In criminal cases, they will do so where the injustice has been done to the prosecution as well as to the accused. See for example  
        R v Dudley Justices; Ex parte Director of Public Prosecutions 
        , (Times Law Reports, 24 June 1992) at 10 (Mann LJ).” 
        
       
      
    81 In Nitiva v Director of Public Prosecutions [1999] NSWCA 332, the Court of Appeal (Sheller and Beazley JJA and Cole AJA) said at paragraph 64: 
     
      
       
        
        “The principles upon which an adjournment ought to be granted are well established. The court has a discretion to grant or refuse an adjournment. However, a refusal to grant an adjournment can, in certain circumstances, constitute a denial of procedural fairness: see  
        Sullivan v Department of Transport 
          
        (1978) 20 ALR 323. As Deane J said in that case at 343 ‘… it is important to remember that the relevant duty of the court is to ensure that a party is given a reasonable opportunity to present his case’.” 
        
       
      
    82 Practice Notes issued by the Chief Magistrate of the Local Court appear to have a statutory foundation: s.28B Local Courts Act 1982; cf Whalley v Commissioner of Police [2003] NSWSC 273 at paragraphs 10-18 concerning Supreme Court Practice Notes. However, there is no evidence in this case that any DPP solicitor was relying upon the Practice Note and was, in a sense, taken by surprise by the course taken which was inconsistent with the Practice Note. In these circumstances, although the Practice Note is part of the legislative and quasi-legislative background to a s.91 application, it does not have any substantial effect on the outcome of the proceedings. 
     
      
    83 The practical effect of what occurred on 8 February 2006, with the refusal of the Plaintiff’s adjournment application, was to deprive the Plaintiff of an effective opportunity to appear and to assist the Court in the making of an important decision affecting the committal proceedings. As Howie J observed in McKirdy v McCosker at 225 (paragraph 31), such an application is an important part of the committal proceedings. The parties who appear on behalf of the prosecutor and the accused person are expected to assist the Court in the determination of the statutory question falling for determination: McKirdy v McCosker at 225 (paragraphs 29-31).  
     
      
    84 In my view, the Second Defendant was not assisted at all by the approach adopted by the Police Prosecutor on 8 February 2006. The passive stance of the Police Prosecutor has contributed to the defective approach adopted by the Second Defendant. I accept that Mr Bartlett was entitled to oppose the application for adjournment. He had complied with the order of the Court and was ready to proceed. The First Defendant was in custody. Erroneous information provided to the Court concerning the date when he served his s.91 application was, no doubt, a source of irritation to him. It would, however, have been helpful if he had informed the learned Magistrate that Ms Chapman had mentioned Mr Love’s injury in the context of the prosecution’s adjournment application. Nevertheless, it was not an ex parte application. The police prosecutor was purporting to appear for the prosecution on the application. I do not make any criticism of Mr Bartlett for his omission in this respect. 
     
      
    85 I have given careful consideration to the Plaintiff’s submission that a denial of procedural fairness occurred in this case. The refusal of an adjournment in this case left the Court with no prosecution assistance in the determination of an important question. In that sense, the Plaintiff was not given a reasonable opportunity to present his case on the s.91 application. Nevertheless, because the Police Prosecutor was purporting to appear for the Plaintiff, however ineffectively on that day, I do not find that a denial of procedural fairness occurred in this case. 
     
      
    86 However, I am satisfied that the Plaintiff is entitled to relief which he seeks on other grounds. 
     
      
       
      The ss.91 and 93 Hearing 
       
      
    87 In circumstances where the learned Magistrate had refused the adjournment and the s.91 application was proceeding, in reality, without any contribution from the Police Prosecutor, there was, in my view, a heightened need for the learned Magistrate to scrutinise the application. The power to make a direction under s.91 and s.93 is an exceptional one. The court is required to have regard to all the circumstances of the particular case to determine whether it is satisfied that there are “special reasons” in the “interests of justice” to require the witness to attend.  
     
      
    88 Here, there was an uncritical acceptance of the First Defendant’s written submissions as satisfying the statutory test. It was apparent from the written submissions that the First Defendant’s solicitor had available to him V’s statement, the photographs of V and other material apparently contained in the police brief. Where his Honour had determined to proceed without prosecution submissions or assistance on the application, it was incumbent on him to request that he be provided with that material. If the Police Prosecutor did not have it, then the learned Magistrate ought to have requested Mr Bartlett to make it available. It was, after all, the First Defendant who bore the onus of satisfying the statutory test.  
     
      
    89 It was not appropriate for his Honour to approach the matter in a manner which involved the First Defendant’s application being granted, as if by default. I am satisfied that is what happened in this case.  
     
      
    90 A proper examination of the written submissions made by the First Defendant raised a very real question as to whether the “special reasons” test could be made out at all in the circumstances of the case. It seems to me that the alleged inconsistencies referred to in the written submissions, on examination, were not inconsistencies of the type referred to in B v Gould and in Boumelhem, that is saying two things which were clearly inconsistent with each other. On the written submissions put forward for the First Defendant, there were areas where clarification was sought to see if there was an inconsistency. That is not the concept, in my view, referred to in B v Gould and Boumelhem. It will, of course, be a matter for consideration in the circumstances of each particular case whether the inconsistencies class of “special reasons” can be made out. It does not seem to me, however, on the matters raised in the written submissions, that this head of argument could be made out in this case.  
     
      
    91 I am satisfied that a constructive, if not actual, failure to exercise jurisdiction has been demonstrated on the part of the Second Defendant by his failure to seek and examine any part of the prosecution brief and, in particular, the statement of V and the photographs referred therein. 
     
      
       
      The ss.91 and 93 Decision 
       
      
    92 I am satisfied that the Second Defendant has failed to give reasons for his direction in a manner which attracts a grant of relief as sought by the Plaintiff. I accept that due allowance must be made for the ex tempore form of his Honour’s reasons: Acuthan v Coates (1986) 6 NSWLR 472 at 476; Lawler v Johnson at 9. I accept also that there is a degree of informality that attends proceedings before a Magistrate and that there are constraints imposed upon the Local Court and those who appear before it by reason of the workload of that Court and the desirability of having matters, especially those of an interlocutory nature, determined expeditiously: McKirdy v McCosker at 225-6 (paragraph 32).  
     
      
    93 Nevertheless, I am satisfied that what has occurred here is, to use the words of Grove J in Black v Director of Public Prosecutions at paragraph 28, no more than the adoption by the Second Defendant of “a rhetorical statement” made by the First Defendant’s solicitor and that a failure to exercise jurisdiction has resulted. There is a requirement to give adequate reasons on applications under this provision: Lawler v Johnson (paragraph 57). This is so, in my view, especially given the final nature of a s.91 direction, absent s.91(5) circumstances. The reasons in this case, in my view, suffer from “a lamentable lack of clarity”: Dawson v Director of Public Prosecutions at paragraph 28. The learned Magistrate did not analyse the material before him in a way that disclosed the process of reasoning that led to his conclusion that the prerequisites of ss.91 and 93 had been satisfied: Leahy v Price at page 10. 
     
      
    94 The reasons of the learned Magistrate do not disclose how a conclusion could be reached that the alleged inconsistencies are “redolent in the complainant’s statement” in circumstances where his Honour did not examine that statement. The items raised in Mr Bartlett’s written submissions do not appear to support such a conclusion. 
     
      
    95 Nor is any foundation revealed for the expression of opinion that “there is a real chance that doubt could be raised in the court’s mind as to whether any or all of the offences with which Mr O’Connor has been charged were actually committed by him and that is especially so given what it is that he contends is the true situation pertaining”. There is no identification in the reasons of what the alleged “true situation pertaining” is said to be. The submissions made on behalf of the First Defendant invited acceptance of this as being a reference back to what was allegedly said to the Second Defendant on an earlier bail application; namely, that despite the First Defendant’s clear and categorical denial of being in the room at all in his lengthy ERISP with police, that there was now a concession that he was in the room after all. I have already indicated that there is no evidence before me of that matter. However, the fact that one is left to engage in a process of surmise and guesswork to attempt to understand the learned Magistrate’s reasons points clearly to a failure to give reasons that discharge the legal obligation imposed on him on this application. 
     
      
    96 The requirement for proper reasons was even greater in this case given the Second Defendant’s determination that the application would proceed with no prosecutor assisting the Court and making submissions. It was necessary, in these circumstances, if the application was to proceed at all, that the reasons for this decision be properly and fully articulated. They were not. This approach contributed to the constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction which occurred in this case. 
     
      
    97 I am satisfied that the apparent rolled-up acceptance by the Second Defendant of the matters referred to in Mr Bartlett’s written submission as satisfying the “special reasons” test was also erroneous. Section 91(7) requires a Magistrate to reveal in reasons for giving a direction under the section, the matters which are said to satisfy the statutory test. There has been a failure of the type identified in Director of Public Prosecutions v Rainibogi (at paragraph 49) resulting from the Second Defendant’s failure to consider the matters raised separately, and then as a totality.  
     
      
    98 Mr Siva submitted that the appropriate course in this case, even if there was some question about the range of matters that could be the subject of permissible cross-examination of V, was to leave it to the Magistrate at the committal proceedings to exercise the power under s.69 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to terminate cross-examination on any particular matter if the Magistrate was satisfied that further cross-examination on that matter would not help the Magistrate to make a determination under ss.62 or 64 of the Act. I do not accept this submission.  
     
      
    99 In my view, it is necessary that there be a s.91 and s.93 application conducted according to law in this case. The very significant deficiencies identified in the present case should not be left to resolution during cross-examination of V. There should be a proper consideration, according to law, of the application that V be required to give evidence for the purpose of ss.91 and 93 of the Act. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    100 I propose to make an order in the nature of mandamus pursuant to s.69 Supreme Court Act 1970, and to quash the direction given by the Second Defendant on 8 February 2006. In the circumstances, I do not consider that it is necessary to make a declaration. Nor is it necessary to further consider the question whether a statutory avenue of appeal is available, by leave, under s.57 Appeal and Review Act 2001.  
     
      
    101 The Plaintiff has sought an order for costs against the First Defendant. Mr Siva submits that, given the contribution of officers of the Plaintiff to events that occurred on 8 February 2006, I should not make a costs order against his client in the event that relief was granted. 
     
      
    102 I am satisfied that an order for costs should be made against the First Defendant. He has participated in the hearing before me and resisted the grant of relief on all bases. I have held that relief should be granted to the Plaintiff. In my view, costs should follow the event. I will, however, grant to the First Defendant a certificate under s.6 Suitors’ Fund Act 1951.  
     
      
    103 I make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (a) the direction made by the Second Defendant on 8 February 2006 under ss.91 and 93  
      Criminal Procedure Act 1986  
      requiring V to attend to give evidence at the committal proceedings against the First Defendant is quashed; 
       
       
      (b) the matter is remitted to the Goulburn Local Court to be heard and determined according to law; 
       
       
      (c) the First Defendant is to pay the Plaintiff’s costs of and incidental to the Summons; 
       
       
      (d) the First Defendant is granted a certificate under s.6  
      Suitors’ Fund Act 1951 
      ; 
       
       
      (e) the order made by me on 1 May 2006 staying the committal proceedings until further order of the Court is dissolved; 
       
       
      (f) orders may be entered forthwith.

      2005/1393 REGINA v Shane John PARTINGTON 
       
       
       
       SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 28 February 2006 Shane John Partington was charged by way of indictment with the murder of Anthony Gaspardis on 27 August 2004. He pleaded not guilty and a jury was dually empanelled. On 17 March 2006 the jury found the offender not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. The matter was then stood over for sentence. A sentencing hearing was later convened at which both parties presented evidence relevant to sentence. I shall discuss that material a little later. First I should describe the circumstances in which Anthony Gaspardis met his death.  
     
      
    2 On 27 August 2004 the offender was living in a 2-story apartment building at 431 Marrickville Road Dulwich Hill. His apartment was on the upper floor. He lived there alone, although his girlfriend spent a considerable amount of time there with him. On the evening of 27 August his girlfriend, Miss Rafferty, was waiting for him at the apartment. He arrived home late and inebriated, and an argument developed between them. What happened during the course of the argument was explored during a voir dire hearing before the jury trial commenced. I do not propose to go into the details of it here but I accept that the offender became extremely aggressive, and that Miss Rafferty ran out of the apartment. The offender then also left the apartment and went to a nearby hotel, the Gladstone Hotel. There he joined the deceased, Tony Gaspardis, who had been at the hotel since about 3:30 that afternoon. They were both regular patrons at the hotel, and knew each other as drinking companions. 
     
      
    3 After a while the offender and Mr Gaspardis decided to go back to the offender's apartment in order to smoke some marijuana. The CCTV footage shows them leaving the hotel at 5 past 9. The offender did not have a key to his apartment as he had left in great haste after his argument with Miss Rafferty. He called out to Miss Joy Swan, who lived in unit 1 on the ground floor of the building, and she buzzed him and Mr Gaspardis into the main door of the building. The two of them then apparently went upstairs towards the offender's apartment. They were never going to be able to get into the apartment as the offender had left his key behind and Ms Rafferty had long gone home. 
     
      
    4 We will never know with certainty what happened after this. The offender gave evidence at his trial in which he described what he said took place between himself and Mr Gaspardis. But for reasons which will emerge later, I cannot accept his version. What we do know is that shortly afterwards there was a commotion outside the door of apartment number 3 at the bottom of the steps going up towards the offender's apartment. A school student, Leila Bourke, who lived in that apartment said that she first heard noises upstairs. Later there were loud banging noises immediately outside her apartment. The door to the apartment was being struck with considerable force. At the same time she heard the offender's voice shouting, ""fuck, fuck"", and another person moaning. The clear inference was that the offender was hitting someone hard against the door, probably by the head.  
     
      
    5 After a few minutes everything went quiet. When she opened the door she found Mr Gaspardis lying immediately outside her apartment. The offender was nowhere to be seen. She and her grandmother made a triple 0 call as a result of which first the police and later the ambulance attended the scene within a short time.  
     
      
    6 The offender was out in Marrickville Road when the police first arrived at the scene. He had in the meantime returned to the foyer where Mr Gaspardis was lying and had asked Miss Swan to call the ambulance. The first police to find Mr Gaspardis, which was a very short time afterwards, could find no sign of breathing, and CPR was attempted but was unsuccessful. I shall describe the extent of his injuries shortly.  
     
      
    7 The offender was taken to Newtown Police Station where he arrived at about 20 past 10. Sergeant Carmichael, who was the Custody Officer, at the time described the offender as being ""well intoxicated"" on his arrival. He had very bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, and was very emotional and crying. He told Sergeant Carmichael that he had had ""heaps"" that night. More than four hours later, at 2:30 the following morning, Sergeant Carmichael thought that he was still too intoxicated to be interviewed. It was not until 6 o'clock in the morning that Sergeant Carmichael considered that he was fit to be interviewed.  
     
      
    8 Sergeant Carmichael's description of the offender's state of intoxication is consistent with the offender's own account given to Dr Bruce Westmore that he had a consumed approximately fourteen to fifteen schooners of beer that day between about 4:45 and 9 o'clock in the evening.  
     
      
    9 No formal interview was conducted with the offender. However, in a conversation with Detective Thinius on the morning of 28 August he said that after an argument with his girlfriend he had gone to the Gladstone Hotel and then had come home and found Mr Gaspardis lying on the ground. Shortly afterwards the police had stopped him. He was asked why Mr Gaspardis would be at his unit and he answered that he must have been coming to see him as Mr Gaspardis knew no-one else in the building. This account of the events was patently false. The offender later denied this conversation, however, I accept the police evidence on this matter.  
     
      
    10 Mr Gaspardis was already dead when the paramedics attended at 431 Marrickville Road. Dr Botterill, who conducted the post-mortem examination, described numerous injuries to his facial area, including a fracture of the bones of the nose. He considered it probable that multiple points of contact would have caused these injuries, and at least moderate force would have been required to break the deceased's nose. On the back of the head there were approximately six separate areas of grazing, and within these areas there were two separate lacerations. Other injuries were noted on the deceased's back, and to the inside of his mouth. The immediate cause of death was a fracture of the second cervical vertebra with consequential damage to the spinal cord at that level, which the doctor said was probably caused by a forced forward flexion. Damage to the spinal cord at that level causes an immediate cessation of breathing. 
     
      
    11 Mr Gaspardis' blood alcohol reading was .280 grams per 100 millilitres, which Dr Botterill described as a very high reading; more than five times the legal limit for driving. The doctor said that how a particular individual would behave with such a high reading would largely depend on his or her tolerance to alcohol. However, many people would be close to comatose at that level.  
     
      
    12 The offender gave evidence at his trial. He did not dispute any of the Crown evidence as to what happened on the evening of 27 August before he and Mr Gaspardis went upstairs towards his apartment. He said that he was knocking on the door of the apartment and calling out to his girlfriend to let him in when for some reason Mr Gaspardis, who was standing behind him, became very agitated and told him to ""fucking hurry up"". Suddenly he felt a blow to the back of his head, he turned around and Mr Gaspardis struck him in the mouth. They then swapped punches. He said that he struck Mr Gaspardis three times around the face and head, and told him to ""fuck off"". Mr Gaspardis started to go down the stairs. 
     
      
    13 A little later the offender said that he heard a slipping noise and shortly afterwards everything went quiet. He went down the stairs himself and saw Mr Gaspardis lying outside apartment number 3. He panicked, so he started to pound on the door of that apartment. At the same time he was calling out ""fuck, fuck"", and Mr Gaspardis, who was lying on the ground, was moaning. 
     
      
    14 The defence called a biomechanical engineer, Mr Tom Gibson, in support of the offender's version. He said that the various head injuries sustained by Mr Gaspardis were consistent with his having fallen down the stairs whilst holding onto the railing. The grasp of his hand on the rail would have caused him to rotate during the fall and present the back of his head to the direction of the fall. The injuries to the back of his head, Mr Gibson said, matched the combination of surfaces and shapes in the corner where his body came to rest.  
     
      
    15 The defence also called Professor John Hilton, a highly experienced forensic pathologist, who said, inter alia, that the distribution of bloodstains and spatters at the scene were consistent with the scenario presented by the offender. 
     
      
    16 One of the problems with the offender's version was that it did not adequately explain the numerous injuries, particularly the facial injuries, sustained by Mr Gaspardis. Both Dr Botterill and Professor Hilton said that it would in all probability have taken more than three blows to cause these injuries. 
     
      
    17 The account given by the offender at his trial would, if accepted, have led to an outright acquittal, and the jury was directed to this effect. The verdict of guilty of manslaughter necessarily means that the jury rejected his version. This is not surprising in the circumstances. There were a number of aspects of the offender's account which strained credulity, not the least of them being that he professed to have an amazingly precise recall of minute details in a manner that is very difficult to reconcile with his high level of intoxication at the time.  
     
      
    18 The factual scenario I should accept, in the light of the jury's verdict is a significant matter to be determined on sentence, and I shall return to it shortly. In the meantime I should say something about the offender himself. He has had some terrible tragedies in his life, and I accept that these are at least partially responsible for his problems with alcohol and his numerous brushes with the law over the years.  
     
      
    19 The offender is now 36 years old, having been born on 4 January 1970. His upbringing was aptly described as ""dysfunctional"" in a presentence report from the Probation and Parole Service. He never knew his father, who had ended his relationship with his mother well before he was born. He had a half brother and sister from a different father who were more than 15 years older than him. He was initially raised by his mother and stepfather. His stepfather was an alcoholic who physically abused both him and his mother. He was also sexually abused by a neighbour. His mother died when he was 10 to 11 years old. His parenting was effectively taken over by his sister, who remains extremely close to and supportive of him. 
     
      
    20 The offender was not happy at school, and he left after Year 10. He commenced two apprenticeships but did not complete either of them. However, he has worked quite consistently over the years in generally unskilled manual occupations. 
     
      
    21 The offender has been abusing alcohol since about the age of 16. He suffers from lack of self-confidence, and has used alcohol to boost his assertiveness. Almost all of the offences in his very considerable criminal history were committed, it seems, when he was under the influence of alcohol. He first came before the courts when he was 16 years old. Between 1986 and 1990 he was convicted of numerous offences of break enter and steal, or break and enter with intent to steal. All were dealt with at Local Court level and all resulted in non-custodial orders.  
     
      
    22 Since 1990 his offences have predominantly involved acts of aggression on his part. Between 1990 and 2003 there were no fewer than seven convictions for assault, two for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and six for maliciously destroying or damaging property. There was a gap of 5 years in which no offences were recorded, when apparently he had a stable relationship with a woman and his children. Somewhat surprisingly, before the present offence, he had never served a term of imprisonment. 
     
      
    23 At the time of committing this offence he was subject to a 2-year bond to be of good behaviour entered in March 2003, and two separate suspended sentences imposed in December 2003 pursuant to s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. His record gives rise to two aggravating factors: Under para (D), that he has a record of previous convictions; and under para (J), that the offence was committed while he was on conditional liberty in relation to other offences.  
     
      
    24 The offender has had two previous relationships, as a result of which he has five children with whom he has little or no contact. His relationship with Ms Rafferty started several months before the offence. She has continued to be supportive of him, and they both say they are committed to the relationship.  
     
      
    25 It is clear that the offender's principal problem is with alcohol. As long as he remains alcohol free he is generally mild mannered and law-abiding. When he takes excessive alcohol his anger is liable to erupt into uncontrolled aggression. That in my view is what happened on this occasion, as I shall describe shortly. 
     
      
    26 The offender has acknowledged his problem with alcohol and has attempted various forms of rehabilitation over the years. However, as the circumstances of this offence indicate, he has at least so far always reverted to his heavy drinking. He also has a problem with depression, and since being in custody he has been taking anti-depressive medication which he says makes him feel more balanced. He has also been involved in organising a program which assists inmates in dealing with addiction known as the 'BASE Program'. However, his time in custody has not always been harmonious. His prison record shows two separate assaults, which he described in his evidence as effectively being self-defence. He says that he is determined to change.  
     
      
    27 In his evidence on sentence, the offender told Ms Betts that he accepted the jury's verdict. He professed deep remorse about the death of Mr Gaspardis. Remorse he also expressed in a handwritten letter which was tendered on sentence. However, under cross-examination by the Crown prosecutor the offender maintained his story that the only physical confrontation between himself and Mr Gaspardis was upstairs outside his apartment, and was initiated by Mr Gaspardis. He said that, having had a great deal of time to think about it, he accepted that the punches he had delivered to Mr Gaspardis at the top of the stairs were hard, and must have caused Mr Gaspardis to become dizzy, thereby causing him to fall down the stairs. He maintained his denial that he had ever struck Mr Gaspardis downstairs outside apartment number 3.  
     
      
    28 For reasons already given I cannot accept that version. Quite apart from the inherent difficulties in the offender's account, it is inconsistent with the jury's verdict. The jury was directed, as I already indicated, that if they thought there was a reasonable possibility that the offender's version might be accurate, then it followed that no action of the offender caused the death of the deceased, and they were to find him not guilty.  
     
      
    29 In the circumstances I find that the offender struck Mr Gaspardis on numerous times on the face, and also in accordance with the evidence of Leila Bourke, that he repeatedly struck Mr Gaspardis' head against the door of apartment number 3. It was the striking of Mr Gaspardis' head against the door which in all probability fractured his cervical vertebra, injuring his spinal cord, and directly causing his death. If it did not do so directly, it certainly did so indirectly when Mr Gaspardis fell to the ground. I do not accept that Mr Gaspardis initiated this confrontation. Given the extent of the offender's intoxication, the jury's verdict means that they were not satisfied that the offender was capable of forming the specific intention required for murder. 
     
      
    30 This, in my view, is by far the most likely factual scenario consistent with the evidence given at the trial, and with the jury's verdict. Indeed in oral submissions on sentence, as opposed to her written submission, Ms Betts did not seriously seek to argue against this factual scenario.  
     
      
    31 It was essentially a motiveless killing. There was no history of animosity between the offender and Mr Gaspardis. I accept that the offender exploded with uncontrollable alcohol fueled aggression, and Mr Gaspardis happened to be the unfortunate person who was in the vicinity at the time.  
     
      
    32 It was a great tragedy for many people. Mr Gaspardis' brother Romano and sister Karen gave moving victim impact statements setting out the devastating effects upon them and their families of Mr Gaspardis' unexpected and violent death. In accordance with s28 of the Act these statements were received and heeded but they have not been instrumental in the fixing of the appropriate sentence.  
     
      
    33 This brings me back to the question of sentence. Miss Betts has submitted there are several mitigating factors under s21A in this case. There is no doubt that this was not a part of a planned or organised criminal activity, and I take that into account under para (B). However, I cannot accept some of the other matters relied upon by Ms Betts. For example, I do not, as I already indicated, accept that the offender was provoked by the victim. Nor can I affirmatively find that the offender is unlikely to re-offend, or that he has good prospects of rehabilitation given his past record. Evidence was adduced that he wants to enter the William Booth program on his release, and that he has good prospects of doing so. It is a very good sign that he appears to have shown some real incite into his problems since his incarceration. One can only hope that this will translate into positive action on his release. I am afraid, however, that I have real misgivings about the genuineness of his expressed motivations and of his expressions of contrition. Nevertheless, I propose to give him the benefit of the doubt on these matters and assume in his favour that this offence has been something of a catalyst for him, and has made him reassess his future in a positive way.  
     
      
    34 Much will depend on his remaining alcohol free upon his release. He will require significant and ongoing assistance in this regard, and in my opinion this constitutes special circumstances which warrant the setting of a non-parole period considerably in excess of the proportion envisaged in sections 44(2) of the Act.  
     
      
    35 The maximum penalty for manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment. It is trite to say that this offence covers a wider area of culpability than virtually any other offence in the criminal calendar. It is for this reason that the legislature has not sought to specify a standard non-parole period for this offence. 
     
      
    36 In my view this was a most serious offence of its type. It involved gratuitous and unprovoked aggression with the tragic consequence that Mr Gaspardis met an untimely and violent death. Other than the fact that it was clearly unpremeditated, there are few, if any, mitigating circumstances relating to the offence as opposed to the offender. There are, as I have indicated, a number of significant mitigating factors relating to the offender personally. His high level of intoxication at the time has already been taken into account in that the relevant offence was reduced from murder to manslaughter.  
     
      
    37 The offender has been in custody since 27 August 2004, and his sentence must be backdated to that date. Shane John Partington, I set a non-parole period of 8 years to commence on 27 August 2004 and to expire on 26 August 2012. The balance of your term of imprisonment is to be 5 years, expiring on 26 August 2017. A total sentence of 13 years.

     RJP v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
      
      
    1 HIDDEN J: I agree with the orders proposed by Hislop J, substantially for his Honour’s reasons. However, I would respectfully adopt the reasoning of Kirby J in relation to ground 1, as I would his Honour’s additional observations in relation to ground 2. 
     
      
    2 KIRBY J: In this matter I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Hislop J. I agree with the orders proposed (that leave be granted but the appeal be dismissed), substantially for the reasons provided by his Honour. I should like to add certain additional comments. 
     
      
    3 In respect to ground 1, the applicant complains that the sentence imposed on count 1 of the second indictment failed to have regard to the youth of the applicant at the time of the commission of the offence. That count was a charge of carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 10 years, being the applicant's sister who was then aged 9 years. At the time the applicant was approximately 15 years (there being some uncertainty as to the date of the offence). 
     
      
    4 Having pleaded guilty before Solomon DCJ, the applicant was interviewed by the Probation and Parole Service. At the time of the interview he was 52 years old and recalling the events 37 years earlier. The Probation and Parole Report included the following statement: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In relation to the offences that occurred prior to him turning 14 years of age, he stated that he was unaware that his behaviour towards his sister was wrong. He claimed that by 14 years of age he began to realise that his behaviour was not acceptable."" 
        
       
      
    5 I accept that the reference to the applicant being 14 was an error and that he was differentiating between his state of mind before count 1 and his appreciation of the unacceptable nature of his conduct as he got older. 
     
      
    6 In sentencing on count 1 on the second indictment, his Honour was obliged to take account of the offences on the Form 1. Count 1 itself was plainly a serious offence. It carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment (s 67 Crimes Act 1900) (since repealed). It involved penile penetration of a girl aged nine years. Nonetheless, the applicant's immaturity, he then being 14 or 15 years old, was relevant. His immaturity was likely to have affected his ability to exercise self control. 
     
      
    7 The second and third offences on the Form 1, however, involving the same victim, were committed by the applicant when he was older. The third offence, for instance, was committed when he was about 18 years old. By then, he well knew his behaviour was unacceptable, as he acknowledged to the Probation and Parole Service. Although I believe the sentence of seven years with a non parole period of three years was high, given the immaturity of the applicant at the time of that offence, nonetheless, taking account of the offences on the Form 1 and the criminality they involved, the sentence was, I believe, within the sentencing range. 
     
      
    8 In respect of ground 2 (the application of s 21A(3)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999), the complaint made against the sentencing Judge was that he was bound to find that the applicant was unlikely to reoffend. 
     
      
    9 Certainly there was, on this issue, material which may have justified such a finding. As mentioned, the applicant was, at the time of sentencing, a man aged 52 years. He was being sentenced in 2005 in respect of conduct which had occurred between 1968 and 1987. He had also been sentenced in Queensland in respect of a similar offence in 1989. He was released in December 1991. There was no evidence of further offending behaviour between 1991 and 2005. 
     
      
    10 On the other hand, the nature of the offences, the length of time over which they had been committed, and the absence of a psychological report providing insight into the applicant's mind, made it unsurprising that his Honour should refrain from making the finding which it is suggested he was obliged to make. Like Hislop J, I find no error upon that basis.HISLOP J:  
     
      
       
      Introduction 
       
      
    11 On 7 March 2005 the applicant pleaded guilty on indictment to counts that: 
     
      
       
      (1) Between 25 November 1968 and 24 November 1969 he did carnally know JT, a girl under the age of 10 years, namely 9 years, contrary to the  
      Crimes Act 1900 
       s 67 (since repealed). The maximum penalty for the offence at the time of its occurrence was life imprisonment. 
       
       
      (2) Between 10 May 1974 and 1 August 1974 he did assault JT and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency on JT she then being under the age of 16 years, namely 14 years contrary to the  
      Crimes Act 1900  
      s 76 (since repealed). The maximum penalty for the offence at the time of its occurrence was 5 years imprisonment. 
       
      
    12 The applicant also requested that the sentencing Judge take into consideration on count (1) a further three charges of indecent assault of JT contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 s 76, on a Form 1 under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. These offences occurred when JT was aged 9, 10 and 12 respectively. The maximum penalty for each offence at the time of its occurrence was 5 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    13 JT was the applicant’s sister. The applicant was born on 25 April 1953. He was thus aged 15 or 16 at the time of the first offence. That offence involved indecent assault culminating in cunnilingus and penile vaginal intercourse. The charges taken into account in sentencing on count 1 essentially involved vaginal touching. 
     
      
    14 Count (2) occurred when the applicant engaged in digital penetration of JT and caused her to commit fellatio upon him. The applicant was aged 21 at the time of this offence.  
     
      
    15 On the same date the applicant pleaded guilty on a further indictment to counts that: 
     
      
       
      (1A) Between 1 October 1984 and 31 December 1984 he had sexual intercourse with TS without her consent knowing she was not consenting she being then under the age of 16 years namely 6 years contrary to the  
      Crimes Act 
       s 61D (since repealed). The maximum penalty for the offence at the time of its occurrence was 10 years imprisonment; and 
      
     
     
      
      (2A) Between 1 January 1987 and 4 May 1987 he had sexual intercourse with TS, a child then under the age of 10 years, namely 8 years contrary to the  
      Crimes Act 1900 
       s 66A (since amended). The maximum penalty for the offence at the time of its occurrence was 20 years imprisonment.  
       
      
    16 TS was a cousin of the applicant. The offences in counts (1A) and (2A) involved digital penetration. 
     
      
    17 The applicant also requested that the sentencing Judge take into consideration on count (2A) a further seven charges on a Form 1. These charges related to two offences of sexual intercourse without consent and five charges of indecent assault by the applicant against TS and two other female cousins. The victims were aged from 5 to 9 years at the time of the offences. Three of the offences involved digital penetration, the remainder vaginal touching and rubbing, on one occasion coupled with breast touching and on another occasion requiring the child to rub the applicant’s penis. The offences occurred between October 1973 and December 1986. 
     
      
    18 On 6 May 2005 Solomon DCJ sentenced the applicant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) On count (1A) imprisonment for 3 years to date from 7 March 2005 and expire on 6 March 2008.  
         
        (b) On count (2A) imprisonment for 5 years to date from 7 March 2005 and to expire on 6 March 2010. The offences against the cousins listed in the Form 1 were taken into account on this count.  
         
        (c) On count (1) imprisonment for 7 years to date from 7 March 2010 and expire on 6 March 2017 with a non parole period of 3 years to date from the commencement of the sentence and expire on 6 March 2013. The Form 1 offences against JT were taken into account on this count.  
         
        (d) On count (2) imprisonment for 2 years to date from 7 March 2010 and expire on 6 March 2012.  
        
       
       
      The result was that the applicant effectively was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment from 7 March 2005 to 6 March 2017 with a non parole period of 8 years commencing on 7 March 2005 and expiring on 6 March 2013.  
       
      
    19 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence.  
     
      
       
      The sentencing Judge’s findings 
       
      
    20 His Honour made the following findings in his remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) The applicant committed sexual offences against his sister when she was aged between 9 and 14 years of age and when he was aged between 15 and 21 years of age. He committed sexual offences against his cousins when they were aged between 5 years of age and 8 years of age and when he was aged between 21 years of age and 33 years of age. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The offences are serious offences as is reflected in the maximum penalties. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The applicant treated his victims in a cruel and callous way. He exploited his position in the family by breaching the trust reposed in him as a member of the family in order to systematically sexually abuse his sister and cousins over a long period of time for his own selfish sexual gratification. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) The applicant’s behaviour regarding his sister and cousins has had tragic consequences. Each of the victim’s lives has been severely impacted upon as a result of the applicant’s offences with the probability that the victims will suffer psychological sequelae from the applicant’s behaviour long into the future. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) The applicant has two other sexual assault offences on his record. On 15 August 1985 he was placed on 12 months probation for the offence of aggravated assault of a sexual nature and on 7 December 1989 he was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment for two offences of indecent dealing with a boy under the age of 14 years. 
        
       
       
        
        (6) The applicant has not re-offended since his release from custody in 1991. His Honour was unable to make a finding as to the likelihood or otherwise of the applicant re-offending. 
        
       
       
        
        (7) The probation and parole service pre sentence report indicates the applicant has expressed feelings of disgust and sadness in relation to his behaviour and expressed a willingness to participate in extensive sexual rehabilitation programs. 
        
       
       
        
        (8) The applicant has a good employment record. 
        
       
       
        
        (9) The applicant is entitled to a 20% discount on sentence for his guilty pleas.  
        
       
       
      The Application for Leave to Appeal 
       
      
    21 There are four proposed grounds of appeal. They are discussed hereunder. 
     
      
       
       
       
      Ground One – The sentencing Judge erred in failing to have regard to the youth of the Applicant at the time of the commission of the offences in respect of the victim JT. 
       
      
    22 The applicant was 15 or 16 years of age at the time of the commission of the first offence and 21 at the time of the commission of the last offence against JT.  
     
      
    23 His Honour was aware of the applicant’s age at the time of the offences as he made reference to it when reciting the agreed facts in his remarks on sentence. However he made no specific reference to the effect, if any, he accorded that fact in sentencing the applicant on count (1). 
     
      
    24 The youth of an offender may be relevant in the sentencing process. It is well accepted that in the case of youth, general deterrence and public denunciation usually play a subordinate role to the need to have regard to individual treatment aimed at rehabilitation – R v Dar (unreported NSWCCA 2 October 1997). Also, where youthful immaturity is a significant contributing factor to an offence, then it may fairly be said that the criminality involved is less than it would be in the case of an adult of more mature years – R v Hearne 124 A Crim R 451 at 458 [25]. This is because, with maturity, may come a recognition of the unacceptable nature of the behaviour and a greater ability to exercise self control. 
     
      
    25 A probation and parole pre sentence report which was tendered stated: 
     
      
       
        
        In relation to the offences that occurred prior to him turning 14 years of age, he stated that he was unaware that his behaviour towards his sister was wrong. He claimed that by 14 years of age he began to realise that his behaviour was not acceptable. 
        
       
       
      The applicant, at the time he was interviewed for the report, was 52 years of age and recalling events which had occurred many years before. It was submitted on appeal that the reference to age 14 may have been an error as the applicant had not been charged with any offence prior to age 15 or 16. This may have been the case, however no steps were taken to correct any supposed error at the sentencing hearing and the applicant chose not to give evidence. It seems to me unlikely the applicant was not aware prior to the commission of the first offence with which he was charged that such behaviour was not acceptable. 
       
      
    26 In any event I would infer from the pattern of repeat offending over many years that any immaturity by reason of his age at the time of the first offence was not a significant contributing factor to the offence as, with admitted knowledge that his behaviour was unacceptable, he persisted with such behaviour for many years thereafter. It is notable that counsel for the applicant on the sentencing hearing, in his written and oral submissions, advanced no argument that there should be any mitigation of penalty by reason of the applicant’s age at the time of the first offences. 
     
      
    27 The offence under count 1 was a significant offence which carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The offences which were taken into consideration on that count on the Form 1 were also serious. In my opinion the sentence imposed on this count was within the range open to the sentencing Judge. 
     
      
      Ground Two – The sentencing Judge erred in the application of s 21A(3)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
       
      
    28 Section 21A(3)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        (3)  
        Mitigating factors 
         
        The mitigating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows:  
         
        … 
         
        (g) the offender is unlikely to re-offend, 
        
       
      
    29 His Honour in his remarks on sentence said: 
     
      
       
        
        The offender has not re-offended since his release from custody in 1991. I do not have the benefit of any psychologist report, so am unable to make a finding as to the likelihood or otherwise of the offender re-offending. 
        
       
      
    30 The applicant submits that notwithstanding the absence of a psychologist’s report his Honour was obliged to make a finding favourable to the applicant as to the likelihood of him re-offending. 
     
      
    31 I do not agree. The subject offences had occurred over a period of many years. There had been other offences dealt with in the Queensland courts. His Honour noted the applicant had not re-offended since his release from custody in 1991. However the applicant chose not to give evidence. No report from a psychiatrist or psychologist was tendered on his behalf. The probation and parole service pre-sentence report was quite guarded in this regard. It noted the applicant had undergone a sex offender’s program while serving a custodial sentence in Queensland but concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        Although this program appears to have given him some insight into the dynamics of this behaviour, he still appears to have difficulty acknowledging full responsibility for his offending and would benefit from further participation in intensive programs. His expressed willingness to participate in further treatment is positive. 
        
       
      
    32 Whilst it may have been open to his Honour to make such a finding he was not bound to do so and in my opinion no error has been demonstrated in this regard.  
     
      
       
      Ground Three – The sentencing Judge erred in the application of the principle of totality. 
       
      
    33 His Honour was required by the principles set out by the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 to impose an appropriate sentence for each of the offences of which the offender had been found guilty and then to consider questions of concurrence, cumulation and totality.  
     
      
    34 In my opinion his Honour imposed appropriate sentences for each of the offences to which the applicant had pleaded guilty, particularly when regard is had to the serious additional matters which were taken into account. 
     
      
    35 The indictment in respect of JT related to offences in 1968 and 1974. The offences on the Form 1 relating to JT occurred between 1968 and 1972. The sentences imposed in relation to the two counts in respect of JT were concurrent.  
     
      
    36 The indictment in respect of TS related to offences in 1984 and 1987. The offences on the Form 1 relating to TS occurred in 1985 and 1986. The sentences imposed in relation to the counts in respect of TS were concurrent. 
     
      
    37 His Honour accumulated the sentences imposed on the indictment in respect of JT and the sentences imposed on the indictment in respect of TS. This, in my opinion, was appropriate. The offences were quite separate and distinct and occurred at least ten years apart. 
     
      
    38 The fact that there were offences on the Form 1 relating to offences against other cousins between 1973 and 1978 which were taken into account on the indictment relating to TS does not demonstrate error by his Honour in accumulating the sentences as he did.  
     
      
      Ground Four – The sentence is manifestly excessive 
      
    39 As is apparent from the nature of the offences and the sentencing Judge’s remarks on sentence these were extremely serious offences. The objective gravity of the offences and the need for general deterrence and retribution are such as to justify the overall sentences imposed by his Honour. This Court will intervene only if it be shown that the sentencing Judge was in error and then only if it forms a positive opinion that some other, more lenient, sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. In my opinion the applicant has failed to demonstrate error on the part of his Honour or that some other, more lenient, sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed. Accordingly, whilst I would grant leave to appeal, I would dismiss the appeal.

    40 I propose the following orders:

     Judgment 
      
      
    1 HODGSON JA: I agree with James J.2 JAMES J: John Galaxidis applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him in the District Court by his Honour Judge Phelan on 17 March 2005. The applicant had pleaded guilty to all of the counts in three indictments. These indictments, in the order in which they were first referred to in his Honour’s remarks on sentence, were:-(1) An indictment containing eighteen counts, charging the applicant with having, at various dates between September 2002 and November 2002, dishonestly obtained by deception for himself or for another a valuable thing or money or a financial advantage. The victim of the offences charged in the first 2 counts of this indictment was an entity called Suncorp Metway. Counts 3 to 18 in this indictment were charges of credit card fraud, that is charges of paying a debt or paying for goods or services by giving particulars of a credit card, without the cardholder’s permission.(2) An indictment containing one count only, charging the applicant with having on 21 September 2002 supplied a prohibited drug, methylamphetamine (20.3 grams).(3) An indictment containing one count only, charging the applicant with having in June 2002 dishonestly obtained by deception a financial advantage for a firm Nicks Cars, a business of which he was a proprietor. This charge was sometimes referred to in his Honour’s remarks on sentence as “the Porsche charge”.3 The applicant had pleaded guilty to all of the counts in the first indictment and the only count in the second indictment on 10 June 2004. The applicant had pleaded guilty to the charge in the third indictment on 1 November 2004, which was the date fixed for the commencement of his trial on that charge.4 The sentences imposed by Judge Phelan on the applicant were as follows:-For the offence charged in the third indictment, a fixed term of imprisonment of two years commencing on 10 June 2004 and expiring on 9 June 2006.For the offence charged in the second indictment, a fixed term of imprisonment of one year commencing on 10 June 2006 and expiring on 9 June 2007.For the offences charges in the third indictment:-On each of counts 1 and 2, a non-parole period of eighteen months commencing on 10 June 2007 and expiring on 9 December 2008 and a balance of term of eighteen months commencing on 10 December 2008 and expiring on 9 June 2010.On each of counts 3 to 18, a fixed term of imprisonment of six months commencing on 10 June 2007 and expiring on 9 December 2007.5 The total effect of the sentences amounted to head sentences of six years and fixed terms or non-parole periods of four and a half years.6 Dishonestly obtaining by any deception any money or any valuable thing or any financial advantage is an offence under s 178BA of the Crimes Act, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for five years. All of the counts in the first indictment and the only count in the third indictment were charges of offences under s 178BA.7 Supplying a prohibited drug, the only offence charged in the second indictment, is an offence under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for fifteen years. 8 In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge stated the facts of some of the offences in considerable detail and the facts of others of the offences only very briefly. In many of the offences a man named Kilpatrick had been a co-offender. The facts of the offences can be briefly stated as follows.Indictment 1Counts 1 and 29 In the case of each of the offences charged in counts 1 and 2 of the first indictment, a loan had been obtained from Suncorp Metway by a person named Alerton, who the sentencing judge described as a dupe and as a person being used by the applicant and others. In each case Alerton’s loan application to Suncorp Metway was supported by false documents, in the preparation of which the applicant and Kilpatrick had participated, in which Alerton’s income and assets were greatly overstated. 10 In the case of the offence charged in the first count, Suncorp Metway, having accepted Alterton’s loan application, advanced a sum of approximately $1,150,000 to enable the purchase of a property at Ewingsdale. It was proposed by the applicant and the co-offenders that the property would be re-sold and the applicant would share in the profits from the acquisition and resale of the property.11 In the case of the offence charged in the second count, Suncorp Metway, having accepted Alterton’s loan application, advanced a sum of about $190,000, ostensibly to enable the purchase of items of office equipment. However, the money advanced was otherwise disbursed, the applicant receiving some of it.Counts 3 to 1812 The applicant and Kilpatrick obtained from a corrupt bank officer details of credit cards with high credit limits, which had been issued by that bank. In each of the offences charged in counts 3 to 18, the applicant or someone on his behalf ordered goods or services over the telephone, paying for the goods or services by giving details of one of the credit cards. The cardholders had, of course, not given any permission for their cards to be used in this way. Indictment 213 The applicant, having been introduced to an undercover police operative, supplied to the undercover police operative 20.3 grams of methylamphetamine for a price of $1200. It was apparent from intercepted telephone calls that this drug transaction by the applicant was not an isolated transaction. Indictment 314 The applicant and Kilpatrick purchased a second-hand Porsche motor vehicle at an auction for a price of $130,410. The applicant fabricated documents purporting to show a sale of the Porsche motor vehicle by his firm Nicks Motors to a company associated with Kilpatrick for a price of $210,000, of which $15,000 had been paid as a deposit. Kilpatrick used the fabricated documents to obtain a payment of $195,000 from CBFC Limited, which was paid to Nicks Motors and then disbursed, mainly to Kilpatrick.15 On 11 March 2005, that is shortly before he was sentenced, the applicant signed a list of additional charges pursuant to Div 3 of Pt 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (“the form 1”). The form 1 was also signed by someone authorised to do so on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions. 16 The additional charges were thirty-one charges of dishonestly obtaining money by deception and one charge of receiving stolen property. 17 In a part of the proceedings on sentence conducted on 11 March 2005 the form 1 was tendered and marked as an exhibit. Judge Phelan asked the applicant whether he admitted his guilt to the additional offences and whether he wanted the court to take the additional offences into account (s 33(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) and the applicant replied in the affirmative to both questions. However, in this exchange in court between the sentencing judge and the applicant, none of the offences for which the applicant was to be sentenced was identified as being the principal offence, in dealing with which the additional offences were to be taken into account.18 On 11 March 2005, that is before he had actually sentenced the applicant, Judge Phelan signed a certificate on the form 1, certifying that he had taken into account the additional offences in dealing with the applicant for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug (that is, the offence charged in the second indictment). 19 However, the only reference to the form 1 in his Honour’s remarks on sentence is in a passage in which his Honour was dealing with the credit card offences charged in counts 3 to 18 in the first indictment, which were offences of the same type as almost all of the additional offences in the form 1. In this passage in his remarks on sentence his Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not propose to recite on to the record the details of the remaining counts involving the credit card fraud. I do note that the offender has asked me to take into account no less than thirty-two similar offences on a form 1 document, all of which relate to obtaining money by deception through that credit fraud and one of receiving stolen property. I propose to accede to that request”. 
        
       
      
    20 In the next paragraph of his remarks on sentence his Honour went on to observe that the credit card fraud would sooner or later have been detected.21 It seems to me quite likely that, notwithstanding the certificate signed by his Honour in which his Honour certified that he had taken the additional offences into account in dealing with the applicant for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, his Honour in fact took the additional offences into account in dealing with the applicant for the credit card offences.22 In his remarks on sentence Judge Phelan, after dealing with the objective facts of the offences, noted some of the subjective features of the applicant. The applicant had had an overbearing father and had suffered emotional and physical violence from his father. The applicant had worked in the family’s motor vehicle sales and repairs and panel beating business and had then become a successful businessman in his own right in similar businesses. The applicant had been a party to protracted civil litigation in the Supreme Court against his parents, which had strained his emotional and financial resources. The applicant consumed alcohol excessively. The applicant had no previous criminal history.23 In his remarks on sentence his Honour said that the applicant had entered into an arrangement with the bank which had been the victim of the credit card fraud to pay $15,000 as compensation for the credit card fraud. At the time of sentencing no payments under the arrangement had yet been made.24 In his remarks on sentence Judge Phelan said that aggravating factors of the offences were that they were committed in company, that they were part of organised criminal activity, that they had caused substantial loss and that there were multiple victims and a series of criminal acts.25 His Honour found that mitigating factors were that the applicant had no previous criminal convictions, that he had been hardworking, that he was unlikely to re-offend, that he had shown remorse and that “he had been oppressed by the over-governing paternal attitudes of his father”.26 His Honour said that the applicant was entitled to a significant discount for his pleas of guilty but his Honour did not quantify the amount of the discount he was allowing.27 His Honour found that there were special circumstances within s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in that the applicant’s imprisonment for the present offences was his first time in prison and in the applicant’s need for rehabilitation and supervision.28 When actually announcing the sentences he was imposing, his Honour said, with respect to counts 3 to 18 in the first indictment:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In relation to the balance of the matters on that indictment, having regard to the fact of his pleas of guilty, to his indication of preparedness to assist the authorities to give evidence and his agreement with the bank to repay the money referred to, I propose to make them concurrent with the first offence and impose in each case a sentence of six months imprisonment”. 
        
       
      
    29 Although these remarks were expressed as applying only to the sentencing of the applicant for the offences charged in counts 3 to 18 of the first indictment, I infer that his Honour took into account the pleas of guilty, the assistance and the agreement for compensation in the sentencing of the applicant for all the offences. 30 The assistance provided and to be provided by the applicant consisted in the applicant having made a statement incriminating the bank officer who had supplied details of the credit cards and his undertaking to give evidence in accordance with the statement at the bank officer’s trial.31 The only ground of appeal against sentence as lodged with the Court was:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The sentence imposed on the applicant was excessive in that his Honour: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) Failed to give any and/or due consideration to the totality and parity principles in imposing sentence. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) In failing to specify the discount for the applicant’s plea of guilty and preparedness to give evidence against another offender, the sentence imposed on the applicant did not sufficiently indicate that credit had been given for such discount”. 
        
       
      
    32 It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that the sentencing judge in sentencing the applicant for multiple offences had failed to apply the principles of sentencing stated by the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 623-624 (45) or the principles of sentencing stated by the High Court in Mill v The Queen  (1988) 166 CLR 59; that the sentencing judge had not had proper regard to the sentencing principle of totality; that the sentencing judge had not quantified any discounts he had allowed for the applicant’s pleas of guilty and the assistance provided by him and the length of the sentences indicated that his Honour had not really taken into account the applicant’s pleas of guilty or the applicant’s assistance; and that there was a lack of parity or proportionality between the sentences imposed on the applicant and the sentences imposed on the co-offender Kilpatrick.33 A submission, which had been made in counsel for the applicant’s written submissions, that the individual sentences were manifestly excessive, was expressly abandoned in counsel’s oral submissions. Such a submission could not have succeeded in relation to any of the sentences. In my opinion, all of the sentences, so far from being manifestly excessive, were very lenient. Indeed, if his Honour did, in accordance with his certificate, take into account the thirty-two additional offences in the form 1 in sentencing the applicant for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, the sentence imposed by his Honour for that offence was, in my opinion, manifestly inadequate.34 In Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616 the High Court held that, where a judge is sentencing an offender for multiple offences, the preferable course for the judge to adopt is that stated in Pearce of fixing an appropriate sentence for each offence and then considering questions of cumulation or concurrence and totality but that a judge is not necessarily prohibited from adopting an alternative course, in order to satisfy the sentencing principle of totality, of lowering the individual sentences below what would be otherwise appropriate and aggregating the individual sentences. See Johnson especially at pars 2 and 26.35 In the present case the sentencing judge had a difficult task in sentencing the applicant for so many offences. Some grouping of offences and some making of sentences for different offences completely concurrent with each other was unavoidable.36 However, features of the sentences set by his Honour, including the length of the sentences, the making of the sentence for the offence charged in the second indictment fully cumulative on the sentence for the offence charged in the third indictment and the making of the sentences for the offences charged in the first indictment fully cumulative on the sentence for the offence charged in the second indictment and the making of the sentences for the offences charged in counts 3 to 18 of the first indictment completely concurrent with parts of the sentences for the offences charged in the first two counts in that indictment, suggest to me that his Honour did not consistently adopt, either the course stated in Pearce, or the alternative course permitted by Mill and Johnson.37 Be that as it may, the ultimate question is whether the totality of the sentences imposed on the applicant fairly and justly reflected his total criminality See R v Weldon: R v Carberry (2002) 136 A Crim R 55. In my opinion, it could not be said, even after allowing for some favourable subjective features of the applicant, that the totality of the sentences passed on the applicant was manifestly excessive or even severe. On the contrary, I consider that it was lenient.38 Although sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify discounts for pleas of guilty and assistance, they are not obliged to do so R v Thomson, R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at 419 (160); R v Hovan [2005] NSWCCA 179. I would not infer from the short lengths of the sentences set by his Honour that his Honour failed to allow any discount for these matters.39 Kilpatrick, a co-offender in a number of the offences for which the applicant was sentenced, had himself been sentenced by Judge Phelan on 14 September 2004. All of the offences for which Kilpatrick was sentenced were offences under s 178BA of the Crimes Act. The sentences of imprisonment imposed by Judge Phelan on Kilpatrick were as follows:-40 For each of twelve offences, one of which corresponded to the offence charged in the third indictment against the applicant, a fixed term of two years.41 For each of forty-nine offences of credit card fraud, which would appear to correspond, almost entirely, with the sixteen credit card offences charged in counts 3 to 18 of the first indictment against the applicant and thirty-one of the additional charges against the applicant in the form 1, a fixed term of one year, wholly cumulative on the fixed term of two years but completely concurrent with each other.42 For each of four offences, two of which corresponded with the offences charged in the first two counts of the first indictment against the applicant, a head sentence of four years with a non-parole period of eighteen months, these sentences being wholly cumulative on the fixed terms of one year but completely concurrent with each other.43 The principles of parity and proportionality in sentencing co-offenders are well known and need not be repeated here. Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606; Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295.44 In sentencing the applicant Judge Phelan was mindful of the sentences he had earlier imposed on Kilpatrick. In his remarks on sentence in sentencing the applicant his Honour set out the sentences he had imposed on Kilpatrick and then commented that it was difficult to compare the two offenders, because their offences did not fully overlap.45 On this application it was submitted by counsel for the applicant that because Kilpatrick’s offences were more numerous, had been committed over a longer period and had caused greater financial loss, the applicant would have a justifiable sense of grievance because of the lack of a proper disparity between the sentences passed on Kilpatrick and the sentences passed on him.46 I do not consider that this submission should be upheld.47 Kilpatrick was not sentenced for any drug offence corresponding to the offence charged in the second indictment for which the applicant was sentenced. This offence under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for fifteen years.48 The sentence imposed on the applicant for the offence charged in the third indictment was the same as each of the sentences imposed on Kilpatrick for similar offences. Kilpatrick had pleaded guilty to all charges at an early stage in the Local Court. The applicant did not plead guilty to the charge in the third indictment until the day fixed for his trial in the District Court. I accept that Judge Phelan, very leniently, made all of the sentences imposed on Kilpatrick fully concurrent with each other.49 The head sentence imposed on the applicant for each of the offences charged in the first and second counts of the first indictment was three years. The head sentence imposed on Kilpatrick for each of the four offences he had committed was four years. I accept that Judge Phelan set the same non-parole period of one and a half years for both offenders.50 Kilpatrick was sentenced for each of forty-nine credit card offences to a fixed term of imprisonment of one year. The applicant was sentenced for each of sixteen credit card offences to a fixed term of imprisonment for six months.51 In the sentencing of the applicant for one or other of the offences for which he was being sentenced the thirty-two additional offences had to be taken into account.52 My examination of the sentences passed on the applicant and on Kilpatrick has not led me to conclude that applicant would have a justifiable sense of grievance or that there is a lack of proper proportionality between the sentences passed on the applicant and the sentences passed on Kilpatrick. In any event, the jurisdiction of this Court to intervene on grounds of lack of parity or proportionality is discretionary and, even if I considered that there was some lack of parity or proportionality, I would not consider, having regard to the leniency of the sentences passed on the applicant, that this Court should intervene. 53 I would propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal against sentence be dismissed.54 HOEBEN J: I agree with James J and the orders he proposes.

     ANDERSON, Noelene v REGINA 
     
     
     Judgment 
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted by a jury of the murder of her husband, Robert Keith Grosse at Rocky Point between 30 June 1995 and 31 July 1995. She appeals her conviction. She has also intimated an intention to seek leave to appeal against sentence but no ground of appeal has been directed to this issue.2 The trial from which this appeal comes was the second trial of the appellant for the offence. The first trial was the subject of an appeal to this Court which was upheld and a new trial ordered (see R v Anderson [2002] NSWCCA 194).3 The Crown case was the same at each trial. It was alleged that the appellant and the deceased were married and had lived together in a house at Rocky Point. The deceased was a bricklayer and the house was constructed on land owned by the appellant. The relationship between them had been turbulent and at various times the deceased had left the home to live in a caravan park. The deceased had a criminal record, including convictions for assaulting the appellant. During one of their physical exchanges the appellant had bitten the deceased's ear. The Crown also alleged that the appellant had, by means of false documents, secured a divorce from the deceased, of which he was unaware. 4 At some time before 1 July 1995, being the date upon which the Crown says the deceased was killed, the Crown alleged that the appellant decided that she would prefer a new partner and determined that it was necessary for her to kill the deceased. 5 On 30 June 1995 the deceased worked as usual for his employer. He was a reliable worker and the evidence disclosed that he drank little. On the following day, 1 July, the appellant drove the deceased to work where he appeared to other employees to be unwell and unable to walk unaided. He was not drunk. After discussion about taking him to Wyong Hospital, the appellant took the deceased away. The Crown alleges that the appellant took the deceased home where she took advantage of his weakened state, strangled him with a piece of cord or twine and buried him under a concrete slab under the house. 6 The appellant gave different accounts of the events of that day to different people. She did not acknowledge killing the deceased until much later. 7 On 3 July the appellant went to Goulburn where she met the man she proposed to live with, Mr Weaver, who was with his daughter, Carla. They stayed in a motel that night and on 4 July 1995 Mr Weaver and his daughter moved into the appellant's house. Mr Weaver remained for only a short period and on 19 July he left with his daughter and moved to a caravan park and then interstate. 8 The appellant gave a version of the events to the deceased's employer, Charles Frost. Frost reported the disappearance of the deceased and police inquiries were commenced. Of significance was the evidence of Margaret Blinman, who was a friend of the appellant. 9 In June 1995 the appellant told Miss Blinman that Mr Weaver was moving in on 4 July and that the deceased would have to go. On 2 July 1995 the appellant told Miss Blinman that she had driven the deceased to a medical centre and that he had then gone. The appellant gave a different version of the events to police. She told them that she had taken the deceased to Gosford railway station to enable him to go to a doctor in Sydney and that the deceased had telephoned her on 2 and 4 July 1995. Telephone records did not indicate that these calls had taken place and there is no evidence that medical assistance was sought. 10 On 24 July 1997 warrants were obtained, pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Listening Devices Act 1984, for the use of listening devices in the appellant's residence. On the same day a warrant was obtained to search the premises. The search was carried out and revealed the decomposed body of the deceased beneath a concrete slab under the house. 11 Thereafter in conversations which were recorded pursuant to the listening device warrants, the appellant admitted that the body the police had found was that of the deceased and that she had used some twine to strangle him. The appellant declined to be interviewed but made a handwritten statement to the police. 12 Relevant material in the statement is as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        ""I wish to make a statement regarding events on the Friday 11th July, I was making a sandwich & about to watch the Midday show, when Bob Grosse walked in the TV room door. He had a few whiska’s and extremely shabby, he said he'd been riding the train and meals you could pick up, somewhere near Oxford St & Newcastle, he asked how the new boyfriend was. I said there was nothing great and it was going no where. He proceeded to undress and offered himself to me. I said, youre dirty and unshaven and I don't know where you've been & I'm no longer your whore of the day. An argument started & I moved into the kitchen & proceeded to cut some yellow cord and knot it to tie up my peach tree. He was drinking from a small bottle from his pocket & proceeded to tell me I wasn't worth having a good fuck (his words) with. because Jan (my first husband) had spoilt and over-protected me. He said I needed a few kinky ideas, as normal his ideas & mine didn't mix. He reminded me I had nothing anymore and no fellow would want me with half a tit. This hurt & was hard enough to accept, I was just beginning to move about & feel a little normal again. I was tired of his choice words to me when drinking such as Im only a fucken cunt bitch. No one had ever spoken like this ever to me & I loathed this frequent phrase - especially when he had a drink or two. He began to rubbish my son Brett he was a little smartarse, because he built his own steel shed & home. He thinks he's got it all with his fat black widow, meaning his wife Sue. I wasn't at all impressed Brett never did nothing to him nor Sue. Even on our last holiday with them, when an argument erupted Bob began throwing punches. Brett said I won't hit an old man like you Bob said are you gutless too, Brett said get out & off the property and ordered me to take him and don't come back. Perhaps the words were slightly different, but meant the same. We packed & moved. I had a great closeness with Brett, he was always their to check my car, the battery, tyres, the motor every time I visited I didn't like abuse about him. Bob was still half dressed & offering himself among his foul outbursts & I couldn't cope with sarcasimn of Jan - as he was remarried and even at family funerals, we have no communication to-gether and so slinging off about our marriage back in 50-70 was a cutting point I have five children to this marriage & there were certain precious moments that didn't need destroying & I chose to keep these memories to myself. This was quite different to the filthy whore type sex he was talking about. He suggested I watch good videos & do things which I dislike & then said he should tie me up, Fuck me up the arse & then P all over me. Because I screamed get out, he picked up the cord & was going to choke me, like he should I done to Margaret. (his former wife.) We struggled when free I went outside I was hurt, angry, fed up & sick of life hated my breast operation and myself, I felt incomplete as a woman unloved & alone, none of my children were close to me & I couldn't unwind to Craig at the caravan park. About half an hour later I came inside he was at the table the bottle almost empty & he had a cup of tea. He sarcastickly said, is the garden the same, my house and me were alike and he hoped I'd lose it & thats why he never intended helping to pay it off & finish it I was again like my smart arse son Brett who knew it all.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        I walked to the table, picked up the cord, threaded the end & put it over his head & said how do you like it? The bottle fell as he grabbed at me & I pulled the cord. We scuffled he fell & I ran outside. I went to the car & used my spare key I drove to Lakehaven shopping centre. I was gone about two hours I think. I didn't know what he was doing or what I should do perhaps he'd left, or would be waiting. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        When I returned Bob was still on the floor. He had the knee tucked under his knee & his head was pulled back, the cord was twisted on his arm and around the shoulder.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        I rolled him on the floor and I knew he was dead.""  
        
       
      
    13 On 15 December 1997, in a telephone call, the appellant told Mr Weaver that she had poisoned the deceased and strangled him at the kitchen table on a date that was identified by him as 18 July 1995. 14 Post-mortem evidence from a forensic pathologist indicated that the circumstances of the death were consistent with strangulation by ligature. Because of the state of the deceased's body it was not possible to determine whether or not, as had been suggested, any poison or other substances had been ingested before he died. 15 On 4 November 2003 the jury found the appellant guilty of murder. On 19 December 2003 she was sentenced to imprisonment for 17 years commencing on 4 December 1999 and expiring on 3 December 2016 with a non-parole period of 11 years expiring on 3 December 2010.16 When sentencing the appellant the trial judge accepted evidence that the deceased had conducted himself in a violent way towards the appellant. However, he found that “the only conclusion which can be arrived at on the basis of the jury’s verdict, is that they rejected the prisoner’s account of the events of 18 July 1995 and in my view did so on the basis that they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the death of the deceased had occurred on 1 July and not 18 July and at a time when the deceased was unlikely to have been physically capable of the provocative conduct immediately preceding his death which the prisoner claimed.”17 The appellant gave evidence at her trial. She said that the deceased had returned to the house unexpectedly on 18 July (her statement had said 11 July) and had been abusive and offensive. He had put a rope around her neck and pulled it back and forth but he let it go and she went outside for a time. When she returned to the house she went to the bathroom and put some lanolin on her neck and then she returned to the kitchen and made a cup of tea. The deceased was sitting at the table drinking and was again verbally abusive and offensive. She threw the rope over his head, but he grabbed it, and then grabbed her, but she managed to escape and ran to the car. He was standing in the kitchen when she last saw him and she could hear him yelling at her as she ran away. She drove to a shopping centre but later returned to the house and found the deceased lying on the kitchen floor. She rolled him over and discovered that he was dead. She then buried him under a concrete slab under the house. The slab had been raised off the ground on wooden pegs. She knocked the pegs away and it fell onto the body. She said that she had forgotten what had happened but had begun to remember when shown a jumper belonging to the deceased which had been found under the house when the body was discovered. 18 She called evidence from a psychiatrist, Dr Hampshire, that what she had described was consistent with a condition known as psychogenic amnesia or repressed memory brought about by the trauma she had experienced and that seeing the jumper had triggered her memory of the events. 
     
      
      The appeal 
      
    19 The appellant has filed a notice of appeal containing seven grounds. She has also provided extensive and comprehensive written submissions. They relate to the grounds of appeal but contain various other matters which seek to explain her actions and concerns in relation to the trial. Those submissions are sometimes difficult to relate to the grounds of appeal. However, I have considered all of the matters which she raises when considering the various grounds. 
     
      
      Ground 1: “new evidence, miscarriage of justice, due to aggravating and exceptional circumstances.” 
      
    20 This ground of appeal has not been made clear. However, at page 34 of the appellant’s written submissions reference is made to “court evidence in Adelaide will prove that day, Thursday, he received custody of Carla and sold his furniture, some on that day.” The person being referred to is Mr Weaver who had lived in Adelaide but moved to New South Wales to live with the appellant. He was accompanied by his daughter Carla who was ordered into his custody. The reference to the day upon which Mr Weaver obtained custody and sold his furniture may be relevant to the day upon which he left Adelaide to come to live with the appellant. However, there was no issue in relation to this day at the trial and although there may be additional information in relation to Mr Weaver’s movements this would not constitute fresh evidence which could be relevant to the appellant’s conviction and appeal. 
     
      
      Ground 2: “Detective conspired and lied in the witness box – in assumptions and facts to coroner.” 
      
     
     
      
      Ground 3: “Invalid coroners reports and body parts not tested and identified, stating Clerke told him what to look for.” 
      
    21 It is convenient to deal with these two grounds together. Senior Constable Clerke was in charge of the investigation which led to the appellant being charged and prosecuted. He retired on medical grounds prior to the trial and did not give evidence. Evidence of the investigation was given by Detective Senior Constable Bridges. This seems to have been by consent and in any event the evidence which he gave was not controversial.22 It emerged in the cross-examination of Dr Oettle, the pathologist who performed the autopsy and prepared a report to the coroner that he had been provided with a document prepared by Detective Clerke on the circumstances of the deceased’s death which said that the appellant was behind the deceased when she applied the ligature to his neck. In the evidence-in-chief, counsel for the appellant objected to a question based on an assumption that she was behind the deceased. There was evidence that she had said she was beside him. The question was recast to accommodate the factual situation. The scenario described by Detective Clerke was incorrect as to the position of the appellant. However, I do not understand that this could have made any difference to the Doctor’s opinion.23 The appellant also complains that Detective Clerke told the doctor to look for evidence of strangulation and that the doctor conspired with the detective to falsely report evidence which would support that assertion. Complaint is made that the document may have been, perhaps unconsciously, influenced by what he was told. However, to my mind there is nothing sinister in the pathologist being briefed by the police on the evidence relating to the circumstances surrounding a person’s death. Neither of the pathologists called in the appellant’s case suggested that this was in any way a concern to him. Any inaccuracy in the information which the doctor was given has not led to any difference in the evidence and there is nothing to suggest that evidence was falsified or inappropriately influenced.24 The deceased’s body was not discovered until two years after his death and there was a significant amount of decomposition. Nevertheless some bodily samples were taken for analysis. The appellant referred in her submission to a black granular substance found in the mouth and oesophagus. There was no evidence that it had been tested to identify it. Dr Oettle thought it was possibly part of the decompositional changes or blood. 25 The only significance which the material had in the Crown case was that there was a break in it consistent with the application of a ligature but was in a different position to the groove under the mandible said to be consistent with application of a ligature from above which was the Crown case. Ultimately no real reliance was placed on it and neither of the pathologists called in the appellant’s case seemed to think that it had significance.26 In her oral submissions the appellant drew attention to the fact that there were three possible locations which had been identified for the application of the ligature. However, each location is consistent with the application of a ligature to the deceased which the appellant admitted she applied.27 In her oral submissions the appellant also made reference to the medical evidence which suggested that the deceased was suffering from arterial disease and may have died of natural causes. At the trial there was a difference of opinion between Dr Oettle and Dr Collins about whether there should have been further examination of certain organs under a microscope. Dr Collins said that given the extensive decomposition of all tissues it would still have been difficult to ascertain whether disease was present under microscopic examination. Dr Oettle was an experienced pathologist and it was for the jury to assess any criticism made of his evidence. This judgment was to be made by the jury in determining whether the Crown had excluded the possibility that the deceased had died solely from natural causes.28 Having regard to the jury’s verdict it must be accepted that the Crown had satisfied the jury to the appropriate standard that the deceased had not died solely from natural causes. In my opinion the appellant has not identified any reason why this finding was not open to the jury and was not properly made. 
     
      
      Ground 4: “Judge biased, stating forensic were not at death scene, yet two qualified forensic men from two different states – quote death is unascertained.” 
      
    29 During the course of his summing up the learned trial judge dealt with the way in which the jury must, as a matter of law, deal with any conflicts between the evidence of expert witnesses, in particular between on the one hand Dr Oettle called by the Crown and on the other hand Doctors Duflou and Collins called by the appellant. He concluded by saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “And where you have conflicting expert evidence from apparently well qualified experts within the field – and I do not think anybody in this case has challenged any of the qualifications of any of the doctors who gave evidence to give the evidence that they gave – then you would only be justified in acting on the evidence of the Crown’s witness when in conflict with the accused if you for good reason both positively rejected the accused’s evidence and positively accepted the evidence of the Crown. If you are of the view that there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence of the accused’s expert witnesses is correct on an issue favouring the accused, you should act on that evidence.” 
        
       
      
    30 One point of conflict was whether one of the post-mortem photographs, exhibit G, depicted a mark which Dr Oettle had said he had observed when he had examined the body where it had been discovered under the appellant’s house. He gave evidence that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Facial grooves present about the neck possibly due to posture, possibly due to clothing, and with one high one under the mandible – that’s high up on the neck – possibly due to a ligature.” 
        
       
      
    31 His Honour dealt with this evidence in the course of which he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Both Doctors Duflou and Collins were of the view that the conclusion that this was a ligature mark could not be arrived at, but by reference to this photograph, not by reference to what they had seen with their own eyes. What they are telling you is not what could not have been a ligature mark on the body, because they never saw the body. What they are telling you is that if you look at this photograph, Exhibit G, then they would not agree that this photograph depicts a ligature mark.” 
        
       
      
    32 He had earlier said of Dr Oettle that he was the only doctor called to see the corpse.33 In my opinion a careful reading of his Honour’s summing up makes plain that he was not summarily dismissing the evidence of Doctors Duflou and Collins. Dr Duflou accepted that attending the crime scene and conducting the autopsy provided the pathologist who did it with a significant advantage. Ultimately the evidence of Doctors Duflou and Collins was that they could not exclude causation of her death by ligature strangulation although in their opinion the autopsy finding did not exclude other causes of death.34 In relation to Dr Oettle his evidence at the trial did not express a concluded view as to the cause of death. He did indicate that he observed a mark which was possibly due to a ligature and that the position of the tongue was what he would expect if someone had been standing beside a person seated at a table and applied a ligature to their neck.35 However, a finding as to the ultimate cause of death in a medical sense was not possible on the evidence and in my opinion was not necessary. Although his Honour gave detailed directions on the law in relation to causing the death of another person the jury had available to it both the material from the listening devices, the admissions made to George Weaver and her own statement to the police. Those conversations included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""He called me (inaudible) I was half a woman because I had one and a half tit off and I was his. But, beggar's had to be choosers and things like that, you know. And when he talked about the way I looked shit. He came around and had a go at me and I was getting on (inaudible) why I was (inaudible) mixing it up with the one you tie up the custard apple.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (inaudible) and put it round the tree and pull it like I usually do and he come around (inaudible) there at me. And I just went off the deep end and (inaudible) called me a bitch (sounds like) strangled me (inaudible)."" 
        
       
      
    36 The appellant later said:  
     
      
       
        
        ""You know. (inaudible) the way I talk to men, so I just sat there and the rope was still out the back on the (inaudible) chair and I was (inaudible) picked it up, wrapped it round his neck (inaudible). And I just said how do you like it? That's what you've done to me a few times. Didn't like it back. And of course (inaudible). He fell on the floor and I went and got (inaudible) and picked up out the front of (inaudible) underneath that hole, put him in there and (inaudible).""  
        
       
      
    37 There was another conversation which was recorded when the appellant's mother was present, as were a number of other persons. One person is recorded as asking the appellant: ""Did you do it?"" Another person says: ""No, you're not"". The first person says, ""Why not? You shouldn't have told me. I never wanted to know.""38 The appellant says, ""You have to know. Wayne knows."" Another speaker: ""You shouldn't have told me. You can't lie now."" The appellant says: ""I'm not going to lie, I'm admitting it."" Another voice says: ""Why didn't you tell me ages ago?"" The appellant says, ""How could I?"" 39 The appellant then says, ""I did it, mum."" The mother asks whether there was a reason and says, ""I know you probably had a reason for it."" The appellant said, ""I did have a reason: he was so abusive that day. I've written a thing out and Clerke told me last night."" 40 Another speaker said, ""Did you tell Clerke?"" The appellant said:  
     
      
       
        
        ""Wouldn't let me home - no. I didn't want to talk to anyone till I told youse myself. He gave me till Monday and the weekend to work it out. I rang a priest last night: he was so fucking rude. He says, 'What are you doing ringing me at this hour?' and this morning I told him he was rude and I asked him who he was and he said, 'You're so evasive I don't know.'""  
        
       
      
    41 There was then a discussion about the circumstances followed by this statement by the appellant:  
     
      
       
        
        “He come in here and he threatened me. And he was going to strangle me and do things. He was forever telling me about Ian, how Ian protected my sex life, he didn't have kinky ideas and things; he rubbished Brett and he went on and on. He picked up a piece of cord that I was going to tie a peach tree up with; he was going to strangle me. I got away from him and went outside, and when I came back he was drinking at the table and the cord was there and I went over and I thought, 'I'm sick of this, I'm sick of everything.' I put the cord, looped the cord and I shoved it round his neck and I said, 'How do you like this?' and he was drinking and in between drinking and everything - and I pulled it hard, and he fell on the floor, and I ran out the door and went to Lakehaven. When I came back he was on the floor.""  
        
       
      
    42 In these circumstances there was more than adequate evidence to support the jury’s conclusion that the acts of the appellant had caused the deceased’s death. 
     
      
      Ground 5: Provocation ignored demoralising the appellant and ignoring witnesses, AVOS, former wife’s statements and AVOs and medical reports from appellant. 
      
    43 The original trial of the appellant failed because of the directions given by the trial judge in relation to provocation. At the second trial the judge gave extensive directions on provocation and analysed the appellant’s case at length in relation to relevant factual matters. With the assistance of the Crown’s submissions it is possible to identify the following complaints which the appellant now makes in relation to matters of provocation: 
     
      
      (a) the trial judge should have directed the jury to find that the issue had been decided in favour of the appellant or at least make a special recommendation that they do so; 
       
      (b) his failure to do was because he was biased against her; 
       
      (c) the jury erred in disregarding provocation; 
       
      (d) the judge erred in ignoring the deceased’s crude sexual assaults. 
      
    44 The appellant’s submission appears to be based on an erroneous premise. The trial judge has no power to direct a jury to make particular findings or make any special recommendations in the circumstances of this case. There was cogent evidence which the jury could accept that there was no relevant provocation which occurred on the day the deceased met his death. The appellant’s credibility was in issue having regard to the fact that she had concealed the body and told the police that she did not know where the deceased was. If the jury was satisfied, as it plainly was, that the appellant had killed the deceased on 1 July it was open to the jury to conclude that he was suffering from significant physical disability on that day and the allegations of his conduct made by the appellant were false. The failure of the judge to act as requested by the appellant does not indicate bias.45 There are difficulties in identifying the substance of submission (c). However, it may be that the appellant maintains that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied that the appellant was not provoked, the onus being on the Crown. Put another way the appellant submits that the verdict of guilty of murder found by the jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence: see M v The Queen (1984) 181 CLR 487; Jones v The Queen (1994) 191 CLR 439 and MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606.46 When summing up to the jury the trial judge clearly accepted that the conduct of the deceased, alleged by the appellant to have occurred, could well have amounted to provocation in the relevant sense. However, critical to this issue was whether or not the jury accepted the appellant’s word that these events occurred as she related them. The jury’s verdict can only be explained on the basis that the appellant’s evidence was rejected. 47 In relation to para (d) above there was no evidence given by the appellant of sexual assaults by the deceased. However, there was evidence of assault and violence and evidence of sexual behaviour which the appellant found unpleasant or distasteful. His Honour reminded the jury of these matters. There is no basis for the appellant’s complaint. 
     
      
      Ground 6: “Depression and illness as per Dr Hampshire. Pursuant to Mental Health Act.” 
      
    48 Dr Hampshire, a psychiatrist, gave evidence that in his opinion the appellant’s claimed loss of memory of the death of the deceased and of her concealment of his body until it was discovered by police was consistent with a condition known as psychogenic amnesia or repressed memory brought about by the trauma of the events she described as occurring on 18 July 2005. Also consistent with this condition was her re-remembering which commenced when she was shown a jumper belonging to the deceased on the day his body was exhumed. The point of this evidence was to explain why she had told police in August 1995 that she did not know where the deceased was. He was also of the opinion that she had a borderline personality disorder and had previous dissociative states and probably a conversion disorder. These conditions were apparently frequently found in people who suffered psychogenic amnesia. He did not, in the evidence he gave, diagnose depression or any other mental illness. The appellant’s written submissions also refer to automatism but Dr Hampshire made no mention of that. 49 His Honour dealt with Dr Hampshire’s evidence during his summing up. There was evidence that conflicted with the claimed loss of memory. Mr Weaver gave evidence that on 19 September 1995 the appellant told him that she had received a telephone call from the deceased. If this evidence was accepted it would suggest that she had not been suffering a loss of memory but inventing a cover story. The jury was not bound to accept her evidence or Dr Hampshire’s evidence. In relevant respects the appellant’s evidence must have been rejected. 
     
      
      Ground 7: “Appellant gave her home temporarily for Grosse to recover debts to his caravan and not guilty of murder or harm as accused.” 
      
    50 This ground of appeal is unclear. It may, as the Crown suggested, be a reference to the appellant’s previous good character. However, this matter was dealt with by the trial judge in his summing up.51 As the Crown acknowledged, in her written submissions the appellant stated that “Mr Bellanto (who was her counsel) failed to allow self defence or seek duress and stress.” This may be understood as a further ground of appeal, namely that senior counsel for the appellant at her trial was negligent in failing to raise self defence as an issue and in failing to raise duress and stress. 52 During a break in the summing up his Honour asked counsel whether self defence was an issue because of something said in defence counsel’s address to the jury. However, defence counsel indicated that his remarks had been directed to the question of provocation and he had never approached the case on the basis that self defence was available. Certainly, the appellant’s own account of what occurred did not raise this issue. Although she alleged the deceased had used a rope around her neck she did not, at that stage, respond by attacking the deceased. Instead, she said she went outside and returned later when although she said the deceased was angry and offensive she did not suggest that he was violent.53 In these circumstances I do not believe it can be suggested that counsel in any way failed to competently conduct the appellant’s defence. There was no basis for a claim of self defence. 
     
      
      Application for leave to appeal against sentence 
      
    54 I have already remarked that although an appeal on this ground was suggested no submissions were made in relation to it. 55 A review of the trial judge’s remarks on sentence makes plain, in my opinion, that the sentence which his Honour imposed was appropriate. His Honour was mindful of the fact that the appellant had undergone multiple trials which included a trial between the first and second jury verdicts which was aborted. He also allowed for her advanced years and the deterioration in her health.56 However, he found that the murder was premeditated from the early hours of 1 July 1995 and was explained by the appellant’s desire to make way for Mr Weaver to reside in the house. Having regard to the objective circumstances of the offence as found by the trial judge and in respect of which no error has been demonstrated, I am satisfied that notwithstanding the appellant’s subjective circumstances no other sentence was warranted in law. 
     
      
      ORDERS: 
      
    57 In my opinion the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. The application for leave to appeal against sentence should be granted but the appeal dismissed.58 JAMES J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.59 HALL J I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

2716643,Adler v R [2006] NSWCCA 158,"Judgment


	
	McCLELLAN CJ at CL: On 16 February 2005 the applicant pleaded guilty to an indictment containing the following counts:
	


Count 1 (s 999 count)

On 19 June 2000 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did disseminate information that was false in a material particular and was likely to induce the purchase by other persons of securities, namely ordinary shares in HIH Insurance Limited (HIH) when at the time of disseminating the said information he knew that it was false in a material particular (s 999 Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)).

Count 2 (s 999 count)

On 20 June 2000 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did disseminate information that was false in a material particular and was likely to induce the purchase by other persons of securities, namely ordinary shares in HIH, when at the time of disseminating the said information he knew that it was false in a material particular (s 999 Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)).

Count 3 (“BTS” count)

Between 3 October 2000 and 11 October 2000 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales with intent to obtain for Business Thinking Systems Pty Ltd (BTS) money, namely the sum of $2 million did make and publish statements which he knew to be false in a material particular (s 178BB Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)).

Count 4 (“BTS” count)

On 29 November 2000 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, being a director of a corporation, namely HIH, was intentionally dishonest and failed to discharge his duties in good faith in the best interests of HIH in that, having a financial interest in Business Thinking Systems Pty Ltd (BTS), he attended a meeting of directors of HIH which ratified an investment of $2 million in BTS, remained present and participated in the discussion, but failed to disclose adverse information about the investment or information about the financial position of BTS known to him to be relevant to that ratification which he knew should have been disclosed, contrary to s 184(1)(b) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).


	
	The maximum penalty prescribed for each of the offences is five years imprisonment and/or in the case of the offences under the Corporations Act a fine of $20,000.
	
	
	The applicant pleaded guilty to the s 999 counts in the Supreme Court on 16 February 2005. On the same day the applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the BTS counts and was committed for sentence. The applicant adhered to his plea to the BTS counts in the Supreme Court on the same day.
	
	
	On 14 April 2005, the applicant was sentenced as follows:
	


In relation to counts 1 and 2, imprisonment for two years and six months concurrent with each other and to commence on 14 April 2005 and expire on 13 October 2007;

In relation to count 3, imprisonment for a fixed term of twelve months, such sentence to be wholly concurrent with the sentence imposed on count 4 and to commence on 14 October 2006 and expire on 13 October 2007; and

In relation to count 4, imprisonment for three years, the sentence to be partly concurrent and partly cumulative on the sentences imposed on counts 1 and 2 and to commence on 14 October 2006 and expire on 13 October 2009.


	
	Accordingly, the overall sentence imposed was imprisonment for four years and six months with a non-parole period of two years and six months.
	
	
	The sentencing judge fixed a single non-parole period in respect of the Federal offences (counts 1, 2 and 4) and a fixed term in respect of the State offence (count 3) having regard to what would otherwise have been the non-parole period for that offence. His Honour indicated that he did this recognising the interplay between the Commonwealth and State sentencing regimes and to avoid possible errors of conflict and confusion in their administration.
	


The facts – s 999 counts


	
	The sentencing judge made findings of fact which in relation to the s 999 counts are relevantly as follows:
	


“Over three days in June 2000 the applicant caused Pacific Eagle Equities Pty Limited, (PEE) a company of which the applicant was sole director and secretary, to purchase large parcels of shares, in HIH Insurance Limited using funds that had been advanced to PEE by HIH using a trust known as the Australian Equities Unit Trust. The applicant caused notices to be sent to the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) in which he was reported as having a ‘relevant interest’ in the acquired HIH shares.

On two consecutive days shortly after the purchase of the HIH shares, the applicant knowingly disseminated false information to a journalist with the Australian Financial Review (AFR) in relation to these share purchases.

On the first occasion (19 June 2000 – count 1) the applicant made statements that ‘fostered and encouraged’ the journalist’s mistaken belief (based on the ASX notices) that the applicant, a non-executive director of HIH, had purchased the HIH shares the subject of the ASX notices on his own behalf.

The false information disseminated by the applicant was published in the AFR the following day.

On the second occasion (count 2) the applicant, having seen the article in the AFR on 20 June, not only chose not to correct the inaccuracies in the article, but also went further and made blatant, direct and ‘totally untrue’ statements to the effect that he was purchasing the HIH shares with his own money.

The substance of the applicant’s untrue statements was published in the AFR the following day.

The applicant at the time had a prominent media profile as a director and shareholder of HIH and as an experienced, active, successful, and large-scale investor with a diverse array of investment interests.

The statements made to the AFR journalist were likely to be reported.

The statements were likely to induce others to purchase shares in HIH.

It was the applicant’s intention in making the misleading statements to induce others to purchase shares in HIH so as to cause a rise in the share price.

The HIH share price did rise following the statements – to a high of $1.21 on 11 July 2001.

The applicant stood to benefit from a rise in the share price in two ways; the first because it helped to position him as Mr Williams’ successor as CEO of HIH; the second being that the applicant held a large parcel of HIH shares the value of which would increase as the share price increased.”


	
	His Honour summarised the nature and objective seriousness of the s 999 counts in the following way:
	


“The offences are serious and display an appalling lack of commercial morality. The dissemination of false information concerning the real purchaser of the HIH shares and the source of the funds for such purchases had the potential to, and I am satisfied did in fact, distort the market in HIH shares and I have no doubt that the statement “I am putting my money up which shows I believe in the industry” coming as it did from a director of the company with a reputation for shrewd investment, would have induced people, particularly small investors, to purchase HIH shares. Many, if not all, of such people would have lost their money when the company collapsed.”


	
	The applicant gave evidence during the sentence hearing. As his Honour observed, the applicant’s evidence was directed at attempting to explain and justify, at least partially, his actions. These attempts were largely unsuccessful and his Honour rejected most of the applicant’s explanations and justifications.
	


The facts – BTS counts


	
	His Honour made factual findings in respect of these offences as follows:
	


“The applicant had an effective 35-38.5% interest in a company called Business Thinking Systems Pty Limited (“BTS”). HIH also had an indirect 15-16.5% interest in BTS.

In September 2000 BTS was suffering severe cash flow difficulties.

A plan by BTS to raise $8 million or $5 million by a capital raising through Foster Stockbroking in the latter part of 2000 was unsuccessful and by October 2000 no funds had been raised.

On 29 September 2000 the applicant wrote to Ray Williams of HIH and requested HIH to invest $2 million in BTS. The correspondence contained two materially false statements.

(i)   BTS was $2.5 million short of funding the capital raising of $5 million (whereas in fact having raised no money it was $5 million short);

(ii)   The applicant would put in another $500,000 (whereas he had no intention and did not invest any money in the fundraising).

On 10 October 2000 the applicant forwarded to Mr Williams at HIH a letter from John Vamos of BTS that falsely acknowledged receipt by BTS of $500,000 from the applicant.

Of the $2 million paid by HIH to BTS, $50,000 was paid to the applicant as a brokerage fee for arranging the $2 million investment by HIH and $400,000 was paid to a company (Pacific Mentor Pty Limited) which was owed money by BTS and which the applicant had an effective 70% interest in.

The applicant made the false representation about his intention to invest $500,000 so as to improve his chances of getting HIH to invest $2 million.

The HIH board met on 29 November 2000 to consider, inter alia, whether to ratify the $2 million investment. The applicant intentionally and dishonestly failed to disclose information relevant to the board’s deliberations, including the dire financial position of BTS (it had incurred substantial losses and was effectively insolvent) and his misrepresentations to Mr Williams to obtain the investment in the first place.


	
	The sentencing judge summarised the nature and objective seriousness of the BTS counts in the following terms:
	


“The BTS matters are equally serious. They also display a lack of commercial morality and the telling of lies for business purposes, expressly in the case of the third count and by non-disclosure in the case of the fourth count. On top of that, they were offences committed by a director of the company where the company was itself the victim. Directors are not appointed to advance their own interests but to manage the company for the benefit of its shareholders to whom they owe fiduciary duties. Accordingly to obtain money from the company by false representations and then to attend a Board meeting and compound the earlier offence by not disclosing the misrepresentation or the deterioration in BTS’ position since the advance, but actively talking it up as a good investment to secure ratification for the transaction, constitutes very serious breaches of the duties of a director.

In relation to the misrepresentations the subject of the third count, the offender described them “in a broad sense” as “stupid errors of judgment” in an effort to cut corners. They were not stupid errors of judgment but deliberate lies, criminal and in breach of his fiduciary duties to HIH as a director. The amount of money fraudulently obtained from the company ($2m) was large. “


	
	As with the s 999 counts the applicant sought, when giving evidence, to explain and justify his actions in relation to the BTS counts. His Honour rejected these explanations.
	


Civil Penalty Proceedings


	
	Prior to the commencement of criminal proceedings against the applicant for the offences contained in counts 1 and 2, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) took civil penalty proceedings against the applicant, a company in which he held an interest, Adler Corporation Pty Ltd, Williams and Dominic Fodera, an officer of HIH, for alleged breaches of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). The proceedings were heard and determined by Santow J in ASIC v Adler & Ors [2002] NSWSC 171; (2002) 168 FLR 253; (2002) 41 ACSR 72 and thereafter were considered on appeal by the Court of Appeal: (Adler v ASIC; Williams v ASIC [2003] NSWCA 131; (2003) 179 FLR 1).
	
	
	Santow J made the following orders:
	


(a)   The applicant was disqualified from managing a corporation for a period of 20 years;

(b)   The applicant, Williams and Adler Corporation Pty Ltd were ordered to pay compensation to HIH Casualty & General Insurance Limited of $7,986,402.

(c)   The applicant was ordered to pay a pecuniary penalty of $450,000.

(d)   A pecuniary penalty of $450,000 was also imposed against Adler Corporation Pty Ltd.

Subjective and mitigating matters


	
	His Honour made a number of findings with respect to subjective and mitigating matters. His Honour referred to the testimonials which were tendered which spoke of the applicant as a good and committed husband and father who had given generously to charity and assisted persons in difficulties. At the time of the commission of the s 999 counts the applicant had no prior convictions, but by the time he committed the BTS counts had committed the s 999 counts and the civil contraventions and accordingly his Honour found could not be regarded as a person of good character “in the business sense.”
	
	
	The applicant’s pleas of guilty to the BTS counts were early pleas, however his pleas to the s 999 counts were not.
	
	
	Whilst his Honour found the applicant to have expressed remorse he also found that remarks made by the applicant during his evidence suggested that he did not really acknowledge to himself the full extent of his wrongfulness in “the business sense.”
	
	
	His Honour found that the civil penalty proceedings brought by ASIC which I consider later were only indirectly concerned with the dissemination of false information to the AFR journalist and this aspect of the applicant’s conduct played only a small part in the disqualification and no part in the orders for compensation or pecuniary penalty imposed by Santow J.
	


The appeal


	
	There are nine grounds of appeal.
	


Ground 1 – in fixing the sentences imposed in relation to counts 1 and 2, being offences alleging a breach of s 999 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), his Honour erred in finding that the false statements made by the applicant induced small investors to purchase shares in HIH and that such investors lost their money when HIH collapsed. There was no evidence to support such findings.


	
	The applicant identified error in the passage which I have already quoted from the remarks on sentence (see para [8] above). In particular the findings that the applicant’s statements “would have induced people, particularly small investors, to purchase HIH shares. Many, if not all, of such people would have lost their money when the company collapsed” are challenged, and it was submitted that these findings were not open to his Honour on the evidence.
	
	
	The applicant emphasised that there was no evidence tendered to his Honour from investors who said that they had purchased HIH shares because of the statements made by the applicant. It follows that there was no evidence before his Honour that any person suffered loss as a consequence of the statements made by the applicant.
	
	
	The evidence which was before his Honour established that on 15 June 2000, four days prior to the first false statement made by the applicant, HIH had made an announcement to the ASX dealing with concerns expressed in the market concerning the company’s capital adequacy, its investments and its business strategy. The evidence indicated that some brokers considered that announcement to be positive in so far as investors in HIH were concerned. The closing price of HIH shares on 15 June was 7 cents higher than the closing price on the day before the announcement leading to the inference that the share price had risen because of that announcement. On 15 June, and the immediate following trading days, the volume of HIH shares traded on the ASX was greater than on 14 June, the day before the announcement. However, trading decreased over each of those days. Accordingly, it was submitted that the announcement of 15 June by HIH was the factor which both positively impacted on the share price and caused an increase in trading volume rather than any statement by the applicant.
	
	
	During the course of the hearing before this Court we were informed by counsel for the applicant that there had been an arrangement between the prosecutor and counsel for the applicant before the sentencing judge that evidence would not be tendered on the issue of whether or not the publication of the false information had caused persons to buy shares and thereafter lose money. Accordingly, it was submitted that the prosecutor carefully chose his words when he submitted to the sentencing judge that “there is a real possibility that Mr Adler’s statements did in fact cause people to purchase HIH shares.” In response counsel for the applicant said:
	


“One thing is clear. The Crown does not assert, because it has not proved, that the market price was in fact strengthened or that others in fact were encouraged to buy or indeed enter the market as a result. It is that factor, absent from these proceedings, which in my respectful submission distinguishes these proceedings from any of the authorities which my friend advances not by way of analogy I know but by way of background.”


	
	Notwithstanding this submission being made on behalf of the applicant counsel for the Crown said later:
	


“The Crown case is that there was an intention to get people to buy, and we have made a submission that there was a real possibility that people may have purchased, and in para 9(e) of our submissions today we have drawn attention to the evidence of Mr Adler. He said that it was fair to say that the second article might influence some investors. Now, in para 11 this is directed to a – it is a submission that the misleading – or the false statement did not cause HIH to advance the money.”

Consideration of ground 1


	
	The evidence before his Honour in relation to share trading in HIH revealed that in the days in June, prior to 15 June, the share price had fallen from $1.15 on 1 June to 95 cents on 14 June. Trading volumes varied from a low of 656,935 shares on 2 June to 2, 317,122 shares on 9 June. On 15 June the share price closed at $1.02 and a total of 4,932,662 shares were traded. In my opinion, there being no other explanation provided by the evidence, the applicant’s submission that the share price rose at this time in relation to the announcement by HIH is correct. It would be expected that the impact of that announcement persisted for a period of time and this is confirmed by the trading figures. The shares traded again on 16 June and rose 1 cent but only 2,258,193 shares were traded. On 19 June the share price closed at $1.02 and 1,854,953 shares were traded.
	
	
	The publication of the false information provided by the applicant was first made on 20 June. On that day the share price closed 1 cent lower but 3,089,015 shares were traded. On 21 June when the second untrue statement was published in the AFR 3,065,421 shares were traded and the price rose to $1.03. Thereafter the price continued to rise reaching its high point on 17 July 2000. After 21 June the maximum shares traded on any day occurred on 23 June 2000 when 3,723,507 shares were traded and, although trading remained brisk for a few days, it proceeded to decline significantly after that time.
	
	
	Of these matters the sentencing judge said:
	


“Not only were the statements which he made to the journalist, and which were therefore likely to be reported, likely to induce other persons to purchase shares in HIH, but I am satisfied that such was his intention so as to cause a rise in the share price, as in fact it did, rising as high as $1.21 on 11 July 2000 before commencing its final decline.”


	
	Having regard to the charges his Honour’s finding in relation to the applicant’s intention could not be challenged. The applicant clearly intended to influence the market in a positive direction. His Honour’s finding that the share price rose in the manner which he indicated is also correct. It is merely a reflection of the evidence of the trading in HIH shares which was before him. Furthermore, if as I am satisfied his Honour intended, he has found that the rise in the share price could be related to the information provided by Mr Adler and published in the AFR I am satisfied this is correct. Both the volume of shares traded and the movement in the price, in the absence of evidence of any other explanation, would lead to the inevitable inference that Mr Adler’s intention had, at least to some degree, been effected. Although it is apparent that the announcement by HIH on 15 June also impacted on the market its impact had clearly begun to dissipate by the time Mr Adler’s statements were published. Having regard to the evidence before his Honour the inference that there was a rise in the share price because of the applicant’s remarks was irresistible.
	
	
	It is at a later point in his remarks on sentence that his Honour expressed the view that is challenged in ground 1. In my opinion, having regard to the evidence before his Honour the findings which he made were open. Although corporate and large investors would no doubt have access to a variety of information there could be little difficulty in accepting that small investors would be influenced by stories in the AFR indicating that a well-known investor, shareholder and director of HIH was acquiring substantial shares in the company. Any person who purchased shares after reading the articles in the AFR would have to have sold again before 7 September 2000 if they were to avoid losing money. Whether this happened the evidence does not indicate, although, having regard to the relatively rapid decline in the share price it would seem inevitable that some persons would have held them beyond the short period in which they could have made a profit.
	
	
	It was submitted that before his Honour could have made any of the challenged findings evidence from persons expert in analysing the market would have been required. However, his Honour was not told of any possible evidence and was unaware of the agreement between counsel. His Honour, of course, would not have been bound by any agreement in any event (see Gas v The Queen (2004) 217 CLR 198). In the absence of any other evidence his Honour was required to analyse and make findings having regard to the evidence before him. That evidence, in my opinion, supports all of his Honour’s findings except for the finding that “many, if not all would have lost their money when HIH collapsed.” Although a finding that some person would have lost money would have been uncontroversial, to identify “many” or “all” as having lost, to my mind, goes beyond a finding which was open on the evidence.
	
	
	However, that finding is not critical to his Honour’s assessment of the criminality of the applicant’s actions. The criminality is adequately described by the finding that the applicant intended to influence the market and by so doing induced persons to buy shares in HIH, at the same time knowing that his representation was false.
	


Ground 2 – in fixing the sentences imposed in relation to counts 1 and 2, his Honour erred in finding that the false statements by the applicant caused the price of HIH shares to rise. There was no evidence to support such a finding.


	
	I have considered the factual matters relevant to this ground of appeal. I am satisfied that having regard to the evidence which was before him his Honour’s finding that the share price rose in response to the applicant’s false statements was available.
	


Ground 3 – in fixing the sentences imposed in relation to counts 1 and 2 his Honour erred in attributing to the applicant an intention to induce other persons to buy shares in HIH, based upon a finding of a causal link between the false statements by the applicant and the rise in the share price.


	
	I have already considered the elements of this ground. I am satisfied that it was open to his Honour to find that the applicant intended his statements to cause the share price to rise and furthermore that it did rise.
	


Ground 4 – in fixing the sentences imposed in relation to counts 1 and 2, his Honour erred in failing to give adequate weight to the principle of double jeopardy having regard to the orders made by Justice Santow in civil penalty proceedings taken against the applicant by ASIC.


	
	I have referred in [13] and [14] to the civil penalty proceedings before Santow J.
	
	
	The evidence before the sentencing judge was that the applicant had paid the pecuniary penalty in orders (c) and (d) as well as the amount of compensation in (b). In total the applicant paid $8,886,402 in compliance with the orders made in the civil penalty proceedings. The Crown conceded that there was no likelihood that the applicant would recover any funds from Williams under any right of contribution he might have had against him.
	
	
	In explaining why and how he had paid all of the compensation the subject of order (b) as well as the pecuniary penalties, the applicant gave evidence that at the time he did not have the funds to meet the full amount, and had received advice that he could legitimately go bankrupt as a consequence of the orders that had been made. He gave evidence that in order to make the payments he sold a number of businesses and assets, and borrowed funds. He gave further evidence that “honouring the Court’s orders was more important that the value of the money”, and that “going bankrupt was not something that sat nicely with him.”
	
	
	The sentencing judge considered the relevance of the civil penalty proceedings in his remarks on sentence and expressed the following conclusion:
	


“Those proceedings were only indirectly concerned with the dissemination of false information to Mr Mellish: see [2002] NSWSC 171, 41 ACSR 72 at [151] to [156] and this aspect of his conduct played only a small part in the order for disqualification imposed by Santow J, and no part in the orders for compensation or pecuniary penalty. Nevertheless, some regard must be had to the order for disqualification to avoid any element of double punishment, but only to a very minor degree. It is to his credit that he paid the fine and compensation rather than avoiding it as he probably could have done by transferring assets or declaring himself bankrupt.“


	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour erred in concluding that the conduct the subject of counts 1 and 2 had “no part” in the making of the order for pecuniary penalty against the applicant. The applicant also submits that his Honour erred in only having regard to the orders made in the civil proceedings “to a very minor degree” when sentencing the applicant.
	
	
	In the judgment of Santow J in which the orders for disqualification, compensation and pecuniary penalties were made, his Honour first considered factual matters of general application. His Honour noted that the civil penalty proceedings concerned nine “transactions” or “episodes” that were said to have given rise to the breaches of the Corporations Act 2001. His Honour noted that those nine “transactions” or “episodes” were grouped into four “sets” of transactions. Two of those “sets” were the $10 million investment into the trust known as the Australian Equities Unit Trust, and the purchase of shares in HIH by the trust, out of part of the $10 million. The conduct that was relied upon in counts 1 and 2 related to the false statements made by the applicant to the effect that he was the purchaser of the shares.
	
	
	From [24] to [28] of his reasons for judgment Santow J set out further findings in relation to the applicant. The applicant emphasized that at [24] his Honour referred to the finding as to the applicant’s purpose in buying the shares. It is submitted that although the sentencing judge’s finding on that issue was different to that of Santow J’s, and is the subject of challenge by the applicant in this application, the fact that both judges had regard to what they found was the applicant’s purpose behind the share purchases, when determining penalty, demonstrates the overlap between the two proceedings. At [27] his Honour referred to the findings he had made in his earlier judgment against the applicant concerning false impressions that the applicant had conveyed to financial journalists and the press, and to the market generally through his notices under s 205G of the Corporations Act 2001. It is submitted that these references by his Honour are direct references to the conduct by the applicant encompassed in counts 1 and 2 and, in so far as his Honour had regard to the false impressions conveyed to journalists, focused upon the acts that gave rise to the criminality contained within the offences ie the making of relevant false statements to the journalist Mellish.
	
	
	His Honour’s consideration of matters relevant to disqualification begin at [53]. At [58] Santow J set out a number of matters which he took into account in making the disqualification order against the applicant. They include the false impression given to journalists as to the purchase of the shares, what was said to be the applicant’s intention in creating that false impression, the false impression given to Mellish as to the source of the money being used to buy the shares, and the fact that the applicant made no attempt to correct the misleading impression given by the press publicity to the statements he had made. It is submitted that these are all matters that the Crown relied upon for proof of counts 1 and 2 and went to the heart of the criminality contained in those counts.
	
	
	His Honour concluded the discussion of disqualification at [12] and then turned attention to matters of compensation concluding that discussion at [124]. Santow J then commences his consideration of matters of penuniary penalty and at [140] and [141] says:
	


“Taking all these matters into account, but particularly the seriousness of the contraventions and the dishonesty apparent in them, I have concluded that pecuniary penalty orders should be substantial. They should reflect that there were in reality four sets of transactions as I have earlier identified. I have sought to apply the totality principle in a way that would act as a personal and general deterrent but is not oppressive, bringing to bear what the High Court has referred to in sentencing as an ‘instinctive synthesis’ of relevant factors: see Wong v R (2001) 185 ALR 233 at 252, [75]. Thus so far as Mr Adler is concerned, I conclude the aggregate total of the pecuniary penalty orders should be $450,000 and likewise for Adler Group the aggregate of the pecuniary penalty orders should be $450,000. The subsequent arithmetic allocation of those penalty orders between the applicable contraventions (…) unavoidably involves some artificiality but can be done here. I would prefer to characterise each aggregate of $450,000 as operating in practice as a single penalty against each of Mr Adler and Adler Corp for all contraventions as Finkelstein J did in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Ltd, at [38]. In applying the totality principle, where the penalty is pecuniary, it is clearly not open to me to avoid the problem, just as it was not open to Finkelstein J, by accumulation or concurrency orders. Were I to use the so-called division method, then each contravention would produce the relevant fraction of the total figure.

In articulating how that total figure is arrived at beyond the ‘instinctive synthesis’ earlier referred to, I should simply say this: One might reasonably characterise the circumstances as involving four sets of transactions which unbundled, produces nine in all. Each gave rise to multiple contraventions. An appropriate outcome in totality is to impose pecuniary penalties aggregating as I have done.”


	
	It was submitted that accordingly when imposing the pecuniary penalty order against the applicant, Santow J, at [140] and [141], must be understood as taking into account all of the findings he had made in relation to the conduct of the applicant summarised earlier in his judgment.
	
	
	Accordingly, it is submitted that a proper reading of Santow J’s judgment establishes that his Honour did have regard to the conduct which formed the basis of counts 1 and 2 in fixing the pecuniary penalty imposed upon the applicant.
	
	
	In my opinion, the applicant’s submission should be rejected.
	
	
	The close relationship between the civil penalty proceedings under the Corporations Act 2001 and criminal proceedings was acknowledged by the High Court in Rich & Anor v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2004) 209 ALR 271. In passages in the joint judgment at [32] and in the judgment of McHugh J at [41], [43], [48] to [58] their Honours indicate that the proceedings have many similarities. The factors and matters taken into account in imposing civil penalties under the Corporations Act 2001, are in many instances identical to the factors and matters taken into account when imposing sentence.
	
	
	In Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 the High Court considered the essential elements relevant when sentencing an offender. In relation to the matter of double punishment the court emphasized that it can only occur where there are common elements in two or more offences for which an offender stands convicted. In the joint judgment of McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ their Honours said:
	


“To the extent to which two offences of which an offender stands convicted contain common elements, it would be wrong to punish that offender twice for the commission of the elements that are common … to punish an offender twice if conduct falls in that area of overlap would be to punish offenders according to the accidents of legislative history, rather than according to their just deserts.”


	
	In the present case the civil penalty proceedings were concerned with contraventions of s 180, 181, 182, 183, 208 and 260A of the Corporations Law in relation to the applicant’s involvement with the payment of $10 million to PEE to fund the HIH share purchase and the share purchases themselves. Those provisions concern directors’ duties and financial assistance for the purchase of the company’s own shares. None of the elements of those provisions overlap in any way with the elements of the offences for which the applicant pleaded guilty in these proceedings. None of those provisions involved proof that the applicant had disseminated false information that was likely to induce others to purchase securities. Santow J was required to consider and make findings in relation to the applicant’s conduct which may have been relevant to the matters for which he was sentenced which included background facts relevant to the present proceedings. However, the civil penalty proceedings were directed to an aspect of wrongdoing quite distinct from the wrongdoing addressed by the s 999 counts in the indictment in these proceedings.
	
	
	Similarly, in these proceedings, whilst the facts before the Court included the advancing of the $10 million to PEE and the purchase by the applicant of the shares, those facts were mere background to the focus of the charges, which was on the dissemination of false information that was likely to induce others to purchase securities.
	
	
	I am satisfied that Santow J had regard to the applicant’s conduct in disseminating false information for a very limited and defined reason that had nothing to do with punishing the applicant for that conduct. It is true that Santow J accepted ASIC’s submissions that these matters were part of a course of “persistent lies and deceit and the associated impropriety” and are included in the summary findings, which are extensive in [58] of his Honour’s reasons. However, this conduct and the many other indicia of dishonesty considered by Santow J, were relied upon merely to characterise the nature of the applicant’s breach of his duties as dishonest. His Honour took these matters into account, not to punish the applicant, but only in determining the appropriate length of time that the applicant should be disqualified from being a director.
	
	
	When considering the appropriate order for disqualification his Honour, Santow J, had clearly in mind that it was to serve “a public protective purpose.” His Honour said this purpose must “clearly be paramount.” His Honour furthermore identified that the order should not be disproportionate to the public protective purpose it is intended to serve, for that indeed would be punitive, “it would subvert that public purpose if private interest considerations were to prevail or preclude an order which went no further than necessary to serve that public purpose.” [80]
	
	
	When Santow J came to determine the appropriate pecuniary penalty orders he did so, as he was required to do, by consideration of the contraventions which ASIC had charged. After referring to those contraventions and the dishonesty apparent in them his Honour determined the appropriate pecuniary penalty orders. This is apparent from [140] of his Honour’s reasons which I have previously set out and the position of that paragraph in the structure of his Honour’s reasons.
	
	
	Accordingly, I am satisfied that the sentencing judge was correct when, in his remarks on sentence (see [56]), he identified the fact that the dissemination of false information had played only a minor part in the order for disqualification and no part in the orders for compensation or pecuniary penalty.
	
	
	In having regard to the fact that the applicant had been disqualified by Santow J, in my opinion the sentencing judge appropriately addressed the possibility of double punishment.
	


Ground 5 – in fixing the sentences imposed to counts 1 and 2 his Honour was in error in that he failed to observe the principles in R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383.


	
	The principle in De Simoni was stated by Gibbs CJ in the following terms at 389 and 392:
	


“… the general principle that the sentence imposed on an offender should take account of all the circumstances of the offence is subject to a more fundamental and important principle, that no one should be punished for an offence of which he has not been convicted.

… where the Crown has charged the offender with, or has accepted a plea of guilty to, an offence less serious than the facts warrant, it cannot rely, or ask the judge to rely, on the facts that would have rendered the offender liable to a more serious penalty.”


	
	The applicant had previously been arraigned in the Supreme Court on an indictment which apart from counts 1 and 2 included three counts alleging a breach of s 997 of the Corporations Act 2001 which are commonly referred to as “market manipulation.” An essential element of those counts is that the acts charged were carried out “with the intention to induce other persons to buy securities.”
	
	
	When sentencing the applicant the sentencing judge, as I have indicated, made findings that the applicant in making the false statements intended to induce persons to buy HIH shares and that this conduct did in fact “distort the market.” These findings were concerned with the nature and circumstances of the offence provided by s 16A(2)(a) of the Crimes Act 1914 and were matters which required consideration when sentencing for that offence. They did not constitute an offence for which the applicant was not convicted and did not render the applicant liable to a more serious penalty. It is plain that the sentencing judge’s findings were not sufficient to constitute a breach of s 997 which is concerned with the person who carries out two or more transactions with the intention of inducing others to buy securities. That offence has nothing to do with the offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty being the dissemination of false information.
	
	
	There is no merit in this ground of appeal.
	
	
	Grounds 6 and 10 were not pressed.
	


Ground 7 – in fixing the sentences imposed in relation to counts 1 and 2, his Honour was in error in specifying a starting point of imprisonment for a period of 3 years and 6 months, against a statutory maximum of 5 years, as reflecting the objective criminality.


	
	The maximum term of imprisonment for the offences in counts 1 and 2 is five years. The applicant emphasised that the offences were unplanned, in the sense that the applicant did not make contact with the journalist in order to have his false statements disseminated to the market. He gave evidence that he had an expectation that he would be contacted by a journalist upon the filing of his notices under s 205G of the Corporations Act but there was no certainty that this would occur. If there had been no journalistic contact the offences would not have been committed. In that sense the offences, although premeditated, were not planned.
	
	
	The applicant also pointed to the fact that although the applicant stood to make a financial gain from his offences this did not occur. In fact he held a significant number of shares in HIH but did not sell them until months after the false statements were made and when the share price of HIH had collapsed. He gave evidence that his total loss as a consequence of that collapse was of the order of $10 million.
	
	
	The applicant referred to the decision in R v Goward, (unreported NSWCCA 16 October 1998) where the offender made a formal statement to the press containing a false assertion that the directors had not sold shares in the company over the previous two months. There was also evidence of Mr Goward’s financial benefits obtained as a consequence of the false statements made to the market. Goward was sentenced with a minimum term of 2 years and a non-parole period of 10 months reduced to 8 months on appeal.
	
	
	Reference was also made to the decision of R v Thomson [2003] VSCA 164. In that case the offender was sentenced in relation to three counts under s 999 of the Corporations Act 2001. The false statements relied upon were made by a director in documents seeking funds from investors. The sentencing judge found that less than $100,000 had been subscribed by investors as a result of the false statements. The sentencing judge imposed a term of imprisonment of one year on each count to be served concurrently. His Honour found that the false statements were not made with a deliberate dishonest intent but had been made “with a considerable degree of recklessness.”
	
	
	Since the applicant was sentenced Kirby J has imposed sentence in the matter of R v Loiterton [2005] NSWSC 905 in relation to one count under s 999 of the Corporations Act 2001. The offender made a statement which he knew was materially misleading. The statement was contained in a formal announcement to the ASX by the offender who was the Chairman of the relevant company. The announcement suggested that an agreement that the company had entered into would produce $13.5 million in cash for the company at a time when it was in financial difficulty. The offender had taken deliberate steps to conceal the true nature of the agreement from other directors. The statement, being a formal announcement to the ASX, was found by his Honour to have been made by the offender in the hope that it would receive widespread publicity and positively affect the share price. In the proceedings before Kirby J the offender denied he knew at the time that the announcement was misleading, although Kirby J found that he did. Kirby J commenced the computation of sentence at 3 ½ years and imposed a sentence of 3 years after allowing 15% for the plea of guilty. A non-parole period of one year six months was imposed.
	
	
	It was submitted that the objective criminality of Loiterton was greater than that of the applicant. In Loiterton the statement was by a chairman of a public company, was in a formal announcement to the ASX and was made at a time when the company was in financial difficulties.
	
	
	I do not accept the applicant’s submission. In the applicant’s case the statements which he made were found by the sentencing judge to be “totally untrue”, “blatant” and “direct.” His Honour found that they were intended to induce persons to purchase HIH shares and drive up the share price. His Honour found that the offences displayed “an appalling lack of commercial morality.”
	
	
	In my opinion it is not correct to identify the offences which the applicant committed as unplanned and the sentencing judge did not do so. The applicant conceded that he expected that a journalist would contact him in relation to the shareholder notices. Plainly, as the sentencing judge found, when the applicant made the false statements he did so knowing that it was likely that the statements would find their way into the public domain. This is undoubted in relation to the second statement. In these circumstances it would not be appropriate to describe the offences as unplanned or merely opportunistic.
	
	
	There are always difficulties in endeavouring to identify common elements between offenders when considering an appropriate sentence. This is particularly the case in relation to crimes involving commercial dealings where the nature of the transaction and the manner of commission of the offence can vary considerably. However, I am not persuaded that the facts of counts 1 and 2 are of a lower degree of criminality than the facts in the Loiterton matter.
	
	
	When sentencing in relation to counts 1 and 2 his Honour started with a sentence of three years and six months but provided a discount of approximately 15% to take into account “all aspects” of the applicant’s plea. The result of a 15% discount should have been a sentence of imprisonment just short of three years (35.7 months or 2.97 years). Instead, the sentence which was imposed was two years and six months, a discount of just over 28.5%.
	
	
	To my mind a discount of that order was inappropriate. The plea was not entered at the earliest opportunity and to my mind a discount of more than 15% was not appropriate. Accordingly, even if his Honour erred in the starting point, and I am not persuaded that he did, the ultimate sentence imposed was not excessive.
	
	
	I have identified error in his Honour’s finding in relation to persons who acquired shares because of the applicant’s statements, “many, if not all would have lost their money when HIH collapsed.” However, in my opinion that error was not significant in the overall sentence. The applicant’s actions motivated by his own personal commercial ambitions and financial aspirations involved criminality of a high order and I am satisfied that no sentence other than that which was imposed was required by law.
	


Ground 8 – in fixing the sentence imposed in relation to count 4, being an offence in breach of s 184(1)(b) of the Corporations Act 2001, his Honour failed to give adequate weight to the applicant’s plea of guilty.


	
	In relation to both counts 3 and 4, his Honour noted that the proceedings concerning those charges had been “fast-tracked” so that pleas of guilty had been entered by the applicant in the Local Court prior to any formal committal proceedings having been held in that jurisdiction. His Honour correctly described the pleas to counts 3 and 4 as “early pleas.”
	
	
	His Honour determined that in relation to “all aspects of the pleas of guilty” to counts 3 and 4 a discount of 25% should be allowed. The applicant now submits that given the fast-tracking of the proceedings in the Local Court, the timing of the pleas, and his Honour’s findings as to contrition, a greater discount for the plea of guilty to count 4 should have been allowed.
	
	
	This Court considered the matter of pleas and appropriate discounts in relation to State offences in R v Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 where it was indicated that, although there would be exceptions, a discount of the order of 25% would be the maximum which may be appropriate. A discount of that order acknowledges all of the matters relevant to the applicant in the present case. That discount was at the very top end of the appropriate range and to my mind no error is revealed.
	


Ground 9 – in fixing the sentences imposed in relation to count 4, his Honour was in error in specifying a starting point of imprisonment of 4 years, against a statutory maximum of 5 years, as reflecting the objective criminality. A sentence of 4 years imprisonment was manifestly excessive in the circumstances.


	
	His Honour found that counts 3 and 4 were more serious, “because they directly relate to the performance of the offender’s duties and responsibilities as a director”. He indicated that the starting point for these counts should be four years discounted by 25% for the plea.
	
	
	The essence of the applicant’s submission was that this was not a case where the money that was obtained by the failure to disclose to the Board the true financial position of BTS was used solely for the personal interest of the applicant. BTS was a company in which HIH had an indirect interest. Apart from the amount of $50,000 which was paid to the applicant as a brokerage fee, the balance of $2 million was utilised in paying the legitimate expenses and debts of BTS. One of those debts involved the repaying of a $400,000 loan from Pacific Mentor Pty Ltd, a company in which HIH was a shareholder. However, the applicant also had an interest in Pacific Mentor of effectively seventy percent and stood to gain if the loan was repaid.
	
	
	I have already referred to the sentencing judge’s findings in relation to the nature and circumstances of this offence. His Honour found that the failure by the applicant to disclose the dire financial position of BTS and the dishonest manner in which he procured Mr Williams and HIH to make the investment amounted to the telling of lies by non-disclosure. His Honour found that the applicant displayed a lack of commercial morality. The applicant admitted that he put his personal interests ahead of the interests of HIH in order to have the Board ratify the investment. Furthermore, he admitted that he had the opportunity to come forward and talk honestly about the problems facing BTS. His Honour’s finding that the applicant dishonestly talked up the investment was clearly open.
	
	
	Notwithstanding these matters by commencing with a sentence of four years his Honour identified the offence as being at the upper end of the spectrum of criminality within the scope of a breach of s 184 of the Corporations Act 2001. When the statutory maximum was five years a starting point of four years was a heavy sentence. To my mind the sentence was excessive.
	
	
	Although his Honour was satisfied that counts 3 and 4 were more serious than counts 1 and 2, I am not persuaded that this is so. In respect of counts 1 and 2 the applicant knowingly provided false information to advantage himself and influence others to take risks by investing in HIH. Counts 3 and 4 involve dishonesty in his dealings with Mr Williams and the Board of HIH with prospective advantage to himself. In each case his conduct was dishonest and intended to induce others to act in a manner which could bring him an advantage. I am satisfied that the criminality was similar and of the same order as that for which Loiterton was sentenced.
	
	
	In my opinion, the appropriate sentence in the circumstances was a starting point of three years and six months which, allowing 25% for the early plea of guilty would give a sentence appropriately rounded of two years and six months. An adjustment should be made to the non-parole period to reflect the reduction in the overall sentence. To my mind that reduction should be to impose a total non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months. The applicant should be re-sentenced accordingly.
	
	
	In my opinion the appropriate orders are:
	


1.   Grant leave to appeal.

2.   Dismiss the appeal against sentence in relation to counts 1, 2 and 3.

3.   Quash the sentence imposed in respect to count 4.

4.   Impose a sentence in respect of count 4 of 2 years and 6 months – to commence on 14 October 2006 and expire on 13 April 2009.

5.   Fix a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months which will expire on 13 July 2007.


	
	SULLY J: I have had the privilege of reading in draft the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL.
	
	
	Save only as to ground 9 of the grounds of appeal I agree respectfully with the entirety of what the Chief Judge has written.
	
	
	As to ground 9, I am unpersuaded that this Court is warranted in now interfering with the sentence passed by Dunford J.
	
	
	I agree respectfully with the Chief Judge’s proposition that there is a similarity between the objective criminality of the behaviour encompassed by counts 1 and 2 and that encompassed by counts 3 and 4 in that in each of the four instances the applicant’s conduct “was dishonest and intended to induce others to act in a manner which would bring him an advantage.”
	
	
	It seems to me, however, that the similarity thus described is a very broad and general one, and is apt, if not examined in greater detail, to gloss the real particular criminality of the applicant’s dealings with HIH and its Board at the Board’s meeting on 29 November 2000.
	
	
	The criminal conduct at which count 4 is aimed does not constitute in practical reality a simple stand alone offence. It constitutes, rather, deliberate fraud causing, and giving ultimate clearance and effect to, a succession of deliberately and intentionally fraudulent acts, namely the materially false statements made to Mr Williams on 29 September 2000, compounded by the sending to Mr Williams on 10 October 2000 of a letter falsely and fraudulently certifying, in effect, payment by the applicant to BTS of $500,000 of the applicant’s own money.
	
	
	By this succession of criminal acts, brought successfully to fruition from the applicant’s point of view on 29 November 2000, the applicant obtained substantial financial benefit from an advance of $2 million which simple honest dealing by the applicant with an honest and conscientious Board would never in all likelihood have obtained for him. I agree with the strictures of Dunford J as summarised in para [11] of the Chief Judge’s reasons.
	
	
	It seems to me that such a state of affairs must entail that the “lack of commercial reality” of which Dunford J speaks is in truth either contemptuously cynical commercial immorality, or contemptuously cynical commercial amorality. On either approach, the count 4 offence was, in my opinion, culpable to a degree that puts it very much towards the top than the mid-point of the relevant sentence range. In such a case I cannot agree the starting point of four years is outside the permissible range. It is a severe sentence passed in punishment of severe criminal fraud.
	
	
	The proper, and the properly resolute maintenance of the commercial integrity of the financial and insurance markets underpins and protects a most significant public interest. The damage done to that integrity by the applicant, a very high profile professional operator in those markets must have been in the very nature of things real and substantial. When all the subjective circumstances have been given their proper place, I cannot accept that the sentence passed by Dunford J is vitiated by the error of an impermissibly high starting point.
	
	
	I would grant leave to appeal. I would dismiss the substantive appeal.
	
	
	HISLOP J:   I have read the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in draft.
	
	
	I agree with what his Honour has written save in respect of ground 9 of the Grounds of Appeal.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the breach of s 184(1)(b) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (being the fourth count and the second of the BTS matters) was 5 years imprisonment and/or a pecuniary penalty. The sentencing Judge specified a starting point of 4 years imprisonment for that offence which he discounted by 25% for all aspects of the plea of guilty resulting in the sentence of three years imprisonment. The applicant submitted (ground 9 of the appeal) that such a starting point was manifestly excessive in all the circumstances. I am unable to accept this submission for the reasons which follow.
	
	
	The sentencing judge concluded the offences against s 999 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) were “serious and display an appalling lack of commercial morality.” The maximum penalty for those offences was 5 years imprisonment and/or a pecuniary penalty. In determining sentence on the s 999 counts his Honour specified a starting point of imprisonment of 3 and a half years. As the Chief Judge at Common Law has concluded, there was no error by the sentencing judge in this regard.
	
	
	The sentencing judge held the BTS matters were equally serious in so far as they too displayed a lack of commercial morality and involved the telling of lies for business purposes, expressly in the case of the third count and by non-disclosure in the case of the fourth count. His Honour held there was an additional element of criminality involved in the BTS matters. He said:
	


On top of that, they were offences committed by a director of the company where the company was itself the victim. Directors are not appointed to advance their own interests but to manage the company for the benefit of its shareholders to whom they owe fiduciary duties. Accordingly to obtain money from the company by false representations and then to attend a Board meeting and compound the earlier offence by not disclosing the misrepresentation or the deterioration in BTS’ position since the advance, but actively talking it up as a good investment to secure ratification for the transaction, constitutes very serious breaches of the duties of director.

These findings, in my opinion, were open to his Honour.


	
	The sentencing judge also noted that:
	


At the time of the commission of the offences in counts 1 and 2, the (applicant) had no prior convictions and must be regarded as a person of good character; but at the time of the commission of the BTS offences, he had committed the offences the subject of counts 1 and 2 and also suffered the civil penalty proceedings.


	
	Reliance was placed by the applicant upon the fact that the money obtained by the failure to disclose to the Board the true financial position of BTS was not used solely for his personal interest. However the sentencing judge specifically referred in his remarks on sentence to the interests of the applicant and HIH in BTS and the manner in which the money paid by HIH was disbursed. It was a matter for his Honour what weight, if any, he attached to those matters.
	
	
	A sentencing judge must weigh all of the circumstances and make a judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence. His judgment is necessarily discretionary. There is no single correct sentence, and judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies – Markarian v R (2005) 215 ALR 213 at [27].
	
	
	In my opinion the decision of the sentencing judge to specify a starting point for the s 184(1)(b) offence of 4 years imprisonment was within the discretionary range open to him and no error has been demonstrated.
	
	
	I would make the following orders:

      Introduction 
        
       
      
    2 On 27 March 2002 the appellant, his brother John, Meli Lagi and Sione Penisini were in a Commodore that had been reported stolen. Each of the occupants was on parole. In the car were four loaded firearms, each of which was stolen. The appellant was driving. He was unlicensed. The car came to the notice of highway patrol officer Senior Constable Glen McEnallay and, in Denison Street Hillsdale he activated his siren and lights, announcing his pursuit. The appellant accelerated to avoid apprehension and, seconds later, made a right hand turn at speed into Grace Campbell Crescent. The Commodore struck the gutter or a traffic island and damaged a wheel. It was immobilised. Penisini got out of the Commodore armed with a .38 revolver and immediately fired five shots in quick succession at the officer. Four of the bullets struck him and he died as a result of gunshot wounds to the chest and head. It is not clear when the other three men alighted from the Commodore but it seems that the appellant was the last. All four men then fled the scene in different directions, each with a gun. The entire episode was over in a minute or so.  
     
      
    3 The Crown case was that the appellant was guilty of Senior Constable McEnallay’s murder by reason of his participation in a criminal enterprise to evade lawful apprehension by police, foreseeing that, in the course of that unlawful enterprise, the death or grievous bodily harm of Senior Constable McEnallay was possible.  
     
      
    4 John Taufahema and Meli Lagi were tried before Wood CJ at CL and a jury in August 2003. John Taufahema was convicted of murder but Meli Lagi was acquitted of that charge, being convicted of a lesser alternative charge. The appellant was to be tried with his brother and Meli Lagi but, because of his counsel’s ill health, this did not occur. The appellant therefore was tried separately before Sully J and a jury commencing on 10 March 2004. On 31 March 2004 the appellant was convicted of murder. On 10 September 2004, he was sentenced to an effective overall term of 23 years with a non-parole period of 16 years. He has appealed against his conviction for murder.  
     
      
       
      The evidence at trial 
       
      
    5 The Commodore first came under the notice of police when two off duty officers in a private car saw it in Botany Road Matraville travelling at high speed, on occasions up to 150kph, sometimes tailgating or overtaking and at one point travelling on the wrong side of the road. The officers followed but eventually lost sight of it. Shortly after, they came across the unmarked police vehicle being driven by Senior Constable McEnallay and spoke to him about the Commodore. An enquiry via police radio revealed that it was believed the Commodore was stolen. (As it happened, the registration plate had been stolen sometime in 2001 but the vehicle was not stolen.) Senior Constable McEnallay decided he would try to find the Commodore. Not long afterwards his vehicle was seen by a delivery truck driver, Mr Patterson, following the Commodore. The Commodore was apparently complying with the road rules and the police vehicle was following it without either lights blinking or siren on. The delivery truck was in front, followed by the Commodore and then by the police car. When Mr Patterson turned left, the Commodore changed lanes to the right to overtake the vehicle. Mr Patterson looked down into it at this point. He said that he could see three men, one in the passenger seat and two in the back, and he noticed one of the persons in the front hand something through to the back. He was not sure what it was. The suggestion by the Crown that, if true, this was a pistol was mere surmise. Shortly afterwards the Commodore turned into Dennison Road and thence into Grace Campbell Crescent. It is apparent from the radio calls that Senior Constable McEnallay commenced to follow the Commodore at almost 5.48pm and stopped in Grace Campbelll Crescent at about 3 minutes later. He did not turn on his siren and flashing lights until shortly after he turned his vehicle into Dennison Road. 6 Another police vehicle had responded to radio calls and was following the Commodore and Senior Constable McEnallay’s vehicle though from a little distance away at Senior Constable McEnallay’s request. The officers in the second vehicle, Senior Constables Kolosque and Day (who were only seconds behind Senior Constable McEnallay’s vehicle), followed the other two vehicles into Dennison Street and turned into Grace Campbell Crescent. They saw the Commodore and the police vehicle stopped at about 20 metres in front of them both facing the same direction. By this time Senior Constable McEnallay had been shot. Senior Constable Kolosque saw three men outside the Commodore looking around and, when they saw the police vehicle, began to run down a nearby street. Senior Constable Day saw the appellant running down Grace Campbell Crescent, that is to say in a different direction.  
     
      
    7 As it happened, a Ms Douglas-Irving drove past Grace Campbell Crescent very shortly after Senior Constable McEnallay’s car (going in the opposite direction) turned into the Crescent. She saw that it was stopped. She saw a man standing next to the Commodore leaning over the driver’s side pointing a gun at the police car. She saw the driver’s door of the police car begin to open. Ms Douglas-Irving saw two shots fired as she was driving past, she then heard another two shots. She drove back and went to the police car, yelling that a police officer had been shot. She saw the shooter and another man running away. 8 Another witness, a Mr Aodisho, was in the park at the side of Grace Campbell Crescent when he heard a car braking loudly. He saw the Commodore and the police car pulling up behind it. He said he heard a number of gunshots and saw the shooter standing in the road on the passenger side of the car firing at the windscreen of the police car. A number of other witnesses saw the appellant, alone, running down Grace Campbell Crescent and then walking past their point of observation apparently carrying something which he was attempting to cover with a blue bandana. A little distance away, in Rhodes Street the appellant was seen hiding something amongst some shrubs. It was a pistol. Shortly after the police found the appellant and arrested him. It is clear that this pistol was not that which was used to kill Senior Constable McEnallay.  
     
      
       
      The appellant’s account 
       
      
    9 Inspector Carla Tomadini electronically interviewed the appellant on the evening of 27 March 2002. The following is an extract from that interview –  
     
      
       
        
        “Q36: OK, do you have a driver’s licence for a car? 
         
        A: No, no 
        
       
       
        
        Q37: No? 
         
        A: Yeah, and then I see the police officer so I just sped off ‘cause I didn’t want to get done my licence again. 
        
       
       
        
        Q72: OK, so all four of you were in the vehicle when you saw the police car, OK, and what happened then? 
         
        A: I just sped off and I just wanted to lose the, get around the corner from the police car and so I can get out and leave the car. 
        
       
       
        
        Q90: Can you tell me what happened [after you turned into Grace Campbell Crescent]? 
         
        A: I turned into there and then I hit the gutter, I think, and yeah, I hit the gutter and then I opened the door and then I heard shots fired and then I just put my head down. I picked up my cigarettes and that from the middle console. 
        
       
       
        
        Q91: OK, you said you heard shots fired. Do you know who shot those… 
         
        A: No, I thought they, I thought the police shot at us. 
        
       
       
        
        Q92: You thought the police shot at you? 
        
       
       
        
        A: Yeah, that’s why I, I just put my head down on the thing and grabbed my cigarettes and that and went around and shut the door and took off. 
        
       
       
        
        Q94: OK, and [then] what happened? 
         
        A: And then I ran, I ran…I ran for the flats and the house. 
        
       
       
        
        Q114: Do you know if any of the people in your vehicle had weapons? 
         
        A: No. If I knew anybody had weapons I wouldn’t have fuckin’ jumped in the car and drive with them. Like I just got out of prison. 
        
       
       
        
        Q144: OK, and so you looked up and the others were running away, is that right? 
         
        A: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q145: OK, can you tell me what you saw? 
         
        A: I didn’t, I just saw everybody scattered and I just took off my own way too. 
        
       
       
        
        Q146: OK, did you see any weapons? 
         
        A: No, I didn’t see any weaponry at that time. I seriously thought the police was firing at us as I put the accelerator. 
        
       
       
        
        Q152: OK, I’ve been told that a male person was seen in the garden of number 33 Rhodes Street. 
         
        A: Where is that? 
        
       
       
        
        Q153: That’s next door to where you say you were, was seen in the garden there doing something and later a police officer found a firearm in that garden. Can you tell me anything about that? 
         
        A: No, that wouldn’t have been mine. I had nothing on me. Like I said if my friends had, if I knew they had then well then…in the car with me. I wouldn’t have drove them. 
        
       
       
        
        Q154: OK, I believe you were the person who placed that firearm in the garden at number 33 Rhodes Street, Hillsdale. What can you tell me about that? 
         
        A: You should get the weapon fingerprinted because its not mine. [Note: no fingerprints were found on that firearm.] 
        
       
       
        
        Q157: Can you tell me where everybody was seated in the vehicle. 
        
       
       
        
        [Over a number of further answers the appellant indicated he was driving, Lagi was in the front passenger seat, his brother John Taufahema was in the rear passenger seat behind the driver, and Penisini was in the rear passenger seat behind Lagi.] 
        
       
       
        
        Q190: When did you first see he police officer? 
         
        A: Somewhere around Bunnerong Road. [He went on to say that he saw the police officer continuing to follow him on Foreshore Drive to the lights and after they turned right, and on to Denison Street.] 
        
       
       
        
        Q205: And what were you trying to do? 
         
        A: I was just trying to, so I could lose sight of him so I could out and go. 
        
       
       
        
        Q206: OK, and what did the police officer do? 
         
        A: He sped up too and he put his siren on. 
        
       
       
        
        Q208: And what happened then? 
         
        A: That’s when I turned into the gutter. 
        
       
       
        
        Q266: When you saw the police did you say anything? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q267: Did you mention to the other three people in the car that the police were behind you at any stage? 
         
        A: I, did they know that the police was behind us? 
        
       
       
        
        Q268: Did you say anything? 
         
        A: All right, all right. Yeah, I said, I said, Shit, I haven’t got a licence. I’m going to be done for unlicensed driving again. 
        
       
       
        
        Q269: OK, what did they say? 
         
        A: They were all…we’ve got the police behind me and after that it was just, I just drove. 
        
       
       
        
        Q270: All right, was there any other talk about the policeman being behind you? 
         
        A: Nuh, I just told them to, put your seat belt on. 
        
       
       
        
        Q271: When you stopped the car why did the other three males run? 
         
        A: They were just I s’pose, they were probably, they were all on parole or something. None of us had a licence. 
        
       
       
        
        Q272: Yes, but the other three weren’t driving so what made them run> 
         
        A: I’m not sure. I know I was running because I didn’t have a licence. 
        
       
       
        
        Q278: Do you know where the other three males went? 
         
        A: They were just scattered in front of me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q280: So you were the last one? 
         
        A: Yeah, I think I was the last one to get out of, to run from the car. 
        
       
       
        
        Q323: Have you handled any weapons in the last 24 hours? 
         
        A: No.” 
        
       
      
    10 In the course of his evidence at trial the appellant said that, as he turned into Denison Street, he said to the other occupants of the vehicle, “put your seat belts on, there is a police officer behind”. This was clearly a declaration that he intended to avoid being stopped by (as it happened) Senior Constable McEnallay if he could do so by outrunning or outmanoeuvring the police vehicle. He said that he was not sure whether anybody said anything in response. (I interpolate that, in my view, this statement and the silence of the other occupants did not justify an inference that they agreed, in the sense of encouraging or joining with him in an enterprise of escape, with this course of action. Even if they had agreed to the appellant’s action of attempting to evade the police car, there was no basis for inferring from this evidence an agreement that guns were or might be used or that any action apart from that which involved driving was contemplated.) 11 The appellant said that he thought that his brother and Meli got out of the car before it came to a full stop but he was not sure. He said that he was the last to get out of the car and, as he put his leg out of the door to stand up, he heard the gunshots. His first thought was that the police officer had fired a warning shot. He said that he put his head down on the front driver’s seat and then moved away from the car. He noticed Penisini out of the car on the passenger’s side. Penisini called out to him. He turned around to look at him. Penisini then threw an object in a blue bandana to him. When he caught it he realised it was a gun. Both of them ran away. In cross-examination the appellant denied that he was aware that any guns were in the car at any relevant time. He said that he drove into Grace Campbell Crescent so that he could stop the car out of sight of the police vehicle and exchange driving positions with his brother. He just did not want the police officer to see him driving. The prosecutor suggested to the appellant that he discussed getting away from the policeman with the others in the car, but the appellant denied this. He also denied agreeing with Penisini and the others that weapons would be used to enable him to escape from the police. 12 Using one of the guns on the pursuing police officer is, on the face of it at least, inconsistent with an agreement to keep the weapons concealed. 
     
      
        
      
    13 The Crown’s submission to this Court was that the appellant’s culpability lay in his shared understanding with the other occupants of the motor vehicle that they would evade lawful apprehension by police, foreseeing that in the course of that unlawful enterprise the murder of Senior Constable McEnallay was a possible incident. The Crown Prosecutor also argued that the appellant had agreed to “hinder” the police officer in the execution of his duty, within the meaning of s546C of the Crimes Act 1900. I deal with this contention below. 14 The Crown submitted that the “essential issue at trial was always whether the Crown could satisfy the jury that the appellant knew that there was a loaded firearm in the car and that he appreciated that, in the circumstances and the atmosphere then obtaining, there was a real risk that any one of the men in the car might fire at the police officer with intent to kill or cause serious harm”. The fundamental problem with this formulation, of course, is that a joint enterprise depends on mutual agreement, not knowledge of what the others intend to do or a mere prediction about what is likely to occur. 
     
      
    15 In my view there was nothing in the evidence of the appellant that assisted the Crown case even assuming that the jury did not believe that the appellant was telling the truth. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    16 It is obvious that the crucial questions involved the extent to which the jury were persuaded that the applicant was party to an agreement that involved the joint attempt to escape (or hinder the officer) of all four, together foresight by the applicant that one or other of the other three might use a gun to effect that hindering or joint escape, that the gun might be fired and that it might be fired with the intention to cause death or grievous bodily harm. 17 Before dealing with the learned trial judge’s directions to the jury on this matter it is convenient to set out the law as I understand it to be. As I have mentioned earlier, the way in which the applicant’s guilt was ultimately left to be determined involved a common purpose arising out of a joint criminal enterprise in which the shooting of the deceased was a foreseen though unintended consequence of the “foundational crime” to which the appellant was a party.  
     
      
    18 A useful starting point is McAuliffe v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 108. The following summary is taken from the headnote to the report. Four youths decided to go to the park to bash someone. One went with a hammer and another with a stick. Two of them were experienced kick boxers. At the park two of them attacked a man who was standing near the top of a high cliff. They kicked him and beat him with a stick. The other youth then high kicked the man in the chest, causing him to fall into a puddle in the rocks a short distance from the edge of the cliff. The youths then left. Next day the man’s body was found in the sea at the bottom of the cliff. Four of the youths were tried for murder and the appeal concerned the correctness of direction by the trial judge as to the application of common purpose. In the course of a joint judgment the court said (183 CLR at 113, references omitted) –  
     
      
       
        
        “The doctrine of common purpose applies where a venture is undertaken by more than one person acting in concert in pursuant of a common criminal design. Such a venture may be described as a joint criminal enterprise. Those terms – common purpose, common design, concert, joint criminal enterprise – are used more or less interchangeably to invoke the doctrine which provides a means, often an additional means, of establishing the complicity of a secondary party in the commission of a crime…[The] complicity of a secondary party may be…established by reason of a common purpose shared with the principal offender or with that offender and others. Such a common purpose arises where a person reaches an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between that person and another or others that they will commit a crime. The understanding or arrangement need not be expressed and may be inferred from all the circumstances. If one or other of the parties to the understanding or arrangement does, or they do between them, in accordance with the continuing understanding or arrangement, all those things which are necessary to constitute the crime, they are all equally guilty of the crime regardless of the part paid by each in its commission… 
        
       
       
        
        Not only that, but each of the parties to the arrangement or understanding is guilty of any other crime falling within the scope of the common purpose which is committed in carrying out that purpose. Initially the test of what fell within the scope of the common purpose was determined objectively so that liability was imposed for other crimes committed as a consequence of the commission of the crime which was the primary objective of the criminal venture, whether or not those other crimes are contemplated by the parties to that venture…However, in accordance with the emphasis which the law now places upon the actual state of mind of an accused person, the test has become a subjective one and the scope of the common purpose is to be determined by what was contemplated by the parties sharing that purpose… 
        
       
       
        
        In  
        Johns (TS) v The Queen 
         (1980) 143 CLR 108 [The] Court did not consider the situation in which the commission of an offence which lay outside the scope of a common purpose was nevertheless contemplated as a possibility in the carrying out of the enterprise by a party who continue to participate in the venture with that knowledge. That situation would occur where, for example, a party knows that another party to a joint criminal enterprise is carrying a weapon which that other party would use to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm in carrying out the enterprise and expressly rejects any agreement that the weapon might be used but nevertheless continues with the venture. The question arises whether both parties are liable if the weapon is used to inflict harm in the course of executing the common purpose that action being one which lay outside the scope of the common purpose or agreement, but within the contemplation of the secondary party. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        …There was no occasion for the court [in  
        Johns 
        ] to turn its attention to the situation where one party foresees, but does not agree to, a crime other than that which is planned, and continues to participate in the venture. However, the secondary offender in that situation is as much a party to the crime which is an incident of the agreed venture as he is when the incidental crime falls within the common purpose. Of course, in that situation the prosecution must prove that the individual concerned foresaw that the incidental crime might be committed and cannot rely upon the existence of the common purpose as establishing that state of mind. But there is no relevant distinction… 
        
       
       
        
        For these reasons, the trial judge was not in error in directing the jury that if the appellants were engaged in a joint criminal enterprise with [the third youth], a shared common intention-that is a common purpose – to inflict grievous bodily harm or an individual contemplation of the intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm as a possible incident of the venture would be a sufficient intention on the part of either of them for the purpose of murder”. 
        
       
      
    19 In Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545 the deceased and the appellant were involved in melee in which the former was punched in the head and fell to the ground where he was kicked, suffering fractures to his face and a brain haemorrhage and the Crown contended (as a second path to convicting the appellant) that he was guilty of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on the victim because he was part of a joint criminal enterprise by the group of which he was one to engage in a street fight with the group of whom the victim was one. The principal judgment was delivered by Hunt CJ at CL, with whose discussion of the directions as to joint enterprise the other members of the bench agreed. His Honour pointed out (92 A Crim R at 588) the distinction between the concepts of joint criminal enterprise and common purpose, observing that “common purpose becomes necessary only where there has been agreement to carry out a particular crime (some text books call it the foundational crime) but some other crime has been committed which had been within the contemplation of the accused as a possible incidence in the execution of their agreed joint criminal enterprise (some textbooks call it the incidental crime) which is said to be within the scope of the common purpose“, citing authorities which it is unnecessary to set out. In this case the infliction of grievous bodily harm was part of the joint criminal enterprise, at least from the time when the members in the group of which the appellant was one started to kick the victim.  
     
      
    20 It follows, as it seems to me, that it is essential to firstly identify the foundational crime alleged to be the subject of the agreement between the alleged offenders, the incidental crime which occurred and the mode by which it is contended by the prosecution that the incidental crime is within the scope of the common purpose. Clearly enough, in this case, the contention of the Crown was that the offenders would jointly evade arrest, described by the learned trial judge as the “crime of avoiding lawful arrest”.21 In the trial of the other occupants of the vehicle, Wood CJ at CL had directed the jury in respect of the murder count –  
     
      
       
        
        “[The Crown must prove the following elements: 
         
        (a) The accused whose case you are considering was party to a joint enterprise with the men who were in this company that, if faced with the possibility of being arrested, one or other of them would use a firearm with intent to prevent such arrest. 
         
        (b) The accused whose case you are considering contemplated that it was possible that, in using a firearm to prevent their arrest, the user would do so in a way that either resulted in the death of, or really serious bodily injury to, the person attempting to arrest them. 
        
       
      
     (c)…”22 This direction reflected, as is obvious, the case presented in the earlier trial that the foundational crime was the offence under s 33B of the Crimes Act 1900. In the appellant’s trial, the Crown prosecutor expressly withdrew the contention that the foundational crime was this offence and relied instead upon an attempt to evade or avoid lawful apprehension. In this Court the Crown did not contend that the foundational crime was an offence under s 33B. One of the important consequences of this concession is that the foundational offence (unlike that, say, of armed robbery or an offence under s33B) did not involve violence or the threat of violence. It is submitted, further, by Mr Game SC for the appellant that, at all events, there is no such offence. 23 The Act creates a number of offences involving attempts to avoid a lawful apprehension: s 33B, dealing with the use (in various ways) of an offensive object to threaten injury to any person or property “with intent to prevent or hinder the lawful apprehension or detention of any person or prevent or hinder a member of the police force from investigating any act or circumstance reasonably calling for investigation”; s 58, dealing with assaults, resistance or wilful obstruction of any officer while in the execution of his or her duty or with the intention of resisting or preventing the lawful apprehension or detainer of any person for any offence; and s 546C making it an offence for any person to resist or hinder a member of the police force in the execution of his or her duty. 24 The Crown contended in this Court that the foundational crime was that created by s 546C of the Crimes Act 1900. Whilst not resiling, in terms, from the case put below, that the foundational offence was evading arrest, the Crown prosecutor in this Court contended that another available offence was that of hindering the officer in the execution of his duty. One major obstacle in the way of this submission is that such a case was not put at trial.  
     
      
    25 It was submitted that the word “hinder” is a word of ordinary parlance without any special meaning and that its usual definition (for example, that in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary) is “to keep back, delay, impede, obstruct, prevent”. By not stopping the Commodore when Senior Constable McEnallay signalled that he should do so by operating the siren and the flashing lights on his vehicle, it is submitted that the appellant sought to delay or impede an impending lawful arrest. (I interpolate that, the officer undoubtedly wished the vehicle to heed the signals and stop but whether he was then intending to arrest anybody is uncertain.) The Crown also contends, relying on the fact that all four offenders fled the scene, that they had agreed that they would run away from the officer and that the agreement to run away was an agreement to “hinder” in the sense, again, of delaying or impeding and hopefully preventing their arrest. The researches of counsel did not produce any authority stating or approving such a wide use of “hinder”. If correct, it would mean, for example, that an offender in Sydney who heard that a warrant for his arrest had been issued in Perth and left his place of residence to hide from the police would be guilty of an offence where the effective changing of his address was, in fact, to delay, impede or prevent it. (I mention that – as appears from the trial judge’s directions extracted below – the Crown case at trial was not merely that the occupants of the car agreed to evade the officer, but that they had agreed to avoid arrest. There was no evidence, as stated above, that the officer was intending to arrest anyone when he was killed.) 26 In Leonard v Morris (1975) 10 SASR 528, Bray CJ (at 531) described the actus reus of the offence established by section 546C as “any active interference or obstruction which makes the duty of the police officer substantially more difficult of performance”. This passage was adopted as correct by Sully J in Worsley v Aitken & Anor (1990) 9 Petty Sessions Review 4074. Worsley, it was alleged, took hold of the police officer’s jacket when the officer was endeavouring to assist another officer then in the course of arresting another person during a melee, saying to the officer “leave him alone, he’s done nothing”. The officer desisted from his attempt to assist with the arrest of the suspect and pushed Worsley away before returning to his task. Of course, Sully J was there considering an actual physical interference by the accused person with the arrest which the officer was about to effect. That is not the use of hinder upon which the Crown relies in this case. 27 The description of the actus reus of this offence given by Bray CJ in Leonard v Morris has been regarded, in my experience, as applicable in this State for decades and I would not be prepared to extend the offence any further by a wider use of the word “hinder” than that which it has hitherto been understood to have. I am of the view that the actus reus of the offence created by s 546C is indeed that ascribed to it by Bray CJ in Leonard v Morris. It follows that the foundational offence upon which the Crown relied did not exist. In the circumstances, this conclusion is fatal to the correctness of the conviction. It is important, I think, to point out that it was not – at least, ultimately, for good reason I think – the Crown case that the appellant had a common purpose with Penisini to use a gun to threaten or attack Senior Constable McEnallay in order to evade or avoid arrest. There was simply no evidentiary basis for such a case, as the prosecutor at trial conceded. The highest point at which the Crown could aim was that the appellant foresaw the possibility that Penisini might use his weapon against the officer (though, on my view, this must be mere speculation). There was no evidence that could justify the conclusion that the appellant agreed with Penisini that he should use the gun to threaten, let alone shoot at the police officer or that he encouraged him to do so.  
     
      
    28 In the circumstances I think it is desirable that I should also deal with the other complaints made by the appellant as to the directions on joint criminal enterprise and common purpose. At the outset, Mr Game SC for the appellant submitted (I think rightly) that the appellant could not be convicted if the Crown proved no more that he intended to run away from the police officer and was aware that the other passengers in the car intended to do the same, even if he adverted to the possibility that someone might shoot at the officer. It was essential that the jury be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt not only that each had decided to evade the officer and that each was aware that the others would also evade the officer, but that each would assist the others in doing so and that the appellant realised that a gun might be used in the attempt and there was a real risk that the officer might be shot or suffer grievous bodily harm. It is this mutuality of assistance that creates the essential commonality of purpose and makes them members of a joint enterprise as distinct from each taking part in his own individual enterprise of attempting to avoid arrest.  
     
      
    29 The way in which this matter was finally left in the summing up can be seen in the following extract from written directions provided to the jury by the learned trial judge during his Honour’s summing up –  
     
      
       
        
        “The simplest approach is to ask whether the Crown has satisfied you by reasonable doubt: 
        
       
       
        
        1. That the actions of the four men who were travelling in the Commodore then being driven by the accused, gives rise to an inference that they had reached an agreement or understanding that all four of them would jointly evade lawful apprehension by S/C McEnallay and; 
        
       
       
        
        2. That the accused then knew that there was at least one loaded revolver the being carried in the vehicle and; 
        
       
       
        
        3. That the accused realised that, in the circumstances and the atmosphere then obtaining, there was a risk that any one of the men in the Commodore might fire that weapon at the police officer; and that in such an event there was a real risk that the police officer might be killed or at least seriously injured; 
        
       
       
        
        4. That such risks crystallised in the shooting in fact by Penisini of the police officer.” 
        
       
      
    30 With unfeigned respect for the learned trial judge it does not seem to me that this direction sufficiently conveyed to the jury the essential point that it was not enough that each of them decided that he would escape as distinct from an agreement that each would assist the others to escape. With respect, it seems to me that the phrase “an agreement or understanding that all four of them would jointly evade lawful apprehension” would not be sufficient to convey to the jury the vital distinction. If the appellant simply intended to run away, he could not be criminally responsible for the death of Senior Constable McEnallay merely because he realised that the other occupants of the vehicle intended to escape and that one of the other offenders, in the course of that offender’s escape, might use a weapon against the officer. 31 It is worth noting, I think, that there was nothing in what the appellant said in his interview to the police that assisted the prosecution case in this respect. If anything, the common sense interpretation of the appellant’s claim (whether it be true or false) was that he intended to escape and that others had a motive for not being arrested (namely they were on parole) but that their decisions to evade arrest were individually made. Certainly the effect of the appellant’s answers was that his decision to run was his own and not the result of any agreement of with the others.32 It would be seem from the brief summary of the appellant’s evidence that although it is true to say that his case was, essentially, that he was unaware of any weapons being in the car but he also denied that there was any agreement between him and the others that all would escape, let alone that there was an agreement that anyone would assist anyone else to do so.  
     
      
      The alternative verdict of manslaughter 
       
      
    33 At the hearing of the appeal the appellant sought to add a further ground of appeal to the effect that the learned trial judge erred in law in failing to leave the offence of manslaughter as an alternative verdict for the jury’s consideration. Leave is required to add their proposed ground. The grant of leave is not opposed by the Crown. The ground is fairly arguable and I would propose that leave be granted. 34 The consequences of a failure to direct a jury in relation to the alternative verdict of manslaughter upon a charge of murder was reviewed by Hunt AJA in R v Kanaan [2005] NSWCCA 385 at [75] as follows –  
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Manslaughter cannot be left for the determination of the jury as an alternative verdict in a murder trial unless there is evidence to support such a verdict (or unless the case on manslaughter is “viable”). 
        
       
       
        
        (2) However, if in a murder trial the jury nevertheless returns a verdict of manslaughter where there is no evidence to support it, the judge may request them to reconsider the matter but, if they persist in that verdict the judge must accept it. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) If there is evidence to support an alternative verdict of manslaughter, the judge must leave that issue to the jury- notwithstanding that it has not been raised by any party, and even if a party objects (or all parties object) to the issue being left to the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        (4)(a) If there is evidence to support an alternative verdict of manslaughter, and if the judge has not left that issue (for whatever reason) there has been error of law. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Subject to provisions of the  
        Criminal Appeal Rule 
        s r 4… the appellant is entitled to a new trial unless the Crown establishes that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. 
         
         
        (c) In determining whether there has been such a substantial miscarriage, it is not permissible to reason that the jury’s verdict of guilty of murder at the first trial excludes any consideration of alternative verdict of manslaughter at the new trial”. 
        
       
      
    35 In order for the appellant to be convicted of murder as a possible incident of carrying out the common design, it is essential that the prosecution prove that he foresaw that one of the other offenders might shoot at the police officer with the intention of killing him or causing him grievous bodily harm. If, on the other hand, the jury considered it reasonably possible that the appellant only foresaw, as a possible incident, that one of the other offenders might shoot the officer (and possibly cause death or grievous bodily harm) but without foreseeing such an intent, then he would only be guilty of manslaughter: Gillard v The Queen (2003) 219 CLR 1 per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J at 13-14, Kirby, Hayne and Gummow JJ in substance agreeing.  36 It is obvious, I think, from what I have already said about the facts of the matter that, if the jury concluded that there was indeed a joint enterprise to avoid arrest and that the appellant appreciated that it was possible that one of the others might use a weapon for that purpose, that would leave very much alive the question whether he adverted to the possibility that one of the others might intend to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to the pursuing police officer. I do not see an evidentiary basis for drawing the latter inference, as indeed I do not see a sufficient evidentiary basis for concluding that there was such a joint enterprise or that the appellant thought that there was a possibility that one of the others would use a gun in the course of it. It seems to me inescapable that a jury might well not be prepared to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant adverted to the possibility that one of the others might intentionally shoot at the officer with the intention of killing him or causing him serious injury, as distinct from the mere possibility that the gun might be used in some way. 37 Accordingly, the alternative verdict of manslaughter must have been left to the jury and it would have been an error of law not to do so. In this regard, the written directions extracted above omit the necessary element that the appellant adverted to the possibility that a gun might be used with the intention of killing or causing grievous bodily harm. In the course of his oral directions the learned trial judge said –  
     
      
       
        
        “What will draw this accused in, if anything, is not only that he was driving the vehicle or that he understood that all four of the people in the vehicle were determined to get away from the pursuing Senior Constable McEnallay. That is enough to show that there was a joint criminal enterprise to evade apprehension. But if this accused is to be drawn into that arrangement in a way that makes him liable for murder, that is to say for a murder by shooting committed not by him but by Penisini, then it is essential that the Crown establish that the accused knew that there was at least one loaded weapon being carried in the vehicle. 
        
       
       
        
        We know that there were in fact four but it would be sufficient for that point to be made good if you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he knew that there was at least one loaded revolver being carried in the vehicle, and that he realised in the circumstances and the atmosphere the enterprise to get away coupled with the availability in the vehicle of at least a loaded weapon, gave rise to a real risk that any one of the men in the Commodore might have thought it a good idea to fire the weapon at the police officer in the course of getting away and that if that happened there was a real risk on the ground that the police officer was going to be either killed or seriously injured”. 
        
       
      
    38 In my respectful view these directions could only support a manslaughter conviction. This was, in substance, conceded by the Crown prosecutor in this Court. 
     
      
      Proposed orders 
       
      
    39 I propose that the conviction be quashed. In my view, there is no evidentiary basis for a conclusion that the appellant was party to an agreement that all four men would attempt to evade the police officer, as distinct from having made a decision that he would attempt to do so and knew that the others would do the same. Nor was there a basis for concluding that he adverted to the possibility that one of the others might use a gun in the course of evading the officer. The case proposed in this Court by the Crown, namely that there was an agreement to hinder the officer in the execution of his duty, was not put at trial and this Court should not order a new trial to permit such a different case to be put: R v Chekeri [2001] NSWCCA 221 at [57]; (2001) 122 A Crim R 422 at 434. More fundamentally, the hindering identified – the running away – is not hindering within the meaning of s546C of the Act. There is thus no foundational offence or joint criminal enterprise upon which the Crown can rely for the purpose of establishing the culpability of the appellant for the (conceded) unintentional consequence of shooting the police officer. As the appellant could not be convicted of murder or manslaughter on the cases as formulated by the Crown both at trial and in this Court, it seems to me that it is not appropriate to order a new trial. 40 Accordingly, I propose that this Court enter a verdict of acquittal.

      2005/1791 REGINA v Phillip Raymond PARKES 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The prisoner Phillip Raymond Parkes pleaded guilty to one count of murder, that on 16 January 2005 at Collaroy he murdered Grace Winifred Parkes, who was his mother. 
     
      
    2 Proceedings for the sentencing of the prisoner were conducted before me on 10 February 2006, 13 March 2006 and 11 April 2006. 
     
      
    3 Documentary evidence in the proceedings on sentence included: 
     
      
      (1) for the Crown - 
       
       A statement of facts prepared by the Crown and four volumes of witness statements, transcripts of interviews, reports and other documents which had been obtained by the Crown, some individual documents in those volumes being made separate exhibits: 
      
    (2) for the prisoner - 
     
      
       Two reports about the prisoner by a psychiatrist Dr Michael Giuffrida, reports about the prisoner by other medical practitioners, a letter from one of the prisoner’s children, a reference from his former employer, some documents about the prisoner from the Probation and Parole Service during a period in which the prisoner was on parole under an earlier sentence and some documents about the prisoner from the Department of Corrective Services during the period in which he has been in custody on remand for the present offence.  
       
      
    4 In the proceedings on sentence Dr Giuffrida and the prisoner gave oral evidence. 
     
      
    5 After the hearing on 13 March 2006 I received comprehensive written submissions from both the Crown prosecutor and counsel for the prisoner. 
     
      
    6 In the proceedings on sentence there was little or no challenge to the Crown’s statement of facts, with the exception of the last part of the statement which was headed “The Accused”, and the following statement of the background to the commission of the offence, of the facts of the offence and of events following the commission of the offence is derived from parts of the Crown’s statement of facts which were unchallenged and which I consider I should accept, supplemented to some extent by other evidence in the proceedings on sentence which I consider that I should accept. 
     
      
       
      Background, Facts of the Offence, Events after the Offence 
       
      
    7 The victim Mrs Parkes was born on 25 January 1921 and as at 16 January 2005 was approaching her eighty-fourth birthday. Her husband had died more than twenty years previously. Mrs Parkes and her husband had three children, Marilyn born in 1948, Russell born in 1951 and the prisoner born on 18 August 1956. 
     
      
    8 The prisoner’s sister Marilyn married Warren James Barrett, by whom she had two children. Marilyn died of leukaemia in 1980. After her death Mr Barrett remarried. His second wife Shirley-Anne Barrett formed and maintained a close relationship with Mrs Parkes, who was, of course, the grandmother of her stepchildren. 
     
      
    9 Mrs Parkes had a number of serious health problems. She was an insulin dependent diabetic. She also suffered from hypertension, Paget’s disease, Bells palsy, glaucoma, goitre, osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. She had had a number of operations on her eyes and had very limited vision. 
     
      
    10 In December 2004 Mrs Parkes contracted a viral infection in her eyes and was admitted to the Sydney Eye Hospital. She was discharged from the Eye Hospital on 24 December 2004. After her discharge she was in need of full-time care.  
     
      
    11 Since 2002 the prisoner had been employed as a bus driver for the Spastic Centre at Frenchs Forest, driving spastic persons from their homes to the Centre in the morning and then driving them home in the afternoon. When Mrs Parkes was discharged from the Eye Hospital on 24 December 2004, the prisoner was on annual leave from the Spastic Centre, being due to return to work on 17 January 2005.  
     
      
    12 While the prisoner was on his annual leave he stayed with his mother at her home at Collaroy Plateau (which was about ten minutes drive from his own home at Dee Why), assisting her with medical tests and the administering of her medication. He also did shopping and cooking and took his mother to medical appointments and to her bank. 
     
      
    13 Mrs Parkes’ failing health and advanced years prompted discussion between family members about her future care. Mrs Parkes did not want to go into a nursing home and wanted to remain living in her own home. Her home was in need of repairs and renovations.  
     
      
    14 At the suggestion of Russell Parkes a facility was arranged with the Commonwealth Bank, whereby up to $120,000 could be borrowed as required, with the principal amount borrowed and interest thereon being payable out of Mrs Parkes’ estate after her death. An ATM card and a cheque book for this loan account were issued by the Bank. As Mrs Parkes was incapable of herself operating on the loan account, the prisoner took control of the ATM card and became a signatory for the purpose of drawing cheques on the loan account. 
     
      
    15 At some time between 24 December 2004 and 16 January 2005 it was agreed between Mrs Parkes and the prisoner that the prisoner would resign from his employment and become Mrs Parkes’ permanent full-time carer. It was part of the agreement that an amount could be withdrawn from Mrs Parkes’ loan account to enable the prisoner to repay an outstanding loan on his car. 
     
      
    16 By mid-January 2005 Mrs Parkes’ health had improved slightly. The prisoner went to his mother’s house on Friday 14 January 2005 and Saturday 15 January 2005 but did not stay at his mother’s house on the nights of those days.  
     
      
    17 On Sunday 16 January 2005 the prisoner arrived at his mother’s house in the morning. He assisted her with her medical tests and the taking of her medication and prepared morning tea and lunch. He left his mother’s house at about 1.30 pm and returned to his own house at Dee Why. Before he left, his mother told him that there was no need for him to hurry back, because she was expecting a friend to come to her house. 
     
      
    18 Mrs Parkes’ friend arrived at Mrs Parkes’ house at about 3 o’clock in the afternoon. Mrs Parkes and her friend talked about various things, including the arrangement that the prisoner would become a full-time carer for Mrs Parkes. 
     
      
    19 The prisoner returned to his mother’s house between half past four and five o’clock in the afternoon. Mrs Parkes’ friend was still there but she left shortly afterwards. 
     
      
    20 The prisoner helped Mrs Parkes with her medical tests. He prepared an evening meal for the two of them, which they ate. After the meal Mrs Parkes sat in the living room of the house, watching television. She was able, notwithstanding the impairment of her vision, to see something of what appeared on a television screen, provided she sat close enough to the television set. 
     
      
    21 The account of subsequent events given by the prisoner in a statement he made to police on 17 January 2005 and in a recorded interview by police on 21 January 2005 was that he left his mother’s house at about 6.45 or 7 o’clock, leaving the front and back doors and the bedroom window open, that he went straight to his house, watched television and then went to bed and that the following morning he returned to his work at the Spastic Centre.  
     
      
    22 Subsequently, on 18 February 2005, the prisoner admitted that this account was untrue. A little later in these remarks I will set out what really happened on the evening of 16 January 2005. However, for the present, I will continue with a statement of events occurring on 17 January 2005 and subsequently.  
     
      
    23 On 17 January 2005 Shirley-Anne Barrett twice attempted to telephone Mrs Parkes but on each occasion her call was not answered. Mrs Barrett then telephoned the prisoner and told him that she had been unable to contact his mother on the telephone. The prisoner told Mrs Barrett that his mother had been planning to be at home all that day. Mrs Barrett decided to go to Mrs Parkes’ house to check on Mrs Parkes. She was concerned that Mrs Parkes might be in a diabetic coma.  
     
      
    24 Mrs Barrett entered Mrs Parkes’ house through the open front door. She found Mrs Parkes sitting on the lounge in the lounge room, with blood on her face, on her nightdress and on the lounge. She was dead. Clothes and other items were scattered in the two bedrooms in the house. A telephone had been unplugged. Mrs Barrett plugged in the telephone and telephoned the prisoner. She told him that his mother was dead and that she was covered in blood and the prisoner said that he would come immediately. Mrs Barrett made other telephone calls, including an emergency call for an ambulance. 
     
      
    25 Police who came to the premises at Collaroy observed a large amount of blood on Mrs Parkes’ face and a number of open wounds on her forehead and on the top of her head and open wounds and some swelling on her right hand, consistent with defensive injuries. 
     
      
    26 On 18 January 2005 Dr Duflou, a forensic pathologist, performed an autopsy on Mrs Parkes’ body. Dr Duflou found “evidence of extensive injury to the head, consistent with having been caused by a number of blows with a heavy object”. In Dr Duflou’s opinion, the presence of defensive injuries on Mrs Parkes’ right hand suggested that for at least part of the assault on her she would have had at least some residual level of consciousness. 
     
      
    27 As I have already stated, on 17 January the prisoner made a statement to police and on 21 January 2005 he participated in an electronically recorded interview by police and in both the statement and the interview he gave the untrue version of events which I have already outlined. On 13 February 2005 the prisoner participated in a videoed “walk through” interview in which he demonstrated, consistently with the account he had given in the statement of 17 January and the interview of 21 January, what he said he had done on 16 and 17 January 2005. 
     
      
    28 After this interview had been conducted, the police officer in charge of the investigation into Mrs Parkes’ death had a conversation with the prisoner. The police officer told the prisoner that the focus of the police investigation was on the prisoner, that police knew when and how Mrs Parkes had been killed and that the officer thought that the prisoner knew why she had been killed. The prisoner said that he would not be admitting anything until the results of forensic tests had been received. The prisoner told the police officer that he needed time in which to speak to his children and to get his affairs in order. He said that he would come to the police station the following week and tell police what had really happened. The police agreed to allow the prisoner the amount of time he asked for. 
     
      
    29 On 18 February 2005 the prisoner voluntarily went to Dee Why Police Station. He participated in an electronically recorded interview in which he admitted that some of the information he had given in his previous statement and interviews had been untrue and in which he admitted that he had killed his mother on 16 January 2005 by striking her on the head with a piece of discarded water pipe. There was no suggestion in the proceedings on sentence that I should not accept as being true, and I accept as being true, the answers given by the prisoner in this interview of 18 February 2005 concerning the commission of the crime and events following the commission of the crime. The following statement of facts about those matters is based on answers given by the prisoner in the interview of 18 February 2005. 
     
      
    30 On three or four occasions in the last couple of years up to 16 January 2005 the prisoner had had thoughts of killing his mother but he had not gone ahead with any planning to do so. 
     
      
    31 The prisoner’s mother drove him “completely crazy”. “She nags the shit out of me”. His mother was always bringing up the same topics again and again, going over her childhood and the deaths of her husband and her daughter. The prisoner’s mother treated the prisoner like a small child, while demanding that he be “the servant and the helper and the carer and the shopper and the cook”. The prisoner’s mother criticised the prisoner about his marriages and his lifestyle. 
     
      
    32 On the morning of 16 January 2005 the thought that that day might be the day on which he killed his mother occurred to the prisoner. The thought would not go away and kept coming back. 
     
      
    33 After arriving at his mother’s house in the morning of 16 January, the prisoner noticed a discarded piece of pipe in the garden and the thought occurred to him that, if he hit his mother across the forehead with the pipe, he would be able to make it look like an accident. However, he concluded that such a plan would not work. 
     
      
    34 After the prisoner returned to his mother’s house in the late afternoon of 16 January the prisoner looked at a jack in the boot of his car but decided that the jack would be too clumsy a weapon and that, if he used the jack to strike his mother, traces from the striking of his mother would be left on the jack. He also considered, and discarded, the idea of using a wheel brace in the boot of his car. 
     
      
    35 After the evening meal had been prepared and eaten and while his mother was watching television, the prisoner put on a pair of disposable gloves which were kept at his mother’s house and which the prisoner used to put on, while putting drops in his mother’s eyes, so as to prevent cross-infection. He put the gloves on, so that he would not leave any fingerprints. The prisoner then went into the garden and got the piece of water pipe he had noticed earlier. 
     
      
    36 After re-entering the house the prisoner spent a number of minutes pacing up and down in various places inside the house, with the piece of pipe in his hand. The prisoner then struck his mother across the forehead with the pipe. She put her hands up and the prisoner struck her a second time on the forehead. In a walk through interview conducted on 18 February the prisoner said that he struck his mother a third time on the forehead and I find that he struck his mother at least three times on the forehead. 
     
      
    37 The prisoner then left his mother and, to make it look as if there had been a robbery, ransacked the bedroom in the house and removed the money which had been in his mother’s purse. 
     
      
    38 The prisoner could hear his mother talking, saying “This is not supposed to happen this way”. The prisoner realised that his mother knew that it was he who had attacked her. She was wiping blood from her forehead with a tissue. 
     
      
    39 It occurred to the prisoner that, as a consequence of his mother suffering from Paget’s disease, the bones in her skull might be thicker than normal. The prisoner told police “I didn’t want her to suffer at that point”. The prisoner then struck his mother a number of times on the top of her head with the pipe. He used as much force as he could muster.  
     
      
    40 The prisoner sat down inside the house for a few minutes. He could hear rattling noises from his mother’s lungs. The prisoner left the house, knowing that his mother was still alive but that she would not live very long. He left a door partly ajar, so as to give the impression that a robbery had occurred. 
     
      
    41 The prisoner put into a plastic bag the piece of pipe he had used to strike his mother and the disposable gloves he had worn. In the walk through interview of 18 February 2005 the prisoner admitted that, in doing this, he was attempting to conceal articles which might provide evidence that he had assaulted his mother. The following morning the prisoner went to an area of bushland near the Spastic Centre, with which he was familiar, and threw away the piece of pipe, the two gloves and the plastic bag in three different places in the bushland. 
     
      
    42 During the interview on 18 February 2005 the prisoner told police that he had retrieved one of the gloves and he handed over that glove to the police. The interview was suspended while the prisoner went with police to the area of bushland. The prisoner indicated to police where he had thrown the various items and police succeeded in recovering the piece of pipe, the other glove and the plastic bag. 
     
      
    43 On the evening of 16 January 2005 the prisoner, after killing his mother, withdrew the sum of $800 from his mother’s loan account by using an ATM. On 17 January 2005 he withdrew a further sum of $800 from the loan account and a sum of $350 from a bank account of Mrs Parkes’. Mrs Parkes had agreed to the first withdrawal of $800 being made, to enable the purchase of a lawn mower. However, Mrs Parkes had not agreed to the other withdrawals being made. The prisoner gave police the remaining unspent proceeds of these withdrawals. 
     
      
    44 On 17 January 2005 the prisoner deliberately conducted himself as if nothing had happened and he left it to Mrs Barrett to discover his mother’s body. 
     
      
       
      Further Subjective Circumstances of the Prisoner 
       
      
    45 In stating the background to the offence I have already referred to a number of the subjective circumstances of the prisoner. The further subjective circumstances I will now state have been derived from the prisoner’s oral evidence in the proceedings on sentence and from the history given by the prisoner given to Dr Giuffrida, as recorded in Dr Giuffrida’s reports, which the prisoner said in his oral evidence was true. The two sources of information are not always entirely consistent with each other, particularly with regard to dates. 
     
      
    46 In about 1980 the prisoner married his first wife, by whom he had three children, a son Sean born in November 1982, a daughter Vanamali born in January 1986 and a daughter Ramani born in November 1988. Ramani suffers from a mental disability. 
     
      
    47 The prisoner’s first wife joined a Hare Krishna sect and the prisoner and his wife moved to a Hare Krishna commune. 
     
      
    48 The prisoner separated from his first wife in January 1993 and they were divorced the following year. The prisoner was awarded custody of the three children of the marriage.  
     
      
    49 After separating from his first wife the prisoner had a brief relationship with a woman living in Melbourne. However, the relationship failed after a couple of months. 
     
      
    50 In 1995 or 1996 the prisoner married his second wife. At some time after the marriage the prisoner and his second wife moved to Murwillumbah, where, although married, they lived in separate houses, because the prisoner’s children and his second wife’s children were not compatible. This marriage also failed and the prisoner and his second wife separated. 
     
      
    51 On 5 December 1996 and 21 February 1997 the prisoner committed robberies in banks, whilst armed with a rifle which was not loaded. On each occasion the prisoner carried a Molotov cocktail, which he ignited and threw, while he was inside the bank, causing a fire in the bank premises. The prisoner committed the robberies to get money to pay his debts and to support his children. 
     
      
    52 An unusual feature of each robbery was that the prisoner had dressed in women’s clothing. In cross-examination in the proceedings on sentence the prisoner agreed that he had dressed in women’s clothing as a disguise in order to mask his identity. 
     
      
    53 On each occasion money was demanded by the prisoner and given to him, the prisoner fled from the bank premises, discarded the women’s clothing and drove away in a car which he had had fitted with Queensland number plates, which he had acquired from an illicit source. 
     
      
    54 Shortly after committing the second robbery the prisoner was arrested. For the armed robbery offences he was sentenced in the District Court to two fully concurrent sentences of imprisonment of seven years with non-parole periods of three and a half years commencing on 25 February 1997. He was also sentenced for two offences of maliciously damaging property by fire, which were made fully concurrent with parts of the sentences for armed robbery. 
     
      
    55 While the prisoner was in prison serving the sentences for armed robbery his son Sean lived with the prisoner’s mother, his daughter Vanamali lived with the prisoner’s brother Russell and his daughter Ramani was placed with carers by the Department of Community Services. 
     
      
    56 The prisoner was released from prison on parole at the expiration of the non-parole periods of the sentences. For the first three years of the period he was on parole the prisoner did not use illicit drugs. However, for the last six months of the period he was on parole, the prisoner was not required to attend at the office of the Probation and Parole Service and during this period of six months the prisoner resumed using cannabis, of which he had previously been a heavy user. He had first starting using cannabis at the age of fourteen. The prisoner told Dr Giuffrida at an interview in September 2005 that, after resuming using cannabis, he reached the stage of smoking forty cones of cannabis a day. In his oral evidence the prisoner explained that he smoked only cannabis leaf, which he was given free of charge by a friend, and not hydroponically cultivated cannabis. 
     
      
    57 In addition to using cannabis, the prisoner was snorting half a gram of amphetamine a week. Apart from illicit drugs, the prisoner had for many years been using large quantities of pain killers containing codeine.  
     
      
    58 In about 2002 the prisoner obtained employment as a greenkeeper at a golf club. From September 2002 to the time of the murder the prisoner was employed by the Spastic Centre Business Services at Frenchs Forest. His duties included transporting some of the Spastic Centre’s employees each morning and each afternoon between their homes and the Centre. He was also responsible for the maintenance of the bus in which the employees were transported. The employees had physical and intellectual disabilities ranging from mild to profound. According to his employer, the prisoner was trusted, reliable and always dependable. 
     
      
       
      The Prisoner’s Mental State and Condition 
       
      
    59 The prisoner pleaded guilty to the charge of murder and did not raise any defence of mental illness or substantial impairment by abnormality of mind. However, although neither defence was raised, it was submitted on behalf of the prisoner in the proceedings on sentence that his mental state and condition were relevant to his sentencing. 
     
      
    60 As I indicated earlier in these remarks, the evidence in the proceedings on sentence included two reports by Dr Giuffrida and oral evidence by Dr Giuffrida. 
     
      
    61 The first report was dated 9 September 2005 and was based on an interview and examination of the prisoner on 5 September 2005, while the prisoner was in custody in a special programmes unit at the Long Bay Correctional Centre. The second report was dated 6 February 2006 and was based on an interview and examination which apparently took place on the same day, while the prisoner was in custody in an acute crisis unit at the Long Bay Correctional Centre.  
     
      
    62 Both of Dr Giuffrida’s reports record a considerable amount of personal history of the prisoner which the prisoner had supplied to Dr Giuffrida. On the application of the Crown, I made a ruling, when Dr Giuffrida was giving evidence, that evidence of the prisoner’s personal history which the prisoner had supplied to Dr Giuffrida would merely be evidence of part of the basis on which Dr Giuffrida had formed his opinions and would not be used as evidence of the truth of the history the prisoner had supplied. However, when the prisoner himself later gave evidence in the proceedings on sentence he said that the history which he had supplied to Dr Giuffrida and which Dr Giuffrida had recorded in his reports was, to the best of the prisoner’s knowledge, true.  
     
      
    63 Dr Giuffrida’s first report is a lengthy document of sixteen pages. I have taken all the report into account but will expressly refer to only certain parts of it. 
     
      
    64 In his first report Dr Giuffrida stated his opinion that it was clear from the history given by the prisoner that the prisoner had, from the age of twelve and throughout his life, had problems with gender identification, feeling more female than male. 
     
      
    65 In his first report Dr Giuffrida recorded that the prisoner had told him that he had started using cannabis at the age of fourteen, that his use of cannabis had gradually escalated, that before he was convicted of the armed robberies he had been smoking up to thirty cones of cannabis a day and that after serving the sentences for armed robbery his use of cannabis had increased to forty cones a day. Dr Giuffrida expressed the opinion that the prisoner’s excessive use of cannabis, combined with some use of amphetamine, would almost certainly have caused serious problems with the prisoner’s cognitive functioning and in particular his memory. 
     
      
    66 Dr Giuffrida considered it likely that the prisoner would have experienced auditory hallucinations “but on the history I could find little indication of paranoid feeling state or delusional beliefs accompanying the hallucinations, which is unusual”.  
     
      
    67 In his first report Dr Giuffrida recorded that the prisoner had told him that he had suffered traumatic injuries to his back and had suffered from chronic arthritis in multiple joints, causing pain and stiffness. The prisoner had taken large quantities of over the counter painkillers containing codeine to relieve his pain and had also used cannabis for pain relief. 
     
      
    68 Dr Giuffrida recorded that the prisoner had suffered from severe depression for which he had sought medical assistance and for which anti-depressants had been prescribed.  
     
      
    69 There are a number of references in Dr Giuffrida’s first report to claims by the prisoner that he had heard voices. The prisoner told Dr Giuffrida that by the end of 2001 he started to hear voices around him and that he sometimes attributed these voices to the television. 
     
      
    70 At page 7 of his first report Dr Giuffrida stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “He said over time the voices became more vivid and intense. On exploring his experience of voices or auditory hallucinations, Mr Parkes said that these in fact started he thought when he was 14 years old and from that time on they came and went intermittently. He found that they became more intense and more persistent in the last 10 years and with increasing amounts of cannabis and amphetamine in particular that they became ‘louder and more pronounced’. 
        
       
       
        
        I asked him about the nature of the voices. He said that there were a number of different voices but there was a male voice in particular which also occurred intensely on the day of his offence. He described this as an evil voice and attributed it to the devil. He said that on a number of occasions in the weeks or months prior to his offence that the voice became threatening and commanding and in response to this he left the house he said with a weapon with the thought of harming someone presumably in the street. He said the voices tend to occur when he was at home and seemed to come through the TV or the stereo. The voices were mostly outside his head but on occasions were inside his head. He said that the voice tormented him that he would die soon and at times commanded him to kill himself and to slash his wrists. He said that he continues to have these voices every night in his cell. 
        
       
       
       ……. 
       
       
        
        He said that he had continuing thoughts of harming and indeed killing his mother together with voices commanding him to do so throughout 2003 and 2004. This became more intense when he started looking after her directly and continuously in December 2004….” 
        
       
      
    71 At page 8 of his report Dr Giuffrida said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Parkes told me that the thought of killing his mother only fully crystallised on Sunday 16 January 2005, the day of the offence. He said that he experienced a voice which he described as evil telling him that he was ‘the instrument’, of his mother’s death. He said that he woke up with that voice and had it all day. He said that the voice told him that ‘her time was up and she had to leave this world’. He said that he felt commanded and controlled by the voice to carry out the command”. 
        
       
      
    72 In his first report Dr Giuffrida recounted that, since the prisoner had been in custody after his arrest in February 2005, the prisoner had been severely depressed and suicidal, cutting his wrists and swallowing razor blades. The prisoner had been kept in a safe cell, with all opportunities for self-harm removed. He had been seen by three psychiatrists, who had prescribed antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs.  
     
      
    73 On pages 11 and 12 of his first report Dr Giuffrida recorded his findings on an examination by him of the prisoner’s mental state. Dr Giuffrida recorded that the prisoner was very despondent and that the prisoner said he continued to entertain suicidal thoughts. Dr Giuffrida continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… He was able to speak to me for about two hours and responded readily to questions and spoke articulately with no impediment and with normal inflection and I could find no evidence of thought disorder at any time. He did not particularly dwell on any particular theme of his history, although the prevailing content as can be seen was one of sadness and failure throughout his life. There was certainly not at any point any indication of overvalued or paranoid delusional ideas. He did not in particular appear to experience any passivity delusions such as delusions of control or of external parties inserting or withdrawing thoughts from his mind. On the other hand he said that he continued to experience intermittently voices which appeared to come from outside him and mostly occurred in his cell at night and which in the past he had attributed to the television or stereo. I did not gain the impression at any stage that he was responding to auditory hallucinations in the course of the interview. 
        
       
       
        
        He demonstrated a good deal of insight into the nature of his psychiatric disorder and indeed recognised that the auditory hallucinations were abnormal and that their commands in the past to kill his mother and or himself were grossly pathological. It seemed clear from his history that, although he stated that he had experienced such command auditory hallucinations, that he recognised that their commands were wrong and immoral and it seems clear that for a long period of time he resisted them. His description of the auditory hallucinations occurring in the context of heavy cannabis and amphetamine use did not sound entirely convincing, insofar as the auditory hallucinations routinely seen in amphetamine abuse are almost always of a threatening and persecutory nature and it is most unusual for hallucinations to be entirely of the command type in amphetamine and cannabis intoxication. 
        
       
       
        
        A description of the voices coming from around him and his attribution to the television suggested of course an underlying psychotic illness such as schizophrenia, although I have to say that I was not entirely convinced that these were characteristic of a functional psychosis such as schizophrenia. 
        
       
       
        
        Cognitively Mr Parkes appeared to be relatively intact considering his life long history of cannabis and other drug abuse and I would have expected there to have been greater cognitive impairment particularly in relation to memory. He had a very detailed memory of past events and was able to give these in a fairly precise chronological order so there was good organisation of his thinking. His concentration and attention throughout the interview was good”. 
        
       
      
    74 On page 12 of his first report Dr Giuffrida expressed the opinion that central to the prisoner’s psychopathology was a core gender identity disorder, that related to this was a gender identity dysphoria, that the prisoner had suffered a virtually life long dysthymic disorder of mood, including poor self esteem and feelings of hopelessness, that on a number of occasions in his life the prisoner had suffered from episodes of a major depressive disorder of a recurrent type and that the prisoner had an underlying avoidant personality disorder, leading to the prisoner being inhibited and socially withdrawn. Dr Giuffrida considered, and rejected, a diagnosis that the prisoner suffered from schizophrenia. However, he concluded that there had been an element of a drug induced psychosis leading up to and probably present at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    75 At pages 13 to 15 of his first report Dr Giuffrida reviewed and commented on some of the documents which had been supplied to him. With regard to transcripts of the police interviews of the prisoner, Dr Giuffrida commented that the prisoner had seemed to be able to understand questions put to him and to respond readily and coherently. Dr Giuffrida noted that, when interviewed by police in February 2005, the prisoner had not referred to experiencing auditory hallucinations and, in particular, command hallucinations ordering him to kill his mother.  
     
      
    76 On the final page of his first report Dr Giuffrida considered whether defences of mental illness or substantial impairment were available to the prisoner. 
     
      
    77 Dr Giuffrida did not consider that a defence of mental illness was available to the prisoner.  
     
      
    78 Dr Giuffrida was unconvinced that the prisoner was experiencing command hallucinations at the time of killing his mother, because it was unlikely that such command hallucinations would have existed in the absence of other psychotic signs, such as other hallucinations or delusional beliefs flowing from the hallucinations. In addition, even if the prisoner had experienced command hallucinations, on his own account he had experienced such hallucinations previously and had resisted them, so that it was difficult to accept that he did not know that what he was doing in killing his mother was wrong. Dr Giuffrida added:- 
     
      
       
        
        “There is also the evidence of his interview with police which, if taken as fact, indicates or at least implies that his actions were consciously planned of his own volition rather than being driven by a command hallucination. There is the additional fact that he stated to police that he had hoped to make his mother’s injuries look like an accident and/or that his mother had been subject to an aggravated break and enter resulting in her death, in view of his ripping the phone cord out of the wall and I presume the withdrawal of cash on her key card or credit card. This would rather suggest a conscious and planned attempt to avoid incrimination. For those reasons I cannot see that Mr Parkes would have a McNaughton’s defence available to him.” 
        
       
      
    79 With regard to availability of a defence of substantial impairment, Dr Giuffrida said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I believe there is considerable evidence for a finding of an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition in so far as Mr Parkes has a long standing, almost life long history of serious psychiatric conditions, the most significant of those being a serious gender identity disorder, recurrent episodes of major depression, one episode of which is very highly likely to have been present at the time of the offence together with a long and serious history of substance abuse and dependence which in all likelihood would have exacerbated his psychiatric symptoms generally and the episode of major depression in particular. In addition I think it is likely that at times in the context of serious intoxication with cannabis and amphetamines, that he developed auditory hallucinations, although I am unsatisfied that these were necessarily of a command type at the time of the offence. All of these conditions are long standing and indeed represent a pre-existing and underlying condition. It is my opinion that these abnormalities of mind affected Mr Parkes’ capacity in the most general sense to understand events, although I do not think that there is any question that he did not understand the specific nature of his offence.  
        
       
       
        
        Whilst I do not think that this abnormality of mind caused him to be totally devoid of the capacity to make a moral judgment in relation to the offence and did not deprive him entirely of that capacity, I believe that it caused some significant and probably substantial impairment of that capacity. On the other hand the concerns that I have expressed in relation to the McNaughton’s defence would apply here”. 
        
       
      
    80 The opinions expressed by Dr Giuffrida in his second report, all of which I have taken into account are generally in accordance with the opinions he expressed in his first report.  
     
      
    81 In February 2006, when Dr Giuffrida interviewed and examined the prisoner for his second report, the prisoner was being held in an acute crisis unit at the Correctional Centre, because of the risk of self-harm. The prisoner had made a further attempt at suicide.  
     
      
    82 On a mental state examination by Dr Giuffrida in February 2006 the prisoner presented much as he had on the previous examination in September 2005.  
     
      
    83 In his second report Dr Giuffrida said that his diagnoses of the prisoner remained as before. 
     
      
    84 In his second report Dr Giuffrida addressed the question of the level of risk the prisoner posed to others. Dr Giuffrida considered that the prisoner’s violent offence against his mother was very specific to that particular relationship and the circumstances existing at the time of the offence. Dr Giuffrida noted that the prisoner had resided with his mother on and off for many years and had not on any other occasion been violent to her. There was no history of any violence by the prisoner against any of his partners or his children. Dr Giuffrida considered that, given the highly specific nature of the prisoner’s violence in the offence against his mother, he would be only a low to moderate risk to others, “if the future risk factors could be managed with a focus on the relationship with anyone whom Mr Parkes lived with in the future”. 
     
      
    85 In his oral evidence in chief Dr Giuffrida said that he had not, until the day on which he gave evidence, viewed the video recording of the walk through interview of the prisoner on 18 February 2005. Dr Giuffrida said that in the video the prisoner appeared remarkably similar to the way in which he had appeared on the two occasions on which Dr Giuffrida had interviewed and examined the prisoner. 
     
      
    86 Dr Giuffrida gave the following evidence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “On the two occasions that I have seen him and on that video, he’s always struck me as alert. He has been remarkably cognitively intact. He is able to give a detailed, coherent history with a good deal of detail, seemingly good recollection of recent and remote events. He’s always been clearly despondent in his mood ….his affect has always been and throughout the interview consistently flat and very restricted in its range. So certainly has always appeared depressed, but on no occasion have I found him to show any formal signs of psychiatric illness in the sense there’s never been a formal thought disorder, no evidence of any delusional ideas or has he ever appeared to be responding to auditory or other hallucinations…” 
        
       
      
    87 In his oral evidence Dr Giuffrida drew a distinction between a person being currently and temporarily intoxicated by an intoxicating substance and a person suffering from long term psychotogenic effects of using the substance. At a particular time the prisoner might not have been currently intoxicated by a substance but he might have been suffering from the long term psychotogenic effects of using the substance. 
     
      
    88 In cross-examination Dr Giuffrida said that the prisoner was shown in the video of the walk through interview of 18 February as functioning “pretty well” and better than Dr Giuffrida would have expected. Dr Giuffrida opined that the prisoner had developed a high level of tolerance to cannabis. 
     
      
    89 In his oral evidence Dr Giuffrida expressed the opinion that the prisoner had found coping with his own life a struggle and that the burden of looking after his mother had pushed him beyond his capacity. Dr Giuffrida agreed that the experience of looking after his mother for a few weeks had given the prisoner an insight into what the future had in store for him. 
     
      
    90 In his own evidence in chief the prisoner said that it had distressed him to leave his employment with the Spastic Centre and to know that he would have to look after his mother on a full-time basis. 
     
      
    91 It was submitted on behalf of the prisoner that I should find that at the time of committing the offence the prisoner was subject to abnormal mental conditions. It was submitted that I should accept Dr Giuffrida’s opinions about the mental conditions affecting the prisoner and should find that these mental conditions had, to some extent, impaired the prisoner’s capacity to control himself when he found himself facing a future as his mother’s full-time carer, his capacity to appreciate the nature and seriousness of what he was proposing to do and his capacity to judge whether what he was proposing to do was right or wrong. 
     
      
    92 I will now make findings about the prisoner’s general mental condition and about his mental state at and about the time of committing the offence. I accept Dr Giuffrida’s evidence that the prisoner has a longstanding gender identity disorder, a related gender identity dysphoria, a virtually life long dysthymic disorder of mood including poor self esteem and feelings of hopelessness, that he has suffered from episodes of a major depressive disorder and that he has an underlying avoidant personality disorder leading to the prisoner being inhibited and socially withdrawn. I accept that since being imprisoned the prisoner has been suicidal. 
     
      
    93 The prisoner does not suffer from schizophrenia and does not suffer from any psychotic illness.  
     
      
    94 For many years the prisoner has abused cannabis. However, for at least some time before the offence was committed the prisoner was smoking cannabis leaf and not cannabis heads and he had developed a high level of tolerance to cannabis. He had resumed using cannabis after he had been abstinent while he was in prison for the armed robbery offences and then while he was being supervised on parole. He was not intoxicated by cannabis at the time of committing the offence. 
     
      
    95 I do not consider that at the time of committing the offence the prisoner’s capacity to function was impaired to any significant extent by the long-term effects of abusing cannabis. 
     
      
    96 Particularly when interviewed by Dr Giuffrida in September 2005 and February 2006 the prisoner claimed that he heard voices, that is that he had auditory hallucinations and that he had had an hallucination of a voice commanding him to kill his mother. 
     
      
    97 There is no reference to the prisoner hearing voices in his interviews by police on 21 January 2005 and 13 February 2005, although this could be regarded as unsurprising, because in each of these interviews the prisoner was seeking to convey that he had had nothing to do with his mother’s death. However, I consider it significant that there is little reference by the prisoner to hearing voices in the lengthy interviews of the prisoner on 18 February 2005, in which the prisoner disclosed that he had killed his mother.  
     
      
    98 In these interviews the prisoner spoke, almost exclusively, in terms of thoughts occurring to him, not of voices telling him something. The only reference to a voice or voices in these interviews, to which I was directed by counsel or which I have been able to discover for myself, is an answer at p 22 of the transcript of the walk through interview on 18 February 2005, where the prisoner said that “A voice in my head was saying ‘enough is enough’”. 
     
      
    99 There are brief references to the prisoner reporting hearing voices in Department of Corrective Services documents in February and March 2005.  
     
      
    100 Dr Giuffrida was of the opinion that the prisoner was not responding to any auditory command hallucination when he killed his mother and I accept Dr Giuffrida’s opinion. Indeed, counsel for the prisoner did not make any submission to the contrary. Furthermore, I do not consider that the prisoner was suffering from an auditory hallucination of any kind at the time he killed his mother. I am prepared to accept that at some other times he might have had auditory hallucinations.  
     
      
    101 I accept Dr Giuffrida’s evidence that the prisoner showed no sign of psychotic illness or of delusions or of disordered thinking and that he was cognitively intact, with a good memory. 
     
      
    102 Dr Giuffrida expressed the opinion in his first report that the prisoner’s capacity to understand events “in the most general sense” had been affected by his mental disorders, although there could be no question but that he understood the specific nature of his offence. Dr Giuffrida also expressed the opinion in his first report that the prisoner’s capacity to make a moral judgment had been impaired by the same mental disorders. 
     
      
    103 Having regard, in particular, to the prisoner’s evidence in the interviews of 18 February 2005 about the steps taken by him in preparing to commit the offence, the steps taken by him in the actual committing of the offence and the steps taken by him in attempting to conceal his responsibility for the offence, and to concessions made by Dr Giuffrida in his oral evidence, I do not consider that the prisoner’s capacity to understand events or to judge whether his actions were right or wrong was in any way impaired by his mental disorders. I do accept that the prisoner’s mental disorders did, to some extent, impair his capacity to control himself when he found himself facing a future as his mother’s full-time carer. 
     
      
    104 The prisoner’s mental disorders have already made, and will continue to make, imprisonment more onerous for him than it is for a normal person. 
     
      
       
      Factors Generally 
       
      
    105 The maximum sentence for murder is imprisonment for the life of the offender. However, a sentence of life imprisonment is reserved for the worst class of case and it was not suggested by the Crown that the present offence merited a life sentence. 
     
      
    106 The standard non-parole period under Div 1A of Pt 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for the offence of murder is twenty years. However, as the prisoner pleaded guilty to the offence, the standard non-parole period is not applicable R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at 184-185 (68-71). However, the standard non-parole period still has relevance as a point of reference. I consider that the offence was at least in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of murder. 
     
      
    107 I summarise some of the more salient objective facts of the offence as follows. 
     
      
    108 The victim of the offence, the prisoner’s mother, was eighty-four years old and suffered from a number of serious health problems. She was largely dependent on the prisoner.  
     
      
    109 The prisoner killed his mother by striking her a number of times on the head with a piece of pipe, using considerable force. A short interval of time elapsed between the prisoner first striking the victim on her forehead and then striking the victim on the top of her head. The prisoner clearly had an intention to kill his mother. 
     
      
    110 The prisoner killed his mother, because he found her conduct towards him intensely irritating and frustrating and because he found the prospect of continuing to care for her unendurable. I accept that his capacity to endure that prospect was lessened to some extent by the longstanding personality disorders to which he was subject.  
     
      
    111 The prisoner did not kill his mother in response to any auditory hallucination. His capacity to understand what he was doing and to judge that it was morally wrong was not impaired by any mental state of the prisoner. 
     
      
    112 The offence was premeditated in that prior to 16 January 2005 the prisoner had sometimes thought of killing his mother and from early in the morning of 16 January 2005 he had been thinking of killing her.  
     
      
    113 There was a moderate degree of planning in that the prisoner first considered, and then rejected, using a car jack or a wheel brace as a murder weapon and then selected a discarded piece of pipe as the weapon he would use. The prisoner put on gloves which were at the premises, so as to avoid leaving his finger prints on the piece of pipe. 
     
      
    114 After committing the offence the prisoner took a number of steps in an endeavour to conceal his responsibility for the killing, including disposing of the murder weapon and the gloves he had worn.  
     
      
    115 I have already referred to a number of factors which are aggravating factors under s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, such as (k) that the offender abused a position of trust or a position analogous to a position of trust, (l) that the victim was vulnerable and (n) that there was some planning. Many of the aggravating factors listed in s 21A(2) are elements of, or inherent in, an offence of murder. Although there were two separate assaults, I would not find that there was gratuitous cruelty, over and above the cruelty necessarily inherent in the committing of the offence. I do not regard the prisoner’s record of previous convictions as an aggravating factor. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    116 A number of mitigating factors under s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act are present. 
     
      
    117 The prisoner pleaded guilty to the offence. The prisoner did not immediately admit his guilt and admitted his guilt, only after he had been told by a police officer that he was the principal suspect. The plea of guilty was, however, an early plea of guilty and I would allow a discount of 20 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    118 The Crown disputed that the prisoner had shown any contrition. It is true that the regret the prisoner expressed was for the effect of the crime on his children and the other members of his family, rather than contrition for the killing of his mother. I will, however, allow a small discount for contrition. 
     
      
    119 Counsel for the prisoner submitted that I should allow the prisoner a discount for assistance provided by the prisoner to law enforcement authorities in the investigation of his mother’s death. Between 17 January 2005 and 13 February 2005 the prisoner did the opposite of assisting the authorities, lying to police in the statement of 17 January 2005 and in the two long interviews by police. However, on 18 February 2005 the prisoner made full, truthful admissions to police, he retrieved and handed over to police one of the gloves he had worn, he participated in a walk through interview and he showed police where he had thrown the other glove, the murder weapon and the plastic bag in which he had carried the weapon and the gloves from his mother’s home. Having been shown by the prisoner where he had thrown those items, the police were able to recover them.  
     
      
    120 It is true that the prisoner provided such assistance, only after he had been told by police that he was the principal suspect. However, although police understandably regarded the prisoner as the principal suspect, it might have been difficult to prove the prisoner’s guilt, in the absence of any admission by him. The prisoner had disposed of the murder weapon. As the prisoner had been living in his mother’s house any traces of the prisoner’s DNA on items in the house might well have been open to an innocent explanation. The prisoner told the police officer in charge of the investigation that he would not say anything until the results of forensic tests had been received, but he would then appear to have admitted his guilt, without having received the results of those tests.  
     
      
    121 I consider that I should allow some discount for the prisoner’s assistance.  
     
      
    122 Apart from the two convictions for armed robbery and the convictions for the associated offences of maliciously damaging property by fire (and one traffic offence), the prisoner has no previous criminal history. I take into account the prisoner’s service to the Spastic Centre. 
     
      
    123 I accept Dr Giuffrida’s opinion that, for the reasons stated by Dr Giuffrida, the prisoner presents only a low to moderate risk of harm to others in the community.  
     
      
    124 I accept that the prisoner has been in some form of protective custody since March 2005, that he is suicidal, that it is likely that he will remain in some form of protective custody for the term of his sentence and that he will find prison life more onerous than do prisoners in the general prison population. 
     
      
    125 I find special circumstances in the prisoner’s mental disorders and his need for treatment for these disorders. 
     
      
    126 The sentence I pronounce will commence from 18 February 2005, when the prisoner was taken into custody.  
     
      
    127 For the offence of murdering Grace Winifred Parkes, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of thirteen years commencing on 18 February 2005 and expiring on 17 February 2018. I set a balance of the term of five years. The earliest date on which you will be eligible to be released on parole will be 17 February 2018.

     Judgment 
    1 HODGSON JA: On 30 July 2003, the applicant pleaded guilty to two charges: (1) That he between 1 January 2000 and 1 December 2000 at Punchbowl in the State of New South Wales did supply a prohibited drug namely heroin.(2) That he between 1 January 2000 and 1 December 2000 at Punchbowl in the State of New South Wales did supply a prohibited drug namely cocaine.2 Both charges were brought under s.25(1) of Drugs Misuse & Trafficking Act, and each carried a maximum penalty of a fine of 2,000 penalty units or 15 years imprisonment or both. 3 The agreed facts indicate that the offence in each case consisted not in a single transaction but in an ongoing course of conduct; but there could of course be no suggestion that there was a commercial quantity of drugs involved in either case (that is, in each case 250 grams), because that would have attracted a charge under s.25(2) of the Drugs Misuse & Trafficking Act, carrying a penalty of a fine of 3,500 penalty units or 20 years imprisonment or both. 4 On 27 February 2004, the sentencing judge sentenced the applicant on each charge to 6 years imprisonment to commence on 27 February 2004, with a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 27 February 2004 and expiring on 26 February 2008. 5 At the time, the applicant was serving a sentence for manslaughter of 10 years commencing on 26 May 2001, with a non-parole period of 5 years expiring on 25 May 2006. Accordingly, the head sentences on the subject charges were totally concurrent with the head sentence on the manslaughter charge, while the non-parole period on the subject charges was concurrent to the extent of 2 years and 3 months with the non-parole period for the manslaughter charge.6 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences. CIRCUMSTANCES7 The charges arose out of the supply of heroin and cocaine from the applicant’s family home, between 1 January 2000 and 1 December 2000. During that year, the applicant was in custody from 20 March 2000 to 23 August 2000, and again from about 23 November 2000. Accordingly, the conduct the subject of the charges did not extend beyond about five and a half months. 8 The agreed facts were set out as follows in the reasons of the sentencing judge: 
     
      
       
        
        In March 2000 Strike Force Ranger commenced an investigation into drug dealing from [the street in which the applicant’s family home was situated]. Through the use of electronic surveillance it was established that heroin and cocaine were being supplied from outside [that home]. The sale of heroin and cocaine would commence at 9am and finish about 11pm each day. The street runners who were mostly juvenile males worked in two shifts, morning and afternoon. The heroin was wrapped in aluminium foil with the shiny side of the foil wrapped inwards. The heroin was sold in $25, $50 and $70 deals and was stored by the street runners in a black plastic film canister. The cocaine was sold in $50 and $100 deals and was packaged with the shiny side of the aluminium foil facing outwards. The cocaine was stored by the street runners in a clear plastic film container.  
         
         
        The heroin and cocaine enterprise was conducted from [the home]. The premises are owned and occupied by AD, the father of AD and MD. The drugs were prepared in the front bedroom of the premises. The street dealers, upon arrival at work, would collect the film canisters containing the drugs and drug phone and then remain on the front verandah of [the home] or in the immediate vicinity. At times street dealers would have to replenish by going into [the home] and obtaining further drugs. Customers would ring a mobile phone number used by the syndicate before placing an order and then being told to come into the street. The customer was then met by the street dealer outside [the home] and the transaction conducted. The storage of the bulk heroin and cocaine was stored at a safe house and brought to the street on a needs basis.  
         
         
        On 2 August 2000 police executed a search warrant on [the home]. Inside the front bedroom police located two sets of electronic scales. In the back yard police located a hole in the fence that could only be accessed from [the home]. On the ground under a ceramic tile was a clear plastic bag tied in a knot. This contained two black plastic film canisters and one clear plastic film canister. The canisters contained fourteen foils of heroin, sixteen foils of heroin and nine foils of cocaine (as said) respectively.  
         
         
        On 2 August (as said) 2000 police executed a number of search warrants and arrested six juvenile street runners in connection with the supply of heroin and cocaine from [the street] These persons included OR and MF. All six have been since dealt with in the Children's Court. Despite this, the syndicate continued to supply heroin and cocaine. The syndicate, however, no longer used a mobile phone to take calls from customers. It was done simply by customers stopping outside [the home] and being met by a street dealer.  
         
         
        Telephone intercepts 
        . Between 31 March 2000 and 24 June 2000 telephone intercepts were placed on two drug phones used by the syndicate. The mobile phones were registered in false names. The phone would be turned on at 9am and turned off at 11pm each day. Between 50 and 70 calls a day were received by the syndicate with a total of 4000 phone calls monitored. The street dealers answering the phone would answer the name under the pseudonyms of ""Sam"", ""Michael"" or ""George"". The customers predominantly used codes such as ""coke"", ""pepsi"", ""occy"", 
          
        ""a quarter of c"" when requesting cocaine, and ""h"", ""hazza"" and ""hammer"" for heroin.  
         
         
        Between 26 May until 5 October 2000 undercover operatives attended [the street]. On thirty-seven occasions heroin and cocaine were sold to undercover operatives. On each occasion listening devices and video footage captured members of the syndicate supplying undercover operatives. The heroin purchased had a purity of 30 to 40 per cent and the cocaine had the purity between 70 to 80 per cent.  
         
         
        Video surveillance 
        . Between 12 March 2000 and 22 September 2000 police installed a camera capable of video taping the activities within [the street]. Approximately 600 hours of activity were captured. The footage shows that on a daily basis the drug supply from outside [the home] would commence at 9am. Customers would arrive predominantly in cars or some on foot. Street runners would meet them at which time they would remove a film canister from their pockets and remove something from a canister and exchange it with a customer for money.  
         
         
        Witnesses 
        . The first witness known as Amber is a former drug user who attended [the street] on a daily basis. The witness and her boyfriend at the time, Grant Brettle, had bought heroin and cocaine from [the street] from November 1999. Amber and Grant were the biggest customers daily buying heroin and cocaine, up to three or four times a day. The witness's evidence is corroborated by video footage and telephone intercept calls in which orders for cocaine and heroin were discussed with members of the syndicate including the quality of the drugs supplied. She recalls the street dealers having film canisters - black for heroin, clear for cocaine.  
         
         
        The second witness known as John Le was a school friend of each of the three accused since [1988]. He knows their nicknames and visited [the home] regularly. In August 2000 he was recruited by MD to sell heroin and cocaine. The witness received $100 a day working the afternoon shift. The witness observed the preparation of the drugs within the front bedroom at [the home]. The witness has been captured on electronic surveillance supplying heroin and cocaine. He also supplied cocaine to an undercover operative in [the street] and was later arrested and charged with drug offences relating to his involvement.  
         
         
        Between 1 January and 10 March 2000 MD lived at [the home] with his mother and father along with his older brother, AD, and his young brother, OD.  
         
         
        The witness informer Amber bought heroin and cocaine from [the home] during this time by contacting a mobile phone before coming into [the street]. She had been buying heroin from [the street] since November 1999. During this period of time she met MD who introduced himself as M. M lived at [the home] with his brother A. She met M daily and when he received a new batch of heroin or cocaine he would provide a sample for her to test. M told her that he was in charge of the heroin but not in charge of the cocaine. She was told this by M after she had $80 and wanted a $50 deal of cocaine and a $50 deal of heroin. MD told her she could get credit for the heroin but not the cocaine as it was not his. Amber believed the cocaine was being sold on behalf of the person she identified as the “love myself bloke"", Bashir Ibrahim.  
         
         
        When MD was placed in custody in March 2000 Amber recalls ""R"", that is OR, took over the sale of heroin and cocaine. She then bought heroin and cocaine from ""R"", OR; ""G"", that is MF; ""Big R"", MR; and two juveniles ""Cuckoo"", KK, and a male she identified in a lineup as SD. Amber recalls after MD was released an Asian male began selling heroin and cocaine in [the street]. She asked for credit for the heroin and the Asian male would ask M or if it was for the cocaine the Asian male would ask the ""love myself bloke"" if he was there.  
         
         
        The Asian male is the witness informer, John Le. The witness informer Le had been a regular visitor to the D house. Le states that although MD was in charge of the sale of heroin, MD sold the cocaine on behalf of his brother … and Bashir Ibrahim. Le stated that heroin and cocaine customers would ring a mobile phone before being told to come into [the street]. On Monday 10 January 2000 MD taunted patrolling police by yelling ""Still making money in the street"". The following day patrolling police observed MD with a large amount of hundred dollar bills. He waved the money and yelled ""It’s hot"".  
         
         
        On 10 March 2000 MD was arrested and placed into custody. He was released on 23 August 2000 and returned to live at [the home]. Shortly after his release he approached the informer witness Le and requested that he sell heroin and cocaine for him. Le accepted and commenced work on the afternoon shift. Each afternoon MD handed him three film canisters containing various amounts of heroin and cocaine. The heroin was in black plastic canisters and the cocaine in a clear plastic film canister. Le would do up to thirty transactions a shift. He witnessed during this time MD and Mohamad Masri making up deals of heroin and cocaine in the front room of [the home]. On a normal shift Le would sell approximately $1200 of heroin and $1500 worth of cocaine. Le's biggest customers were Amber and Grant. At the completion of the shift Le would hand all the unsold drugs and the money to MD. MD would then pay him $140. Le states that MD sourced the drugs from Gerda Kalaji and the drugs not used were taken from the street by Mohamad Masri and stored at a safe house. They were brought back into the street by Mohamad Masri when required.  
         
         
        On 29 September 2000 undercover operative Billy attended outside [the home]. 
         
         
        On 29 September undercover operative Billy attended [the home]. MD approached the vehicle. The undercover operative asked for ""Two 50s of charlie"" - that is, two 50 deals of cocaine. MD questioned the undercover operative as to who he was and who had brought him into the street. The undercover operative then stated that it was friends. MD then called out to the street dealer informer witness John Le and asked if he knew him. Le confirmed this at which time MD said ""I’ll send the bloke around here, I don' t do nothing bro, it's up to him"". Whilst Le was carrying groceries in for Mrs.D, AD approached the undercover operative Billy and asked him ""What are you after bro?"". Billy replied ""Two 50s, sorry charlie"". AD then asked who had sent him. AD then yelled out to Le ""Have you seen him before?"". ""I saw him yesterday anyway"". MD had by then moved away from the vehicle but returned and yelled at the undercover operative ""No nothing, go, we give him nothing"". The conversation is reported by way of a listening device and is partly captured on video.  
         
         
        On 26 November 2000 police executed a search warrant on [the home]. Le was  
        arrested by po 
        li 
        ce  
        i 
        n the front yard of  
        [the home]. 
          
        In the front bedroom police located a set of electronic scales. In a drain at the front of the house police located a Remington zip bag. There is a dispute about who owns that bag. Inside the bag was located one plastic bag containing heroin 8.5 grams; two bags of cocaine 10.5 grams; and fifty-six deals of heroin wrapped in foil. 
        
       
      
    REASONS OF SENTENCING JUDGE9 The sentencing judge gave the following additional reasons for the sentences: 
     
      
       
        
        The circumstances of the plea are that the offender pleaded not guilty and a voir dire was conducted concerning the admissibility of audio tape evidence and video tapes of a search conducted at premises in Telopea Street, Punchbowl - some 4000 hours of audio tapes and 600 hours of video tapes. A trial was estimated to last about six weeks. The Crown concedes that the plea was made at the earliest opportunity to an appropriate charge. There was a considerable utilitarian value in the plea. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        The Department of Juvenile Justice prepared a report and it was compiled from an interview with the offender and notes that, whilst admitted to Goulburn Correctional Centre, the offender has spent some two and a half years in the segregation unit. He reported that he is involved in counselling programs run at the Centre and indicated that he was prepared to participate in programs when released into the community. He stated that he would like to complete his basic age to the School Certificate level on his release. He receives weekly visits from family whilst his extended family visits him on a monthly basis. He also receives spiritual guidance and support from an Imam who visits the gaol once a month from the Auburn Mosque. 
         
         
        I have found special circumstances in this case being the offender's age and, as fragile as they are at this stage, prospects of rehabilitation. A psychologist's report from Mr Terry Smith was prepared. He sets out the background and in his opinions and conclusions states that after the offender was released from custody in August 2000, a well-known drug boss made requests of him to act in a managerial role in the running of drugs from his home in [the street]. He was paid a wage proportional to the number of hours he worked. The influence of the organiser was enhanced because of his reputation not only within the Bankstown area but elsewhere.  
         
         
        In coming to sentence I have borne in mind the age of the offender at that time. He was born in December 1983 so he was a little under seventeen when some of these offences were committed and was no doubt vulnerable to pressure from the person who was dealing in drugs.  
         
         
        Mr Smith notes that the offender has developed a range of symptoms bordering on anxiety and depression during his incarceration. He said his prognosis is somewhat difficult to judge because he has been in prison since he was a young adult. Smith said it is understandable that the influence to participate in the group's activities to a 17 year old must have been daunting. He made a choice based on identifying with his siblings and friends rather than being able to choose with insight. Mr Smith continues he has been incarcerated for two years in segregation and did not express resentment or hostility about his lot. He argues to possess all of the criteria to live a positive and adaptive lifestyle. Mr Smith continues he has the support of his family and promise of employment.  
         
         
        His counsel in submissions noted that he was in custody from 10 March 2000 to August 2000, that he was re-arrested on 26 November 2000 and he has been in custody since then. His counsel also submitted that the offender's role was not as significant as it appears on the face of it because when he entered custody the operation continued in his absence. He submitted that he was a prisoner involved in dealing at the street level.  
         
         
        In my view the context which I have outlined in this very considerable operation identifies the offender as, as young as he was, not simply being caught up at the street level in the extensive trafficking that was taking place. It is very important in coming to sentence to bear in mind the charges that have been brought against the offender and not to sentence him for matters for which he has not been charged, otherwise we would be in conflict with the [De] Simoni principle.  
         
         
        Mr O'Brien submitted that in the facts as tendered by the Crown over protest there was material as to how much cocaine and how much heroin was sold by Mr Le and others every day of the week. That was in dispute. In coming to sentence I have not taken into account that statement. Mr O'Brien also referred to the [De] Simoni principle in his submission that:  
         
          
          ""My submission is that any such evidence which is capable of establishing a commercial quantity or beyond is totally inadmissible and must be rejected by your Honour on the basis that it would offend the principle of the High Court in [De] Simoni. It is my submission that the prisoner cannot be invited to plead to one level of offence and then have the Crown invite sentence for an aggravated level of that offence.""  
          
         
         
        There is no contest about that submission and it is accepted.  
         
         
        I will now deal with the offender's pre-sentence custody. On 26 November he was charged and arrested for three offences. He was bail refused for those matters on 26 November and remains so. The trial for those matters is listed in the Sydney Supreme Court on 5 July 2004.  
         
         
        On 26 December 2000 the offender was charged with common assault, affray, armed with intent to commit an indictable offence and maliciously destroy property in excess of $2000 and under $5000. He was sentenced on 6 June 2001 at Gosford Local Court to six months fixed term. That was backdated commencing 22 December 2000 and concluding 21 June 2001.  
         
         
        On 5 February 2001 he was charged with murder. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced on 12 February 2003 to ten years imprisonment with a five year non-parole period. The head sentence commenced on 26 May 2001 and concludes on 25 May [2011]. The non-parole period granted was five years and as such the earliest date for parole is 25 May 2006. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        The offender was arrested for the drug offence of supply cocaine and heroin on 19 May 2001. At the time he was charged with the offences and was bail refused and of course he was in custody on other matters. Sentence was imposed from 6 June 2001 and 12 February 2003 and was backdated to take any pre-sentence custody in relation to those offences into account. As a result, the prisoner has not spent any time in custody on these charges prior to the sentencing date and no pre-sentence custody is available to take into account.  
         
         
        The offender was the organiser of the supply organisation for a period of about five and a half months. As it was said in submissions, the offender was ""punching over his weight"". At the age of seventeen he was running a well-organised street supply organisation. I have given careful consideration to comparison with his criminality with MR and because of the offender's intimate involvement in the organisation, albeit for a short period of time, I am of the opinion that the prisoner's criminality was more extensive.  
         
         
        The offender's age at the time of the offence is such that I find special circumstances and [Pearce's] case requires me to fix an appropriate sentence for the two charges and then consider questions of concurrence and accumulation. As the offence occurred over the same period, the only distinction being the difference in drugs, I will make the sentences concurrent.  
         
         
        I have had regard to the totality of the criminality involved and the prisoner's age of seventeen at the time of the offences and it leads me to conclude that the sentence should be partially concurrent with the sentence that he is presently serving. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Apart from the period when the offender was admitted to bail and unfortunately returned to his offending behaviour and was re-arrested in November 2000, he has been in custody now for a long period of time. To make the sentence appropriate in the circumstances I could well deliver a wholly cumulative - could well deliver a crushing blow to someone who has just passed his twentieth birthday.  
        
       
      
    GROUNDS OF APPEAL10 The applicant seeks leave to appeal on the following grounds:(1) That the sentence was manifestly excessive.(2) That the sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account s.21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.(3) That the sentencing judge erred in failing to specify the reduction given by virtue of plea of guilty and the utilitarian value of the plea.SUBMISSIONS11 Mr. Terracini SC for the applicant submitted that, given the age and other subjective features of the applicant, particularly his custodial history, the sentences were manifestly excessive: see R v. Dimovski NSWCCA 3/8/92; R v. Ahmadi [1999] NSWCCA 161; R v. Tipler [2000] NSWCCA 382. Mr. Terracini placed particular emphasis on the harshness of the applicant’s custody in the High Risk Management Unit (HRMU) at Goulburn Correctional Centre between 18 December 2001 and the date of sentencing, that is 27 February 2004, and thereafter up to about July 2005. Mr. Terracini pointed out that, although the primary judge did advert to the circumstance that the applicant had been held in this unit prior to his sentencing, he did not advert to the circumstance that he was still being held there and would be so held for an indefinite period into the future. In fact, he was held there for a further period of about 17 months. Mr. Terracini referred to Kanaan v. Regina [2006] NSWCCA 109 at [265]. 12 Mr. Terracini submitted that the sentences actually imposed were appropriate for a charge of commercial supply rather than indictable supply: R v. Markarian [2003] NSWCCA 8, 137 A Crim R 497; R v. Ambatsidis [2000] NSWCCA 125. Particularly was this so having regard to the age of the applicant, his susceptibility to the influence of others, and the circumstance that he was paid a wage rather than being a beneficiary of the profits of the operation. 13 On the second ground, Mr. Terracini submitted that the sentencing judge erred in failing to explicitly take into account matters set out in s.21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act: see Regina v. Walker [2005] NSWCCA 109; Regina v. Street [2005] NSWCCA 139 at [32]-[34]. In particular, Mr. Terracini submitted that the sentencing judge gave no adequate consideration of the fact that the applicant had no record for similar offences (s.21A(3)(e)); gave no adequate consideration of whether the applicant was likely to re-offend (s.21A(3)(g)); gave no adequate consideration of whether the applicant was not fully aware of the consequences of his actions because of his age (s.21A(3)(j)); and did not adequately consider the applicant’s guilty plea (s.21A(3)(k)). 14 Mr. Terracini submitted that, whilst the sentencing judge referred to the fact that the plea was made at the first available opportunity and that there was considerable utilitarian value in the plea, he erred in failing to indicate the extent of the reduction given. In this case, the plea was entered at the first available opportunity after the Crown brought the appropriate charge: R v. Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117; R v. SY [2003] NSWCCA 291. DECISION15 Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides as follows:

        General 
         
        In determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the court is to take into account the following matters:  
         
        (a) the aggravating factors referred to in subsection (2) that are relevant and known to the court, 
         
        (b) the mitigating factors referred to in subsection (3) that are relevant and known to the court, 
         
        (c) any other objective or subjective factor that affects the relative seriousness of the offence. 
         
        The matters referred to in this subsection are in addition to any other matters that are required or permitted to be taken into account by the court under any Act or rule of law. 
         
        (2)  
        Aggravating factors 
         
        The aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows:  
         
        (a) the victim was a police officer, emergency services worker, correctional officer, judicial officer, health worker, teacher, community worker, or other public official, exercising public or community functions and the offence arose because of the victim’s occupation, 
         
        (b) the offence involved the actual or threatened use of violence, 
         
        (c) the offence involved the actual or threatened use of a weapon, 
         
        (d) the offender has a record of previous convictions, 
         
        (e) the offence was committed in company, 
         
        (f) the offence involved gratuitous cruelty, 
         
        (g) the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial, 
         
        (h) the offence was motivated by hatred for or prejudice against a group of people to which the offender believed the victim belonged (such as people of a particular religion, racial or ethnic origin, language, sexual orientation or age, or having a particular disability), 
         
        (i) the offence was committed without regard for public safety, 
         
        (j) the offence was committed while the offender was on conditional liberty in relation to an offence or alleged offence, 
         
        (k) the offender abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim, 
         
        (l) the victim was vulnerable, for example, because the victim was very young or very old or had a disability, or because of the victim’s occupation (such as a taxi driver, bank teller or service station attendant), 
         
        (m) the offence involved multiple victims or a series of criminal acts, 
         
        (n) the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity. 
         
        The court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence. 
         
        (3)  
        Mitigating factors 
         
        The mitigating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows:  
         
        (a) the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was not substantial, 
         
        (b) the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity, 
         
        (c) the offender was provoked by the victim, 
         
        (d) the offender was acting under duress, 
         
        (e) the offender does not have any record (or any significant record) of previous convictions, 
         
        (f) the offender was a person of good character, 
         
        (g) the offender is unlikely to re-offend, 
         
        (h) the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, whether by reason of the offender’s age or otherwise, 
         
        (i) the offender has shown remorse for the offence by making reparation for any injury, loss or damage or in any other manner, 
         
        (j) the offender was not fully aware of the consequences of his or her actions because of the offender’s age or any disability, 
         
        (k) a plea of guilty by the offender (as provided by section 22), 
         
        (l) the degree of pre-trial disclosure by the defence (as provided by section 22A), 
         
        (m) assistance by the offender to law enforcement authorities (as provided by section 23). 
         
        (4) The court is not to have regard to any such aggravating or mitigating factor in sentencing if it would be contrary to any Act or rule of law to do so. 
         
        (5) The fact that any such aggravating or mitigating factor is relevant and known to the court does not require the court to increase or reduce the sentence for the offence. 
        
       
      
    16 In my opinion, it is desirable to explicitly advert to applicable factors identified in s.21A(2) and (3), and to indicate how they are being taken into account, if this is not obvious: cf. R v. Walker [2005] NSWCCA 109 at [32]. However, in my opinion, the absence of such explicit advertence is not of itself a breach of s.21A. Such absence may, in combination with other factors, indicate that s.21A has not been complied with; but the question of whether s.21A has or has not been complied with must be considered in the light of both what is said and what is not said in the reasons. 17 In the present case, it is not shown that s.21A(3) has not been complied with. As regards par.(e), the applicant’s record was adverted to, and in my opinion there was no need to comment explicitly on the nature of the offences in that record. As regards par.(g), the sentencing judge referred to the prospects and prognosis of the applicant. As regards par.(j), the sentencing judge adverted to the applicant’s choice to offend as being based on identifying with his siblings and friends. As regards par.(k), the plea of guilty was plainly taken into account.18 The sentencing judge adverted to the plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity to an appropriate charge, and stated there was a considerable utilitarian value in the plea. In my opinion, this reference, and the level of the sentences, indicates that the sentencing judge did give an appropriate discount. The failure to quantify this discount in the reasons is not in my opinion an error warranting appellate intervention. 19 In my opinion, the question of excessiveness of the sentences should be considered, at least when what is in issue is whether there should be appellate intervention, having particular regard to the practical impact of the sentences on the applicant. When one takes into account the sentence which the applicant was already serving for manslaughter, it can be seen that the only practical impact of the sentences on the applicant is a delay of the time at which the applicant would become eligible for parole from 25 May 2006 to 26 February 2008, a period of about 1 year and 9 months. Even when one takes into account the early plea of guilty, the age of applicant, the circumstance that he was not shown to be participating in the profits of the enterprise and the circumstance that he was under the influence of siblings and friends and others, it cannot be said that this is manifestly excessive, having regard to the nature and extent of the criminal enterprise and the applicant’s organisational role in it. Further, I do not think the harshness of the applicant’s custody in the HRMU at Goulburn Correctional Centre is a powerful consideration in his favour: the only period for which the sentences under appeal have effect, namely 25 May 2006 to 26 February 2008, is a period beginning almost a year after that harsh custody had ceased. 20 For those reasons, in my opinion the following orders should be made:1. Leave to appeal granted.2. Appeal dismissed.21 JAMES J: I agree with Hodgson JA22 HOEBEN J: I agree with Hodgson JA.

    Judgment 
     
      
    1 JOHNSON J: This is an appeal under s.56(1)(c) of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (“Appeal and Review Act”) by the Plaintiff, the Director of Public Prosecutions, with respect to proceedings that came before Magistrate William Pierce, the Second Defendant, at the Burwood Local Court on 14 October 2005. 
     
      
    2 The proceedings involved a charge of unlicensed driving against the First Defendant, Sinan Cakici. On 14 October 2005, the Second Defendant dismissed the charge. 
     
      
       
      The Present Appeal 
       
      
    3 An appeal to this Court by a prosecutor under s.56 is confined to grounds involving a question of law alone: Director of Public Prosecutions v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 343 at paragraph 58ff. This appeal does raise such a question.  
     
      
    4 The Second Defendant, in accordance with usual practice, has submitted to any order of the Court except costs. The First Defendant has appeared in person and unrepresented both on 1 May 2006 when the matter was first before me, and today when the matter proceeded to hearing. 
     
      
    5 The proceedings in the Local Court were prosecuted by a police officer. In accordance with usual practice, the Director of Public Prosecutions has taken over the proceedings for the purposes of ss.9 and 10 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986. 
     
      
    6 When the matter was called on for hearing this morning, Mr Dhanji, counsel for the Plaintiff, stated that the relief being sought in the Summons is now confined to certain orders only. An order under s.59(2) of the Appeal and Review Act setting aside the order of the Second Defendant is no longer sought. Nor is an order now sought that the matter be remitted to the Burwood Local Court to be heard and determined according to law. 
     
      
    7 The Plaintiff seeks an order in accordance with paragraph 2 of the Summons, namely, a declaration that the Magistrate erred in law as to the proper construction and application of the provisions of clause 37 Local Courts (Criminal and Applications Procedure) Rule 2003. The Plaintiff submits that it is important for this issue to be determined as Mr Dhanji submits that the fundamental question of procedure raised in this case is one which has caused the erroneous dismissal of other proceedings in the Local Court because of a perceived deficiency in the initiating process which was said to go to jurisdiction.  
     
      
    8 I accept that the issue raised by this Summons is of general importance and that it is appropriate to proceed to determine the matter, although it is not a determination which will have any adverse effect upon the First Defendant in the sense that he will again be placed in jeopardy with respect to the charge. 
     
      
       
      The Alleged Offence  
       
      
    9 The factual background to the present matter can be stated shortly. 
     
      
    10 It is alleged that at 6.10 pm on 24 June 2005, the First Defendant drove a vehicle on a public street at Bankstown without being licensed for that purpose, the First Defendant being a person who had never been licensed and who was not exempted by the Regulations from being licensed. This is an offence under s.25(2) Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998. 
     
      
       
      The Local Court Proceedings 
       
      
    11 A Court Attendance Notice (“CAN”) was issued and served on the First Defendant. He appeared at Burwood Local Court on the return date, 15 July 2005, before Magistrate Still. The First Defendant was unrepresented and entered a plea of guilty to the charge. 
     
      
    12 According to the transcript of proceedings on that day, which is in evidence before me, there was some short discussion between the presiding Magistrate and the First Defendant in which the First Defendant indicated that he had a number of fines outstanding exceeding the sum of $1,000.00. His Honour indicated that he would give the First Defendant an opportunity to make arrangements with the State Debt Recovery Office to pay the fines and, if that course was taken, it would assist the First Defendant on the question of penalty. 
     
      
    13 The First Defendant sought an adjournment to allow this to be done and the proceedings were adjourned to 14 October 2005 before the Burwood Local Court.  
     
      
    14 The bench sheet for 15 July 2005 confirms that the First Defendant entered a plea of guilty to the charge and bears a notation ""SDG"". It is apparent from procedural documents in evidence before me, that those letters were recorded by Magistrate Still and were shorthand for ""Standard Directions Given"". This was a reference to a document which is also in evidence before me. It appears that Magistrate Still adopted the practice with respect to this class of offence whereby, if an adjournment is granted following a plea of guilty, a document is given to the defendant indicating the things that were to be done (or not done) by him or her during the adjournment. In this case, the relevant document indicated that the First Defendant was to pay fines or obtain clearance from the State Debt Recovery Office and to get a valid licence and bring it to the Court on the adjourned date. The document emphasised that the First Defendant was not to drive without a licence.  
     
      
    15 The document noted, no doubt to emphasise the importance of these steps, that if the First Defendant took this action, then he would be dealt with leniently.  
     
      
    16 On 14 October 2005, the matter came before Magistrate Pierce at Burwood Local Court. The First Defendant did not appear on this occasion. The First Defendant told me, and I accept, that there was a misunderstanding as to the date and he was at work on that day. He has emphasised that he did not ignore the proceedings or fail to attend on that day because of a lack of interest in the proceedings. I accept this explanation. The First Defendant has demonstrated by his two appearances before this Court (in circumstances where he was not obliged to attend) that he has taken a serious view of these proceedings. He has sought to emphasise that he is attempting to do all he can to comply with his obligations with respect to the driver licensing laws. Mr Dhanji informed the Court that it was, in part at least, because of the First Defendant’s serious approach to these proceedings that the Plaintiff determined not to seek remittal of the matter to the Local Court. 
     
      
    17 I return to the events of 14 October 2005. The Second Defendant noticed the letters ""SDG"" on the bench sheet. From the transcript, his Honour appears to have formed the view that these letters stood, in some way, for the concept ""Summons Defective"". Of course, it is apparent on the evidence before me that the letters bore no such meaning. His Honour noted that the proceedings had been stood over from 15 July 2005 to 14 October 2005. His Honour surmised that this adjournment was to remedy what his Honour considered was a defect in the service of the CAN. Once again, it is clear on the evidence before me that this was not the purpose of the adjournment. 
     
      
    18 It is not clear how his Honour came to form these views. There is no sign in the papers, including the bench sheet, that such an issue had been raised on 15 July 2005. On that day, the First Defendant had appeared and pleaded guilty. The bench sheet recorded this fact. Clearly, the First Defendant had been served and he made no complaint of a jurisdictional nature about the matter. Nor did his Honour, Magistrate Still, have any concern in that regard.  
     
      
    19 The Prosecutor appearing before the Second Defendant on 14 October 2005 drew to the Court’s attention the fact that the matter was in for sentence and had been stood over to allow the First Defendant to pay fines. This was an entirely accurate statement of what had happened.  
     
      
    20 His Honour, however, took the view that the CAN was defective and dismissed the proceedings. The basis for this view was a notation on the CAN to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
         ""SERVICE DETAILS:  
         
         
        I have served on ACCUSED/DEFENDANT a copy of this court attendance notice in PERSON at 6.20pm on 24/06/2005 at WITNESSED by ACCUSED.  
        
       
       
        
        Sen Con MELANIE FLOREY (30548) Bankstown.” 
        
       
      
    21 The Second Defendant considered that the failure in the CAN to indicate a place of service was fatal both in respect to service and, apparently, to the jurisdiction of the Local Court. 
     
      
       
      Relevant Statutory Provisions 
       
      
    22 It is necessary to turn to the relevant statutory provisions governing these procedural issues.  
     
      
    23 Before the repeal in 2003 of the Justices Act 1902, the jurisdiction of the Local Court with respect to criminal proceedings flowed from the laying of an information. The service of a summons following the issue of the information, or the question of service generally, was unrelated to the issue of jurisdiction: Director of Public Prosecutions v Goben [1999] NSWSC 696 at paragraphs 16-24; Roads and Traffic Authority v Wood (2005) 63 NSWLR 596 at 600 (paragraphs 25-26) and Sharman v Director of Public Prosecutions [2006] NSWSC 135 at paragraphs 26 and 38. 
     
      
    24 In July 2003, the Justices Act 1902 was repealed and the statutory scheme for procedures in criminal prosecutions in the Local Court were included in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. It is those provisions which are presently relevant. In Sharman, Bell J observed that the investing of the jurisdiction in the Local Court with respect to criminal proceedings commenced by CAN was governed by reference to ss.177 and 178 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, taken with a number of rules within the Local Courts (Criminal and Applications Procedure) Rule 2003. 
     
      
    25 Section 172(1) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “172  
        Commencement of proceedings by court attendance notice 
          
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) Proceedings for an offence are to be commenced in a court by the issue and filing of a court attendance notice in accordance with this Division.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
       
      
    26 Sections 177 and 178 state: 
     
      
       
        
        “177  
        Service of court attendance notices 
         
         
        (1) A court attendance notice issued by a police officer must be served by a police officer in accordance with the rules. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) A court attendance notice issued by a public officer must be served by a police officer, public officer or other person of a class prescribed by the rules, in accordance with the rules. 
         
         
        (3) A copy of a court attendance notice issued by a person other than a police officer or a public officer must be served by a person of a class prescribed by the rules in accordance with the rules. 
         
         
        (4) A copy of a court attendance notice must, except with the leave of a Magistrate or a registrar of the court, be filed in a court not later than 7 days after it is served and must contain an endorsement as to service. 
         
         
        (5) Leave may be granted under subsection (4) after the expiry of the 7-day period referred to in that subsection. 
        
       
       
        
        178  
        When proceedings commence 
         
         
        (1) All proceedings are taken to have commenced on the date on which a court attendance notice is filed in the registry of a relevant court in accordance with this Division. 
         
         
        (2) A court attendance notice may be filed even though it has not been served if:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
          (a) a warrant is sought under this Part for the arrest of the accused person, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) the notice is not able to be served, despite reasonable attempts to do so, or 
          
         
         
          
          (c) the registrar gives leave to do so after forming the opinion that it is not reasonable in the circumstances of the case to require prior service of the notice. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) Nothing in this section affects any other Act or law under which proceedings are taken to have been commenced on another date.” 
        
       
      
    27 Clause 18 Local Courts (Criminal and Applications Procedure) Rule 2003 relates to the service of CANs in summary proceedings. The rule provides for a number of methods of service which may be utilised. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that service of a CAN includes the handing of a notice to the accused person: clause 18(2)(a). 
     
      
    28 Clause 37 Local Courts (Criminal and Applications Procedure) Rule 2003 provides for proof of service. Clause 37 relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        37  
        Proof of service 
         
         
        (1) A person who serves a document issued in proceedings must complete an endorsement as to service on a copy of the document served. 
         
         
        (2) The endorsement must include the following matters: 
         
         
          
          (a) the date service was effected, 
          
         
         
          
          (b) the method of service, 
          
         
         
          
          (c) the name, address and occupation of the person serving the document,  
          
         
         
          
          (d) if the document was served personally, the person to whom it was delivered, 
          
         
         
          
          (e) if the document was served by post, the manner in which the person was informed of the address to which it was posted and the time and place of posting, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (f) if the document was served by facsimile, the manner in which the person was informed of the address to which it was sent and the date on which advice confirming successful transmission of the document was received 
          
         
         
          
          (g) if the document was served by electronic communication (other than facsimile), the manner in which the person was informed of the email address to which it was sent and the date it entered the information system addressed to the person’s email address. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) The endorsement must be signed by the person serving the document and a witness to the signature. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) In the case of a document served by a police officer, the endorsement: 
         
          
           
          (a) may be incorporated on an electronic copy of the document produced from the Police COPS system, and 
          
         
         
          
          (b) is not required to be signed by the police officer who serves the document. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        …” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    29 It may be noted from clause 37(2)(a) to (d) of the Rules that the endorsement which is to be included on a copy of a CAN served must include the date of service, the method of service, the name, address and occupation of the person serving and (if the document was served personally) the person to whom it was delivered. There is no requirement for endorsement of the place of service. 
     
      
    30 Clause 37(3) of the Rule requires that the endorsement must be signed by the person serving the document and a witness to the signature. However, clause 37(4) provides that, in a case of a document served by a police officer, the endorsement may be incorporated on an electronic copy of the document produced by the COPS system, and it is not required to be signed by the police officer who serves the document. 
     
      
       
      Is Endorsement of the Place of Service Required by Law? 
       
      
    31 The short point raised by the Plaintiff in this case is that the Second Defendant's view that the endorsement for service was defective because it failed to indicate the place of service was erroneous. What is required to be endorsed, as a matter of law, in the case of personal service are the matters referred to in clauses 37(2)(a) to (d) of the Rule. The CAN complied with those requirements. Since a police officer served the CAN, the provisions of clause 37(4) of the Rule were applicable. Accordingly, the Plaintiff submits that there was no defect at all. I accept this submission.  
     
      
    32 The fact that the endorsement on the CAN itself includes the word “at” (followed here by the words “WITNESSED BY ACCUSED”) might suggest that the place of service was to be inserted in the document. However, neither the Act nor the Rules require this to be done where there is personal service upon the accused person. Accordingly, the Second Defendant's view was erroneous and the CAN and the proceedings ought to have been be left on foot. 
     
      
    33 A clear error of law has been demonstrated in this case in his Honour’s conclusion that the failure to specify the place of service in the CAN was fatal to the proceedings.  
     
      
       
      A Further Error in Dismissing the Charge 
       
      
    34 In circumstances where the Second Defendant formed the view that there was a fatal defect in the process resulting in effect, in the Court lacking jurisdiction, the Plaintiff submits, in any event, that the order should not have included dismissal of the charge. The papers ought to have been marked “No jurisdiction”. 
     
      
    35 Section 202(1) and (2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides that the Local Court must determine summary proceedings after hearing the accused person, prosecutor, witnesses and evidence in accordance with the Act, and that the Court may determine the matter by convicting the accused person or making an order as to the accused person or by dismissing the matter. Section 208 provides for withdrawal of a matter by the prosecution. The Plaintiff submits that the Second Defendant fell into further error by dismissing the matter where there had not been a hearing in accordance with s.202 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. It is submitted that the appropriate order, in circumstances where there is a finding of no jurisdiction, is the marking of the papers to that effect. 
     
      
    36 There is authority for this approach with respect to the repealed Justices Act 1902: Barns v Edwards (1993) 31 NSWLR 714 at 720; and Goben at paragraph 37 and following. In Sharman at paragraph 44, Bell J considered that the principle in Barns v Edwards was applicable where there was a finding of no jurisdiction with respect to a CAN for the purposes of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 
     
      
    37 I accept the submission of the Plaintiff in this respect. In my view, the provisions contained in s.202 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 do not materially alter the position which applied concerning s.80 of the repealed Justices Act 1902. I note that the practical context in which this issue was sometimes litigated in earlier cases, such as Goben, related to the power of the Local Court to order costs against a prosecutor in summary proceedings. In Goben, at paragraph 51, it was held that such a costs order could not be made unless a valid information was dismissed. 
     
      
    38 Section 213(4) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 expressly overcomes that past difficulty in that it permits a Local Court to order a prosecutor in summary proceedings to pay costs if the matter is dismissed, because the matter is withdrawn or the proceedings are for any reason invalid.  
     
      
    39 The appropriate order in this case, in my view, if the magistrate was correct in his conclusion (which he was not), was one of “No jurisdiction”. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    40 I conclude that a clear error of law has been demonstrated on the part of the Second Defendant. The CAN was not defective with respect to the endorsement of service contained on it. Even if his Honour’s conclusion with respect to service was correct, there was a further error of law in dismissing the matter. 
     
      
    41 The Plaintiff seeks an order for costs against the First Defendant, but submits that this is an appropriate case for the grant of a certificate under s.6 Suitors’ Fund 1951. The Plaintiff has undertaken not to enforce the order for costs against the First Defendant personally in the event that the costs exceed the sum allowed under the Suitors’ Fund Act 1951: cf Director of Public Prosecutions v Belani [2005] NSWSC 1013 at paragraph 69. 
     
      
    42 In these circumstances, I make the following orders:  
     
      
       
      (a) in accordance with paragraph 2 of the Summons, I declare that the Second Defendant erred in law as to the proper construction and application of the provisions of clause 37 of the  
      Local Courts (Criminal and Applications Procedure) Rule 2003 
      ; 
       
       
      (b) I order that the First Defendant pay the Plaintiff's costs of the proceedings, but grant to the First Defendant a certificate under s.6  
      Suitors’ Fund Act 1951 
      .

    IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESEQUITY DIVISIONTechnology & Construction LISTWHITE JFriday, 28 April 200655046/02 The Owners of Strata Plan 50946 v Multiplex Construction (NSW) Pty Ltd & 4 OrsJUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application by the first and fifth defendants pursuant to rule 14.28 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) to strike out an amended statement of claim filed on 15 September 2005, for the proceedings to be summarily dismissed pursuant to rule 13.4, and for other relief.2 The ground of the application is that the defendants contend that the plaintiff's causes of action pleaded in the amended statement of claim first accrued more than six years before its being filed. (See Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) s 14(1)(b)). The proceedings were commenced on 4 October 2001. The plaintiff contends that the causes of action on which it now relies did not accrue until 2003. The fifth defendant was joined as a party by the amended statement of claim. The plaintiff's causes of action alleged in the amended statement of claim are barred if they arose before 15 September 1999. (Uniform Civil Procedure Act ss 64(3) and UCPR rule 19.2(4)). The first and fifth defendants say that if the plaintiff has any causes of action against them, they accrued on 29 September 1995. 3 In Wardley Australia Limited and Western Australia (1992) 175 CLR 514 at 533 the High Court warned: 
     
      
       
        
        “We should ... state in the plainest of terms that we regard it as undesirable that limitation questions of the kind under consideration should be decided in interlocutory proceedings in advance of the hearing of the action except in the clearest of cases. Generally speaking, in such proceedings, insufficient is known of the damage sustained by the plaintiff and of the circumstances in which it was sustained to justify a confident answer to the question.” 
        
       
      
    4 The plaintiff is the owner of the common property of a building known as the Goldsborough Mort building situated at 243 Pyrmont Street, Darling Harbour. The common property was vested in it on registration of the strata plan number 50946 on 29 September 1995. 5 The first defendant had been engaged in 1994 by the then owner and developer of the building, Jaguar Investments (NSW) Pty Ltd, to design and construct works of refurbishment of the building. The building is located in the Darling Harbour precinct. The consent authority for the project was the Darling Harbour Authority. It delegated the tasks of assessing and certifying development of land within the Darling Harbour precinct to certain approved independent certifiers. The fifth defendant was such a certifier. On 25 September 1995, the fifth defendant issued to the Darling Harbour Authority a ""Partial Certification of Building Occupation/Completion"". The certificate was partial because it excluded the fit-out of part of the building and excluded compliance with the requirements of certain authorities. The exclusions are not presently relevant. Mr Howse, on behalf of the fifth defendant, certified “that the works as constructed comply with the principles and objectives of the Building Code of Australia and the Local Government (Approvals) Regulation 1993 as are applicable to the premises and the conditions of approval contained in certification number J94134 issued by this company and dated 14 June 1995”.6 In its original statement of claim filed on 3 October 2001 the plaintiff pleaded that the first defendant owed to it a duty of care to: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) design and construct the Works including the Common Property in accordance with the Contract  
        [between it and Jaguar Investments NSW Pty Ltd] 
        ; 
         
        (b) design and construct the Works including the Common Property in a proper and workmanlike manner; 
         
        (c) design and construct the Works including the Common Property generally in accordance with the plans and specifications, all relevant legislative requirements, standards and codes and  
        [Jaguar's]  
        project brief; 
         
        (d) ensure that the Works and the Common Property were fit for purpose.” 
        
       
      
    7 The plaintiff alleged that the first defendant breached that duty of care by reason of the building’s containing various structural defects. That claim, and the claim against three other defendants, was ultimately resolved. The defects in the building the subject of the plaintiff's original complaint did not extend to fire safety systems for the building.8 In the course of the litigation, experts were engaged by the plaintiff to inspect the adequacy of the building. In mid 2002 one such expert recommended that a fire safety expert be engaged. As a result of that recommendation, in December 2002, a Mr Alexander of Engineered Fire and Safety Solutions Pty Ltd was engaged to provide a report on the adequacy of the fire safety systems installed in the building. The first such report was provided in March 2003. The plaintiff's evidence on the present application, which was not challenged on this application, is that prior to Mr Alexander expressing concerns to it shortly before the finalisation of his report, it was not aware of any defects in the fire safety system. 9 Between 2003 and September 2005 there were negotiations, mediation and other steps taken to attempt to resolve all the disputes. These efforts were only partially successful. On 14 September 2005 orders were made by consent that the plaintiff have leave to file the amended statement of claim, but that was not to be construed, or relied upon by the plaintiff, as indicating that it was entitled to such leave, or as an admission of any matter by the first and fifth defendants. The first and fifth defendants say that the plaintiff was not entitled to such leave because the claims introduced by the amendment are statute barred. They are not precluded from advancing that contention by the orders made on 14 September 2005. They make no other complaint about the amendment. It is common ground that if the point in relation to the Limitation Act does not succeed the leave granted on 14 September 2005 will stand without qualification. 10 The effect of the amendment was to delete entirely the previous allegations of breach of the duty of care allegedly owed by the first defendant to the plaintiff. No claims are now made against the second to fourth defendants. Instead, the plaintiff now alleges that the first defendant breached its duty of care to the plaintiff by failing to design and construct the works and the common property in the manner required by the duty it allegedly owed to the plaintiff, by reason of alleged defects in the fire safety system.11 12 There are twenty-nine such alleged defects. They include the following, which are provided by way of example:  
     
      
      (a) occupancies of different classification on levels 1 to 2 are not separated by fire resisting construction (item 1); 
       
      (b) certain windows are unprotected by fire resistant materials (item 2); 
       
      (c) the heads of bolts in original timber columns used to strengthen the columns are unprotected (item 3); 
       
      (d) service riser ducts located in the services area of each floor are constructed of materials which have an inadequate fire resistance level, are not protected by additional or adequate sprinklers and their construction provides for fire and smoke to pass through all levels of the building (item 5); 
       
      (e) there is inadequate sprinkler protection of certain timber columns (item 7); 
       
      (f) essential fire safety equipment is hidden behind set plaster walls with no provision for access (item 8); 
       
      (g) fire hose reel cupboards on certain levels are mounted at the wrong height and are not adequately signposted (item 18). 
      
    13 The plaintiff alleges that the fifth defendant owed it a duty of care in relation to its certification that the building complied with relevant requirements. It alleges that the fifth defendant breached that duty by, amongst other things, wrongly certifying that the design and construction of the building complied with the principles and objectives of the Local Government (Approval) Regulations and the Building Code of Australia. The plaintiff relies on the same particulars of breach concerning the allegedly defective fire safety system as it does in its case against the first defendant. 14 The plaintiff claims damages for the costs of rectifying the alleged defects. It does not claim as damages the diminution in value of the building or the common property by reason of the presence of the alleged defects, compared with what its value would be if the defects did not exist. Nor does the plaintiff allege that has been required by any authority to carry out the work it claims is needed to rectify the alleged defects. I understand the plaintiff to contend that the alleged defects are on the common property and that the work said to be required to rectify the defects would be undertaken on the common property.15 In support of this application the first defendant read evidence to the effect that its task was not to design and construct the building in compliance with the prescriptive conditions relating to fire safety in the Building Code of Australia. Rather, because the building was a heritage building, it says that the refurbishment was required to be, and was, designed and carried out in accordance with the principles and objectives of the Code. Whilst this is a useful background to the parties' positions, the evidence is not directly relevant to the ground on which the present application is brought. The defendants do not deny that there is an arguable case that they owed the duty of care alleged. Nor do they deny that there is an arguable case that those duties were breached. Their contention is that the matters now complained of as defects existed from the time the refurbishment was completed and the strata plan registered. That appears to be common ground. They submit that the damage allegedly suffered by the plaintiff by reason of what it contends to be defects was suffered when the common property was vested in the plaintiff, that is, on 29 September 1995. They submit that the plaintiff's causes of action expired on 29 September 2001. 16 No defence has yet been filed. However, I can assume that there will be nothing to preclude the defendants from relying on a defence under the Limitation Act, and that the defence would be pleaded if the amended statement of claim is not struck out. The application was heard on this basis without objection by the plaintiff. 17 The plaintiff submits that its cause of action to recover the costs of rectification arising from a latent defect or defects in the building is a claim for economic loss which first accrued when the defects either became known to the plaintiff or became manifest, in the sense of being discoverable by reasonable diligence. (Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman (1985) 157 CLR 424 at 505; Hawkins v Clayton (1988) 164 CLR 539 at 543 and 587-588; Wardley Australia Limited v State of Western Australia (1992) 175 CLR 514 at 540; Bryan v Maloney (1995) 182 CLR 609 at 617, 625; Scarcella v Lettice & Anor (2000) 51 NSWLR 302 at 606; Pullen v Gutteridge Haskins & Davey Pty Ltd [1993] 1 VR 27 at 71; Sherson & Associates v Bailey (2001) Aust Torts Reports 81-591 at 66,495-66,496.) These authorities establish that a purchaser who buys a building containing a latent defect which is not then known and is not manifest, in the sense of being discoverable through the exercise of reasonable diligence, does not suffer loss at the time of purchase, but only does so when the defect becomes known or manifest. The reason for this is that the purchaser has not at that stage outlaid moneys because of the defect, (compare Sheldon v McBeath (1993) Aust Tort Reports 81-209 at 62,082), and there is no diminution in the value of the house by reason of the unknown and unmanifested defect. There is no reason to think that the plaintiff, in whom the common property was vested on registration of the strata plan, would stand in a relevantly different position from such a purchaser. 18 Although it appeared from the written submissions of the first defendant that it might contend that different principles applied where the loss claimed is the cost of rectifying the defect or damage to property, rather than diminution in the value of the property, senior counsel for the first defendant made it clear in oral address that no such contention was advanced. Nor did the fifth defendant advance such an argument. This is understandable given that the cost of rectification is a recognised head of damage in tort for the negligent occasioning of damage to a building. (Evans v Balog [1976] 1 NSWLR 36; Parramatta City Council v Lutz (1988) 12 NSWLR 293; Pantalone v Alaouie (1989) 18 NSWLR 119). In Hawkins v Clayton at 588 Deane J referred to the economic loss which is to be taken to arise from a latent defect only when it is known or manifest, as consisting of diminution in value or other consequential damage. Even if an owner's claim is for the cost of rectification, the owner will first suffer economic loss when a latent defect becomes known or manifest, through the diminution in the value of the property. 19 Instead, the defendants submitted that the principles referred to above only apply to the case of a latent defect. They submitted that the defect or defects alleged by the plaintiff were not latent. With the possible exception of five items, they were visible. They were not hidden or concealed. It was submitted that a defect was not a latent defect within the sense of the authorities referred to, merely because the plaintiff did not appreciate the significance of what was observable, and that was so even if a person in the position of the plaintiff, exercising reasonable diligence, would not appreciate the significance of what was observed. Further, the defendants relied upon an opinion expressed by the plaintiff's expert, Mr Alexander, that the alleged defects would have been revealed by a reasonably complete inspection by a qualified building inspector. That, it was submitted, both prevented the alleged defects from being classified as latent, and meant that the defects were always manifest, in the sense that they would be apparent through the plaintiff's exercising reasonable diligence by engaging a qualified building inspector to inspect the building. 20 The difficulty with these submissions is that they raise questions of fact which are not suitable for determination before a final hearing. The concept of a latent defect in a building is used in the authorities in this area in the sense of something which is not known or manifest. They are the two sides of the one coin. In this area, the concept of what is manifest extends to what is not known but would be discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence. A defect which is not known or manifest in this sense is latent. Equally, in my view, a defect is latent if it is not known or manifest in this sense. In my view, there is no additional requirement that in order for a defect to be latent it must not be visible, or must be concealed or hidden, although, of course, a defect which is visible and not hidden may be manifest in the sense of being discoverable with reasonable diligence. Moreover, a defect may be, and often will be, different from the physical thing which may be observed. For example, there may be a latent defect in the design of a building where a temporary external wall is too thin to carry a load, even though the thickness of the wall and the size of the roof it carries is plainly visible. (Sherson & Associates v Bailey at 66,505). The defects alleged by the plaintiff in this case are, primarily at least, defects of design. The principles as to when economic loss is first suffered through latent defects in a building are the same whether the defect is one of construction or design. (As to defects of design, see e.g. Pullen v Gutteridge Haskins & Davey Pty Ltd; Sherson & Associates v Bailey; and Bryan v Maloney. As to defects of construction, see Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman). 21 Moreover, the defendants accepted that there is a triable issue in respect of five of the alleged defects that the allegedly defective physical work would not be visible on an ordinary inspection and would therefore not be latent defects even in the sense in which they contended that expression should be understood. These defects included the lack of separation of different occupancies by fire restriction construction which is hidden by a ceiling (item 1), the installation of sprinkler mains which are located behind set plaster walls (item 8), and the riser shafts and associated sprinklers which are also enclosed by set plaster (item 5). It is not necessary to refer to all five of such items.22 Mr Darke SC for the first defendant submitted, rightly, that the plaintiff has contended that the particular defects alleged are all aspects of what it alleges to be a defective fire safety system with interdependent parts. He submitted that if some of the allegedly defective components of the integrated system were not latent defects, the allegedly defective system was also not a latent defect, even if other defective components were not visible. I do not decide whether this is the correct way of looking at the question. If it is, the submission raises a question of fact and degree as to the extent to which the allegedly defective visible components made manifest the defect or defects in the system. That must be an issue for trial. 23 As I have said, Mr Alexander also expressed the opinion that most of the other items relied upon by the plaintiff as defects in the fire safety system would not have been identified as a defect except by an expert in the field. For example, the windows (item 2), the exposed bolt heads in timber columns (item 3), the sprinkler system protecting certain timber columns (item 7), and the height of the fire hose reel cupboard (item 18), are all visible. But there is evidence that only an expert in the field of building construction could be expected to appreciate the alleged deficiencies. This, in my view, raises a triable question as to whether such alleged defects are latent, or whether they are manifest.24 The defendants submitted that a defect was not a latent defect if it would be revealed by expert examination. Senior counsel for the fifth defendant referred to the discussion of what constitutes a latent defect in Pinnock Brothers v Lewis & Peat Limited [1922] 1 KB 690 at 697, and in Robert A. Parente v Bayville Marine Inc. and General Insurance Company of America [1975] 1 Lloyds Rep 333. Neither of those cases dealt with the expression in a context similar to the present. The test enunciated in Parente v Bayville Marine Inc was said to be one applicable to the facts of that case, and is clearly not that which the authorities have had in mind when describing defects such as inadequate footings as being latent. In Pinnock Brothers v Lewis & Peat Limited, Roche J said that the word latent was only applicable to a defect not discoverable by the exercise of reasonable care. That appears to be the same question as whether a defect would be manifest by being discoverable through the exercise of reasonable diligence. That is a question of fact to be decided in all the circumstances of the case. The fact that in Pinnock Brothers this might require expert examination of a cargo does not, in my view, mean that expert examination would necessarily be required in all cases. In Sherson & Associates v Bailey it was held (at [96], 66,508-66,509) that defects did not become manifest, so that loss thereupon immediately accrued, when it was reasonable for an owner to make enquiry of an expert, such that until a reasonable period for enquiry expired, the discovery of the defect was to be taken to be delayed. This is not consistent with a defect being manifest and not latent if at any time it would be revealed by expert inspection. 25 It was submitted for the fifth defendant that a strict approach was required before a defect could be considered to be latent if the policy of the Limitation Act were to be observed. It was submitted that to be consistent with this policy, a defect should not be characterised as latent unless it would not be identifiable on expert examination, because, for example, the work had been covered up. That does not appear to be consistent with Sherson & Associates v Bailey, although the defendants submitted that there the question of whether the defect was latent was conceded. 26 In my view, the submission has the difficulty that the policy of the Limitation Act, in its application to causes of action in tort, is that the limitation period should not commence to run until some non-negligible damage has been sustained. The question is, when does the plaintiff first suffer economic loss? Leaving aside a case where a payment has been made for works which should not have been made because the work was defective (Sheldon v McBeath at 62,082), the answer provided by the authorities is that such a loss first occurs when the knowledge or manifestation through reasonable diligence of the defect will affect the value of the property, as where it could not be honestly sold without disclosure of the defect. There is no policy reason for bringing forward the time at which loss is to be taken to be first sustained by adopting a priori rules as to what discoverability through reasonable diligence requires, or, what in my view is the other side of the same question, as to what is required before a defect can be classified as latent.27 The question of what is manifest through reasonable diligence is a question of fact. There is clearly a triable issue about it. Even if the defendants are right, that reasonable diligence by the plaintiff would require the engagement of an appropriately qualified expert, or that a defect is not latent if it would be apparent to a suitably qualified expert, the issue is still one for trial. I should not assume that the statement in Mr Alexander's report upon which the defendants rely, would be the only evidence on the subject. That opinion may well be the subject of contest, particularly by the fifth defendant who certified the building as having been constructed in accordance with the principles and objectives of the Code.28 For these reasons, in my view, the limitation issue raised by the defendants cannot be determined at an interlocutory hearing. No question of the exercise of a discretion arises. It follows that paragraphs 3 and 4 of the first and fifth defendants' notices of motion should be dismissed. Paragraph 1 of those notices of motion sought a substantive order that the grant of leave to file the amended statement of claim should be set aside. However, as the limitation issues were the only issues raised in opposition to the amendment, that application should also be dismissed. Paragraph 2 of the notices of motion sought an order that the original statement of claim be struck out. That statement of claim has been amended. The amended statement of claim will not be struck out. Hence paragraph 2 should also be dismissed. 29 For these reasons I dismiss the first and fifth defendants' notices of motion dated 15 September 2005 and 14 December 2005 respectively with costs. The exhibits may be returned.[Counsel Addressed]30 Application is made for indemnity costs, essentially on the ground that the notices of motion were hopeless and that they ought not reasonably to have been brought. Although the defendants' applications were unsuccessful, I do not consider that raising them was a relevant delinquency. I decline to make the order for indemnity costs which is sought.31 The parties are agreed that the matter should be put back before the Technology and Construction List Judge for further directions to be made for the progress of the proceedings. I stand the proceedings over to 12 May 2006 before the Technology and Construction List Judge.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Just stand up Mr Baxter, my practice whatever the result is, is to tell people in advance what I am going to sentence them to, so they know, they are not left in suspense. In your case I propose to impose the following sentences. For the possess firearm matter I propose to sentence you to three years imprisonment, that sentence will date from 27 August 2005 and expire on 26 August 2008 and I take that to be the correct commencement date from my notes Mr Crown is that right?2 CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes I checked again today and I think that is correct your Honour.3 HIS HONOUR: Yes I do not have a transcript still from Wagga so I have to rely on my notes. In relation to the offence of ongoing supply of methylamphetamine I propose to sentence you to a term of imprisonment of six years comprising a non parole period of four years and one month and a balance sentence of one year, eleven months and that sentence will commence eighteen months into the sentence for the firearms offence. So that means your total sentence will be seven and half years imprisonment with on my calculation a five year and seven month non parole period. Just take a seat thanks very much.4 The prisoner Alan John Baxter appears today for sentence in relation to two principal offences to which he pleaded guilty at the Wagga Wagga District Court on 31 March 2006. The first charge to which he pleaded guilty is an offence alleging that he between 1 June 2005 and 30 June 2005 at Wagga Wagga in the State of New South Wales did on three or more separate occasions during a period of thirty consecutive days supply a prohibited drug other than cannabis for financial or material reward. This is an offence brought pursuant to s 25A Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and carries a maximum penalty of twenty five years imprisonment.5 In relation to that offence I am required to take into account three other offences, two offences of ongoing supply of a prohibited drug namely methylamphetamine for financial or material reward pursuant to s 25A Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. One offence alleging twelve separate supplies between 1 May 2005 and 30 May 2005 and a second offence under the same provision of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act alleging fifteen separate supplies within thirty consecutive days of a prohibited drug namely methylamphetamine for financial or material reward committed between 1 July 2005 and 30 July 2005.6 The third charge is an offence of supply methylamphetamine committed on 26 July 2005 and arises out of the circumstances of the arrest of the prisoner and his possession of an indictable quantity of methylamphetamine at that time.7 The second offence to which the prisoner has pleaded guilty is an offence alleging that on 26 July 2005 at Currawarna in the State of New South Wales, he did possess a prohibited firearm, namely a replica Smith and Wesson pistol not being authorised to do so by licence or permit. Three offences are disclosed on a further Form 1 which are to be taken into account in sentencing the prisoner for this second offence and those three offences are two offences of selling a firearm and one further offence of possessing a prohibited firearm, namely another replica Smith and Wesson pistol.8 The offence of selling a firearm committed between 25 May and 2 June 2005 was disclosed to the investigators during their investigation of the offender’s activities in relation to the sale of methylamphetamine and likewise the further offences of selling a firearm committed between 23 June and 25 July 2005 arises out of that investigation.9 The offences of possession of a prohibited firearm, the principal offence and the offence on the Form 1 are offences that are disclosed from the circumstances of the prisoner’s arrest. The principal offence of possessing a prohibited firearm is an offence which carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment. It is an offence for which there is disclosed a standard non parole period under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, that standard non parole period is three years and I will deal with that aspect of this case shortly.10 In relation to the pleas of guilty that have been entered by the prisoner in relation to the two principal offences, those pleas of guilty were entered on arraignment. As I understand the matter the prisoner was committed for trial, however it should be fairly pointed out that the arraignment occurred within seven to eight months of the arrest of the offender. I have taken into account what has been put by the learned Crown Prosecutor in relation to this matter, as well as the matters raised on behalf of the accused. I note that the investigation of this matter was a complex matter with many, many telephone intercepts and listening device recordings forming part of the material available to the Crown. The pleas that were entered at the District Court, after committal, occurred in the context of ongoing negotiations between the defence and the Crown. Having regard to the form of the indictment and the number of matters on the Form 1 I am satisfied that bearing in mind the pleas were entered on arraignment, that the pleas of guilty were entered in reality in a practical sense at the first reasonable opportunity. Although it might be a matter of slight degree to the contrary on a full analysis of the information available to me, I am of the view in the circumstances bearing in mind the fact that there was a paper committal and the plea was entered on arraignment and given what I was told about the progress of the matter, that the prisoner should receive a discount of twenty five percent upon the otherwise appropriate sentences for each of the principal offences, having regard to the utilitarian value of the pleas that have been entered. A great deal of court time has been saved by the manner of the conduct of the proceedings, both at the Local Court and before this court. The committal for trial has not delayed the matter or added to the burden in reality of the Court, both at this level and at the Local Court. In the circumstances given what I understood to be a general concession in relation to this aspect, I am of the view that the prisoner is entitled to the discount I have indicated in accordance with the guideline judgment in Thomson and Houlton.11 The detection of the prisoner in relation to the principal offences and the matters on the Form 1 arose out of an operation which commenced in the Wagga Wagga area in around April 2005. Between 29 April 2005 and 10 June 2005 telephone intercept warrants were issued for the prisoner’s mobile phone and telephone calls to and from that telephone were monitored and recorded. The prisoner was arrested on 26 July 2005.12 The Crown case against the prisoner in relation to the supply prohibited matters, both the principal offence and the two ongoing supply matters on the Form 1 was that the prisoner was supplying amounts in what were called point quantities or .1 of a gram for which he would receive $50 for each such supply. He may, on occasion, have supplied more than one point to the one person but as I understood the matter, notwithstanding something suggesting to the contrary in the Statement of Facts, the prisoner supplied as far, as the police investigation was concerned, in those quantities. The Crown case was that the prisoner had been purchasing the relevant amphetamine supplied by him in larger amounts and breaking it up into small amounts for sale. Some of the amphetamine was purchased for his own use and the use of a co-offender Catherine Murphy, a person with whom the prisoner was living during the relevant period of time.13 The first offence disclosed in the facts is the principal offence and it relates to the supply of methylamphetamine in these quantities within a thirty day period on fifteen separate occasions. The Statement of Facts chronicles each of the supplies which were detected either by way of telephone intercept or by way of dealing between the prisoner and an undercover operative.14 The facts reveal the circumstances of supplies on 1 June, 9 June, 12 June, 14 June, 15 June, 19 June. On some occasions the prisoner was either in company with Catherine Murphy at the relevant times or used her as an agent for the supply of the drugs. The arrangements for the supply of the relevant drugs involved supplies at various places, both near Currawarna and elsewhere. As the facts disclosed to me after a supply on 20 June 2005, on 28 June 2005 the prisoner was approached early in the evening of that day by a police undercover operative wearing a listening device. The prisoner and the operative met in Morgan Street, Wagga Wagga near as I understand it the Wagga pool. The prisoner was initially suspicious of the undercover operative and asked that person to supply him with drugs to prove that he was not an undercover police officer. After some further discussions the prisoner agreed to supply the undercover operative with amphetamine in the future. He instructed the undercover operative not to talk on the phone and to use a code by talking about fishing or football. The prisoner in this conversation or meeting boasted to the undercover operative about how busy he was selling drugs and at the end of the conversation the prisoner told the undercover operative that whenever he wanted anything to ring the prisoner and meet him at the same place. The prisoner told the operative that he would give him what he had. The prisoner further supplied amphetamine to another party on 29 June 2005 and then on 30 June 2005, the prisoner again met up with the police undercover operative, again wearing a listening device.15 The relevant conversations on 30 June 2005 and 28 June 2005 were, as I understand it, recorded. This meeting was also the subject of some surveillance. Catherine Murphy was in attendance at the relevant time. The undercover operative on this occasion was involved in conversation with the prisoner, who during the course of the conversation spoke to two other people who arrived at the carpark and the undercover operative witnessed the prisoner undertake two transactions apparently supplying the prohibited drugs whilst he was talking to these two other people. The prisoner said in the course of this conversation with the undercover operative: 
     
      
      “I’ve run for twenty months man and I haven’t even looked like coming undone because I’m not stupid”. 
      
    16 He also said to the undercover operative: 
     
      
      “I can do the crystal that will blow your fucking head off mate. I can get you the best crystal you’ve ever seen in your fucking life”. 
      
    17 The prisoner later said: 
     
      
      “I will put it to you like this right, I can get you anything you fucking want, anytime you fucking want it and as much as you want”. 
      
    18 The undercover operative arranged to meet the prisoner the next week. Crystal is a term used to describe a particular form of methylamphetamine. The facts revealed the circumstances of further supply by the prisoner on this day to other people. The undercover operative during the course of this meeting saw the prisoner remove a number of plastic resealable bags from a plastic “Kinder-Surprise” container, each containing a small quantity of powder, and hand them to a male person. The prisoner received cash from that male person. There was a further supply to another party on 30 June 2005 to two other persons, the particulars of which are set out in the Statement of Facts. Later on 30 June 2005, the police undercover operative rang the prisoner and asked him for what are described in the facts as “four big sinkers”. The prisoner apparently became confused and asked the undercover operative if he wanted “Ossie, Oscars” being the code word for ounces. The prisoner, according to the facts, agreed to do this but wanted money up front. The undercover operative clarified that he wanted four weights or four grams and the prisoner told the undercover operative that he could do that for him and that the undercover operative would be looking at about three hundred and fifty dollars to purchase each gram. The undercover operative was told to ring him back the following day.19 The Form 1, as I said, discloses two offences of ongoing supply, one in May, the other in July 2005 and I have set out briefly the particulars of those offences from the Form 1. They follow the same pattern of ongoing supply to a number of people over a period of time. It should be noted in the evidence of the prisoner that he gave before me, when he described the amount of methylamphetamine that he was using and the extent of his supply, that he claimed during this period of time he was using up to seven points, as I have defined it, of amphetamine a day. He told me that amphetamine cost about three hundred and fifty dollars a gram, he was spending about three hundred dollars a day on amphetamines up to two thousand dollars a week. He told me that he was selling these drugs to fund his amphetamine addiction. It should be noted in relation to his own account as to his dealings in methylamphetamine and as was disclosed in the examination of him, that he was by his own mathematical calculation selling a hundred deals of methylamphetamine a week. Thus it might be said on his own admission that the specific instances of supply, particularised in the facts represent just a portion of the supplies undertaken over that period of time, even bearing in mind what has been said in submission about the extent of supply increasing as the prisoner’s tolerance to methylamphetamine may have increased.20 The third offence on the Form 1, as I said, was an offence relating to the offender’s possession of a quantity of methylamphetamine, two point six one grams, at the time that he was apprehended. The police found in the course of the search of the prisoner, twenty-five plastic resealable bags each containing methylamphetamine in the total quantity that I have described. Six hundred dollars was located in the prisoner’s wallet, and a further one hundred and fifty dollars was located in the front pocket of his bum bag, there is no evidence of any other cash being found upon him. 21 In relation to the second offence on the indictment, the possess prohibited firearm offence, the facts in relation to this matter, being a breach of s 7 Firearms Act 1996, are that when the police executed a search warrant on the prisoner’s home at Kurrawarner, police located a replica Smith and Wesson 3.57 Magnum pistol, buried in a carry bag within a plastic barrel in the rear yard of the property. The prisoner said that the replica pistols, there was another one found at the same time which appears on the Form 1, were given to him, he put them in the bag and into the barrel and buried them as he did not know what to do with them. In his evidence before me, he told me that these replica firearms were provided to him by his brother. However when directly confronted by the Crown as to why they were secreted in the manner that they were seen by the police, he was not able to give any sort of coherent explanation. It seems quite clear on the facts that these firearms, from whatever source he received them, were within his possession for his purposes, and I do not accept his account that he simply put them away without knowing what to do with them.22 In relation to the matters also appearing on the Form 1, the first offence in time arose from what appears to be an intercepted telephone call on 1 June 2005, when the prisoner rang another person and offered to sell what is described as an under and over for $300. An “under and over” is a commonly used term to describe a double barrelled shotgun where one barrel sits on top of the other. The male to whom the prisoner spoke did not have the money and they arranged to meet up later. This matter arises under the extended definition of “sell” under the Firearms Act. The second offence of selling a firearm pursuant to s 51 Firearms Act arose out of a conversation where a male person not known rang the prisoner, and told the prisoner to keep his lookout for a “Betsy”. As I understand the matter, the term “Betsy” refers to a firearm. The prisoner said to this male person, “I’ve got something for you but it will cost you”. He then described a full length self-repeater with a scope and bayonet, he described it as lever-action. 23 On 24 July 2005 at 3.30pm the prisoner rang the male back and told him that he was coming to see him. During that conversation the prisoner said:24 “I’ve got Betsy, I brought Betsy”.25 The firearm in question, if it was ever in the possession of the prisoner, was, as I understand it, not recovered by police. In relation to the prisoner’s evidence in respect of these offences, particularly the selling of the firearms, the prisoner said in his evidence to me that at least one of the firearms he was selling was to a man he had met in gaol. He gave evidence before me that he had made no enquiry as to what that person was going to do with the firearm and that fact is a very disturbing matter indeed. 26 In relation to the objective facts concerning the ongoing supply of methylamphetamine as revealed in the principal offence and in the Form 1, there can be no doubt that over the period of time particularised in the charges, the prisoner was engaged in the business of supplying methylamphetamine to people who might approach him for the purchase of those drugs. He claimed in his evidence before me that he only sold to those people whom he knew were methylamphetamine users. It seems to me with the greatest of respect that his dealings with the undercover agent reveal to the contrary and whilst he may have sought to establish in his own mind the bona fides of the undercover agent, as a methylamphetamine user, the facts of the matter are that he had no knowledge of the identity of that undercover agent and had no means of knowing that he in fact was a user. I believe it is quite clear on the evidence the prisoner was prepared to sell methylamphetamine to whoever would approach him and seek to purchase methylamphetamine from him. The prisoner was clearly involved in the business of ongoing supply of amounts of amphetamine of a point on each sale although, as the evidence before me reveals, he was able to sell more than one point at the one time to the one person. There is no evidence as to where the prisoner obtained his methylamphetamine from, there is no clear evidence even from the prisoner in his evidence before this Court as to the amounts of methylamphetamine that he purchased for ongoing supply. There is no evidence of the prisoner making vast profits, if I could use that expression, from this business in which he was engaged over this period of time, but clearly he was making a profit from it and I do not accept that the prisoner was only in the trade of methylamphetamine for the purposes of satiating his own addiction or dependence upon the drug and that of his partner Ms Murphy.27 With regard to the firearms offences, I bear in mind in determining an appropriate penalty for the principal offence that the firearm is a replica firearm. Although it is a prohibited firearm under the Firearms Act, it was not a firearm capable of directly causing injury to another. There is no suggestion of the prisoner using the firearm in perpetration of the crimes involved in the sale or supply of methylamphetamine. Such evidence would have obviously required a more stern view to be taken of the objective facts of those matters although they are serious in themselves. As I have said, the prisoner’s own account of being prepared to sell a rifle or a shotgun to a person that he knew in gaol, in circumstances where he had no knowledge as to what purpose the firearm was to be used, is disturbing indeed. There is no evidence of course that the prisoner planned to sell the replica firearms, but again as I said earlier, I do not accept the account that he gave as to the reasons for the firearms being in his possession. The extent of the prisoner’s supply of methylamphetamine was clearly revealed in the evidence he gave before me when he sought to explain the quantities of methylamphetamine that he was using over the relevant time covered by both the principal offence and the offences disclosed in the Form 1. 28 In relation to the prisoner’s background, as I understand the matter, the prisoner was born on 27 March 1969 and thus at the time of the commission of these offences, he would have been thirty-six years of age. He has a lengthy criminal history, the full detail of which I need not reveal. He first appeared at the Children’s Court in 1984 at Wagga Wagga and thereon after had a number of appearances in Children’s Courts for largely offences of dishonesty. The first term of imprisonment imposed upon him was as I understand it, in June 1992, when he was convicted of receiving in respect of four charges as the record seems to reveal. These were offences committed on or about April 1990, 5 July 1991, 12 July 1991 and 21 July 1991. As I understand the total sentence imposed upon him, or effective sentence imposed upon him in relation to the principal offence for which he was sentenced, some of the offences of receiving were dealt with on what was then described as a Form 2, was a minimum term of one year four months and an additional term of three years six months, that is a total sentence of four years and ten months and clearly a finding of special circumstances.29 The criminal history before me reveals on the same date he was dealt with at Wagga District Court he was also sentenced at the Moree District Court in relation to two charges of breaking, entering and stealing, I assume that that is an error in the record and it would seem as though he was also, in effect, given terms of imprisonment again amounting to four years and ten months for those two offences of breaking and entering and stealing.30 In any event the prisoner was in breach of his parole at a later time and that parole was revoked in circumstances which will be revealed in the Probation and Parole Service Report. The prisoner had some other appearances in the Local Court after his release from gaol, including a conviction at Cootamundra Local Court on possessing property stolen outside the State for which he was sentenced to six months imprisonment.31 In October 1997 he appeared again at the Wagga Wagga District Court and was convicted of supplying heroin and he was sentenced to a minimum term of three years with an additional term of one year with an offence of receiving taken into account in respect of that matter. An appeal against the severity of that sentence was unsuccessful. After being sentenced at Wagga Wagga District Court, he was next sentenced at the Wagga Wagga Local Court on 15 March 2000 to a term of sixteen months imprisonment with a minimum term of twelve months for an offence of breaking, entering and stealing and in March of 2000 his parole was revoked.32 In March of 2003 he was convicted of possessing a prohibited drug as he was in February of 2004, which is consistent with his account of the use of drugs prior to 2005. In February of 2003, he was again sentenced to terms of imprisonment, twelve months imprisonment for an offence of breaking, entering and stealing and a number of sentences of three months imprisonment for assaulting police, possessing housebreaking implements and larceny. With regard to his parole history, the Probation and Parole Service states that after the four year and ten month sentence to which I earlier made reference imposed in 1992, when released on parole, the prisoner was returned to custody in September 1995 to serve the balance of parole and it was during that period of time he received the term of imprisonment earlier mentioned, apparently at Cootamundra.33 In relation to the sentence imposed in 1997 of supplying a prohibited drug, his parole was revoked in the year 2000 by reason of the offence of breaking entering and stealing and he was required to serve a term of nine months and several days for that balance of parole. That period however was subsumed by the sentence for the breaking entering and stealing matters. The report notes that he was not given a parole period in relation to the twelve months sentence which was imposed in 2003.34 With regard to the background of the prisoner, as I understand the evidence, the prisoner was largely raised in the Wagga Wagga area, certainly his early appearances at the Children’s Court appear to be at Wagga Wagga Children’s Court. He is one of a family of six children in what is described as a blended family. He was apparently disowned by his father when he was a very small child. His mother married her partner when he was four and the prisoner states that he was subjected to abuse from his stepfather for a period of time. His behaviour is described in his teenage years as being “rebellious” and “hostile” and that much would appear to be self evident from the criminal history which has been provided to me. The prisoner has two children. One child lives in Queensland, the other child whose mother lives in the Wagga district was in the care of the prisoner and his partner at about the time of his arrest. Apparently the mother of that child is a person herself with drug dependency problems and the prisoner has, to his credit, taken responsibility for the care of that child when he has been at large. The prisoner has a history of drug dependence and drug usage. He previously was addicted to heroin but stated to the Probation and Parole Service that he had stopped using this substance in 1996. On his release from custody after the term of imprisonment imposed in 1997, he used what are described as mood altering substances in addition to amphetamines and was drug dependent up until the time of his arrest. He gave evidence before me that he was able to rid himself, at least temporarily, of his dependence on methylamphetamine by going cold-turkey during a period of time that he was in custody. He was released to bail and in fact there are broken periods of custody up until the time that he was finally returned to custody full time in November 2005. The reason for those broken periods of custody arose out of the continuing nature of the police investigations and the laying of more serious charges over a period of time. The prisoner gave evidence to me and provided some documentary evidence to show that in November 2005 he was making enquiries about a rehabilitation program that he might undertake and also making enquiries and about then showing a willingness to undertake urinalysis which I have taken into account.35 In his discussions with the Probation and Parole Service, there was discussion about the need for a residential rehabilitation to be effective in assisting him in avoiding drug usage in the future. There are various suggestions in the Probation and Parole Service report about how this might best be effected. Some of those suggestions of course are based upon an assumption that a non-custodial order would follow although, realistically, the Probation and Parole Service report states, in the assessment of the suitability of the prisoner for supervision, that at this time the programs offered by the Correctional Services Centres offer the prisoner the best start to personal renewal and that any courses and programs he undertakes in custody and are completed, may offer him a sound start to community rehabilitation. As to whether there is a need for residential rehabilitation outside of a custodial setting, that would be a matter for the prisoner and the parole authorities. 36 In sentencing the prisoner, I have taken in account the handwritten note that he wrote to me and that is supplemented, as I said, by the evidence that he has given. I note that he has been placed on some medication whilst in custody, which might assist him, although there is no evidence before me that he suffers from a mental illness, notwithstanding a claim in his handwritten note that he suffers from what he describes as paranoid schizophrenia. 37 With regard to the steps he took in November and perhaps beforehand to pursue some form of rehabilitation program, it must be fairly said that what he did was far too little, far too late. It was submitted to me in the course of the submissions of his counsel who skilfully represented his interests that I should regard the prisoner as a person who voluntarily desisted from the supply of drugs in a manner which should be taken into account to the credit of the prisoner. In my view the circumstances of the prisoner ceasing to supply drugs is quite different to that set out in the decision of Kane Bacon [2000] NSWCCA 549. In my view the voluntarily withdrawal of the prisoner from supplying methylamphetamine arose out of his detection in relation to these offences and not because of any self-motivation on the prisoner’s part and in any event, his ceasing to supply methylamphetamine after 26 July 2005, is not in my view, strong evidence of rehabilitation.38 The facts of the matter are the offences the prisoner has committed are very serious offences indeed, and whilst there must be some credit given to the prisoner for steps he has taken in the intervening period, both in custody and whilst on bail to address fundamental issues that relate to his offending, those matters are not of great significance when one considers the objective facts.39 There are, arising out of this matter, several important legal issues that require some attention. Firstly, in respect of each principal offence as I have outlined, I am required to take into account matters on two separate Forms 1. The separate Forms 1 disclose offences that are of a relevant character to the relevant principal offence. In the guideline judgment in relation to Form 1 matters, Attorney General’s Application Number One (2002) 56 NSWLR 147, the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the fact that there are matters to be taken into account on a Form 1, means the greater weight should be given to the need for personal deterrence in the community’s entitlement to extract retribution. The entire point of the process, as the Court pointed out, is to impose a longer sentence or to alter the nature of the sentence that would have been imposed if the primary sentence stood alone. It is wrong to suggest the additional penalty should be small, sometimes it will be substantial, but the sentencing process is only concerned with the principal offence, not to determine appropriate sentences for matters listed on a Form 1 or to determine an overall sentence that would be appropriate for all the offences.40 As to increasing the sentence for the primary offence, the Court observed that there were matters which limit the extent to which this is so, specifically the express division set out in s 33(3) of the Act, the maximum penalty for the primary offence being one matter, the principle of totality being another. The Court said it would be  
     
      
      “rarely appropriate for a sentencing judge to attempt to quantify the effect on the sentence for taking into account Form 1 offences”. 
      
    41 It was also noted that the offences included on a Form 1 will have a significantly lower salience in the sentencing process. For various reasons however, a judge must be careful to assess whether it is appropriate to proceed to sentence on a basis where the administration of justice could be brought into disrepute by sentencing the offender for criminal conduct on a “manifestly inadequate, unduly narrow or artificial basis”. That is the situation here as I have noted by my reference to the objective facts.42 The other important legal issue or principle in sentencing that arises in this matter, relates to the course of conduct of the prisoner and the context of his criminal history. Here the antecedent criminal history is relevant to show that the instant offences are not an uncharacteristic aberration and to some extent, the commission of the instant offences show on the part of the prisoner a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In this latter circumstance, as the High Court said in Veen (No. 2) v The Queen, (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477: 
     
      
      “Retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind”. 
      
    43 Of course the principal offence of ongoing supply of methylamphetamine carries a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment. Allowing for the weight to be given to the significance of offences on the Form 1 as they reflect upon the prisoner’s conduct over a period of time, at the same time, even allowing for the calculation of up to a hundred supplies in a given week, one must have one’s feet on the ground when one considers the quantities that were being sold and when one bears in mind, even being prepared to accept the prisoner’s evidence, that there was a substantial quantity of the drug sold to finance the prisoner’s use of the drug and that of his partner. This provision has been discussed a number of times in authorities from the Court of Criminal Appeal. One such authority is R v Smiroldo [2000] NSWCCA 120. The facts of that case and the ultimate outcome are not important here but it might be fairly said that this matter is somewhat similar in one sense, by reason of quantities sold “small scale” yet “systematic drug dealing”. It would appear this prisoner’s criminality however is somewhat greater than Mr Smiroldo’s and it should be borne in mind that Mr Smiroldo had no convictions for drug matters. The Court cited an earlier decision in Kalache [2000] NSWCCA 2 which said: 
     
      
      “The provisions of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and other statutes making possession and supply of drugs illegal have been enacted in the belief that the use of drugs is harmful and manufacturing and supplying them contributes to this harm. Other things being equal, doubling the quantity is calculated to double the illegal profits of those engaged in such enterprises and if not to double, at least substantially increase the harm. When an offender knows the quantity in which he is participating a fortiori when his earnings or profit are proportional to or vary with that quantity, considerable weight must be given to assessing his criminality.” 
      
    44 Further in Kalache Justice Hulme had said in relation to this provision:45 “Parliament has indicated with unmistakeable clarity the seriousness with which it regards trafficking in drugs. Experience in this Court, and as a member of the community, makes it equally clear that the penalties imposed by the Courts to this time have not been sufficient to preclude an increase in the trafficking which occurs”.46 In that case of Smiroldo, it was held that the statistics for single supplying charges provided little guidance in determining appropriate sentences under s 25A. Of course, the legislation provides for the prohibition of ongoing supply over thirty day period for financial reward in any number of quantities so long as there are three such supplies in the relevant period, and of course one can always envisage more serious examples of the offence than this one, but this offence is a significant offence by any measure.47 With regard to the firearms offence, apart from the earlier comments I have made, I note as I have said earlier, that this is an offence for which there is a standard non-parole period. In this matter the prisoner pleaded guilty, and as was held in Regina v Way, the standard non-parole period directly comes to consideration after trial and to answer the question that was posed in paragraph 117 of their judgment: 
     
      
      “Are there reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period”. 
      
    48 In this matter, yes there are. Primarily the plea of guilty of the prisoner I do not propose to enter into a discussion as to whether this particular offence, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, fits within the middle of the range of offences of this type but it is to be fairly said as I observed earlier that the relevant firearm in the possession of the prisoner was not one capable of being discharged and was not used apparently for the prisoner’s trade in drugs, which to my mind are relevant matters in fixing the appropriate sentence.49 Still, having said that, the maximum penalty is one of fourteen years imprisonment, the prisoner’s record does not assist him and of course as the Court of Criminal Appeal said in Regina v Way, the standard non-parole period may still take a place in sentencing for offences of this type as a reference point, a benchmark, a sounding board as much the same way as authorities, statistics and other matters may be taken into account.50 In sentencing the prisoner, I have taken into account of course s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the various purposes of sentencing that arise. To my mind, all of which arise in this particular case. In relation to s 21A, so far as relevant aggravating factors pursuant to s 21A(2) are concerned, I do no believe that one need here treat that as a check list, however the specific aggravating factor that I believe arises in the offence of ongoing supply of methylamphetamine is that it was clearly planned activity over an extended period of time. I have already dealt with the relevance of the criminal history of the prisoner in my reference to Veen (No. 2).51 In relation to mitigating factors, there are very few. It seems to me that although the prisoner has expressed remorse for the commission of these offences, which is noted, the genuineness of that expression of remorse is difficult to gauge. I note the plea of guilty to each of the charges by the prisoner. So far as the prisoner’s remorse is concerned, it would appear on the evidence available to me that he displayed very little remorse, in fact no remorse, about his involvement in the ongoing supply of methylamphetamine during the course of the commission of the offences and clearly, caught unguarded of course, he was boastful about his capacities. Now whether he was talking up the situation to impress the undercover agent is one matter to be taken into account, but frankly his disclosures and his actions in the presence of the undercover agent, do him no credit. 52 With regard to the issue of special circumstances, I am of the view clearly that the ultimate result to be imposed, which would involve a partial accumulation of sentence, is a special circumstance which will require some adjustment of the relationship of a non-parole period to the total sentence for the offence of ongoing supply of methylamphetamine. I am of the view that the criminality involved in the two principal offences is to be regarded as separate, although of course that does not, by reason of the principle of totality, lead to a total accumulation of one sentence upon another.53 In sentencing the prisoner I have had regard to the decision of the High Court in Regina v Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610 particularly, what the majority observed at paragraph 45 that the Court is required to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence then have regard to issues of concurrency or accumulation and of course, totality of sentencing as for example, has been discussed in Pearce and also in the earlier decision of the High Court in Regina v Mill (1988) 166 CLR.54 With regard to the bigger picture though, of whether there are special circumstances in a general sense warranting an adjustment of the non-parole period greater than that necessary simply to accommodate accumulation, I am not of the view that such special circumstances exist in this matter. Of course the purpose of parole is to assist in the rehabilitation of the prisoner but in my view the balance of sentence that will arise after the expiration of the non-parole period I will fix will be sufficient time for the prisoner to show that he is capable of addressing those issues that might lead to his rehabilitation. So far as his background is concerned, he has twice previously breached the opportunity of parole. On one occasion when a finding of special circumstances was made in his favour. Of course this is not conclusive I have on a number of occasions, fixed non-parole periods recognising special circumstances when persons have previously been in breach of parole. 55 That having been said and noting everything that has been put on behalf of the prisoner by Mr Barron, I am of the view that notwithstanding his background of drug dependence, notwithstanding some steps, tentative though they may be of seeking assistance, particularly whilst on bail, notwithstanding the need of the prisoner to have professional assistance to assist him to adjust to community living and obviously the need for him to get some professional guidance to avoid drug usage in the future, I do not believe the various circumstances I have identified and were identified by Mr Barron are circumstances that are special and warrant the exercise of the discretion available under s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. As I said ultimately the parole period I have provided for will be sufficient to enable the prisoner to get the benefit of that parole supervision.56 I have had close regard of course to the various submissions put by the parties. I note in passing that many of the submissions raised particularly by the offender I have dealt with as I have gone through the facts and other issues relevant to this case. In sentencing the prisoner in relation to the ongoing methylamphetamine I note what previous decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal have said about amphetamines being in the middle of range of the seriousness of prohibited drugs, it is a matter about which I need not make any decision. There are many wiser judicial comments about this topic in many decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal. So far as the submission that if the prisoner is drug free he will not be a burden on society, that may be so, but of course given his background and given the circumstances of these offences, notwithstanding anything that he has done in the last seven or eight months, one would have to be very, very circumspect about the prognosis for the prisoner’s ability to avoid offending in the future. Ultimately I have accepted, with the exception of the need to recognise the partial accumulation affect of the sentences, that this is not a special circumstances case, as submitted by the Crown. Whilst I agree the offences require condign punishment in the circumstances of the matter, that must be assessed by proper assessment of the objective facts by regard also to the relevant subjective matters and what was put by the Crown about this being a commercial enterprise, albeit, not necessarily a particularly profitable enterprise, I accept.57 Thus, hoping I have covered all the relevant matters that were raised in the course of the plea, I will move to the orders. 58 In relation to the offence of possess firearm committed on 26 July 2005, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, you are convicted. Taking into account all time spent in custody, you are sentenced to three years imprisonment. That term of imprisonment is to date from 27 August 2005 and to expire on 26 August 2008, that is a fixed term sentence. 59 In relation to the offence of ongoing supply of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine committed in June 2005, you are convicted, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period of four years and one month, that sentence is to commence on 27 February 2007 and expire on 26 March 2011. The non-parole period of one year eleven months will expire on 26 February 2013. In sentencing you for that offence I have taken into account the matters on the Form 1. 60 HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown is there anything in the character of a correction of an error in the calculation?61 CORR: No your Honour.62 HIS HONOUR: There are the backup charges, I will deal with those shortly.63 CORR: No I get that his non-parole period ending on 26 March 2011 and the total sentence finishing on 26 February 2013.64 HIS HONOUR: Yes the total sentence should be--65 CORR: Seven years and six months with a five years seven months non-parole period.66 CORR: Yes I get that as seventy-four and one-half percent.67 HIS HONOUR: Yes it is just slightly below seventy-five percent and he has got the benefit of two weeks on my calculation. It is not inconsistent with what I found. It is difficult when you are doing a calculation in half-years to get to a figure which is precisely on track.68 CORR: No there is no difficulty with that point your Honour.69 HIS HONOUR: Yes Mr Barron, is there anything you wanted to raise of a technical matter?70 BARRON: The only thing in relation to the supply there was a four years one month minimum term from 27 February, what was the additional term on the other--71 HIS HONOUR: That’s correct and a balance of sentence is one year eleven months. It means a total sentence of six years and it means an effective sentence of seven and one-half years with a non-parole period of five years and one month which is just slightly less than seventy-five percent.72 BARRON: Yes.73 CORR: Five years and seven months your Honour.74 HIS HONOUR: Yes, I’m sorry yes.75 BARRON: Thank you your Honour.76 HIS HONOUR: Mr Baxter do you understand the sentence I have imposed?77 CORR: The back-up charges?78 HIS HONOUR: All the back-up charges on the certificate provided by the Crown pursuant to s 166 are dismissed. There are fifty-two such charges.79 CORR: Yes your Honour.80 HIS HONOUR: Do you want to speak to your client?81 BARRON: I will see to my client downstairs, I will see him down there very shortly. The only thing is I don’t know whether or not it is in your Honour’s power to make a recommendation that he be held at Junee - I’m uncertain as to whether or not you can make that recommendation.82 HIS HONOUR: Well to be truthful, if I was sitting at Wagga and there was a need for him to come back to Wagga I would make that recommendation but in light of the sentence I have imposed he is going to have to be classified by the authorities.83 BARRON: Yes he will be. Also he has a matter that is part heard that was to have been before Wagga Court yesterday, that is the only difficulty. Unfortunately he wasn’t able to be there and he--84 HIS HONOUR: I will ask for the warrant to be marked that I recommend that he be, in the short term until final classification, be held at Junee.85 BARRON: Thank you your Honour.86 CORR: Yes your Honour also confiscation and destruction orders.87 HIS HONOUR: I see, are there prohibited drugs to be destroyed?88 CORR: Yes, those are the ones found on him, the discrete supply.89 HIS HONOUR: I order the destruction of any prohibited drugs.90 CORR: Yes the Kinder-surprise drugs I think your Honour.91 HIS HONOUR: Yes and when you say confiscation, are you talking about the firearms?92 CORR: The firearms yes your Honour.93 HIS HONOUR: I order confiscation of the firearms.94 There is nothing else?95 BARRON: I have got nothing to press on that. I understand other items were seized by police. We will be making an application in relation to those. I think there was a TV set and things like that--96 HIS HONOUR: My order does not affect any personal property of your client, that is a matter for other places.97 BARRON: Yes if my friend is making no application, thank you your Honour.98 HIS HONOUR: What about the cash?99 BARRON: It is not subject of any charge your Honour.100 CORR: No it is a matter for him your Honour.101 HIS HONOUR: It has been seized as an exhibit though by the police hasn’t it?102 BARRON: I will be making an application for the return of that your Honour.103 CORR: I think an application similar to detinue would be appropriate.104 HIS HONOUR: There are specific provisions in the Criminal Procedure Act that deal with the issue of the cash but at the moment there is no application before me so the only thing I will order is the destruction of any prohibited drugs found in the possession of the accused and confiscation of any firearms found in the possession of the accused.

    3 ROTHMAN J: The Crown appeals the alleged manifest inadequacy of the sentences imposed on TWP. 
     
      
       
      Issues 
       
      
    4 TWP pleaded guilty to 17 offences of various kinds of assault, sexual assault and incest against his three daughters (‘A’, ‘B’ & ‘C’) for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a non-parole period of 7½ years as part of a total sentence of ten years’ imprisonment. In dealing with the Crown appeal, it is necessary to deal with the details of the offences charged and the facts which gave rise to them, the principles to be applied in a Crown appeal against sentence, the errors, if any, in the sentencing process and, to the extent that manifest or identified error is found, whether the Court should re-sentence and if so what that sentence should be.  
     
      
    5 Because of the age of the victims, the legislation requires that their names, and in this case, because of the relationship, the respondent’s name, and any matter identifying them, must not be published and an order to that effect is in place.

      The respondent is, on the current sentence, eligible to be released on 1 March 2013. 
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    7 The following facts are taken from the Agreed Statement of Facts tendered before the trial judge and in turn are almost wholly taken from the transcript of the respondent’s ERISP: 
     
      
       
       AGREED STATEMENT OF FACTS 
       
       
      The offender is the father of three daughters, A, B and C. He is married to their mother, D. 
       
       
      A is 28 years old and was born on 9 February 1977, B is 18 years old and was born on 30 July 1987. C is 15 years old and was born on 14 November 1989. 
       
       
        
        On 5 July 2004, A told her mother that the offender had sexually assaulted her and her two sisters. Later that day D and her daughters attended the sexual assault service and spoke with a counsellor. D telephoned the offender and told him where they were. A spoke to him later and told him they were getting help. The offender was concerned that he would go to gaol. The following day, the offender rang A . He said  
        “What am I going to do? I’m not a very good cook and I won’t be able to look after myself.” 
         He then asked if he should turn himself in. A told him it had to be his decision. The offender rang again later and asked  
        “Do they know what I did to B about getting her pregnant and then hitting her to lose the baby?” 
         A replied  
        “They know everything. We have been honest and you have to be honest.” 
        
       
       
        
        On 6 July 2004, the Ballina JIRT office received a notification from the Department of Children Services regarding C. No action was taken that day.  
        
       
       
        
        On 7 July 2004, the offender attended Lismore police station and informed the station staff that he was handing himself in for molesting his daughters. He was interviewed and admitted to sexually assaulting his daughters. The counts on the indictment are substantially based on the admissions made by the offender in his interview. His three daughters have partial memories of what occurred. They are embarrassed discussing sexual matters and expressed varying degrees of unease about the possible consequences for their father.  
        
       
       
        
        The first assault on A occurred when she was aged 7 and the last when she was 23. In the ERISP, the offender said his relationship with A was “ 
        more like a husband/wife relationship … As gross and disgusting as that sounds that was the way it sort of was between me and A for years.” 
         (Q&A 460) The offender said that when they lived at [one address] and A was aged between 13 and 19, there were two, three or maybe four breaks between it when he tried to stop but  
        “I just miserably failed and went back to it again.” 
         A said that  
        “Dad took every opportunity he could to have sexual intercourse with me. If mum was busy or in the shower he would come to me and beg me to have sex with him. He never let up until I would let him.” 
          
        
       
       
        
        In relation to the offender’s conduct when she was older, A states that she got baptised at the age of 17. Her father had stopped touching her for a while but at the time she was baptised he was assaulting her again. She states that the first time she felt his penis inside her was when she was 16 or 17 but she later explains that it took her a while to remember what happened and she still does not remember everything that happened. Usually she said he would rub his penis in the crack of her bum until he ejaculated. …. She recalls an incident when out working with the offender at [a certain address] where they had sexual intercourse. She said it happened several times there. When she was 18, A said that sexual intercourse with the offender was almost a daily occurrence. She said he always put his penis in her vagina from behind while she was standing and he would pull it out before ejaculating.  
        
       
       
        
        The offender first had sexual intercourse with B when she was ten and also indecently assaulted her. The offender could not remember how many times he assaulted B, however, he said that B was never willing and didn’t want to do it and didn’t agree to it. He said he kept asking her and would say  
        “along the lines of um, I really need it because when I got overcome I just was desperate and I’d beg for it sort of thing.” 
         He said as a result he didn’t do it with B very much and didn’t think it was very many times. (Q&A 494-497) 
        
       
       
        
        B could not remember the particulars of other incidents apart from the two she particularised. She said it had happened roughly more than 20 times and that he only put his penis inside her the first time. She said it was fairly frequent  
        “more than once a week.” 
        
       
       
        
        The offender had sexual intercourse twice with C around the time of her eleventh birthday. The offender said that after he had sex with C for the second time he decided to stop and told her he wouldn’t do it again. C said that after it happened she hated him and she figured if she was really nasty to him he would get the idea and stop. She said that when she anticipated him trying it she would burst into tears and bite and scratch him, punch him and cause a scene. The offender did not persist when C behaved this way. C does not recall the offender telling her that he would not have sex with her again.  
        
       
       
        
        B and C were home schooled until they finished their education. A was home schooled for the majority of her life. The girls’ primary social circle was the extended family of the offender and their small church group which was led by the offender’s family.  
        
       
       
        
        Count 1: Sexual Assault (cat 4): Victim A between 9 February 1984 and 31 October 1984 
         
        This charge resulted from an admission from the offender during his ERISP. He states in his interview that this incident occurred when A was aged 7 years and they were living at [place ‘TC’]. 
        
       
       
        
        A was 7 on 9 February 1984 and D (her mother) states that they moved from that property in October 1984 (paragraph 7), hence the time frame of between 9 February 1984 and 31 October 1984 (end of October). 
        
       
       
        
        A does not remember this incident.  
        
       
       
        
        It was morning and A was sleeping on the couch. The offender approached her from behind. She woke up. He lifted her leg a little bit and rubbed in between her legs with his penis. He had taken his penis outside his pyjamas. When asked about the area of A he touched with his penis, the offender replied  
        “The area of her vaginal area, like in between her legs, around there sort of and, well, just her, I just rubbed sort of in between her cheeks of her, of her, of her bottom basically.” 
         He said that he may have actually put it inside there and rubbed on it but he was not sure. He ejaculated “all over her legs and everywhere.” (Q&A 54-111) 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: Sexual intercourse with person 10 and under 16 years under authority s.66C(2): Victim A at [place ‘M’] between 14 November 1989 and 25 November 1989 
         
        This charge resulted from an admission from the offender during his ERISP. He states in his interview that this occurred living at a property at M. He also states that his second daughter was born at this stage but his youngest daughter was not. He said that A was 11 and B was only 2 or 3 years old.  
        
       
       
        
        D states that they moved to M just before B’s first birthday (30 July 1988) and A was aged 11 years at the time. C was born on 14 November 1989. 
        
       
       
        
        Hence the time frame of B’s 1st birthday on 30 July 1988 and the day that C was born on 14 November 1989 when A was aged 11 and 12 years.  
        
       
       
        
        Again, A does not remember this incident.  
        
       
       
        
        The offender was sitting on the toilet at night time and beckoned A over. She took off her pants and she sat over the offender’s penis. His penis went into her vagina for about 10 to 15 seconds. With A still attached to him, he stood up then knelt down and put her on the floor. He then backed off her before he ejaculated. (Q&A 112-159) 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3: Sex intercourse with person 10 and under 16 years under authority s.66C(2): Victim A at [place ‘M’] between 14 November 1989 and 25 November 1989 
         
        This charge resulted from an admission from the offender during his ERISP. He states in his interview that this occurred when living at the property and he thought that his wife was in hospital having their youngest daughter (C). 
        
       
       
        
        D states that she went into hospital earlier in the day that C was born (14 November 1989) and left the hospital 25 November 1989. D remembers the date that she left the hospital because she had a caesarean and had a bad experience with the doctor and just wanted to go home. (paragraph 15) 
        
       
       
        
        Again A does not remember this incident.  
        
       
       
        
        The offender said that A was on her back lying down in the caravan during the daytime. He took her knickers off and inserted his penis insider her. He took it out and ejaculated into his hand. The offender said that A did not want to be a part of it and wasn’t interested in it. (Q&A 160-181) 
        
       
       
        
        Count 4: Sexual intercourse with person 10 and under 16 years under authority s.66C(2): Victim A at [place ‘M’] between 25 November 1989 and 28 February 1990 
         
        This charge resulted from an admission from the offender during his ERISP. He states in his interview that this occurred when living at the Property after his youngest daughter was born (14 November 1989). A was about 12 years old.  
        
       
       
        
        D states that they lived at this property up until February 1990 when C was 12 weeks old.  
        
       
       
        
        The time frame is between the date that D got home from hospital after having C (25 November 1989) and the end of February 1990 when she states that they left the property (28 February 1990). 
        
       
       
        
        A vaguely remembers this occurring in the car shed however she also said that it occurred lots of times. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender also states that it happened more than once. 
        
       
       
        
        The police asked him about the first time had had sexual intercourse with A in the car shed. He said it was in the daytime and they were in there for about three or five minutes. A took her pants off. A was standing, sort of crouching and he inserted his penis in her vagina from behind. He backed out before he ejaculated. (Q&A 186-216) 
        
       
       
        
        Count 5: Sexual intercourse with person 10 and under 16 years under authority s.66C(2): Victim A at [place ‘M’] between 25 November 1989 and 28 February 1990 
         
        This charge resulted from an admission from the offender during his ERISP. The time frame is set out for the same reasons as charge 4.  
        
       
       
        
        The offender stated that the next time they had sexual intercourse was in the dairy or cattle yards about 20 metres from the old BMW car. It was daytime and A pulled her pants down. A was standing with her hands on her knees. He penetrated her vagina from behind, withdrew his penis and ejaculated on the ground. (Q&A 217-234) 
        
       
       
        
        The offender said that he had a habit of asking A to meet him there. He estimated they had sex about 5 times at that property. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 6: (Charge 13) Sexual intercourse with person 10 and under 16 years under authority s.66C(2): Victim A at [place ‘TC’] between 9 February 1991 and 9 February 1992 
         
        The offender stated that A was 14 years of age at the time. The time frame between 9 February 1991 and 9 February 1992 is when she was 14 years old. D states that they moved to that property (para 17) just prior to A’s 13th birthday and moved just before B’s 9th birthday (para 26), which was 30th July 1996. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender stated that he used to have sex with A near an old red ash tree in the paddock. He described the first time they had sex there. He asked her to meet him there. A would take down her pants and stand with her hands on her knees. He inserted his penis into her vagina from behind and would then back out and ejaculate. He said that it only ever took a minute or two. The rest of the family was up at the house which was on the hill. (Q&A 245-255) 
        
       
       
        
        Count 7 (Charge 14): Sexual intercourse with person 10 and under 16 years under authority s.66C(2): Victim A at [place ‘TC’] between 9 February 1992 and 9 February 1993 
         
        The offender stated that the offence occurred at TC when A was 15 years old.  
        
       
       
        
        The offender said that he had sex with A near the toilet trench which was downhill from the house. He said it was a sunny morning. He said that he told her to meet him there. She took off her pants and he inserted his penis into her vagina from behind. He removed his penis and ejaculated on to the ground. (Q&A 259-276) 
        
       
       
        
        Count 8 (Charge 15): Sexual intercourse with person 10 and under 16 years under authority s.66C(2): Victim A at [place ‘TC’] between 9 February 1991 and 9 February 1993 
         
        The offender stated that A was 15 at the time. They were disturbed by D. D stated that A was 15 years old.  
        
       
       
        
        The offender said that the bulldozer was parked in front of the house near the track. He was working on it with A and suggested that they do it. A took down her pants and rested her hands on the dozer. The offender inserted his penis into her vagina from behind. He removed it and didn’t get to ejaculate as his wife came out with a cup of coffee. When his wife saw them she threw the cup of coffee at him. He said that they were not actually in the act of intercourse but it looked suspicious as he pulled up his pants quickly. He had a major argument with his wife and he pleaded with her not to leave him. He said that once before his wife had actually caught them about to do it. (Q&A 279-294) 
        
       
       
        
        D said the offender and A were working on the bulldozer. She took a cup of coffee out to the offender. She could see the offender and A together and did not hear any sounds of working. She didn’t know what they were doing for certain but she was suspicious due to the other times she had seen them together. She cannot remember what she said to the offender but she was very angry. She thought that A was 15 at the time.  
        
       
       
        
        Count 9 Charge 16): Sexual intercourse with person 10 and under 16 years under authority s.66C(2): Victim A at [place ‘TC’] between 9 February 1991 and 9 February 1993 
         
        The offender said that A was about 15. He refers to numerous instances of similar behaviour at that time. D refers to one incident where she walked in on them. D thought that A was about 14 years old. A stated that the offender use to come into her bedroom early in the morning when her mother was making his lunch. She would stand up, turn around and the offender would insert his penis inside her vagina and pull it out before ejaculating. She said this  
        “happened heaps of times. Too many times to mention.” 
        
       
       
        
        The offender said that he used to have sex with A in her bedroom in the morning while his wife was making his lunch. A would get up take her pants off and stand with her hands on her knees. The offender inserted his penis into her vagina from behind and removed it before ejaculating. (Q&A 328-339) 
        
       
       
        
        D stated that when A was about 14, D walked into D’s bedroom and saw the offender and A putting on their clothes. It looked as if the offender had been having sex with A from behind. She said both the offender and A denied that anything had happened. She asked A if she wanted to leave and she said that she didn’t. She told the offender he was sick and had a twisted mind. He told her she was always looking for evil when there wasn’t any. A thought that her mother caught them when she was about 13. A said that although she initially denied anything had happened she later told her mother about what happened on this occasion.  
        
       
       
        
        Count 10 (charge 17): Incest by a male of a female aged 16 years or over: Victim A at [place ‘WW’] between 1 October 2000 and 31 December 2000 
         
        The incest charge is the last time the offender and A had intercourse. A states that it happened a couple of months before she started going out with her husband. They commenced going out on 10 December 2000. The offender said that A told him she had found a guy who she loved and she wanted to marry him. The offender said  
        “I actually bargained with her to do it one time, um, as a last time, I bargained with her.” 
         He later explained that if she let him have sex once more that he promised never to do it again and to let her go and have her own life and get married. He said that the bargaining occurred at a bible camp and she eventually agreed and they did it when they got home. They had sexual intercourse in the fruit packing shed and the offender remembers that it was the only time that A knelt down during intercourse. The offender estimated that it was about 4 years ago. (Q&A 408-433) A said that he told her this was the last time. She said he asked to do it front ways but she didn’t want to do it that way. She said they had sex the same way with him entering her from behind.  
        
       
       
        
        Count 11 (Charge 6): Sexual intercourse with person 10 and under 16 years under authority s.66C(2): Victim B at [place ‘TC’] between 30 July 1997 and 30 July 1998  
         
        This charge resulted from admissions made by the offender during his ERISP. He states in his interview that this occurred after they moved to WW and he went with B to their old property at TC to check the water tanks.  
        
       
       
        
        D states that they moved to the property just before B turned 9 but continued to return to the TC property for some time after they moved.  
        
       
       
        
        B thought that she was 10 years old. She said that they sold the TC property before she was 10. She said the offender undid her belt buckle and used his penis to take her virginity. She was very reluctant to give details about what happened but confirmed he had sex with her. When he finished he told her to wipe herself.  
        
       
       
        
        The offender said he asked her if she wanted to  
        “do it” 
         and that in her innocence she said  
        “yes” 
        . He said she did not know what she was doing. He took off her pants. He said they were standing up facing each other and  
        “I didn’t really put it in her, I just sort of, I put my penis sort of onto her vagina and sort of basically moved it around until I felt the urge and then I backed off and ejaculated.” 
         He conceded he may have entered her vagina  
        “slightly but I didn’t actually engage in full sexual contact as such.” 
         The offender thought that B was about 11 but observed several times that she was young,  
        “so young” 
        . (Q&A 466-493) The time frame is based on B’s recollection of her age and the circumstances regarding the sale of the properties.  
        
       
       
        
        Count 12 (Charge 7): Aggravated indecent assault s.61M(1): Victim B at [place ‘WW’] between 30 June 1999 and 20 July 2001 
         
        This charge resulted from a disclosure from B during her interview. B said that the offender had sex with her in the cabin of his Ute. She advised she may have been 12 or 13 at the time. It was night time. She later stated that he did not put his penis inside her crotch this time. He stayed on the outside of it. He was lying on top of her and rubbed his penis on her crotch. He told her how beautiful she was. (Note it appears that “crotch” is the term B uses for vagina.) 
        
       
       
        
        The offender did not mention this matter however he did say that he could not remember all the times that he sexually assaulted B. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 13 (Charge 8): Sexual intercourse with person 10 and over under 16 under authority s.66C(2): Victim B at [place ‘WW’] between 30 July 2000 and 10 November 2001 
         
        This charge resulted from a disclosure from the offender during his interview. B does not refer to this incident except in the context of the subsequent charge. The period of the charge is from 30 July 2000 (when B turned 13) to 7 November 2001 (when D was in hospital). The offender said at Q&A 546-557 that the last time he assaulted B was when his wife was in hospital and this offence occurred before that incident. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender said that this assault occurred at the workshop toilet at WW. It was in the day time and he asked B over there and would have told her that he needed to do it. B’s pants were off and she sat down over him on his penis as he sat on the toilet. He said this was the first time he actually put it in B and this was the time  
        “we thought that she got pregnant” 
        . He said that he thought he had ejaculated after he’d gotten off. He said he would have told her to give herself a good clean out in case she got some on her. He said he thought she was 13 or 14 (Q&A 508-524) 
        
       
       
        
        Count 14 (Charge 9): Assault: Victim B at [place ‘WW’]. Time frame between 30 July 2000 and 10 November 2001 
         
        This charge resulted from a disclosure from the offender.  
        
       
       
        
        B stated that she was 9 when she started getting her period. One time her period was overdue by a couple of weeks and she told the offender. She said he was terrified and didn’t know what to do. He told her not to eat anything and to exercise a lot which she did. She still didn’t get her period and he said he was going to have to hit her to get rid of it. B said OK and he hit her between her hips and belly three times  
        “hard enough” 
        . He then hugged her and she got her period the next day. She said her period that time was reasonably heavy but it had never been light.  
        
       
       
        
        In his ERISP, the offender said that after Count 13 occurred, B told him that she felt sick and her period was overdue. He said he was shocked and really frightened. He asked where she felt sick and when she replies  
        “here in the tummy” 
         he backhanded her fairly hard saying  
        “what there?” 
         She told him that hurt and he said  
        “well I hope you’re not pregnant.” 
         He then went to buy a pregnancy test thing. He said he hit her  
        “because at the time I felt that it might have, it might have stopped it happening if was, if she was pregnant.” 
         He also told her that she could lose it by stressing herself or overexercising too hard. He said she buckled up a bit and moved backwards when he hit her. He observed  
        “I just did all this out of absolute fear of her being pregnant.” 
         (Q&A 520-541) 
        
       
       
        
        Count 15 (Charge 10): Aggravated indecent assault s.61M(1): Victim B at [place ‘WW’]. Time frame between 7 November 2001 and 10th November 2001 
         
        This charge resulted from an admission from the offender during the ERISP. He stated that it occurred when his wife was in hospital having a hysterectomy. 
        
       
       
        
        D states that she was in hospital between 7 November 2001 and 10 November 2001. (para 28) 
        
       
       
        
        The offender said that while his wife was in hospital he went to B’s bed at night as he was totally overcome with the feeling of sexual need. He told B that he needed to do it really bad but that he wouldn’t put his penis inside her after what happened before. B took her pants down and was lying on her back. The offender came in front of her between her legs. He rubbed his penis up and down on her vaginal area until he ejaculated. He said that was the last time he did anything with B. (Q&A 546-557) 
        
       
       
        
        Count 16 (Charge 11): Sexual intercourse with person over 10 under 16 person under authority s.66C(2): Victim C at [place ‘WW’] between 1 September 2000 and 30 December 2001 
         
        This charge resulted from an admission from the offender and a disclosure from C. The offender stated that it happened after his wife had a hysterectomy and they were not having sex much.  
        
       
       
        
        D states that she was in hospital between 7 November 2001 and 10 November 2001.  
         
         
        C discloses that it was just before she turned 11 (14 November 2000). She states that it was sometime in the two months before her birthday on a Saturday night as they went to a religious service the next morning.  
        
       
       
        
        C stated that the offender crawled into her bed when she was asleep and sort of climbed on top of her. He then undressed her and told her not to make any noise. He rubbed her backside with his penis as he tried to find her vagina. He then put his penis inside her vagina. She stated that his penis was inside her for what felt like a long time going back and forth. Every time she made a noise he told her to be quite. She was telling him to stop. He eventually got up and left. She said her vagina hurt and she felt like throwing up.  
        
       
       
        
        The offender said he thought C was 11 or 12, probably around 11. He hadn’t had sex for 3 or 4 weeks after his wife came home from hospital. He said that he went into her bedroom and she was sort of half awake. She was lying on her back. He pulled the blankets back and put her legs on an angled position upwards and pulled her pant upward. He then put his penis in her vagina. He said he didn’t keep it in there long. After he pulled out his penis he used it to rub the edge of her vagina for a few seconds then ejaculated quickly. His wife was asleep in the next room. (Q&A 556-572) 
        
       
       
        
        Count 17 (Charge 12): Sexual intercourse with person over 10 and under 16 years s.66C(2): Victim C at [place ‘WW’] between 14 November 2000 and 31 January 2001 
         
        This charge resulted from an admission from the offender and a disclosure from C. C stated that it happened just after her 11th birthday, between two or three weeks later.  
        
       
       
        
        C said that her mother was in the shower and she was putting away things on her bed. It was night time. The offender whispered to her to come into his room. She had an idea of what he wanted and didn’t want to go but felt she had to. When she got into his room, he grabbed her and pulled off her pants and sat her on his lap. He didn’t have any pants on. He then sort of pushed her back off and stood her over near the door and got her to bend over. She said he then put his penis in her vagina from behind. He moved it back and forwards for what seemed like a long time to her. He then told her to clean herself out. C had just finished her first period. She said that a few weeks after this incident the offender asked her whether she was pregnant and she said no. This was the last time anything happened.  
        
       
       
        
        The offender said that another two or three weeks had gone by since the first episode with C and he still had not had sex with his wife. He asked C to come to his bed and he got her to turn around. He removed her panties and inserted his penis in her vagina. He said he was only inside for a few seconds and then used his hand to ejaculate. He showed her his semen and told her that if it got inside her she would get pregnant. He said he told her that he was never going to touch her again. (Q&A 572) C does not recall the offender saying this to her. 
        
       
      
    8 It is clear from the above that the 17 offences with which the respondent was charged are those occasions upon which the respondent or the victim could give sufficient details to allow a charge to be laid. On the agreed facts before the Court, sexual intercourse with A was, at least during part of the time, occurring on a daily basis and was, at other times, occurring more than once a week with B. Whatever the frequency with which sexual assault occurred on one or more of his daughters, it is only with the 17 offences that the sentencing court was allowed to deal, and it is only those 17 offences with which this Court can deal. And, subject to the application of the principles in sentencing relating to totality, it is with each of those 17 offences that the Court is required to deal.  
     
      
       
      Principles in Crown Appeals 
       
      
    9 The principles that an appellate court applies to an appeal by the Crown have been stated on a number of occasions and are well known. The Crown appeal is, by its nature, an exceptional power reposed in either the DPP or the Crown which power ought to be exercised rarely. Even more rarely will the Court intervene because, while each appeal is dealt with on its merits, in Crown appeals, the Court continues to exercise a residual discretion, even where error has been shown, not to intervene in the discretion exercised by a sentencing judge.  
     
      
    10 The principles on Crown appeal were summarised by Wood CJ at CL in a much cited passage in R v Wall [2002] NSW CCA 42, which is cited in full in R v Prasad (2004) 147 A Crim R 385 at [27]. That summary is:  
     
      
       
        
        (a) The normal restriction upon appellate review of the exercise of a discretion, as set out in  
        House v The King 
         (1936) 55 CLR 499, applies to Crown appeals against sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen 
         (2000) 202 CLR 321; with the result that this Court cannot merely substitute its opinion, as to the appropriate sentence, for that of the sentencing judge:  
        Lowndes v The Queen 
         (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671; rather, it may interfere only where error either latent or patent is shown;  
        R v Tait 
         (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388; and  
        Wong and Leung v The Queen 
         (2001) 207 CLR 584; 76 ALJR 79 at [58] and [109]. 
         
        (b) Appeals by the Crown should generally be rare;  
        Malvaso v The Queen 
         (1989) 168 CLR 227 at 234, and unless there is a clear error of principle identified, it would be exceptional for the Court to interfere:  
        R v Baker 
         [2000] NSWCCA 85. 
         
        (c) A Crown appeal against sentence is concerned with establishing matters of principle ‘for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons’: per Barwick CJ in  
        Griffiths v The Queen 
         (1977) 137 CLR 293 but this power extends to doing what is necessary to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing, that is, where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand:  
        Everett v The Queen 
         (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299, 74 A Crim R 241 at 244;  
        Dinsdale v The Queen 
         (2000) 202 CLR 321, 115 A Crim R 558, and  
        Wong and Leung v The Queen 
        . 
         
        (d) The Court has a lively discretion to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown, and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it should have regard to the double jeopardy that a convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal:  
        R v Allpass 
         (1993) 72 A Crim R 561,  
        Director of Public Prosecutions v Papazisis 
         (1991) 51 A Crim R 242 at 247, and  
        Wong and Leung v The Queen 
         at [110]. 
         
        (e) A sentence which is imposed as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal will generally be less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court:  
        R v Holder and Johnston 
         (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 256, and will generally be towards the lower end of the available range of sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen 
         at para [62]. 
        
       
      
    11 In R v Abboud [2005] NSWCCA 251, I remarked that over and above the principles stated must be added the strong resistance by the Court against tinkering with sentences and the injunction by the High Court in Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at [26]:  
     
      
       
        
        Judges at first instance should be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime under which the sentencing regime is effected. 
        
       
      
    12 To these principles should be added the confirmation by the High Court in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25: 
     
      
       
        
        [25] …Thus is specific error shown? (Has there been some error of principle? Has the sentencer allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the decision? Have the facts been mistaken? Has the sentencer not taken some material consideration into account?) Or if specific error is not shown, is the result embodied in the order unreasonable or plainly unjust? … 
        
       
       
        
        [27] Express legislative provisions apart, neither principle nor any of the grounds of appellate review, dictates the particular path that a sentencer, passing sentence in a case where the penalty is not fixed by statute, must follow in reasoning to the conclusion at the sentence be imposed should be fixed as it is. The judgment is a discretionary judgment and, as the basis for appellate review reveal, what is required is that the sentencer must take into account all relevant considerations (and only relevant considerations) in forming the conclusion reached. As has now been pointed out more than once, there is no single correct sentence. And Judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime as applies. … 
        
       
       
        
        [30] Legislatures do not enact maximum available sentences as mere formalities. … 
        
       
       
        
        [31] It follows that careful attention to maximum penalties will almost always be required, first, because the legislature has legislated for them; secondly, because they invite comparison between the worst possible case and the case before the court at the time; and thirdly, because in that regard they do provide, taken and balanced with all of the other relevant factors, a yard stick.  
        
       
      
    13 It is the above principles, especially as they relate to Crown appeals, that I apply in dealing with the sentence below.  
     
      
       
      Are there Errors in the Sentencing Process: Identifiable or Manifest? 
       
      
    14 The sentencing judge rightly remarks “that people who commit sexual offences on their children are treated very seriously by the courts” and recounts that Counts 1 to 10 relate to the eldest daughter, A, and cover the period 1984 to 2000 when she was aged 7 to 23. Counts 11 to 15 relate to daughter B and cover the period 1997 to 2001 when she was aged 10 to 14. Counts 16 and 17 relate to daughter C and cover the period 2000 and 2001. The sentencing judge refers to “the previous good character of this offender” and various mitigating factors prescribed in s.21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The sentencing judge accepts that the respondent “is unlikely to re-offend given the circumstances of this case, and … that he has good prospects of rehabilitation and as is already clear, there has been a plea of guilty.” The sentencing judge recites that the respondent is entitled to “the full credit for his plea” which saved his daughters and his wife from giving evidence and to a discount to reflect the principles in R v Ellis (1986) NSWLR 603, because his ERISP was a more detailed recollection of the offences and therefore was of assistance to the police in their investigation. 
     
      
    15 His Honour in dealing with the sentence to be imposed, says: 
     
      
       
        
        I would have regarded the appropriate head sentence in this case as in the region of fourteen to fifteen years. I have discounted that to ten years for the plea of guilty and the  
        Ellis 
         factor. As I say, I do not precisely go into the mathematics, but I have identified it so that people know. It will then become apparent that because of what I have already said, the minimum period that has to be served in custody for these matters will be one of seven and a half years dating from today, and it is now necessary for me to go through the various offences detailing how that is made up. That is an exercise I have to go through because of the principles of  
        Pearce 
         and other legal reasons. 
         
        
       
      After recounting why it would be inappropriate, in looking at the formal sentence to determine what was the sentence imposed in relation to one child as against another, his Honour said: 
       
       
        
        It is an administrative exercise that I have to do, and it remains that the overall gravity of what has happened here is reflected by a non-parole period of seven and a half years. 
        
       
       
      His Honour then went on to impose the sentences that are earlier mentioned in this judgment. His Honour did not find special circumstances.  
       
      
    16 There are a number of matters which need to be raised in relation to the sentence imposed and the remarks of the sentencing judge. The first is the reference to “previous good character”. The sentencing judge was here referring to the fact that, as at the date of sentencing, the respondent had no prior convictions. He was also referring to the references, mentioned above, provided on his behalf. The sentencing Judge seemingly took this into account to some large degree as he did the lack of a likelihood to re-offend. Each of these, no doubt, depends upon the report of the registered psychologist which was in evidence before his Honour and before this Court.  
     
      
    17 The difficulty with this approach, in relation to offences of this kind is that, similar to most white-collar crime, the non-apprehension of the respondent (or his prior good behaviour) is almost a necessary condition to the commission of the crime. In circumstances where the respondent faces 17 offences of sexual assault on children spanning a period of almost 20 years, previous good behaviour is a factor which ought provide little weight in favour of the respondent18 The psychologist’s report is based upon an interview on one occasion on 30 August 2005 and has a number of problems. For example, it seems that the respondent told the psychologist that he approached members of the New South Wales Police prior to complaints being made against him and that his sexual activity with his eldest daughter commenced when she was approximately 12 years of age. The offences commenced when the child was 7. Offences against a 7 year old cannot be understood on the reasons given to the psychologist for initiating contact with his eldest daughter, which was that “she was at that time developing into womanhood”. It is also clear that notwithstanding that he now recognises what he did was wrong, he recognised at the time of the continuing offences that it was wrong and has so stated.  
     
      
    19 Further, in relation to whether or not he is “unlikely to re-offend”, there seems to be no independent evidence that would suggest that to be the case. It is clear from the psychologist’s report (although it does not seem that testing occurred) that the respondent is not a paedophile. The psychologist states that the respondent “has not preyed on other children or molested anybody outside the family”, but the psychologist was unaware, at least according to the report, that he had also molested his third child. The psychologist comes to the conclusion that the respondent is not “a danger to the community. His sexual activities have always been confined to the family and since he no longer has access to his wife and family, he has controlled his sexual desires and feels he will be able to continue to do so.” This may ground a finding that there are good prospects of rehabilitation but seems to depend far more on the current lack of opportunity. On the sentence imposed by his Honour, the respondent will be 56 years of age when he re-enters society. At that age he is well able to enter into a new relationship and have other children. Further, there seems nothing on the record which warrants a finding that he is unlikely to re-offend if contact occurs with his daughters, or their daughters.  
     
      
    20 Each of the above criticisms are criticisms relating to findings of fact that are within the discretion of the sentencing judge. They may provide an understanding for a sentence that would otherwise be manifestly inadequate, but, in and of themselves, ought not to be the subject of correction. I will assume, notwithstanding my grave reservations, that the findings of his Honour in relation to those matters stand.  
     
      
    21 However, his Honour discloses no basis for arriving at the sentence he imposes.  
     
      
    22 I do not here participate in the debate between “instinctive synthesis” and “a staged sentencing process”. As the High Court has made clear, no single approach is correct in all cases. The High Court, however, pointed out: 
     
      
       
        
        An invitation to a sentencing judge to engage in a process of ‘instinctive synthesis’, as useful as shorthand terminology may on occasions be, is not desirable if no more is said or understood about what that means. The expression ‘instinctive synthesis’ may then be understood to mean an arcane process into the mysteries of which only judges can be initiated. The law strongly favours transparency. Accessible reasoning is necessary in the interest of victims, of the parties, appeal courts and the public. There may be occasions when some indulgence in an arithmetical process will better serve these ends. ( 
        Markarian 
        ,  
        supra 
        , at [39]) 
        
       
      
    23 There is simply no transparency in the process by which his Honour divined the starting point of 14 to 15 years.  
     
      
    24 Moreover, the process of “instinctive synthesis” refers to a sentence to be imposed for one offence. It does not invite sentencers to ignore, or treat as an administrative task, the principles embodied in Pearce. In Abboud the Court remarked: 
     
      
       
        
        [36] It has often been stated that in sentencing an offender, an appropriate sentence must be fixed which considers all of the questions associated with the criminality of that offence. In the case of multiple sentences for multiple offences, the totality principles adumbrated by the High Court in  
        Pearce v The Queen 
         (1998) 194 CLR 610 are well known and ought to be applied. I have already referred to the flexibility which nevertheless remains in a sentencing judge and was referred to in  
        Johnson 
        , supra 
        . In  
        Johnson 
        , the joint judgment, cites, with approval, the judgment of the High Court in  
        Mill 
         (see paragraphs [18] and [19] of  
        Johnson 
        ) … The High Court makes clear that there is no inconsistency between  
        Mill 
         and  
        Pearce 
         and that each reflects the level of flexibility that must be retained by a sentencing judge in applying the principles of sentencing. Nevertheless, the approach in  
        Mill 
         is recognised as the orthodox approach to sentencing. It provides that a separate sentence will be imposed in relation to each separate offence, taking into account the matters that affect that sentence. It is only at the end of the process that the totality principle will be accommodated, preferably, by making the sentences wholly or partially concurrent.  
        
       
      
    25 While it is permissible to accommodate the totality principle by adjusting the last sentence to be imposed, as his Honour did here, the processes as adumbrated by the High Court in Mill, Pearce and Johnson do not include a process which treats all of the offences as one or which allows a process which starts with an overall figure and treats the assignment of criminality in relation to each offence as an administrative step.  
     
      
    26 Both of those kinds of error are evident in his Honour’s remarks on sentencing. His Honour treats Counts 1 to 10 as if they were all one offence against the eldest daughter. Similarly he treats Counts 11 to 15 as if they were one offence against the middle daughter. His Honour treats Counts 16 and 17 against the youngest child likewise and as if there were no additional criminality involved over the offences against the elder daughters. The manner in which his Honour fixed the commencement date for the sentences pays insufficient regard to those aspects of the charges that related to different children and those aspects of each offence which were not comprehended in the other offences, even against the same child.  
     
      
    27 The process by which his Honour fixed the commencement date and term of each sentence was almost fictional, described by his Honour as “an administrative exercise” (see [15] infra), and pays insufficient regard to the principles adumbrated by the High Court in Pearce.  
     
      
    28 In the circumstances, errors of principle have occurred in the process of sentencing which require the respondent to be re-sentenced by this Court.  
     
      
    29 Further comment is required on the subjective factors concerning the respondent. The first is that, as set out in the facts above, his initial reaction to the reporting of these incidents by his wife and daughters was not remorse and contrition as to what he had done, but rather concern as to his ability to cook for and look after himself. This represents a continuation of the attitude of pandering to his own needs to the detriment of his children which underpinned the offences in question.  
     
      
    30 The second element is the comment made throughout the ERISP that part of the cause for these offences was the fact that his wife was unwilling or unable to engage in sex with him. I do not, in any way, accept the truth of that proposition, or, even if it were true, that such a proposition is ameliorative of the seriousness of these offences or the sentences to be imposed. Of note is the explanation given to the psychologist that one of the reasons that his wife had difficulty engaging in sexual intercourse with him was that “his wife had been abused by several people”. That knowledge, not mentioned by his Honour, shows an actual knowledge of some of the damage that would likely be occasioned to his daughters by his conduct.  
     
      
    31 Lastly, in relation to errors identifiable or manifest, I would make clear that a sentence of seven and a half years’ imprisonment non-parole period and ten years’ imprisonment for the total sentence is manifestly inadequate for a series of offences of this kind stretching over this many years.  
     
      
    32 This is not a case in which the residual discretion reposed in the Court not to interfere on a Crown appeal, even when error is found, applies. (See R v AA [2006] NSWCCA 55) 
     
      
       
      Sentencing 
       
      
    33 It is necessary for the respondent to be re-sentenced. For that purpose I accept, notwithstanding the above criticisms, the findings of fact upon which his Honour based the sentences imposed. I do so because those findings of fact were open and, given the nature of the appeal process, ought not to be disturbed. Further, I accept the discount of thirty-three and a third percent applied by his Honour on account of the utilitarian view of the plea of guilty and the assistance provided to police pursuant to the principles adumbrated in Ellis. I deal with the offences in what I consider to be ascending order of seriousness: 
     
      
       
      Count 14 
       is a common assault with a maximum penalty of two years’ imprisonment. It is an assault, within the range of common assaults, above a midrange of seriousness which was perpetrated on a person in a trust relationship with the respondent and done for the purpose of causing the termination of a suspected pregnancy. In the scheme of common assaults it is a quite serious assault. As already indicated, I allow the discount that the sentencing judge has applied and take into account the subjective elements, including prior good character. These subjective factors apply to all offences, as does the factor of this being his first period of incarceration.  
       
       
      Count 1 
       is an indecent assault of a child under 16 years which carries a maximum penalty of six years’ imprisonment. This was an indecent assault on a seven year old child. Nevertheless, the circumstances surrounding the assault are not such as to put it in the worst case but it is, again, above midrange in seriousness. 
       
       
      Count 10  
      is incest, carrying a maximum penalty of seven years’ imprisonment. Because daughter A at the time was above the age of consent, it is not sexual intercourse without consent as is the case in all persons under the age of 16 years. Nevertheless taking into account the position of trust and that this incident occurred as a culmination of a prolonged period during which the victim would have been wholly disempowered and her true consent suborned, it is an offence of serious proportions and at higher than midrange in the range of offences that fit within the section.  
       
       
      Counts 12 and 15  
      are each aggravated indecent assault carrying a maximum sentence of seven years’ imprisonment. The assault was committed against the middle child at the age of 12 or 13 in relation to Count 12 and at the age of 14 in relation to Count 15. Again these are offences which do not involve gratuitous violence or threats, but do abuse the position of trust which the respondent had vis-à-vis his daughter. Once more, this offence would be at midrange.  
       
       
      Counts 2 to 9, 11, 13, 16 and 17 
       are each sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 16 years of age and relate to all three daughters. The first offence against each child, i.e. when each child was at her youngest age, is marginally worse than the others, although each of them are at or above midrange in seriousness. The first offences of this kind against each child are Count 2 for daughter A, Count 11 for daughter B and Count 16 for daughter C. None involves gratuitous violence or the use of force (or the threats of it) over and above that which is otherwise an element of the offence. However, each of them was an abuse of trust.  
       
      
    34 I must then deal with totality and the overall sentence. I consider that there is significant overlap in the sexual intercourse offences in relation to each child. None of the individual offences can, by itself, in this sentencing exercise, be served without some concurrence. I have decided to treat the first offence against each child separately from the others because it required a separate animus than the continuation of a course of conduct already commenced in relation to that child. The last and penultimate sentences have been fixed to put into effect the statutory ratio between non-parole period and the remainder of the term in circumstances that, but for that factor, do not enable a finding of special circumstances. The overall non-parole period and remainder of sentence represent, in accordance with the principles on a Crown appeal, the lowest end of the range available for these offences.  
     
      
    35 In light of all of the factors mentioned above and my assessment of the seriousness of the offences, I propose that the respondent be re-sentenced and I propose that the Court should make the following orders: 
     
      
    a Appeal allowed.b The sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Black QC of the District Court on 2 September 2005 be quashed and in lieu thereof, the following sentences be imposed:i. Count 14: common assault – a fixed term of 18 months’ imprisonment to commence on 2 September 2005 and expiring on 1 May 2007;ii. Count 1: indecent assault – a fixed term of three years’ imprisonment commencing 2 January 2006 and expiring on 1 January 2009; 
     
      
    iii. Count 10: incest – a fixed term of three years’ imprisonment commencing 2 January 2007 and expiring on 1 January 2010;iv. Count 12: aggravated indecent assault – imprisonment for three years commencing 2 January 2008 and expiring on 1 January 2011 with a non-parole period of 27 months’ imprisonment commencing on 2 January 2008 and expiring on 1 April 2010;v. Count 15: aggravated indecent assault – imprisonment for three years to commence on 2 January 2009 and expire on 1 January 2012 with a non-parole period of 27 months’ imprisonment to commence on 2 January 2009 and expire on 1 April 2011;vi. Count 2: sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 16 years under authority – imprisonment for four years commencing 2 January 2010 and expiring on 1 January 2014 with a non-parole period of three years’ imprisonment commencing 2 January 2010 and expiring 1 January 2013;vii. Counts 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9: sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 16 years under authority – for each, imprisonment for four years to commence on 2 February 2011 and expire on 1 February 2015 with a non-parole period of three years’ imprisonment commencing on 2 February 2011 and expiring on 1 February 2014;viii. Count 11: sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 16 years under authority – imprisonment for four years to commence on 2 February 2013 and expire on 1 February 2017 with a non-parole period of three years’ imprisonment commencing on 2 February 2013 and expiring on 1 February 2016;ix. Count 13: sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 16 years under authority – imprisonment for four years to commence on 2 February 2014 and expire on 1 February 2018 with a non-parole period of three years’ imprisonment to commence on 2 February 2014 and expire on 1 February 2017;x. Count 16: sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 16 years under authority – imprisonment for four years to commence on 2 February 2015 and expire on 1 February 2019 with a non-parole period of two years’ and seven months to commence on 2 February 2015 and expire on 1 September 2017;xi. Count 17: sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 16 years under authority – imprisonment for a period of five years to commence on 2 September 2016 and expire on 1 September 2021 with a non-parole period of one years’ imprisonment to commence on 2 September 2016 and expire on 1 September 2017.c The respondent is sentenced to an overall effective sentence of a non-parole period of 12 years’ imprisonment and is first eligible for release on parole on 1 September 2017, thereafter to be under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service until 1 September 2021.

     GIANOUTSOS v GLYKIS 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: This matter comes before the Court by way of a case stated under the provisions of s 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The appeal is out of time. However, the reason for the delay is explained by the lack of a transcript which, through no fault of the appellant, meant that the appeal could not be lodged within the period provided by s 5B(2). In the circumstances, leave should be granted to appeal out of time. 
     
      
    2 The appellant originally applied for an Apprehended Personal Violence Order (“APVO”) against the respondent alleging that she was the author of a series of anonymous emails which he had received which proved distressing to both himself and his wife. 
     
      
    3 The matter was determined in the Local Court and an interim APVO was granted in February 2004. The application was heard over four days in September and December 2004. Ms Glykis appeared in person at the hearing. 
     
      
    4 The evidence at the Local Court included oral evidence from the appellant, his wife, Associate Professor Peter Collins, (Head of the Linguistic Department of the University of New South Wales), Gail Kay (the appellant’s receptionist) and the respondent. Numerous documents were tendered including emails which the respondent admitted she had created and sent. 
     
      
    5 The matter was heard before Bradd SM who determined to make the order. His Honour found that the emails were of an harassing nature and, having regard to the evidence, including the expert evidence, found that they had been authored by the respondent. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “So all that evidence together is such that I am satisfied that the only rational inference that can be drawn is that Ms Glykis was the author of the emails.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Dr Gianoutsos has given evidence that he has continuing fears. He says he feels threatened and concerned. His wife has also given evidence of her fears and actions have been taken by them to increase security at their home which indicates they have fears. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that given the nature of the emails that the fears are reasonable.” 
        
       
      
    6 Ms Glykis appealed to the District Court where, after receiving limited further evidence, Puckeridge DCJ upheld the appeal. 
     
      
    7 In his reasons for judgment Puckeridge DCJ noted that Professor Collins had concluded from emails, which were admittedly sent by the respondent, that the emails about which complaint was made were also sent by her. His Honour noticed that Mr Bell, who had given evidence on behalf of the respondent, was of the opinion that the emails were “what he referred to as cut and paste and could have been cut and pasted by the recipient.” His Honour does not resolve this disagreement but said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I had indicated at an early stage in making a ruling on 23 March 2005, the issue before the court on the appeal was whether or not the appellant on the probability was the author of the emails exhibits 2, 3, 4, 5 and 15 in the Local Court. Having considered those emails I consider those emails do amount to harassment within the meaning of s 562AI of the  
        Crimes Act 
        .” 
        
       
      
    8 His Honour then notes that the appellant gave evidence before the District Court in which he indicated that he still maintained fears in relation to the respondent. His Honour accepted that the appellant had “reasonable grounds for his fear” and continued saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “That being the case I consider I have to be comfortably satisfied that the appellant was indeed the author of these emails. Counsel for the respondent has submitted the test is the test of the probabilities, I accept that. In view of the nature of the fear I consider that whilst the court has to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities within the meaning of  
        Briginshaw v Briginshaw 
         I consider that the case is such that the court would have to be comfortably satisfied.” 
        
       
      
    9 His Honour indicates that he has had regard to the evidence of Professor Collins and the other experts. He also notes that the respondent says that she did not author the emails. His Honour notes that the appellant: 
     
      
       
        
        “relies on the circumstantial evidence that the email address in relation to Dr Gianoutsos was only given to the appellant on 17 December 2003 by the (appellant’s) secretary at the time. The (appellant) submits that it would have to be more than mere coincidence for emails to be sent to that same email address the next day. The (appellant) submits that when you take that into account together with the evidence of Professor Collins and Mr Skinner, the court could be satisfied on the probabilities, indeed comfortably satisfied that the author of the emails was the appellant.” 
        
       
      
    10 Having provided this short summary of the position of the respective parties and without any further analysis of the evidence his Honour expresses the following conclusion: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whilst there is force to this submission I am not satisfied on all the evidence that the appellant was the author of the email. I cannot be satisfied on the evidence that the appellant was also the person who made harassing phone calls.” 
        
       
      
    11 Accordingly, his Honour determined that the appeal should be upheld and dismissed the apprehended violence order. 
     
      
       
      An outline of the facts 
       
      
    12 The appellant is a plastic surgeon who has been practising at the Prince of Wales Hospital for six years. During 2001 and 2002 he worked fulltime in the Prince of Wales Hospital campus, that is, in his rooms at the Private Hospital, the public hospital and the Sydney Children’s Hospital. He worked at the Sydney Children’s Hospital, Prince of Wales campus, from 21 January 2001 up until December 2002. 
     
      
    13 The respondent gave evidence that in November 2001 she interviewed Dr Gianoustos in his office and “his jaw dropped, he had a good perve, he was looking at her breasts, drooling.” She claimed that she later invited him to a Christmas party, that they both attended, but they had no actual contact there. 
     
      
    14 In February 2003 Ms Glykis broke up with Dr Arthur Grillas with whom she had a relationship which she said had damaged her self-esteem. The respondent contacted the appellant on 6 March 2003 seeking advice concerning treatment. 
     
      
    15 The appellant was then a widower. In April 2003 he announced his engagement to the future Mrs Gianoutsos (Melanie). Before their marriage the appellant received a typed anonymous letter saying certain things about Melanie and querying whether the marriage should go ahead. The letter distressed both of them and they decided to destroy it.  
     
      
    16 In July 2003 the appellant and Melanie were married. The wedding was publicised in the social pages of a Sydney newspaper. On 4 August 2003 Melanie started working at the appellant’s practice. At about that time the practice started to receive a large number of nuisance telephone calls. Between 19 September 2003 and 5 October 2003 the appellant and Melanie were overseas. When they returned they turned on the computer. They opened 3 emails, one dated 21 September 2003 and two dated 24 September 2003. Each of them was addressed to “Mark.” There was evidence that the email server for the two anonymous emails was a company called Betrusted Pty Ltd which was the internet service provider for the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing. The respondent worked for the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing between August and November 2003.  
     
      
    17 The first of the emails (dated 21 September 2003) which was sent shortly after the wedding suggested that the appellant should have married “a stunning Greek woman – like the red head at POWH” who had never married and had no children, and who used to model. There was evidence that the respondent was Greek, that she was redheaded and had worked at the Sydney Children’s Hospital at POWH where the appellant was also employed. The respondent had never married and had no children. Her curriculum vitae, which was in evidence, indicated that she had been a model.  
     
      
    18 The appellant and his wife were distressed by the emails and approached the police. A further email was received on 13 October 2003 which was distressing and after which the appellant took steps to increase his security at home. 
     
      
    19 On 17 December 2003 Melanie received a phone call from a person identifying herself as Maria asking about impulse light machine and associated skin care. Approximately 4 hours later on 17 December 2003 there was evidence that the respondent attended the appellant’s surgery. The evidence was that she asked for “Melanie” and was introduced to Melanie Gianoutsos with whom she then spoke. She also met the receptionist, Gail Kay, who introduced herself as “Gail.” Mrs Gianoutsos gave evidence that the respondent was behaving bizarrely and seemed angry. Ms Kay gave evidence that the respondent seemed “quite agitated.” 
     
      
    20 The respondent was handed documents and then left the surgery but returned later. On her return she had a further conversation with Melanie Gianoutsos about scientific components and skin cream. Due to her behaviour Melanie wrote on a “post-it” note a “red headed Greek girl”, which she placed with the respondent’s file. The meeting with the respondent on 17 December 2003 made Melanie Gianoutsos feel frightened. She also gave evidence that on this occasion she handed the respondent a document bearing the email address drgianoutsos@ozemail.com.au which she said was the first time the practice had used this email address. 
     
      
    21 The next day a woman telephoned the appellant’s rooms and asked whether “Mark” received all his emails. She was told that he did and that the emails were printed off and not filtered by staff. Gail Kay, the receptionist said she recognised the voice as that of the respondent. Later that day Melanie opened an email addressed to the appellant purporting to come from “Iggi Michael.” It was sent to both of the appellant’s email addresses. This was the first anonymous email to be sent to the email address at drgianoutsos@ozemail.com.au. The email complained about one of the appellant’s secretaries identified as “Melissa” or “Melanie”, spoke of her in derogatory and offensive terms, pitied the man who was married to her and contrasted her with “Gail.” 
     
      
    22 This exchange caused the appellant and his wife to become even more concerned for their security and shortly afterwards these proceedings were commenced. 
     
      
    23 The case stated raises six questions.  
     
      
       
      Question 1 – Was the appeal to the District Court a hearing de novo? 
       
      
    24 In his reasons for judgment Puckeridge DCJ described the appeal as “a hearing de novo.” This was not correct.  
     
      
    25 The appeal was required to be dealt with as if it was an appeal against conviction under Part 3 of the Crimes (Local Courts and Review) Act 2001. Section 18 of that Act provides that the appeal is to be dealt with “by way of rehearing on the basis of certified transcripts of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings … .” 
     
      
    26 Subsection 2 provides that fresh evidence may be given “but only by leave of the District Court which may be granted only if the court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that the fresh evidence be given.” 
     
      
    27 In George Pakis (1981) 3 A Crim R 132 at 136, O’Brien CJ of Cr D said that “[t]he expression ‘by way of rehearing’ may in some contexts give rise to difficulties.” This is because, as Viscount Sankey LC noted in Powell v Streatham Manor Nursing Home [1935] AC 243 at 249, “There are different meanings to be attached to the word ‘rehearing.’” The meaning given to the word will differ according to the type of appeal in question. The following passage from Glass JA’s decision in Turnbull v New South Wales Medical Board [1976] 2 NSWLR 281 at 297-298 is illuminating: 
     
      
       
        
        “Appeal is a term loosely employed to denote a number of different litigious processes which have few unifying characteristics. They vary greatly in the extent to which the appellate court may interfere with the result below. Graded in ascending order, in accordance with the width of the corrective power exercised by the appeal court, they are as follows:  
        
       
       
        
        (a)  
        Appeals to supervisory jurisdiction 
        . Only errors going to jurisdiction or denials of natural justice can be ventilated. 
        
       
       
        
        (b)  
        Appeals on questions of law only 
        , e.g. from the Workers' Compensation Commission. Undetermined or wrongly determined issues of fact must be remitted. 
        
       
       
        
        (c)  
        Appeals after a trial before judge and jury 
        . The result below will be disturbed if the judge fell into error of law, or if the jury's errors of fact transcend the bounds of reason. But, except for the assessment of damages, issues of fact must be redetermined in a new trial. 
        
       
       
        
        (d)  
        Appeals from a judge in the strict sense 
        , e.g. appeals to the High Court. If the judge has fallen into error of law, or has made a finding of fact which is clearly wrong, the appellate court will substitute its own judgment. Only such judgment can be given as ought to have been given at the original hearing. Later changes in the law are disregarded and additions to the evidence are not allowed:  
        Victorian Stevedoring and General Contracting Co. Pty. Ltd. and Meakes v Dignan  
        [(1931) 46 C.L.R. 73, at p. 107]. 
        
       
       
        
        (e) Appeals from a judge by way of rehearing, e.g. appeals under s. 75A of the Supreme Court Act, 1970. Judicial opinion differs on whether a power to receive fresh evidence is implied:  
        Ex parte 
          
        Currie; Re Dempsey 
         [(1968) 70 S.R. (N.S.W.) 1; 88 W.N. (Pt. 2) 193]. Almost invariably, however, it is expressly conferred. If errors of law or wrong findings of fact have occurred below, the appellate court will try the case again on the evidence used in the court below, together with such additional evidence as it thinks fit to receive. Since it will decide the appeal in the light of the circumstances which then exist, changes in the law will be regarded:  
        Ex parte Currie; Re Dempsey 
         [(1968) 70 S.R. (N.S.W.) 1; 88 W.N. (Pt. 2) 193]  
        Edwards v. Noble 
         (1971) [125 C.L.R. 296, at p. 304]. 
        
       
       
        
        (f)  
        Appeals involving a hearing de novo 
        , e.g. appeals from a Court of Petty Sessions to a Court of Quarter Sessions. All the issues must be retried. The party succeeding below enjoys no advantage, and must, if he can, win the case a second time:  
        Sweeney v. Fitzhardinge  
        [(1906) 4 C.L.R. 716].” 
        
       
      
    28 As Glass JA notes in point (f) above, appeals from a Court of Petty Sessions to a Court of Quarter Sessions were historically a hearing de novo. It was pointed out in the debate prior to the enactment of the Justices Legislation Amendment (Appeals) Act 1998 (NSW) that “the de novo appeal phenomenon dates back to a time when magistrates were not legally qualified and when the record of proceedings before magistrates was grossly inadequate” (Legislative Council, Hansard, 23/9/1998, p. 7787). The Justices Legislation Amendment (Appeals) Act 1998 (NSW) inserted s 132 into the now repealed Justices Act 1902 (NSW). Section 132 is substantially the same as s 18 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW). The purpose of s 132 of the Justices Act 1902 was to modernise the way appeals from the Local Court were conducted in light of the fact that magistrates are now legally qualified and that records of Local Court proceedings are now of a much higher standard. Specifically, the system of conducting appeals by way of a hearing de novo was to be replaced by a system of rehearings on the transcript of the proceedings before the magistrate. Fresh evidence could be adduced, but only with leave. 
     
      
    29 In Camilleri’s Stock Feeds Pty Ltd v EPA (1993) 32 NSWLR 683 the Court of Criminal Appeal interpreted s 5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. As it stood at the time, s 5AA relevantly provided that: 
     
      
       
        
        “(3) Any such appeal shall be by way of re-hearing on the evidence, if any, given in the proceedings before the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction and on any evidence in addition to or in substitution for the evidence so given.” 
        
       
      
    30 Section 5AA(3) – which is similar in terms to s 18 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) – was held to provide for a rehearing rather than a hearing de novo (at 687-692). 
     
      
    31 It is clear from the terms of s 18 that an appeal to the District Court by a defendant in the Local Court is not merely a mechanism which, once invoked, allows the trial to be started afresh. The appeal is to be conducted on the basis of certified transcripts of the evidence given in the Local Court, and fresh evidence may only be given with the leave of the court. 
     
      
    32 Question one should be answered: No 
     
      
       
      Question 2 – Did I err in law in treating it as such? 
       
      
    33 After indicating that the former s 5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provided for a rehearing rather than a hearing de novo, Kirby P (Campbell J and James J agreeing) in Camilleri’s Stock Feeds at 692 stated that: 
     
      
       
        
        “This Court must therefore proceed to consider the appellant’s culpability upon the basis of the evidence which was tendered before the trial court and any additional or substituted evidence admitted by the Court.  
        Ultimately, it is for this Court, having considered all of the evidence then finally before it, to resolve for itself, afresh, the ultimate issue for decision. 
        ” (emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    34 Subsequent to the decision in Camilleri’s Stock Feeds, s 5AA(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 was amended and a new subsection 3A was inserted. The section then provided as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(3) Any such appeal is to be by way of re-hearing on the evidence (‘the original evidence’), if any, given in the proceedings before the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction. 
        
       
       
        
        (3A) The Court of Criminal Appeal may however give leave to adduce fresh, additional or substituted evidence but only if the court is satisfied that there are special grounds for doing so. If the court does give leave, the appeal is to be by way of rehearing on the original evidence and on any fresh, additional or substituted evidence so adduced.” 
        
       
      
    35 In Cooper v Coffs Harbour Council (1997) 98 A Crim R 340 at 342, Howie AJ (with whom Hunt CJ at CL and Smart J agreed) stated that these amendments did nothing more than confirm the correctness of Kirby P’s judgment in Camilleri’s Stock Feeds. Importantly, his Honour said (at 341) that “an appeal under s 5AA is not restricted to a determination of whether the decision of the court below was infected with error.” His Honour went on to say (at 342) that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although this Court is concerned primarily to redetermine the charge on the evidence before the trial court, it does not follow that the hearing of the appeal is limited only to a review of that evidence even if no other evidence is adduced on the hearing of the appeal…As Hunt J (as he then was) said in  
        Huntley Colliery Pty Ltd v State Pollution Control Commission 
         [(unreported, NSWCCA, 5 June 1991)] “the appeal is on almost all fours with an appeal from the decision of a magistrate to the District Court…The difference in the nature of an appeal to this Court and an appeal from a magistrate to the District Court, is that an appeal under s 5AA is not a new hearing in which the prosecutor is required to lead the evidence to support the charge afresh.” 
        
       
      
    36 Of course, Howie AJ was referring to an appeal from a magistrate to the District Court before the enactment of the Justices Legislation Amendment (Appeals) Act 1998 (NSW). At 342 his Honour cites the decisions in Ex parte Day; Re Crampton (1943) 43 SR (NSW) 349 at 351 and Longshaw (1990) 20 NSWLR 554 at 559-561, which make plain that at the time Cooper was decided an appeal from a magistrate to the District Court was a “hearing de novo in which there is a completely new trial where in the prosecutor must begin again.” However, an appeal under s 18 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) is not a hearing de novo. Rather, it is a rehearing of a similar nature to a rehearing under the former s 5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (s 5AA was amended in 2000 so that it now provides for an appeal in the strict sense rather than an appeal by way of rehearing).  
     
      
    37 In Allesch v Maunz (2000) 203 CLR 172 the High Court considered the appeal provisions under the Family Court Act. In the course of the joint judgment of Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ their Honour’s said at 180: 
     
      
       
        
        “For present purposes, the critical difference between an appeal by way of rehearing and a hearing de novo is that, in the former case, the powers of the appellate court are exercisable only where the appellant can demonstrate that, having regard to all the evidence now before the appellate court, the order that is the subject of the appeal is the result of some legal, factual or discretionary error (see  
        CDJ v VAJ  
        (1998) 197 CLR 172 at 201-202), whereas, in the latter case, those powers may be exercised regardless of error.  
        At least that is so unless, in the case of an appeal by way of rehearing, there is some statutory provision which indicates that the powers may be exercised regardless of error. 
        ” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    38 In the present case, the legislation does indicate that the District Court’s appellate powers may be exercised regardless of error. Section 20 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) provides that on an appeal from a magistrate the District Court may either set aside a conviction (or in this case an APVO), or it may dismiss the appeal. The District Court is not limited to ordering fresh proceedings in the court below. Indeed, unlike the Supreme Court (see s 55(1)(b) of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW)), the District Court is given no express power to remit the matter back to the Local Court for redetermination in accordance with its directions. In R v Kurtic (1996) 85 A Crim R 57, Hunt CJ at CL noted that the power to determine an appeal otherwise than by ordering fresh proceedings would indicate that a court with such a power is not a court of error (at 59-60). 
     
      
    39 The District Court has power to rehear issues at trial but does not have power to remit the matter back to the Local Court. It follows that the District Court’s powers under s 18 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) are not dependent upon a finding of error at the original trial. 
     
      
    40 An appeal under s 18 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) is an appeal of this nature. 
     
      
    41 Question two should be answered: Yes, but this was not material to the resolution of the matter. 
     
      
       
      Question 3: Which party bore the onus of proof? 
       
      
    42 Although the appeal was by way of rehearing the onus remained on the appellant (Dr Gianoutsos) to prove his case to the relevant standard. The duty of the District Court judge was to determine the matter having regard to the evidence tendered in the Local Court and any further evidence admitted on the appeal: (see Camilleri’s Stock Feeds Pty Ltd at 692). 
     
      
    43 The answer to question 3 is that, although the proceedings were an appeal by way of rehearing, the respondent to that appeal (Dr Gianoutsos) continued to carry the onus of proving his case. 
     
      
       
      Question 4: Did I misdirect myself in stating that the facts must be proved to the comfortable satisfaction of the Court and in accordance with the principles in  
      Briginshaw v Briginshaw  
      (1938) 60 CLR 336? 
       
      
    44 Section 562AI(1) of the Crimes Act provides that the court may make an APVO “if it is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that a person has reasonable grounds to fear and in fact fears” one of the identified matters. In the present case the relevant matters were: 
     
      
       
        
        “(b) the engagement of the other person in conduct amounting to harassment or molestation of the person, being conduct that, in the opinion of the court, is sufficient to warrant the making of the order, or 
         
         
        (c) the engagement of the other person in conduct in which the other person:  
         
        (i) intimidates the person, or 
         
        … .” 
        
       
      
    45 Puckeridge DCJ accepted that the appellant had reasonable grounds for his fear that the author of the emails displayed irrationality and delusions which left himself and his family potentially at risk of physical harm. Having made that finding his Honour said that he “had to be comfortably satisfied that the appellant (now the respondent) was indeed the author of the emails.” His Honour accepted that satisfaction was required on the balance of probabilities within the meaning of Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR at 336 and said “I consider that the case is such that the court would have to be comfortably satisfied.” 
     
      
    46 With all due respect, it is difficult to discern the approach to the factual dispute which his Honour had in mind. His use of the expression “comfortable satisfaction” does not explain the task which his Honour set for himself. Briginshaw is concerned with the circumstances when the obligation falling upon a moving party requires proof to the “reasonable satisfaction” of the judicial decision maker. That question will be informed by the “seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding” (Briginshaw at 362). 
     
      
    47 When allegations which are being investigated or pursued in civil litigation involve a finding that a crime has been committed, application of the “Briginshaw test” as it has come to be identified has few difficulties. Weight must be given to the presumption of innocence and exactness of proof is expected (Briginshaw at 363). However, in other cases, which may include paternity questions under the Family Law Act 1975, the form of the legislation may require a different approach. In G v H (1994) 124 ALR 353 Deane, Dawson & Gaudron JJ said (at 362): 
     
      
       
        
        “It has been clear since the decision in  
        Briginshaw v Briginshaw 
         that in civil cases the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities, with due regard being had to the nature of the issue involved so that ``[t]he seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal'’ ((1938) 60 CLR at 362 per Dixon J;  
        Newis v Lark  
        (1571) 2 Plowd 403 at 412;  
        Cooper v Slade  
        (1858) 6 HLC 746 at 772-3;  
        Neat Holdings Pty Ltd v Karajan Holdings Pty Ltd  
        (1992) 110 ALR 449 at 449-50). Thus, if there is an issue of ``importance and gravity'’, to use the words of the trial judge, due regard must be had to its important and grave nature. 
         
         
        Not every case involves issues of importance and gravity in the  
        Briginshaw v Briginshaw 
         sense. The need to proceed with caution is clear if, for example, there is an allegation of fraud or an allegation of criminal or moral wrongdoing, as in  
        Briginshaw v Briginshaw 
         where the allegation was adultery by a married woman, an allegation involving serious legal consequences when that case was decided (see (1938) 60 CLR at 347, 350, 353, 368, 372;  
        Helton v Allen  
        (1940) 63 CLR 691 at 701, 712;  
        Rejfek v McElroy  
        (1965) 112 CLR 517 at 521-2) Paternity is a serious matter, both for father and for child. However, it is not clear that the question of paternity should be approached on the basis that it involves a grave or serious allegation in the  
        Briginshaw v Briginshaw 
         sense when what is at issue is the maintenance of a child and the evidence establishes that the person concerned is more likely than anyone else to be the father. After all, paternity can be determined easily and, for practical purposes, conclusively. And now that that is so, it is difficult to see why, if a person who could be the father declines to participate in procedures which will provide proof one way or the other, the child's rights to maintenance and support should none the less depend on the biological fact of paternity being established on the basis that, so far as the putative father is concerned, the biological fact involves an allegation in much the same category as an allegation of moral or criminal wrongdoing. Moreover, while a determination of parentage for the purposes of Family Law Act proceedings is obviously a serious matter for both the child and the putative parent, such a determination cannot properly be regarded as a declaration of paternity in the traditional sense. As Strauss J pointed out in the Full Court, there is some doubt as to whether the Family Court has the power to make such a declaration, and it is ``neither necessary nor desirable'’ that such a declaration be made in a case such as the present ((1993) 16 Fam LR at 534. See also  
        Re C (No 2)  
        (1992) 15 Fam LR 355 at 365;  
        Duroux and Martin  
        (1993) 17 Fam LR 130 at 134).” 
        
       
      
    48 As their Honours point out the approach to the making of conclusions considered by Dixon J in Briginshaw, in the well known passage to which their Honours refer, should not be understood as imposing a test in civil litigation other than the balance of probabilities. However, what is required is that when loading the scales appropriate weight is given to the matters to which Dixon J referred. 
     
      
    49 The “Briginshaw standard” is often spoken of quite loosely and as if it is a third standard of proof sitting somewhere between the balance of probabilities and beyond reasonable doubt. This is wrong. As Dixon J points out the civil standard of proof is proof on the balance of probabilities requiring the relevant party to prove the elements of its case to that standard. 
     
      
    50 In Kantor v Vosahlo [2004] VSCA 235 the issue for resolution was the testamentary capacity of the testator. The trial judge said that the executors bore a “heavy onus” in proving that the testator had testamentary capacity at the time she wrote her will. On appeal, Ormiston JA (at [24]) was of the opinion that by referring to the onus of proof in this way the trial judge had misdirected himself. In their joint judgment Buchanan and Phillips JJA said at [56]: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no warrant, then, for describing the onus on the propounders in this case as ""heavy"" or the standard as other than the ordinary one applicable in a civil suit. Of course the cogency of the evidence necessary to discharge the onus will depend upon the circumstances of the case, as it always does; the source of the doubt as to capacity will say much about what must be proved to dispel the doubt. But the onus was fixed below on the appellants (as was acknowledged) and the standard of proof was on the balance of probabilities.” 
        
       
      
    51 To say that a court must be “reasonably satisfied” (Briginshaw per Dixon J at 362) or “affirmatively satisfied” (Kantor per Buchanan and Phillips JJA at [54]) is one thing, but to say as did Puckeridge DCJ that the court must be “comfortably satisfied” is another thing altogether. His Honour appears to have been implying that proof to a higher standard than the balance of probabilities was required. If so, he was in error. 
     
      
    52 Although it could not be doubted that some people against whom an APVO is sought are likely to be deeply offended by the allegation which the applicant makes it is important to bear in mind that the court is only concerned to determine whether a person “has reasonable grounds to fear and in fact fears.” Such a determination does not necessarily require a finding that any particular event has occurred (although such a finding could be made) and does not require a finding that a criminal act may have been committed. 
     
      
    53 Furthermore, the making of an APVO may not necessarily have severe consequences or indeed any practical consequences at all for the person against whom it is made. If it be the case, as the respondent suggested in this matter, that she did not want to have anything further to do with the respondent the orders will have no effect on the way she conducts herself and lives her life. It is possible that it may affect her reputation but, having regard to the threshold the statute requires, the making of the allegation would be likely to have as much impact as the making of an order. 
     
      
    54 In these circumstances his Honour was required to consider the question raised by s 562AI of the Crimes Act giving appropriate weight to the fact that the appellant had made a serious allegation. But he was not required to determine whether the respondent had in fact authored the emails. His Honour was only required to consider whether the fears which he found the appellant held were founded on reasonable grounds. Accordingly, to isolate and decide the matter by consideration of whether he was “comfortably satisfied” that the respondent had authored the emails was not appropriate. The appropriate question was whether having regard to the available evidence, including evidence as to the author of the emails, the appellant had reasonable grounds for his fears justifying the making of an order against Ms Glykis. 
     
      
    55 The answer to question 4 is: Yes. 
     
      
       
      Question 5: Did I err in considering that it was necessary for me to be satisfied that the appellant engaged in conduct amounting to harassment or intimidation? 
       
      
    56 As I have indicated s 562AI(1) of the Crimes Act provides that a court may make an APVO if it is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that a person “has reasonable grounds to fear, and in fact fears”, the engagement of that other person in conduct amounting, inter alia, to harassment or intimidation and the conduct is sufficient to warrant the making of the order. Accordingly, the inquiry which the court must undertake is whether the complainant has reasonable grounds to fear and in fact fears the engagement of the other person in the relevant conduct. Before coming to that conclusion it is not necessary for the court to determine that the other person has in fact engaged in that conduct but, only, that the complainant has a fear which is based on reasonable grounds. Of course, if the court was satisfied that the other person had not conducted him or herself in the manner which the complainant alleged this would be relevant to a consideration of whether or not the court should be satisfied in the particular case and may prove fatal to the application. However, by confining the relevant question to whether or not the other person had actually sent the emails Puckeridge DCJ, in my opinion, was diverted from the inquiry which the section requires. 
     
      
    57 Question 5 should be answered: Yes. 
     
      
       
      Question 6: Were the reasons for my decision adequate, having regard to the test to be applied for an apprehended personal violence order s 562A 
      I  
      of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900? 
       
      
    58 His Honour stated that he had had regard to the evidence of Professor Collins and the other experts but gave no reason, based upon that evidence, as to why he reached the conclusion that he was “not satisfied” that the appellant was the author of the emails. Beyond the evidence of the experts, as I have already indicated, there was significant circumstantial evidence which pointed to the respondent as being the author of the emails. Before reaching a conclusion as to whether the respondent was the author his Honour should have analysed that evidence. Beyond the fact that his Honour said that he had had regard to “all the evidence” no indication is given of the basis upon which he reached his conclusion.  
     
      
    59 In Ainger v Coffs Harbour City Council [2005] NSWCA 424 the Court of Appeal had occasion to consider the significance of adequate reasons and the part they play in the judicial process. McColl JA with whom Mason P and Hunt AJA agreed said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Adequacy of reasons lies at the heart of the judicial process. Failure to provide sufficient reasons promotes ‘a sense of grievance’ and denies ‘both the fact and the appearance of justice having been done’, thus working a miscarriage of justice:  
        Misfud v Campbell  
        (1991) 21 NSWLR 725 at 728;  
        Beale v Government Insurance Office of New South Wales  
        (1997) 48 NSWLR 430 at 442 per Meagher JA. 
        
       
       
        
        The primary judge was not obliged to spell out every detail of his process of reasoning ( 
        Yates Property Corporation Pty Limited (In Liq) v Darling Harbour Authority  
        (1991) 24 NSWLR 156 at 171, 182), however he was obliged to expose his reasons for resolving a point critical to the contest between the parties:  
        North Sydney Council v Lygon  
        (1995) 87 LGERA 435 at 442 per Kirby ACJ;  
        Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd  
        (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 
          
        at 270 per Mahoney JA, at 280 per McHugh JA. This obligation lay upon him to enable the parties to identify the basis of his decision and the extent to which their arguments had been understood and accepted:  
        Soulemezis  
        at 279 per McHugh JA. As Santow JA (with whom Meagher and Beazley JJA agreed) explained in  
        Jones v Bradley  
        [2003] NSWCA 81 at [129] it was necessary that the primary judge “ ‘enter into’ the issues canvassed and explain why one case was preferred over another”. 
        
       
      
    60 I appreciate the burdens the workload of the Court imposes on District Court judges. This will impose practical limits on the length and detail required in reasons for judgment. However, in the present case, even if his Honour correctly identified the question he was required to answer as being whether or not he could be satisfied that the appellant was the author of the emails, his reasons for his conclusion were wholly inadequate. Before he could come to any conclusion on this issue his Honour should, at least, have identified the relevant evidence and explained whether he accepted that the events, which allegedly surrounded the sending of the emails and were said to involve the respondent, had occurred. In my opinion these events point, with considerable force, to the likelihood that the respondent was the author of the emails and required analysis in his Honour’s reasons before he could resolve the issue which he had set for himself. 
     
      
    61 The answer to question 6 is: No. 
     
      
       
      One other matter 
       
      
    62 The Court received lengthy and detailed submissions from each party. Much of those submissions was devoted to factual matters not requiring resolution by this Court in which jurisdiction is confined to resolving the questions which have been asked. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    63 In my opinion the appeal should be upheld and the following orders made: 
     
      
    64 1. Grant leave to appeal. 
     
      
      2. Answer the questions asked as follows: 
       
      Question1: No. 
       
        
        Question 2: Yes, but this was not material to the resolution of the matter. 
         
        Question 3: The respondent to the appeal (Dr Gianoutsos) continued to carry the onus of proving his case. 
        
       
      Question 4: Yes. 
       
      Question 5: Yes. 
       
      Question 6: No. 
       
      3. Remit the matter to the District Court to be determined in accordance with the answers to the questions raised in the appeal. 
       
      4. Order the respondent to pay the appellant’s costs of the appeal. 
       
      
    65 SULLY J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    66 HISLOP J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant pleaded guilty on indictment to a charge that between 16 August 2002 and 26 August 2002 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere he supplied a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine contrary to s 25(1) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. He also asked that one similar offence on a Form 1 of supplying 188 grams of methylamphetamine be taken into account. 
     
      
    2 The maximum penalty for each offence was imprisonment for 15 years.  
     
      
    3 The applicant seeks leave to appeal and relied upon five grounds. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    4 A detailed statement of agreed facts was tendered at the sentencing hearing. His Honour made findings in accordance with the agreed facts in a summary form. His Honour found that the applicant rang his son Pasquale Barbaro, in Sydney, and asked him to supply the applicant with 300 methylamphetamine tablets. Pasquale told the applicant he could get 1,000 at a time and, after some negotiations, the applicant agreed to pay him for 1,000 tablets. Before he was arrested the applicant managed to distribute 300 of the tablets. The rest were recovered. The weight of the 1,000 tablets was close to 250 grams at a price per tablet of $10 to $12. 
     
      
    5 In relation to the matter on the Form 1 his Honour found that the applicant had arranged to supply his son with methylamphetamine in powder form of a total weight of approximately 7ounces. The applicant arranged for another person, Mr Kavanagh, to take the drugs to his son. Mr Kavanagh was arrested at Sydney airport with 188 grams, approximately 7 ounces, of methylamphetamine secreted on his person. 
     
      
    6 On 29 November 2002 the New South Wales police obtained warrants for the arrest of the applicant. However, execution of the warrants was delayed at the request of the Victorian Police who were conducting another investigation into offences allegedly committed by the applicant in Victoria. It was not until 12 March 2004 that the applicant was spoken to by Victorian police about these matters. 
     
      
    7 On 6 September 2004 a meeting was arranged between police, the applicant and his lawyer. On 7 September 2004 the applicant consented to extradition to Sydney. He was initially on bail but that was revoked on 22 September 2004 and the applicant remained in custody. 
     
      
    8 The applicant was originally to stand trial but following negotiations between his lawyers and the Crown the current charge was substituted for a previous charge. When the substitution was offered the applicant pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    9 The sentencing judge was provided with the applicant’s criminal history. His Honour determined that it consisted of a variety of matters but included in it were three particularly relevant matters relating to drugs. The first of those matters was a conviction on 28 October 1985 for cultivating a prohibited plant. The applicant was convicted and fined $3,000 and placed on a good behaviour bond for three years.  
     
      
    10 The second matter was a conviction for the possession of cannabis resin for supply and possession of cannabis for supply. The applicant was convicted for those offences on 19 April 1987 and was sentenced to three years imprisonment on the first offence and two years imprisonment on the second offence to be served concurrently with a non-parole period of 18 months. 
     
      
    11 The third matter related to the possession, sale and supply of heroin for which the applicant was convicted on 11 May 1992. He was sentenced to five years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years. 
     
      
    12 His Honour recognised that the offences were old matters and said the lapse of time since serving his sentence in respect of the 1992 matter might indicate in some circumstances that the applicant had undergone some rehabilitation. However, his Honour also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… in view of the commission of these offences it seems to me that I ought to take into account, as an aggravating feature, the fact of your prior criminal history. It indicates quite clearly that you are aware of the consequences of committing such offences. It is therefore a record which does not allow the Court to extend any leniency.” 
        
       
      
    13 The sentencing judge gave consideration to relevant subjective matters. These included a report from a psychologist, Anna Robilliard, which concluded that the applicant does not suffer any psychological dysfunction and is at an age and stage in life where the more active elements of anti-social personality tend to remit. She found that the applicant is committed to his current partner and their two children. The psychologist records that the applicant was sincerely remorseful.  
     
      
    14 Notwithstanding the advice from Ms Robilliard the sentencing judge found that although the applicant had expressed remorse “that is not a particularly mitigating factor as it does not indicate any particular remorse for the offence committed, but rather indicates only that you feel sorry for the circumstances that you have got yourself into by reason of the commission of the offence.” 
     
      
    15 His Honour also had a report in relation to the applicant’s partner, Ms Anita Ciancio, who was aged 27 at the date of sentence. She has the care of their two young daughters and was the victim of an assault and kidnapping of the daughter Montana. Ms Ciancio was severely traumatised and apparently became fearful of strangers, of being away from home and of hearing sudden or loud noises. She has become hyper-vigilant and experiences problems sleeping, including nightmares, and her eating patterns have changed. A psychological report on Ms Ciancio indicates that her recovery from the trauma is being hindered by the applicant’s absence which she finds very distressing. 
     
      
    16 In relation to these matters his Honour concluded that although the applicant’s “family circumstances are more difficult and perhaps considerably more difficult than many of the families whose husbands, fathers and other relatives are imprisoned, it does not amount to hardship in the sense referred to in the authorities which would justify any appreciable mitigation of sentence.” Nevertheless his Honour indicated that he would take that matter into account. His Honour also indicated that he would have regard to the fact that the applicant will spend at least part orf his prison sentence in New South Wales prisons away from Victoria and in particular, Melbourne where his family reside. 
     
      
    17 The evidence before the sentencing judge indicated that the applicant had committed the offences because of financial and other pressures from his family. He has a history of prior relationships and has financial responsibilities for a number of children. Having regard to the conclusion he had expressed in relation to the matter of remorse and conscious that the offences had been committed because of family pressures, his Honour expressed doubts as to whether the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour noted that the applicant was 48 years of age and although the evidence suggested that persons generally reduce their criminal activity as they age, his Honour concluded that “whether you decide to rehabilitate yourself is yet to be seen.” 
     
      
    18 His Honour accepted that the applicant had pleaded guilty to this offence at the earliest opportunity. This was of course, true but only because, following negotiations in relation to another charge, the applicant was offered the opportunity to plead to the offence for which he was then being sentenced. His Honour accepted that the plea entitled the applicant to a reduction of 25% having regard to its utilitarian value. To my mind that conclusion was generous. 
     
      
    19 His Honour also had before him the remarks on sentence of Stewart ADCJ in the matter of Kavanagh. Stewart ADCJ imposed a suspended two year prison term. His Honour was satisfied that there was no question of parity with Kavanagh. 
     
      
    20 His Honour also had the remarks on sentence of his son Pasquale Barbaro who was sentenced by Sides DCJ on 30 September 2004. He was sentenced in respect of a number of offences of which the matters involving the applicant were only two. In respect of those matters Pasquale Barbaro was sentenced to six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years and in relation to the Form 1 matter was sentenced to imprisonment for 4½ years with a non-parole period of three years. Sides DCJ made the sentences for those matters and a number of other offences partially concurrent and partially cumulative with the effect that Pasquale Barbaro was sentenced to a head sentence of nine years with a non-parole period of six years. 
     
      
    21 The sentencing judge recognised differences between the applicant and his son. Pasquale Barbaro had no prior convictions for like matters although he did have an extensive criminal record. At the time of the commission of the offences Pasquale was on bail for offences in the Australian Capital Territory and Sides DCJ concluded that the offences that were revealed suggested a significant involvement in the drug trade. 
     
      
    22 The sentencing judge accepted that the overall criminal culpability of the applicant was less than that demonstrated by his son but that in relation to the particular offences their criminal culpability was equivalent. 
     
      
    23 In relation to the matter on the Form 1 the sentencing judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Court of Criminal Appeal has said in respect to matters to be taken into account on a Form One that where the offence or offences are serious the penalty imposed should reflect an increase over and above that which would have been appropriate had the Form One offence not been taken into account. I intend to implement that principle.” 
        
       
      
    24 His Honour indicated that but for the plea of guilty the starting point for the non-parole period which he would have imposed was six years imprisonment with a head sentence of eight years. Having regard to the plea of guilty his Honour imposed a non-parole period of four years and six months with an overall term of six years. 
     
      
    25 There are five grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in treating the applicant’s criminal history as an “aggravating feature” 
       
      
    26 I have related the sentencing judge’s remarks in relation to the previous offences. 
     
      
    27 There are now a number of decisions which have discussed potential problems with the correct application of s 21A(2)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. That section provides that an aggravating factor to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence includes “the offender has a record of previous convictions.” 
     
      
    28 The difficulty identified in some decisions is the effective reconciliation of that requirement with subs (4) which provides that “the Court is not to have regard to any such aggravating … factor in sentencing if it would be contrary to any Act or rule of law to do so.” 
     
      
    29 I discussed these difficulties in R v Hathaway [2005] NSWCCA 368. I need not repeat that discussion in these reasons but note that a five member bench has been convened later this month to consider the issues. 
     
      
    30 The applicant submitted that his Honour’s reference to the criminal history as an “aggravating feature” is in error because of the manner in which some decisions of this Court have confined the influence which a prior criminal record may have in the sentencing process. In R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193 Howie J indicated that the impact of s 21A(4) was to confine the relevance of a prior criminal record to the common law rule which is “that the prior record does not have the effect of aggravating an offence but it may either deprive the offender of leniency or indicate that more weight is to be given to retribution, personal deterrence and protection of the community.” 
     
      
    31 Whatever be the ultimate resolution of the role which s 21A(2)(d) in the sentencing process I am not persuaded that in the present case his Honour has erred. Although his Honour remarked that he would have regard to prior offences as an aggravating feature, his Honour confined its influence to being “a record which does not allow the court to extend any leniency.” In this respect, whatever the correct understanding of s 21A(2)(d) his Honour has not fallen into error. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in his application of parity as it related to the sentences imposed on Pasquale Barbaro 
       
      
    32 His Honour expressly acknowledged that when sentencing the applicant he intended to ensure parity between the sentence he imposed and that which was imposed on his son, Pasquale Barbaro. As I have indicated Pasquale was sentenced for a number of matters which included the matter for which the applicant was sentenced and the count on the Form 1. The applicant received exactly the same head sentence as his son received in relation to one only of the matters for which the latter was sentenced, being count 3. On that matter Pasquale received a term of imprisonment of six years with a fixed non-parole period of three years. The ultimate sentence imposed on the applicant maintained a head sentence of six years but imposed a non-parole period of 4½ years. Of course, when sentencing the applicant, his Honour had regard to the matter on the Form 1 and also to the applicant’s prior criminal history. 
     
      
    33 The overall sentence imposed on Pasquale was significantly greater than that imposed on the applicant, the head sentence being nine years with an effective non-parole period of six years. Although the son was sentenced for a greater number of offences, in my opinion, his Honour was correct to mark out the sentence imposed on the applicant by reference to the sentences imposed on his son in relation to the same matters. I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed on the applicant was in any way disproportionate to that imposed on his son: (see Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 301-302) or that the applicant is entitled to maintain a justifiable grievance. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred in how he dealt with the offence on the schedule 
       
      
    34 As I have related, the sentencing judge said when considering the matter on the Form 1: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Court of Criminal Appeal has said in respect to matters to be taken into account on a Form One that where the offence or offences are serious the penalty imposed should reflect an increase over and above that which would have been appropriate had the Form One offence not been taken into account. I intend to implement this principle.” 
        
       
      
    35 The applicant’s complaint is that his Honour has not made clear the principles which he applied when giving consideration to the Form 1. The statement that the sentence should reflect an increase is said to be a statement devoid of principle. It is submitted that his Honour may have thought that he was sentencing for both offences. 
     
      
    36 In Attorney-General’s Application Under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 this Court identified and explained the principles which are appropriate when a court is sentencing, having regard to a matter on a Form One. Spigelman CJ said at 159: 
     
      
       
        
        “The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community’s entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they might otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express provision in s 33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle totality is another.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        The manner and degree to which the form on offences can impinge upon elements relevant to sentencing for the principle offence will depend on a range of other factors pertinent to those elements and the weight to be given to them in the overall sentencing task. For that reason it will rarely be appropriate for a sentencing judge to attempt to quantify the effect of the sentence of taking into account Form One offences.” 
        
       
      
    37 Further, at 162: 
     
      
       
        
        “The effect of inclusion on a Form 1 is to give the offences so included a significantly lower salience in the sentencing process. There will be an obvious advantage, and hence a greater incentive to admit guilt, where the Form 1 procedure is employed. In my opinion, the issues that arise are broadly equivalent to those involved in the Crown deciding not to prosecute for the full range of offences open to it or to accept a plea to a lesser charge, albeit in the context of multiple, and often divergent, criminal offences.  
         
         
        By reason of the express statutory power, a sentencing judge must assess whether it is appropriate to proceed to sentence on a basis where no separate penalty is to be imposed for admitted offences. There will be cases in which, for example, the administration of justice could be brought into disrepute by the court proceeding to sentence a person guilty of a course of criminal conduct on a manifestly inadequate, unduly narrow or artificial basis. I do not intend the previous sentence to constitute a comprehensive statement of the circumstances in which the broad discretion vested in the sentencing judge by s 33(1)(b) can be exercised. Nevertheless, the role of the Court must be constrained, to ensure that the independence of the judicial office in an adversary system is protected. (Cf  
        Maxwell v The Queen (1995)  
        184 CLR 501 
        at 513–514 and 534–535 
        .)  
         
         
        Striking the appropriate balance between overloading an indictment and ensuring that the indictment — leading to conviction and to sentence for, and only for, matters on the indictment — adequately reflects the totality of the admitted criminality, is primarily a matter for the Crown. The decision of the Crown in this regard will, no doubt, be guided by the determination in this case that, when matters are ""taken into account"" on a Form 1, the sentencing judge does not, in any sense, impose sentences for those offences. “ 
        
       
      
    38 Although the sentencing judge in the present matter did not explain in any detail how he proposed to incorporate consideration of the Form One in the ultimate sentence, I am not persuaded that error has occurred. His Honour correctly identified that when having regard to matters on a Form 1 it may be expected that the sentence will be increased above that which would otherwise have been appropriate. In formulating the task in this way I am satisfied that his Honour had in mind the appropriate elements identified by the Chief Justice in the guideline judgment which I have referred to above. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: The sentencing judge gave insufficient weight to the circumstances flowing from the kidnapping of the applicant’s daughter 
       
      
    39 I am satisfied, as was the sentencing judge, that the applicant’s partner and his children have suffered significantly from the kidnapping of their daughter. His Honour said that he would have regard to these matters and also take into account that the applicant would be required to serve part of his sentence in New South Wales when his family were living in Melbourne. However, I am not satisfied that the circumstances were such as to require a finding of exceptional circumstances justifying particular leniency in the sentencing process: (see R v Edwards (1996) 98 A Crim R 510). 
     
      
    40 Furthermore, the Court has today been informed that the applicant has now been moved to Victoria, where he continues to serve the current sentence, which thereby ameliorates the impact of the geographical separation from his family. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: The sentence is manifestly excessive 
       
      
    41 I am not persuaded that the sentence which his Honour imposed was excessive. The offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty related to an amount of drug, “close to 250 grams” which was an indictable amount, although just under the commercial quantity. The matter on the Form One was also a serious offence and his Honour was required to have appropriate regard to the applicant’s criminal history. Apart from the need to punish the applicant, it was necessary for the sentence to adequately meet the obvious need for personal deterrence and the protection of the community. 
     
      
    42 As I have already indicated, although the sentencing judge found that the applicant was entitled to a discount of 25% for the utilitarian value of his plea, it was not appropriate, in my opinion, to find that he pleaded guilty “at the earliest opportunity.” He bargained to that position and a discount of no more than 20% as was applied by Sides DCJ when sentencing his son was well within the appropriate range. 
     
      
    43 I am not persuaded that any sentence other than that which was imposed was appropriate. 
     
      
    44 Although I would grant leave to appeal I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    45 HALL J: I agree. 
     
      
    46 LATHAM J: I also agree. 
     
      
    47 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: Accordingly, the orders of the court are as I have indicated.

    2 SIMPSON, J: I agree with Hall, J. 
     
      
    3 HALL, J: On 6 October 2005, the Director of Public Prosecutions filed a notice of appeal pursuant to s.5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 in respect of a sentence imposed by the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney on 8 September 2005. On that date, the respondent, Kevin Smith, appeared for sentence on a charge of supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (“ecstasy”) on 26 October 2004 to which charge he had pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    4 The respondent was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of two years, with a non-parole period of one year, to date from 26 January 2005. The stated ground relied upon was that the sentence is manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
       
      Factual circumstances 
       
      
    5 The charge was one pursuant to s.25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The maximum penalty for an offence under that section was imprisonment for 20 years and/or a fine of 3,500 penalty units ($385,000). 
     
      
    6 The respondent had been committed for sentence to the District Court on 7 March 2005 from the Burwood Local Court. 
     
      
    7 On 20 May 2005, an application was made to join the respondent’s proceedings with his co-offender Fang Li He. The proceedings were accordingly stood over until 21 July 2005 to be heard with the proceedings against He. 
     
      
    8 The proceedings were subsequently again stood over on 21 July 2005 to 5 August 2005 and subsequently again until 26 August 2005. 
     
      
    9 On 26 August 2005, evidence was tendered at the sentencing hearing. The respondent did not give evidence. The proceedings were adjourned until 8 September 2005 for sentence to be delivered on that date. 
     
      
       
      The sentence 
       
      
    10 On 8 September 2005, the respondent was sentenced to a non-parole period of 12 months to date from 26 January 2005 and to expire on 25 January 2006 with a parole period to expire on 25 January 2007. The respondent was accordingly sentenced to a total period of two years. 
     
      
       
      Prior sentences 
       
      
    11 The respondent had been previously sentenced in relation to three supply prohibited drug charges at the Bidura Children’s Court. The terms of the sentence were as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        Sentence 1: Three months full-time detention to date from 26 October 2004 and to expire on 25 January 2005; 
        
       
       
        
        Sentence 2: Four months full-time detention to date from 26 January 2005 and to expire on 25 May 2005; and 
        
       
       
        
        Sentence 3: 18 months probation (to be of good behaviour and to follow directions of the Probation and Parole Service, especially in relation to drug and alcohol counselling). 
        
       
      
    12 The period of pre-sentence custody served by the respondent in relation to the offence of 26 October 2004 was 207 days commencing on 26 October 2004. However the custodial sentences that he had been given for the three supply charges in Bidura Children’s Court commenced to run from the time that he was arrested for the offence the subject of the appeal. 
     
      
       
      Factual matters 
       
      
    13 The following summary of facts is taken from the Crown’s written submissions which were based on the sentencing judge’s findings of fact and were not disputed on this application. 
     
      
       
        
        1. A taskforce was directed at suspects in Burwood and Botany. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Telephone intercepts confirmed that the respondent was involved in the supply of prohibited drugs in association with He. 
        
       
       
        
        3. On 26 October 2004, police undertook surveillance and saw the respondent and He in a motor vehicle and followed them to the McDonalds Restaurant at Strathfield where they parked the car. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The co-offender, Chin, approached the parked car and engaged in a transaction from that car. 
        
       
       
        
        5. Police then approached Chin and his girlfriend in their car whereupon the girlfriend threw something out of the car window. 
        
       
       
        
        6. The “something” was recovered and later analysed to be 160 grams of ecstasy – approximately 500 pink tablets of MDMA embossed with a star. 
        
       
       
        
        7. The respondent’s car drove off but was pursued by police and the occupants were arrested driving through Homebush. 
        
       
      
    14 The sentencing judge observed that the relevant sequence of events established that the respondent and one or more others were involved as sellers of quantities of drugs, obviously for more senior people in the drug business. His role, it was observed on the facts presented to the Court, was not quite that of a street runner “but he was limited in his capacity to supply drugs” (remarks on sentence, p.1). This finding was supported by a transcript of communications on 26 August 2004 between the respondent and an undercover operative. 
     
      
    15 In the remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge noted that this transcript of the conversation comprehensively proved the respondent’s drug dealing and that the police had in fact already conducted a few deals, unbeknown to the respondent, with him in their undercover capacity. 
     
      
    16 The sentencing judge observed in this regard “this of course is not a charge under s.25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, but it has something of that quality” (remarks on sentence, p.3). That provision, of course, is concerned with an offence of supplying prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis as specified in that section. 
     
      
       
      Aggravating factors 
       
      
    17 The remarks on sentence dealt with aggravating factors in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In terms of aggravating factors, the offence was committed in company, which is relevant in that it bears upon another aggravating feature, that it was part of a planned organised criminal activity. I should say, however, that it was not very organised; it was not high level. Nonetheless, those are considerations of aggravation. 
        
       
       
      Mitigating factors 
       
      
    18 The circumstances of mitigation as recorded in the remarks on sentence were as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The offence was committed some five days after the respondent had attained his 18th birthday. 
       
       
      (b) The absence of any significant related criminal record (it being noted that the criminal record that he did have was, in effect, related to the sequence of events that gave rise to the episode in the McDonalds carpark on 26 October 2004). 
       
       
      (c) The respondent’s reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. 
       
       
      (d) Remorse or contrition as demonstrated by the early plea of guilty. 
       
       
      (e) That as a juvenile bordering into adulthood, the respondent was not as fully aware of the consequences of his behaviour as he might have been had he been older. 
       
      
    19 The sentencing judge referred to a psychological report prepared by Mr. Taylor. The report contains background material in relation to the respondent including his migration to Australia from China. The sentencing judge observed that the offences appear to have occurred because of the disruption from his migration as well as from family disruption, all of which had caused him to fall into the “wrong company”. 
     
      
       
      The ground of appeal – manifestly inadequate sentence 
       
      
    20 In the written submissions for the Crown, it is submitted that the sentence is manifestly inadequate, the substantial proposition being that the objective seriousness of the offence was so great that the sentence handed down did not reflect the criminality involved. 
     
      
    21 The Crown observed that the offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years, the amount involved being not less than the commercial quantity, namely, 0.125 kilograms, and the amount involved, in this case, being 160 grams. 
     
      
    22 The Crown’s further submissions included the following points:- 
     
      
       
      (a) This Court has, on occasions, treated the drug as a mid-range drug:  
      Regina v. Bimahendali 
       [1999] NSWCCA 409 at [14]. However, Wood, CJ. at CL. in that case at [17] observed that the best guide is that given by the legislature as to the available penalty, dependent upon whether the drug in question is more or less than the traffickable or commercial quantity prescribed. 
       
       
      (b) In  
      Regina v. Dang 
       [2005] NSWCCA 430, Howie, J., with whom Studdert, and Whealy, JJ. agreed, stated:- 
       
       
        
         
          
          “… this Court no longer approaches the evaluation of the seriousness of a particular supply offence by distinguishing between different types of drugs according to the perceived dangerousness of the drug being supplied. Rather, the Court has stressed that the appropriate consideration is the relevant statutory regime and the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence:  
          Regina v. Nai Poon 
           (2003) 56 NSWLR 284;  
          Regina v. Neale 
           (2004) 138 A. Crim. R. 493.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (c) Accordingly, in determining the proper penalty, the fundamental consideration is the degree by which, having regard to the maximum penalties provided by the Act, the respondent’s conduct would offend against the legislative objective of suppressing the illicit traffic in the prohibited drug:  
      Regina v. Peel 
       (1971) 1 NSWLR 247 at 252. 
       
       
      (d) The seriousness of the respondent’s offending is to be judged by reference to the relevant statutory criteria and the sentence to be imposed is required to take into account the purposes which sentencing is intended to serve: see s.3A of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
      . 
       
      
    23 The Crown accordingly submitted that the sentencing judge gave insufficient weight to:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The elements of both specific and general deterrence. 
       
       
      (b) The legislative intention in relation to these types of offences. 
       
       
      (c) The protection of the community. 
       
      
    24 The Crown further contended that undue weight was given to the respondent’s subjective features. 
     
      
       
      The decision in Regina v. Harmouche 
       
      
    25 In oral submissions the Crown cited this Court’s decision in Regina v. Harmouche [2005] NSWCCA 398. The facts in that case may be shortly stated. The respondent was charged pursuant to s.25(1) of the Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act 1985. Between 17 January 2002 and 13 February 2002, he either offered or agreed to supply a total quantity of cocaine in the region of 200 grams. He was on bail at the time of the offence. This is one point of distinction to the present case. The estimated street value of the 200 grams of cocaine was $66,666. The respondent was 19 years of age at the date of the offence, having been born on 14 September 1982. The bail that had been granted on 31 October 2001 related to charges of two offences of supply or knowingly taking part in supply of cocaine. The offence charged under s.25(1) rendered the respondent liable to imprisonment for 15 years and a fine equivalent to 2,000 penalty units.  
     
      
    26 There were some factual circumstances that were similar to the present case. These included:- 
     
      
       
      • The respondent’s role as a re-seller, rather than that of a principal or organiser of others or a financier. He was above the level of a street dealer, but, given the fact that the case had proceeded on the basis of a particular amount being supplied, Hulme, J. (with whom Sully and Latham, JJ. agreed) at [34] stated that these facts did not matter much. 
       
       
      • The respondent’s role included the fact that he (or others who were willing to do the same), was an essential cog in the distribution of cocaine to those whose lives it was likely to damage and to the reaping of profits by those who put such profits ahead of the welfare of others and the requirements of the law. 
       
       
      • The offending was not the result of some momentary weakness or temptation. The agreed facts and the transcripts made it clear that the offending involved considered, deliberate criminality, day after day for some time. Again, there is a similarity in this respect to the facts of the present matter. 
       
       
      • There was evidence from forensic psychologists that the respondent had been raised in a fairly dysfunctional home. In this respect, there is again some similarity to the present case. 
       
       
      • The respondent was aged 19 years at the date of the offence and had commenced using cocaine when he was 18 or 19. The respondent was accordingly approximately 18 months older than the respondent in the present case. 
       
      
    27 In Harmouche (supra), Hulme, J. at [37] referred to Regina v. Peel (1971) 1 NSWLR 247 at 268 in which it was said that “in determining the proper penalty … the fundamental consideration is rather the degree by which, having regard to the maximum penalties provided by the Act in question, the respondent’s conduct would offend against the legislative objective of suppressing the illicit traffic in the prohibited drug”. Hulme, J. went on to state:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… where does the respondent’s offending lie in the scale of criminality envisaged by the statutory provision here relevant? Clearly it does not lie at the top. But when regard is had to activity, quantity, knowledge, deliberateness and role, his offending is a long, long way from the bottom of that scale. And this is so even without the aggravating feature of his offending having occurred while he was on bail.” 
        
       
      
    28 This Court in Harmouche (supra) held that the sentencing judge was entitled to give some weight to the factors of an early plea, delay and youth but that he had allowed the subjective features of the case to overshadow the seriousness of the respondent’s offence (at [53]). It was observed that very little attention was given to the respondent’s criminality and that the sentence imposed contained no, or almost no, significant element of general deterrence or of retribution. This Court accordingly held that it was manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    29 In Harmouche (supra), the Court observed at [69] that apart from the respondent’s activity, his knowledge, the deliberateness and the duration of his offending, his role and the quantity of drugs involved, there were additionally the factors that the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity and the fact that it was committed in company. The latter factor, it was thought, may be a necessary component, if not an element of the offence of supply and to that extent it was not a factor which would increase the sentence on account of it. However, the Court noted that it was clear that the company extended further than this and, subject to a specified reservation referred to in the judgment, regarded the s.21A matters in the case, in the context of drug supply, as meriting a heavier sentence than otherwise. 
     
      
    30 Finally, in Harmouche, the Court stated that the fact that the offence was committed whilst on bail would also lead to an increase in the sentence beyond that otherwise appropriate and in this respect referred to Regina v. Readman (1990) 47 A. Crim. R. 181; Regina v. Chang [2003] NSWCCA 2327 and Regina v. Huynh [2003] NSWCCA 239. 
     
      
    31 The sentence imposed of two years and six months including a non-parole period of one year and three months, which was directed to be served by way of periodic detention was quashed. The respondent was re-sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of two years and 134 days (or approximately four months) commencing on 8 June 2005 with a balance of term of one year. 
     
      
    32 Ms. Francis of counsel, who appeared on behalf of the respondent contended that the following were important points of distinction between Harmouche and the present case:- 
     
      
       
      • The amount of drugs was higher (in the  
      “region” 
       of 200 grams of cocaine). 
       
       
      • The fact that Harmouche was on bail at the time of the offence in question, whereas in this case the respondent had no criminal record. 
       
       
      • The fact that he had been charged some months before with unrelated matters (the charges, however, were later dismissed). 
       
       
      • The role of the offender, Harmouche, was said to be higher and that there was a degree of sophistication in his offending. 
       
      
    33 The objective seriousness of the offence in this case received limited reference in the remarks on sentence beyond the extract set out above. In that respect, reference is made in particular to the following:- 
     
      
       
      • The assessment of the respondent as not quite a street runner but a seller for more senior people with a limitation on his capacity to supply drugs (p.1). 
       
       
      • That the commercial amount of the drug and the nature of it was the centre of the charge (p.2). 
       
       
      • The transcripts of the conversation with the undercover operative comprehensively proved his drug dealing and his involvement in the earlier transactions. 
       
       
      • The aggravating factors included the fact that it was part of a planned or organised criminal activity but that it was not a very organised one and it was not at a high level. 
       
      
    34 If consideration was in fact given to maximum penalties provided by the Act and the respondent’s conduct offended against the legislative objectives, then such consideration is not reflected in the remarks on sentence. Nor is there reference to the issues as to the deliberate nature of the offending nor to the factors relevant to general and specific deterrence, having regard to the nature of the offence under s.25(2). 
     
      
    35 Whist a judgment of this Court in one case does not set a standard to be applied in like cases, it is of course relevant in evaluating the criminality in similar cases involving young offenders who traffic in prohibited drugs. The Court in Harmouche did consider a number of important factors relating to young offenders who are involved in the re-selling of prohibited drugs as essential participants in organised drug trading. This Court has emphasised the importance of consistency in sentencing and it is therefore important, in my opinion, to identify relevant factors and the approach to be taken in cases of the kind here in question. Cases involving drug trafficking, generally speaking, require the imposition of sentences that properly give effect to considerations of general and specific deterrence and whilst there will, of course, in appropriate cases be room for leniency where the circumstances warrant it, that will only arise after due and proper consideration and weight has been given to the objective seriousness of the criminality involved in the offending conduct. 
     
      
       
       
      Principles in relation to the determination of a Crown appeal against sentence 
       
      
    36 The principles in relation to the determination of Crown appeals against sentence are well-known and have been summarised by Wood, CJ. at CL. in Regina v. Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70]. The principles may be shortly stated as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The normal restriction upon appellate review of the exercise of a discretion as set out in  
      House v. The King 
       (1936) 55 CLR 499 applies to Crown appeals against sentence. 
       
       
      (b) Appeals by the Crown should generally be rare and unless there is a clear error of principle identified, it should be exceptional for the Court to interfere. 
       
       
      (c) A Crown appeal against sentencing is concerned with establishing matters of principle but the power extends to doing what is necessary to avoid any manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing, that is, where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand. 
       
       
      (d) The Court has a lively discretion to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown, and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it should have regard to the double jeopardy that a convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal. 
       
       
      (e) The sentence which is imposed as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal will generally be less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court and more generally be towards the lower end of the available range of sentence. 
       
      
    37 The respondent has submitted that there is no error of principle involved in the sentence determination in this case and that being so, it would be exceptional for this Court to interfere and on any basis this case cannot be said to be an exceptional one. 
     
      
    38 In the respondent’s submissions, three matters in particular were identified:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The sentence is to be read as incorporating a 25% discount for an early plea of guilty. On that basis, this gives rise to a starting point in excess of two years and six months. 
       
       
      (b) Additionally, bringing into account the period spent in custody from the date of arrest on 26 October 2004, the sentence represents an overall starting point of greater than two years and nine months full-time imprisonment. 
       
       
      (c) The sentence was ordered to be served cumulatively upon a three month control order imposed in the Children’s Court for an offence of supply prohibited drugs. 
       
      
    39 Each of these matters are important in determining whether this Court should intervene. 
     
      
    40 The respondent also argues that the sentencing judge was entitled to have regard to subjective matters including, in particular, the respondent’s age and the fact that he was a juvenile when he had committed the earlier offences. That is undoubtedly so. 
     
      
    41 In addition, I accept that other matters which were taken into account, namely, the respondent’s somewhat dysfunctional family upbringing, the fact that he left home at 16 years of age and that there was a basis for accepting that he had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation were all matters to be taken into account in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    42 In the respondent’s submissions, the sentence imposed was neither unreasonable or plainly unjust or manifestly wrong nor could it be said to be so disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime as to shock the public conscience. It is contended for the respondent that the sentence imposed fell within the range available to the sentencing judge. 
     
      
       
      Analysis 
       
      
    43 Whilst it can undoubtedly be said that the sentence imposed was lenient, the question remains as to whether or not appealable error has occurred in the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion or, alternatively expressed, whether the sentence was so low as to be manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    44 In resolving this question, I consider the following matters to be relevant:- 
     
      
       
      • The seriousness of the offence under s.25(2) of the  
      Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act 1985 
       warrants a sentence which properly recognises the criminality involved. Sentencing in respect of such offences must give effect to principles of general and specific deterrence for the reasons stated in  
      Harmouche 
      . 
       
       
      • The relevant circumstances which the sentencing judge was required to consider in terms of objective criminality and subjective factors would, I believe, indicate that a non-parole period of 12 months and a balance of term of 12 months could hardly give effect to the principle of general deterrence. 
       
       
      • The imposition of a one year non-parole period with a balance of term of one year, notwithstanding that the respondent was barely 18 at the time of the offence, can hardly represent the taking of a very firm stand against the evils of the drug trade. It has frequently been recognised that courts, including this court, must take a very firm stand in sentencing for drug offences:  
      Regina v. Collins 
       [2000] NSWCCA 236 at [15];  
      Regina v. O’Brien & Anor 
       (CCA, unreported 23 August 1989);  
      Regina v. Wong & Ng 
       (1988) 39 A. Crim. R. 1 at 3. 
       
       
      • Whilst I consider the sentence to be manifestly inadequate, nevertheless, having regard to the constraining principle (e) derived by me from Wood, CJ. at CL. in  
      Wall 
       (supra), the sentence which this Court should impose if it were to re-sentence would be no longer than a few months more than that imposed by the sentencing judge. 
       
       
      
    45 A further factor that must be brought into account is the fact, as previously stated, that the non-parole period of one year imposed upon the respondent expired on 25 January 2006. The affidavit of the respondent sworn 16 February 2006 establishes that the respondent has been released from custody and that since his release he has commenced work as a waiter four days a week and the respondent has stated that he has not had any contact with any former associates. Although, in some cases, the circumstance that the respondent to a Crown appeal is no longer in custody will not prevent the Crown appeal from succeeding, in many cases it is likely to be of some importance in the exercise by the Court of Criminal Appeal of its residual discretion. 
     
      
    46 In Regina v. MD, BM, NA, JT [2005] NSWCCA 242, the Court at [106] stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Of particular significance to the determination of the appeal is the fact that, because he was taken into custody on 3 January 2003, JT’s sentence expires on 3 October 2005. In these circumstances, if the appeal were upheld and he were to be re-sentenced, any further term would impose a significantly greater burden on him than if a longer sentence had been imposed initially. This is a very significant matter to be weighed in the exercise of discretion where the respondent is a young man of no prior convictions serving his first sentence in custody. Notwithstanding the gravity of the offence, such an additional punishment could not be justified in all the circumstances of this case.” 
        
       
      
    47 Whilst this observation was made in a factual context which is not identical to the present, it nonetheless emphases that given the fact that the applicant has already been released from custody, the Court must have some regard to the significantly greater burden that would be imposed by requiring him to return to custody. 
     
      
    48 Whilst I am of the opinion that the sentence is manifestly inadequate, the question arises as to whether, in the circumstances identified above, the Court should in its discretion intervene to correct the sentence. I do not consider intervention is warranted in circumstances in which, for reasons earlier stated, the Court would be limited in the extent to which it could increase the sentence and that to do so would impose an undue burden upon the respondent, he having been released from custody. 
     
      
    49 I accordingly would dismiss the appeal.

      Introduction 
       
      
    3 The applicant pleaded guilty to 3 counts that he did on 28 June 2004 supply a prohibited drug contrary to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (‘the Act’) s 25. 
     
      
    4 The counts related to cannabis (count 1), methylamphetamine (count 2) and methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (count 3). The drugs were discovered in a unit rented by the applicant during the execution of a warrant by police on 28 June 2004. 
     
      
    5 The maximum penalty is ten years imprisonment or a fine of 2000 penalty units or both (count 1) and 15 years imprisonment or a fine of 2000 penalty units or both (counts 2 and 3 - s 32(1) of the Act). 
     
      
    6 On 11 August 2005 Judge Black QC sentenced the applicant in the District Court in respect of the three counts to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 15 months commencing on 11 August 2005 with the balance of the sentence of 15 months to date from 10 November 2006 and expire on 10 February 2008. 
     
      
    7 The applicant has sought leave to appeal against the sentence. Two grounds were argued on the appeal. Firstly that the circumstances of the case were so exceptional that his Honour must necessarily have erred in imposing a full time custodial sentence or, alternatively, if it had been open to his Honour to impose a custodial sentence, the custodial sentence imposed by his Honour was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      Discussion 
       
      
    8 The applicant had a strong subjective case. In particular he had, for a lengthy period, engaged in voluntary work in his local community. This had been largely as a facilitator of youth events relating to surfing and skateboarding. He had been instrumental in lobbying the local council for a skateboard park. He had come to the attention of the former mayor, Mr Moore. Mr Moore gave evidence on his behalf, praising his inherent qualities, community involvement and expressing optimism for his future and that his engagement in youth work in the community would continue. The applicant had had a drug problem. He sought assistance himself for that problem and had successfully completed a MERIT course. The applicant gave evidence, as to which he was not cross-examined, that he was in employment and was conducting a small business. He expressed his remorse for what had occurred and his positive state of mind for the future.9 His Honour approached the sentencing task in a conventional manner. He made a number of findings as to the applicant’s subjective case. In particular he noted in his remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        a) The applicant had no previous convictions; 
        
       
       
        
        b) He had shown remorse by his pleas and entering into the MERIT programme; 
        
       
       
        
        c) His successful involvement in that programme; 
        
       
       
        
        d) That in the past he had shown he was capable of, and did, contribute significantly to the welfare of the community and there were real prospects he could contribute to the community in the future; 
        
       
       
        
        e) A former mayor and community relations officer gave evidence highly commendatory of the applicant, expressed optimism for his future and that he may contribute to the community once again; 
        
       
       
        
        f) He was unlikely to re-offend; 
        
       
       
        
        g) He has and continues to have good prospects of rehabilitation; 
        
       
       
        
        h) He displayed courage in giving evidence at the sentencing hearing; 
        
       
       
        
        i) He pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. 
        
       
      
    10 The applicant has submitted that his Honour erred in that he did not refer in his remarks on sentence to the fact that the applicant was not cross examined on his evidence, had obtained employment and had set up his own small business, was ashamed of his actions, that he had initiated his attendance in the MERIT program and that his Honour had not referred to the report of the psychiatrist or to the opinion of the psychiatrist and Mr Moore that a non custodial sentence was called for.  
     
      
    11 It is not necessary that every matter considered by a sentencing Judge be referred to in the remarks on sentence. As his Honour sentenced the applicant upon completion of the evidence and submissions he would undoubtedly have had the matters referred to in the preceding paragraph in mind at that time and, of course, the determination of the appropriate sentence is a matter for the sentencing Judge, not the witnesses. 
     
      
    12 His Honour gave the applicant credit for the subjective matters, but, as he said in his remarks on sentence, he had to also bear in mind “the other side of the coin”. 
     
      
    13 On “the other side of the coin” was the fact that the applicant had pleaded guilty to the supply of prohibited drugs. Although there was no evidence of actual supply, supply was deemed pursuant to the operation of s 29 of the Act. The cannabis found was more than twice the trafficable quantity, the methylamphetamine was almost 50% more than the trafficable quantity and the methylenedioxymethylamphetamine was more than 14 times the trafficable quantity.  
     
      
    14 There was evidence the applicant had a significant drug problem at the time but, as his Honour observed, there had been no attempt to claim that the drugs were all in relation to some personal use or need or to otherwise attempt to reduce the severity of the offences.  
     
      
    15 As the applicant had pleaded guilty to a deemed supply of prohibited drugs it was not open to his Honour to deal with the matter on any basis other than that the applicant had the drugs in his possession for the purpose of supply. In this context it was observed by his Honour that the offences to which the applicant had pleaded guilty impact upon the very people in the community that the applicant had done so much to help in the past.  
     
      
    16 In the case of offences of supplying prohibited drugs the need for general deterrence is high. There is an established rule that for such offences a full time custodial sentence must follow unless exceptional circumstances can be shown – see Regina v Yerkovic [2000] NSWCCA 281 at [13], Regina v Ha [2004] NSWCCA 386 at [20] and the cases discussed therein. Periodic detention is not usually considered an appropriate sentence with prohibited drug supply offences. 
     
      
    17 His Honour referred to that principle. In doing so he referred to “particular circumstances” rather than “exceptional circumstances”. This was presumably but a slip of the tongue. If it was not, it would appear to connote a lesser test than that required by “exceptional circumstances”.18 His Honour discounted the sentence by 25% for the plea of guilty. He found special circumstances by reason particularly that it would be the applicant’s first sentence of imprisonment, and that he had exceptional prospects of continuing to contribute to the community. The finding of special circumstances was reflected in a significant variation of the statutory non-parole ratio. 
     
      
    19 It is apparent from the sentence imposed by his Honour that he concluded the applicant’s subjective case was not such as to overcome the need for general deterrence by way of a custodial sentence. In my opinion it was open to his Honour to so conclude. 20 As the High Court observed in Markarian v R [2005] 215 ALR 213 at 221: 
     
      
       
        
        … a court of criminal appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because the appellate court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised his or her discretion. 
        
       
      
    21 An appellate Court interferes only if it be shown that the sentencing judge was in error – R v Tait (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388, and then only if it forms the positive opinion that some other and more lenient sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed – R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [79]. 
     
      
    22 In the present case the decision that a custodial sentence was appropriate and the length of the sentence imposed represent the conclusion of an experienced District Court Judge who had the benefit, which this Court does not have, of hearing the applicant and his witness give evidence. In my opinion the sentence represents an exercise of the sentencing discretion which was open to his Honour and one with which this Court should not interfere. Accordingly, whilst I would grant leave to appeal, I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    23 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Leave to appeal granted. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Appeal dismissed.

    2 This Court has had many occasions to emphasise the statement by Mason J in Lowe v The Queen (1994) 154 CLR 606 at 610 that an appellate court can only intervene if the sentence of a co-offender engenders a “justifiable sense of grievance” (see R v Kelly (2005) 155 A Crim R 499 at 502-3 and at 513-4; R V Maherr (2005) 154 A Crim R 457 at 464-6; R v Wilkie (2003) 140 A Crim R 78 at 81; R v Chen (2003) 138 A Crim R 433 at 443; R v Inamata (2003) 137 A Crim R 510 at 523; R v Schultz [2002] NSWCCA 462; R v Ismunandar (2002) 136 A Crim R 206 at 215; R v Van Hoang (2002) 135 A Crim R 244 at 248; Man Kong Ho (2002) 133 A Crim R 340 at 350; Lim Yok Peng (2002) 130 A Crim R 293 at 298; MacDonnell (2002) 128 A Crim R 44 at 53 - 4; Halls and Halls (2002) 127 A Crim R 209 at 216; Richards (2001) 123 A Crim R 14 at 28; Cimone (2001) 121 A Crim R 433 at 437; Uzabeaga (2000) 119 A Crim R 452 at 459; Doan (2000) 115 A Crim R 497 at 500).  
     
      
    3 The sentence complained of must be such that there is an appearance of injustice to the “objective bystander.” In Liu v Regina [2005] NSWCCA 450 I said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although the High Court has stressed the need for consistency in punishment, particularly of co-offenders, this does not have the consequence that if in all the circumstances a co-offender should have received a greater sentence than the other offender, the latter may complain of a justifiable grievance requiring intervention by this Court. If the error has been made when sentencing another offender the co-offender’s grievance may not require the intervention of this Court.” 
        
       
      
    4 In the present case, as Smart AJ explains the applicant can point to the sentence of the co-offender De Marco and submit that having regard to their respective roles in the drug operation the applicant’s sentence should have been less than De Marco. 
     
      
    5 However, before he can sustain a justifiable sense of grievance this Court would need to be satisfied that the sentence imposed on De Marco was appropriate having regard to the offence for which he was being sentenced and the sentences imposed on the other co-offenders. 
     
      
    6 Having regard to his role in the enterprise the sentence imposed on De Marco was lenient to the point that the applicant’s complaint of a lack of parity has little substance. When consideration is given to the fact that the applicant was sentenced for multiple offences and, although a minor matter, consideration was also given to the matter on a Form 1 he cannot complain of a justifiable sense of grievance. 
     
      
    7 The sentencing judge said of the applicant that his “criminality is extensive and nothing other than a significant penalty of imprisonment is appropriate.”  
     
      
    8 In my opinion this finding is correct and no sentence other than that which his Honour imposed was required. 
     
      
    9 I agree with the orders proposed by Rothman J. 
     
      
    10 ROTHMAN J: Shannon James Bree seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed by His Honour Judge Woods QC DCJ on 15 October 2004, on the basis that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by virtue of the disparity between the sentences imposed upon him and those imposed upon his co-offenders.  
     
      
    11 The effective overall sentence imposed upon the applicant was a term of imprisonment of three and a half years non-parole period and a head sentence of four years and eight months. The sentences which bring about that aggregate were: 
     
      
       
      Count 1 and Count 2 
      : supply prohibited drug (ecstasy in the case of Count 1 and methylamphetamine in the case of Count 2) in each case by operation of s.29 of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 
      , a contravention of s.25(1) of that Act, which provides for a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and/or a $220,000 fine. The applicant was sentenced on each Count to a non-parole period of two years and three months to commence on 16 December 2003 and to expire on 15 March 2006. In each case there was fixed a parole period of nine months to commence on 16 March 2006 and to expire on 15 December 2006; a total term of three years.  
       
       
      Count 3 
      : Supply prohibited drug (cannabis, in the vicinity of 20kg) contrary to s.25(1) of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 
      , the date of offence being between 2 October 2002 and 16 October 2003, for which a maximum penalty is fixed of 10 years’ imprisonment and/or a $220,000 fine and for which the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a non-parole period of three years and six months to commence on 16 December 2003 and expire on 15 June 2007 and a parole period of 1 year and two months to commence on 16 June 2007 and expire on 15 August 2008, bringing about a total term of 4 years and 8 months. The sentence for the foregoing offence took into account a matter included on a Form 1, being goods in custody (date of offence: 21 October 2003) contrary to the  
      Crimes Act 1900 
      , s.527C for which there is a maximum penalty of 6 months’ imprisonment and/or a $550 fine.  
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    12 The applicant was charged with and pleaded guilty to trafficking in prohibited drugs, namely ecstasy, methylamphetamine and cannabis and, in the case of the cannabis, in an amount not more than the commercial quantity.  
     
      
    13 The applicant was a member of the Scott Syndicate. That syndicate was concerned with trafficking in cannabis. I take the facts from the sentencing judge’s remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Police in May 2003 searched premises of the offender, Shannon James Bree, at 5 Wentworth Street, Gunnedah. That was preceded by surveillance and on 13 May at 9.25 am police saw Bree drive into the driveway. He went inside for a short time and then returned to his car and then police spoke to him. He admitted possessing 6.8 grams of cannabis, he was arrested and cautioned. The search warrant was explained to him and the search was commenced. There were several large ugly dogs running around the place, one of them tied up – obviously, dogs designed to keep respectable citizenry away from the premises. He told police that it wasn’t his house but he owned the dogs and was attending the residence to feed them. He had a key to the premises, which were unoccupied. Inside the premises a lot of items relating to drugs were found – cannabis seeds, a bong, documents in the name of Brett BREE, the offender’s brother, hydroponic equipment which was not in use but none the less the offender admitted that the equipment was his. Resealable bags were found in the kitchen, a safe was found and seized. Digital scales were found, floor boards appeared to be loose and underneath the floor boards a vacuum sealed plastic bag was found with another bag in it containing a large amount of high quality cannabis. The offender said that he had seen it previously when the dogs had disturbed the loose floor. He said he replaced the cannabis back where he found it because he did not know who owned it. That bag contained approximately 485 grams of cannabis. Under further floor boards, there were two more heat sealed bags, similar in kind and in quantity of cannabis they contained. Police had the safe opened and the offender stated that he placed items in the safe before police attended the premises. He told police in an interview that he had been approached a number of weeks previously to supply the dogs for protection and he attended the house daily to feed the dogs. While in the house he looked at the freezer and saw a number of items inside: he found a plastic bag containing an amount of cannabis and two other resealable bags. He said that he saw beige powder and a bag of beige pills. He said he noticed a cupboard door containing the safe and the door of the safe open. He assumed the items in the freezer belonged in the safe so he placed them in the safe before closing the door. He said that the cannabis located in his pocket was going to be a gift to his girlfriend. The safe was opened, and contained a plastic bag of cannabis, 408 grams in weight, and other bags, one containing a number of white and beige coloured tablets and another bag containing 10 tablets. The offender stated he had also found those in the freezer but had forgotten about them. Those facts are relevantly the basis for counts on the indictment. …  
        
       
       
        
        … the offender Bree was involved with Scott. Scott was a major coordinator of an organised syndicate involved in the packaging and distribution of cannabis into New South Wales from South Australia. The cannabis was delivered into New South Wales by couriers who packed the cannabis into four storage compartments within the four wheel drive motor vehicle supplied by Scott. Those couriers had delivered to persons in New South Wales who in turn supplied it to Bree. Police investigations identified Bree receiving cannabis on a regular basis. He would take it from the man, De Marco, and return with it to Gunnedah to sell.  
        
       
       
        
        … Numerous telephone calls record conversations between Bree and Scott, conversations detailing when and how deposits of large sums of cash were made by Bree on a regular basis into back accounts in the name of Jason Scott’s wife, Melissa Robbins and another account in the name of Dubioso.  
        
       
       
        
        … Calls show that Bree paid Scott around $3,000 per pound of cannabis delivered. Banking records obtained for the period 2 October 2002 to 28 July 2003 show deposits and cash payments totalling in excess of $115,000. Shannon Bree, or his associates, made these deposits and/or cash payments to Jason Scott as payments for cannabis.  
        
       
       
        
        Based on the purchase price per pound, it is calculated (the Crown accepts and I will sentence on the basis) that the amount of cannabis purchased by Bree between 2 October 2002 and 16 October 2003 was in the vicinity of 20kg. This includes the period between 24 July 2003 and 16 October 2003 when Bree is recorded in conversations with Scott and his associates as having paid or owed Scott $115,800 for cannabis received. There is no doubt that Bree did, in fact, owe Scott the money: conversations indicate that.  
        
       
       
        
        On 21 October 2003, a search warrant was executed on premises associated with Shannon Bree in Gunnedah. $5,000 in cash was found and he gave no satisfactory explanation for that. There is no doubt that it was associated with drugs.  
        
       
       
        
        … As to the role played by Bree, it might be said that he was a franchisee in the syndicate in the town of Gunnedah. He was not one of the principals of this overall operations but nonetheless, so far as Gunnedah was concerned, he was the principal distributor for those above him in the chain. The criminality is extensive and nothing other than a significant penalty of imprisonment is appropriate.” 
        
       
      
    14 As can be seen from the above extensive quote, the applicant was engaged in a syndicate for the trafficking of drugs, which syndicate was substantial. The syndicate was essentially concerned with trafficking in cannabis and the offences in relation to ecstasy and amphetamine were offences detected as a result of the execution of the search warrant which was issued primarily for the purpose of obtaining evidence in relation to the cannabis syndicate.  
     
      
    15 As already stated, the fundamental issue raised by the applicant in this Court is the issue associated with parity. The sentences imposed on the offenders caught in the net of this investigation are as follows:

    16 For relevant purposes the co-accused Livas can be wholly discounted as relevant in this exercise. The evidence in relation to Mr Livas was that he was caught in the net during a particular purchase in circumstances where he otherwise had no connection with the syndicate (see Livas v R [2006] NSWCCA 54).  
     
      
       
      Principles applicable to Parity 
       
      
    17 As can be seen from the above table, his Honour Judge Woods QC DCJ sentenced five of the nine persons charged from material obtained in the investigation of the syndicate. Most relevantly, he sentenced the principal, Scott, and Mr De Marco as well as the current applicant. Indeed, the accused, Jason Scott, Shannon Bree and Eugene Vanderstaak were sentenced at the one time and the remarks on sentence, except where the sentencing judge expressly differentiated, relate to all of them. Mr De Marco was sentenced almost two months later. The major thrust of the argument of the applicant before this Court was that, especially by comparison with the sentence imposed on Mr De Marco, there is a justifiable sense of grievance in the applicant who received, relatively, a heavier sentence than was deserved.  
     
      
    18 The fact that De Marco was sentenced later in time than the applicant is not a bar to the application of parity principles to the applicant (see Jones v The Queen (1993) 67 ALJR 376 at 377). The parity principle recognises, in relation to sentencing, a consistent theme throughout the law. It recognises that equality, and the perception of equality, is a necessary concomitant of the objective application of law and principle. It applies in a number of areas. Applying the same principles of consistency of approach, the courts have held that unequal treatment of persons who are relevantly equal is discrimination. So, too, is the equal treatment of persons who are relevantly unequal. (see Waters v PTC (1992) 173 CLR 349 at 402, per McHugh J.) 
     
      
    19 The principle found expression as a recognised factor in fixing an appropriate sentence. The application of the principle requires that like should be treated alike and that, where there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them (see Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295, especially per Dawson and Gaudron JJ at [301]). 
     
      
    20 In Lowe v The Queen (1994) 154 CLR 606, Mason J (as he then was) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The justification which the courts assign for intervention in the case of disparity is that disparity engenders a justifiable sense of grievance in the applicant and an appearance of injustice to that impassive representative of the community, the objective bystander.” 
        
       
      
    21 Mason J had earlier said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Just as consistency in punishment – a reflection of the notion of equal justice – is a fundamental element in any rational and fair system of criminal justice, so inconsistency in punishment, because it is regarded as a badge of unfairness and unequal treatment under the law, is calculated to lead to an erosion of public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice. It is for this reason that the avoidance and elimination of unjustifiable discrepancy in sentencing is a matter of abiding importance to the administration of justice and to the community.” 
        
       
      
    22 The fundamental essence of the principle, especially in relation to sentencing, is that any discrepancy should be justifiable. Of course, sentencing an individual offender is not like setting a generally applicable wage rate or determining whether, by comparison to others not in a particular class, a person has been treated unequally or inappropriately. Every offence and every offender is unique. The arithmetic precision which may apply in other areas of the law cannot apply to the sentencing of an individual offender. Where co-accused and their role within a criminal enterprise is the same, then the objective factors associated with the offence are relevantly the same, however, objective factors in the commission of the offence are not the only factors to be taken into account in sentencing. Since no two individuals are identical, the determination of exact relativity in the sentencing of individuals is an impossibility. Some of the measures that are utilised in order to minimise a lack of transparency is, as Dawson J encouraged, the sentencing by one judge of co-accused in a joint criminal enterprise. That was largely achieved in relation to the Scott Syndicate, of which this forms part. Certainly it was achieved in relation to the sentencing of Mr De Marco, Mr Scott and the applicant.  
     
      
    23 When a prisoner appeals the sentence imposed on the ground of disparity, it would be a mistake to determine the appeal on the basis of the misleading nature of the short hand title it is given. It is not truly an appeal on the basis of “disparity” or even on the basis of the “parity principle”. It is an appeal on the basis that there is a legitimate and/or justifiable sense of grievance or injustice at the discrepancy in sentencing between two or more co-accused. The test for determining the legitimacy of a sense of grievance is objective not subjective. An applicant for leave to appeal on the basis of such a ground must demonstrate, not that the applicant feels aggrieved, but that a reasonable mind looking objectively and overall at what has occurred would see justification in the applicant’s grievance (see R v Doggett, NSWCCA, 24 March 1996 unreported, per Sully J and R v Ilbay [2000] NSWCCA 251 at [6]).  
     
      
    24 Further, there are a number of qualifications which, themselves, are based upon the application of transparent justice to the principle in question. It is, for example, not appropriate for an appeal court to intervene by reducing a sentence if the result is to produce a sentence disproportionate to the culpability (both objective and subjective) of the offender in question (see R v Boney [2001] NSWCCA 432).  
     
      
    25 I turn then to the application of the principle to the facts in this case. His Honour the sentencing judge said of the role played by Bree: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it might be said that he was a franchisee in the syndicate in the town of Gunnedah. He was not one of the principals of the overall operations, but nonetheless, so far as Gunnedah was concerned, he was the principal distributor for those above him in the chain. The criminality is extensive and nothing other than a significant penalty of imprisonment is appropriate.” 
        
       
      
    26 It is clear that his Honour, informed in relation to the totality of the operations of the syndicate, took the view that the criminality of the applicant was significant and at a higher level than the submission made by and on behalf of the applicant before this Court. As well as dealing with De Marco, the applicant dealt directly with Scott, as did De Marco. The judge also held, particularly in relation to the applicant’s criminal history, that he had a “bad history” but not a “remarkably bad history”. As to parity, his Honour made clear that the applicant: 
     
      
       
        
        “does not bear the same culpability as Scott, and perhaps others equivalent to Scott. … It is nonetheless a very serious criminality. He clearly was involved extensively in the distribution of this illegal substance and the criminality continued over a long period of time.” 
        
       
      
    27 After taking into account the subjective elements associated with the applicant, his Honour then sentenced the applicant. The sentence, of course, was for three offences, not simply the offence relating to cannabis. Further, all of the sentences are concurrent and his Honour was clearly concerned to ensure that the totality of the sentence reflected an appropriate figure.  
     
      
    28 The applicant seeks to separate out the cannabis charge, which was the most serious charge, but it seems, at least in part, that the sentence on Count 3 reflects his Honour’s desire to ensure an overall sentence which reflects the totality of the criminality involved.  
     
      
    29 I have earlier stated that it is impermissible to compare the applicant with Mr Livas and given their respective roles it is impermissible to compare the applicant with any of the couriers or Mr Gosling. In his submissions counsel for the applicant paid particular regard to the sentence imposed on Mr De Marco. It is necessary to deal with this comparison because it is the one which has been the subject of the most telling submission and the concern of the applicant in relation to “unfair treatment”. Mr De Marco was sentenced by Woods QC DCJ on 3 December 2004, some 2 months or so after the sentencing of Mr Scott and the applicant. His Honour, in the remarks on sentence for Mr De Marco (and Byron Wood who was sentenced at the same time), recounted the issues associated with the Scott Syndicate and made the following comments: 
     
      
       
        
        “The matter relates to an extensive syndicate of marijuana distribution, one of the principals of which was a man called Jason Peter Scott. … 
        
       
       
        
        … He, in effect, ‘franchised’ various people such as the man, Bree, [the applicant], and such as the man, De Marco, to be the recipients of the drug for it to be on-supplied in due course. There were, as well, various people who were the drivers or couriers of the vehicles. The couriers are at the lowest level of the culpability although in all cases such as that of the man Wood, inevitably a prison sentence will be imposed. Higher up than that is the level of people such as Bree and De Marco. At the top level was the man, Scott and possibly various others.” 
        
       
      
    30 It is clear that, at least at the time he came to sentence De Marco, Woods QC DCJ took the view that De Marco and Bree were at a similar level of criminality. There are differences. As counsel for the applicant has pointed out, De Marco was convicted in relation to five times the amount of cannabis than was the applicant. However, given the nature of the syndicate and the factual findings by his Honour the sentencing judge, the amount of cannabis to which the charges relate may be more a question of timing than it is a reflection of the relative level of criminality of the two co-accused. That seemed to be the view of his Honour the sentencing judge. In sentencing Byron Wood his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is a difference in the maximum penalty available as to supply of marijuana in terms of large commercial as against a commercial quantity, but in the circumstances of this case, it does not seem to me to be as significant as other considerations, and particularly the respective roles involved.” 
        
       
      
    31 In dealing with Mr De Marco, his Honour Woods QC DCJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In a case where there are multiple offenders and a syndicate is involved, sometimes difficulties arise in equating the sentences to be imposed upon various parties. Without engaging in an overly fine dissection of the comparabilities, this man’s culpability is approximately like that of the man, Bree [the applicant], although there may be slight differences and I bear in mind the necessity to avoid sentencing in a way that might excite legitimate concerns as to comparability of treatment.” 
        
       
      
    32 The fundamental basis of the submissions of the applicant was that he had been unfairly treated by comparison with De Marco in circumstances where De Marco received a lesser sentence yet should have received a greater sentence. It is a submission based upon the lack of “due discrimination” between the two offenders. In the joint judgment of Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Postiglione, their Honours cite with approval the following extract from R v Tiddy [1969] SASR 575 at 577: 
     
      
       
        
        “… where other things are equal, persons concerned in the same crime should receive the same punishment; and where other things are not equal, a due discrimination should be made.” 
        
       
      
    33 In this case, none of the offenders are “equal”.  
     
      
    34 His Honour the sentencing judge arrived at a sentence for De Marco based on his perception that De Marco was at or about the same level of culpability as Bree. That determination was made on the basis of the role of the two offenders, rather than the amounts of the drug involved. There are differences, of significance, between the role that De Marco played and the role that Bree played. I have already described Bree, in the words of Woods QC DCJ, as a “franchisee”. De Marco is probably best described as a “wholesaler” and was further up the chain of the syndicate than was Bree. Even taking account of the preference to look at the role rather than the amount of drugs involved, De Marco played a seemingly more significant role than did Bree.  
     
      
    35 As already stated, the first of two offenders is entitled to rely upon parity with the second, notwithstanding that the second was set by comparison with the first. (See Jones v The Queen, supra). 
     
      
    36 However, the difficulties, largely already mentioned, in this case are twofold. Firstly, the applicant was sentenced for more than one offence and there can be little doubt that the sentence in relation to cannabis was structured so as to take into account the sentencing judge’s view as to the totality of the criminal liability of the applicant. It also took into account the goods in custody matter on the Form 1. Secondly, and more importantly from the perspective of the submissions made on behalf of the applicant before this Court, the applicant’s sentence has an appropriate relativity to that of Scott and the various couriers. In the case of Palanca, he was described by Hosking SC DCJ as operating “below Scott” and above “Bree and De Marco” in objective criminality but because of subjective factors the particular sentence was imposed. The dilemma, therefore, for the applicant, is that, while it may look, at first blush, that the sentence in comparison to De Marco suffers from a disparity, making an alteration, favourable to the applicant to reflect relative seniority in the syndicate with De Marco, would put the applicant out of parity with all of the other members of the syndicate. Further, given the role that the applicant played in the organisation, his prior criminal record and the other offences (including the Form 1) for which he was sentenced a sentence any lower than the one imposed by Woods QC DCJ would take the applicant out of the range of appropriate sentences for the criminal conduct and subjective elements involved.  
     
      
    37 While the applicant may have a sense of grievance at the relative sentence imposed upon Mr De Marco, it is a sense of grievance derived from the leniency with which Mr De Marco has been treated. That sense of grievance is essentially one based upon the error, the applicant submits, of finding that Mr De Marco and Mr Bree were at the same level and ultimately, mistakenly, of giving Mr De Marco a sentence that was erroneously lenient. It is not every disparity which requires correction. There must be a disparity based upon a legitimate sense of grievance. In this case, the sense of grievance felt by the applicant is not legitimate because it is based upon a known situation where there has been a mistake in fact in the later sentence on relative criminality of only one of 8 co-accused. The sentence imposed on the applicant is an appropriate one and a lower sentence would be inappropriate and inadequate (see R v Tisalandis [1982] 2 NSWLR 430). Further, the disparity is not such that it warrants correction.  
     
      
    38 For these reasons I propose that: 
     
      
    a Leave to appeal be granted;b The appeal be dismissed.39 SMART AJ: Shannon James Bree seeks leave to appeal against non-parole periods totalling 3 years and 6 months with a parole period of 1 years 2 months on the sole ground that he has a justifiable sense of grievance by virtue of the disparity between the sentences imposed on him and those imposed on his co-offenders, in particular Elliott De Marco, Peter Palanca and Israel Gosling. 
     
      
    40 He was charged that on 13 May 2003 at Gunnedah he supplied a prohibited drug, namely, methylendioxymethylamphetamine (ecstasy) (Count 1) and that he supplied methylamphetamine (deemed supply of 36.5 grams) (Count 2). He was further charged with supplying cannabis, indictable quantity, between 2 October 2002 and 16 October 2003, being less than 25 kilograms (the commercial quantity). For convenience this is called Count 3. On the last mentioned charge there was taken into account a charge of on 21 October 2003 having goods in custody, namely $5000.41 The maximum penalty on each of Counts 1 and 2 is 15 years imprisonment and/or a $220,000 fine whilst that on Count 3 is 10 years imprisonment and/or a $220,000. On Counts 1 and 2 the applicant was sentenced to terms of imprisonment, the judge setting a non-parole period of 2 years 3 months commencing 16 December 2003 and expiring 15 March 2006 and imposing a further period of imprisonment of 9 months expiring on 15 December 2006. On Count 3 the judge set a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months commencing 16 December 2003 and expiring 15 June 2007 and imposed a further period of imprisonment of 1 year 2 months expiring on 15 August 2008. The sentence on Count 3 was thus concurrent with that imposed on Counts 1 and 2. The total effective sentence was therefore 4 years 8 months with the applicant being eligible for release to parole on 15 June 2007.  
     
      
    42 The applicant entered pleas of guilty to the offences charged at an early stage. I would adopt the statement of facts extracted in the judgment of Rothman J, along with his table of offenders, their roles, the sentencing judges and the sentences. 
     
      
    43 It is not in doubt that all other factors being equal, co-offenders of approximately equal responsibility for the offence should be treated alike, nor that there must be due proportion between the sentences imposed on co-offenders: Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 esp at 609 (Gibbs CJ) 610-611, 613-614 per Mason J; Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295, esp at 301. The appellate Court has a discretion to intervene where there is a manifest discrepancy or disparity such to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. An appellate Court is not required to achieve parity with an erroneous sentence if to do so would amount to the imposition of another erroneous sentence. Error should not be compounded: R v Diamond NSWCCA, unrep., 18 February 1993, R v Isumander & Siregar [2002] NSWCCA 477 and R v SY & Anor [2003] NSWCCA 291 and R v Harmouche [2005] NSWCCA 398 at 68, and cases there cited. 
     
      
    44 I turn now to a comparison of the cases against the applicant and De Marco, their circumstances and their sentences. 
     
      
    45 De Marco was sentenced by the same judge as the applicant, but about seven weeks later. De Marco received a non-parole period of 3 years and a further period of imprisonment of 1 year. The quantity of cannabis supplied by the applicant was about 20kg and that supplied by De Marco was approaching 100kg. He was charged with, and pleaded guilty to supplying not less than the commercial quantity of cannabis. This offence carries a higher maximum penalty (15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $385,000). 
     
      
    46 De Marco was a mid-level distributor in an extensive syndicate of marijuana distribution co-ordinated by Jason Peter Scott. The judge held that Scott, in effect, “franchised” various people such as the applicant and De Marco, to be the recipients of the drug to be on-supplied in due course. Beneath the applicant and De Marco were the couriers who made the deliveries from South Australia to New South Wales. 
     
      
    47 Like the applicant, De Marco had the benefit of an early plea of guilty. 
     
      
    48 In sentencing De Marco the judge took into account as matters of aggravation, that this was organised criminality and that he did have a record for drug offences in England which had put him in prison. For the purpose of the sentencing exercise the judge accepted De Marco’s explanation that he had “taken the rap” for his friends who, from time to time, shared the task of buying ecstasy for their use. De Marco’s record was not a long one. 
     
      
    49 The judge found that when De Marco came to Australia he attempted to advance himself by a business enterprise which apparently resulted in financial failure with him, presumably, falling into debt. Under such pressure he fell prey to the temptation of easy money from drugs. The details are not stated. Nor is a great deal stated in the judge’s reasons as to the method of De Marco’s operation. It does seem that he operated over a much wider area than the applicant. That would be consistent with the quantities each of them handled. 
     
      
    50 The case of De Marco presented something of a puzzle. The judge was well aware of both aspects. On the one hand there was his extensive involvement in the drug trade. On the other hand he had innate decency and community spirit which were reflected in his work with the Rural Bushfire Brigade and in his work with handicapped children. The judge expressly took these into account. The judge described the personal material advanced in relation to De Marco’s family situation as distressing, but not something which the Court could take into account by way of mitigation. 
     
      
    51 In sentencing De Marco the judge was aware of parity considerations, stating: 
     
      
       
        
        “Without engaging in an overly fine dissection of the comparabilities, this man’s culpability is approximately like that of the man, Bree, although there may be slight differences and I bear in mind the necessity to avoid sentencing in a way that might excite legitimate concerns as to comparability of treatment.” 
        
       
      
    52 The applicant was obviously a principal distributor (and vendor) of cannabis in his hometown of Gunnedah over an extended period. He conducted an extensive business. 
     
      
    53 The applicant was born on 16 May 1975, married and with one child. The judge had regard to his criminal history. In February 1996 he was placed on recognisances and fined for cultivating prohibited plants and possessing them. In August 1996 he was sentenced to 2 months imprisonment for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In November 1999 he was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and placed on a recognizance in the Newcastle District Court. There were other offences; some involved dishonesty and others were traffic offences. In September 2003 he was convicted of being in charge of an attacking dog, and fined. The judge commented that the applicant’s history was “not a remarkably bad history but it is a bad history.” 
     
      
    54 The judge pointed out that the marihuana offence was committed in part while the applicant was on bail in relation to Counts 1 and 2. His prospects of rehabilitation were guarded. 
     
      
    55 The judge made the sentences concurrent as the offences “were committed during the same general period of criminality and were related”. 
     
      
    56 De Marco did not commit his offence while on bail for other charges and there were no Form 1 matters to be taken into account. 
     
      
    57 The judge found, “… Police investigations identified Bree receiving cannabis on a regular basis. He would take it from the man, De Marco, and return with it to Gunnedah to sell”.58 The sentences imposed on the applicant and De Marco lack due proportion. Both men were major distributors of drugs and both were appreciable operatives within a large-scale drug syndicate. Because of the much larger quantity of drugs handled by De Marco (approaching 100kgs as against about 20kgs) De Marco effectively disseminated much more cannabis into the community and over a wider area, even helping to supply the applicant. I can see no sound basis for imposing a greater sentence on the applicant (3 years 6 months non-parole and a balance of 1 year 2 months) than De Marco (3 years non parole and a balance of 1 year) especially when De Marco’s role was more widespread and he was disseminating into the community four times, and approaching five times, more cannabis than the applicant. The differences between them did not warrant the difference in the sentences imposed. Indeed, having regard to the more serious offence of De Marco, it would be expected that he would receive the greater sentence. The judge appears to have been influenced by the commendable community service of De Marco, but that could not be allowed to result in a major sentence reduction.  
     
      
    59 The judge recorded, correctly, at the start of his reasons as to De Marco, the offence to which he had pleaded guilty, but made no mention when comparing him with the applicant to De Marco facing a more serious charge. This was not a case where there was relatively little difference in the quantities the subject of these separate offences. 
     
      
    60 Having regard to the judge’s duty to determine a proper sentence for each offence and the judge evidently doing so, the applicant’s sentence on Count 3 cannot be assumed to be inflated because of the offences the subject of Counts 1 and 2. Whether the sentence on Count 3 should have been partially accumulated on those on Counts 1 and 2 is another issue. 
     
      
    61 Having concluded that there is disparity between the cannabis sentences imposed on the applicant and De Marco the question remains what course this Court should take. 
     
      
    62 The sentence imposed on the applicant on the cannabis count (Count 3) is a lenient one and one close to or at the bottom of the permissible range for that offence. The seriousness of the applicant’s offence lies in the substantial quantity of 20kgs of cannabis, the supply and distribution taking place over one year, the regular and systematic nature of the skilful operation and the payment by the applicant or his associates of $115,000 directly into the bank account(s) of Scott. This has all the hallmarks of a substantial business operation for profit. 
     
      
    63 The sentence imposed on De Marco was erroneous in that it was manifestly inadequate. De Marco was responsible for the supply and distribution of a quantity of cannabis approaching 100kgs. He knew from a previous custodial sentence that he should not be involved in supplying drugs. He was part of a well-organised drug distribution syndicate distributing by skilful means large quantities of drugs from South Australia into New South Wales. De Marco succumbed to the lure of easy money to recover from a failed business enterprise. To reduce the applicant’s sentence based on the manifestly inadequate one imposed on De Marco would involve the compounding of error.  
     
      
    64 The applicant also relied on the sentence imposed on Palanca who received a sentence comprising a non-parole period of 3 years and a balance of term of imprisonment of 1 year 9 months, making a total sentence of 5 years 5 months. He pleaded guilty to supplying not less than the large commercial quantity of cannabis leaf which carries a maximum penalty in terms of imprisonment of 20 years. 
     
      
    65 Hosking DCJ, after describing the managerial role and skill of Scott in setting up the syndicate and operation, stated that Palanca was supplied with particulars of cannabis growers in South Australia by Scott. Once Scott had established Palanca with these contacts for a regular source of cannabis, Palanca gathered large quantities of cannabis for packaging in preparation for delivery to New South Wales. Between 25 October 2002 and 5 October 2003, Palanca supplied more than 100kg of cannabis to known couriers in the syndicate to transport to New South Wales and to known people in New South Wales. The total amount of cannabis supplies in New South Wales from South Australia was in excess of 900kg and purchases of cannabis in New South Wales yielded in excess of $5 million. This was at Scott’s behest, with Palanca involved in but a portion. 
     
      
    66 Scott had been previously sentenced to a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months and a further term of two years 6 months imprisonment. Hosking DCJ found that Palanca stood significantly below Scott in terms of the level of involvement and the quantity of cannabis he pleaded guilty to supplying. Scott had a criminal record while Palanca did not have a criminal record. Palanca had a grim and loveless childhood. He left school at age 15, having passed Year 10. He has been with his partner for 20 years and they have two children, aged 19 and 16. Palanca began using cannabis from age 17 and his use gradually increased over the years. He entered into the arrangement earlier described to clear his cannabis debt. 
     
      
    67 Palanca was diagnosed as having a dysthymic disorder. Upon his release he will require ongoing psychological therapy to address his disorder. He has severe high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high triglycerides and a kidney condition. He was described by his doctor as a chronically ill man. He is about 40 years old. 
     
      
    68 The judge found that before his involvement in the subject offence Palanca was previously a man of good character and that he was unlikely to re-offend. He had good prospects of rehabilitation. Palanca received a discount of 25 per cent for his early plea of guilty. 
     
      
    69 Understandably, and unlike the cases of the applicant and De Marco, Hosking DCJ found special circumstances in Palanca’s case. 
     
      
    70 The narration of the facts in Palanca’s case demonstrates that there were major differences between his case and that of the applicant. While Palanca’s objective criminality was probably greater than that of the applicant, Palanca had a compelling subjective case. He had the benefit of a finding of special circumstances. The principles of parity and due proportion do not lead to the applicant having a justifiable sense of grievance as a result of the sentence imposed on Palanca. 
     
      
    71 The applicant also relied on the sentence imposed on Israel Nye Gosling. I do not regard that case as comparable with the applicant’s case. Gosling was stopped for a random breath test. On the back seat of his vehicle there was a large bag of green vegetable leaf and $6186. During his recorded interview he told the police that he intended to take the cannabis to Tweed Heads to supply his friends. The cannabis leaf had a net weight of 7.138kg. The indictable quantity is 1.00kg.  
     
      
    72 Gosling was born on 15 November 1977. He had virtually no criminal history. He had but one previous conviction, namely, stealing from the person in 1995 for which, as a juvenile, he was placed on probation. Judge Hock thought he had good prospects of rehabilitation if he maintained his present resolve. He had the support of his fiancée and his family. Since his arrest he had been in protection and could well remain there for the whole of his sentence. He received a discount of 25 per cent for his plea of guilty. Special circumstances were found. 
     
      
    73 Gosling’s sentence comprised a non-parole period of nine months and a balance of term of imprisonment of 9 months. 
     
      
    74 The applicant submitted that Gosling was, like him, an on supplier and that he (the applicant) should not have received a total sentence which was more than three times that imposed on Gosling and where the non-parole period was more than four times. 
     
      
    75 On the evidence Gosling was not a major distributor of cannabis over an extended period. His criminality did not approach that of the applicant. Less importantly, but nevertheless relevantly, Gosling’s subjective case was stronger than that of the applicant. It is not known what reduction in sentence Judge Hock made to allow for Gosling serving his sentence in protection. 
     
      
    76 The challenge made to the applicant’s sentence based on that imposed on Gosling must be rejected. 
     
      
    77 The applicant also took a more general approach, namely, that when regard was had to all the sentences mentioned he was dealt with more harshly than the other offenders. When the individual facts relating to the other offenders are examined, there are relevant differences in the roles played and the subjective features. The applicant was running the drug distribution operation in Gunnedah. He could be described as the syndicate’s manager in Gunnedah, although it is apparent that he was selecting the customers with whom he dealt and sent large sums of money to Scott, paying for the drugs he had received. He then “on-sold” the drugs. 
     
      
    78 For his criminality the applicant could not, correctly, have received a lesser sentence. As earlier stated, to reduce the applicant’s sentence because of the manifestly inadequate sentence imposed on De Marco would involve a compounding of error. 
     
      
    79 The applicant should be granted leave to appeal against sentence, but the appeal should be dismissed.

      Introduction 
       
      
    3 On 25 July 2005 the applicant pleaded guilty at Burwood Local Court to the offence of maliciously destroy or damage property by means of fire contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 s 195(b). The maximum penalty for such an offence is 10 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 On 30 September 2005 the applicant was sentenced for that offence by Finnane DCJ to a non parole period of 1 year and 3 months commencing on 4 May 2005 and expiring on 3 August 2006 with the balance of the term of the sentence of 2 years and 9 months to commence on 4 August 2006 and expire on 3 May 2009. 
     
      
    5 The circumstances of the offence were that on 4 May 2005 the applicant set fire to the family home. The sentencing Judge found that the applicant was a man of good character who committed the offence whilst he was suffering from a severe mental disorder and possibly from the effects of an earlier suicide attempt. His Honour was of the opinion that the applicant did not seek to burn the house down for the purpose of gain or revenge but rather because of some overflow of emotions leading to complete irrationality of conduct. His Honour considered it most unlikely the applicant would ever offend again. 
     
      
    6 His Honour in his remarks on sentence said: 
     
      
       
        
        [The applicant] is a man for whom the finding of special circumstances should be made. What he really needs after serving a fairly short non-parole period , is to be subject to supervision for a longer time during which, he should be able to get some assistance in dealing with anger, and perhaps he should get assistance in relation to his family problems. For that reason I propose to give him a non-parole period of 15 months with a head sentence of four years. And that is very much less than the normal ratio between head sentence and non-parole period which would be closer to three years. … So far as the principle of retribution is concerned that is met by imposing upon him a head sentence of four years. It makes it plain that any person who burns a house down, even if it is one that he partly owns, can expect to receive a substantial sentence.  
        
       
      
    7 His Honour made no reference to the plea of guilty in his remarks on sentence or in the course of submissions on sentence.  
     
      
    8 The applicant has sought leave to appeal against sentence on the ground that his Honour omitted to discount the sentence for the guilty plea. 
     
      
       
      Discussion 
      
    9 The applicant submitted that he had pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity and accordingly his sentence should have been discounted by 25% in recognition of the utilitarian value of the plea – R v Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. He further submitted there was no evidence the sentencing Judge had discounted the sentence for the plea. He relied upon Regina v Shenton [2003] NSWCCA 346 in which Handley JA held at [12]: 
     
      
       
        
        … a sentence which should be discounted for a plea of guilty, must not only be properly discounted, it should be manifestly be seen to be properly discounted. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
    10 The Crown accepted his Honour did not expressly state he had taken the guilty plea into account when sentencing the applicant. However, it was submitted, such should be inferred as the fact of the plea was expressly referred to by both counsel in addressing his Honour on sentence, the material tendered to his Honour referred to the early admission of guilt and the plea, his Honour proceeded to sentence upon completion of the submissions and the sentence was consistent with an appropriate discount for the guilty plea. In those circumstances it would be quite improbable his Honour would have overlooked the fact of the plea.  
     
      
    11 Applicant’s counsel referred his Honour to statistics from the Judicial Commission of New South Wales. The Crown referred his Honour to a number of cases which had similarities to the present both as to the facts and in that there had been a plea of guilty. In three of those cases the offender had been sentenced to a term of four years imprisonment following a plea of guilty.  
     
      
    12 His Honour said in relation to this material: 
     
      
       
        
        I have looked at the statistics that have been given to me. I have looked at some cases to which I have been referred. It would seem to me that a head sentence of three to four years is a fairly normal type of sentence in this sort of situation. 
        
       
      
    13 The statistics to which his Honour referred reveal that the head sentence for 35% of all s 195(b) offenders was 36 months with a further 10% being sentenced to 48 months and that the head sentence for 38% of all s 195(b) offenders who pleaded guilty and had no prior convictions was 36 months with a further 13% being sentenced to 48 months imprisonment 14 In these circumstances the choice by his Honour of a head sentence of four years is equivocal. It may indicate that his Honour had in mind an undiscounted figure or a discounted figure. The fact that there was no reference to the plea of guilty in his Honour’s comments during the course of submissions or in his remarks on sentence, either in respect of its utilitarian value or as evidence of contrition, causes me to infer that his Honour inadvertently overlooked the question of a discount for the plea of guilty when sentencing the applicant. As this Court observed v R v Thomson at [160(1)]: 
     
      
       
        
        A sentencing judge should explicitly state that a plea of guilty has been taken into account. Failure to do so will generally be taken to indicate that the plea was not given weight. 
        
       
      
    15 There is no reason why, in the proper exercise of the judicial discretion, a discount of 25% of the overall sentence would not have been appropriate in this case. A reduction of the total term to three years should be made to allow for such discount. 
     
      
    16 However the non-parole period was selected by his Honour as appropriate having regard to all of the relevant subjective circumstances. It was not the result of simply varying the statutory ratio by a percentage. The non-parole period was, as his Honour observed, very much less than the normal ratio. In my opinion it remains an appropriate non parole period even though the application of a plea discount reduces the total sentence to 3 years. In these circumstances the Court is obliged to order the applicant’s release at the expiry of the non-parole period.  
     
      
    17 At the time of the offence the applicant was subject to a telephone interim apprehended violence order which prohibited him from approaching the family home. Although his English was poor despite living in Australia for nearly 30 years, it is apparent from his interview with police that he was well aware of the terms of the apprehended violence order. This was an aggravating factor which contributed to the overall criminality of his offence. In my opinion the overall criminality is such that a lesser non parole period is not warranted in law. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    18 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
    1. Leave to appeal granted. 
     
      
    2. Appeal as to sentence allowed.  
     
      
    3. The sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Finnane on 30 September 2005 is quashed. 
     
      
    4. In lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of one year and three months commencing on 4 May 2005 and expiring on 3 August 2006. The balance of the term of one year and nine months is to commence on 4 August 2006 and expire on 3 May 2008. 
     
      
    5. In accordance with the requirements of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 s 50 the Court directs the release of the applicant on parole at the end of the non-parole period.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Smart AJ. 
     
      
    2 ROTHMAN J: Damien Wright seeks leave to appeal his sentence. He was sentenced by his Honour Judge Marien SC at Campbelltown District Court on 24 January 2005 for six offences being offences for demanding money with menaces with intent to steal. His Honour imposed an overall effective sentence of three years’ imprisonment as a non-parole period commencing 24 January 2005 and expiring on 23 January 2008 with a balance of term of one year expiring on 23 January 2009.  
     
      
    3 There are two grounds of appeal: that the sentencing judge erred by failing to give effect to the finding of special circumstances; and, secondly, that the sentence is manifestly excessive. Before dealing with each of these grounds of sentence it is necessary to set out the facts giving rise to the offences and the remarks of the sentencing judge insofar as relevant. Lastly, if error is shown, the Court needs to deal with the question of whether a lesser sentence is warranted.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    4 All of the offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty relate to the extortion of the victim, Damien Magee. The victim and the applicant worked together at Woolworths in Bass Hill. In February 2003, the victim witnessed some conduct by Wright at work in the liquor section of the store, which it seems indicated theft. The victim spoke to the applicant about it. A few days later, the victim told the store manager of the conduct and the applicant was dismissed from employment. Thereafter, the applicant extorted $8,995 from the victim by using threats of retribution, violence and death. It is necessary to detail how this was effected.  
     
      
    5 The applicant approached the victim soon after the victim had spoken to the store manager. He declined to accept an apology offered by the victim and expressed his views about the victim in a direct and abrupt fashion. When the victim asked the applicant whether he would “flog” him, the applicant replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “No, you won’t be flogged, not by me anyway.” 
        
       
       
      Two days later the victim was informed that the applicant’s employment had been terminated. The victim was worried that the applicant would come looking for him and requested that his shifts be changed. This change was implemented and the new shifts continued for a period of time. In April, the victim returned to his regular shifts. On 4 April 2003, the applicant approached the victim in the Woolworths’ car park. The victim was afraid. The applicant demanded $1,000 from him and escorted him to the local ATM to make withdrawals totalling $1,000 (as bank records corroborate). The applicant made clear that he blamed the victim for the loss of his job and told him not to go to the police. Similar events occurred on each of the dates listed in the charges and each time the victim was frightened. I will deal in turn with each of the charges. 
       
      
    6 Count 1 is demand money with menaces with intent to steal, which occurred on 4 April 2003. It is a contravention of s.99(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years.  
     
      
    7 On 4 April 2003, the victim finished work at about 1 pm and was walking to his car when he was approached from behind and the applicant said to him: 
     
      
       
        
        “Hey you, I’ve been looking for you.” 
        
       
       
      The victim was immediately afraid, the applicant being close enough to touch the victim if he had wanted to. The applicant said: 
       
       
        
        “I’ve had people out here waiting for you. The only reason you are still walking is because of me, and how we were before.” 
        
       
       
      He then said: 
       
       
        
        “What sort of recompense can I get?” 
        
       
       
      The victim said that he did not know what he meant and was very frightened. The victim thought that he was about to be bashed. The applicant said to him: 
       
       
        
        “How about you give me $1,000?” 
        
       
       
      The victim said that he was unable to do so because he could only withdrawal $500 at a time. To that response the applicant said: 
       
       
        
        “I know you are with the Commonwealth Bank, let’s go.” 
        
       
       
      They walked to the Twin Willows Hotel ATM. The applicant urged the victim to get $900 out, which he did. He told the victim to get another $100. The applicant took the money from him. The victim’s bank statement shows that $900 and $100 were withdrawn by the victim at the Twin Willows Hotel from his Savings Passbook Account at 13:16 and 13:19 respectively. The applicant then insisted that the two of them have a drink at the hotel. The victim agreed because he was frightened that some harm might come to him. The applicant walked back to the victim’s car, after the drink, and told the victim that it was the victim’s fault that he, the applicant, had lost his job. He told the victim not to go to the police. The applicant’s Streamline Account balance at this time was $1. 
       
      
    8 Count 2 is demand money with menaces with intent to steal, which occurred on 11 April 2003. One week after the first offence, the applicant approached the victim in the Woolworths car park again and said he needed to borrow some money from the victim. The victim agreed because he was afraid to argue with the applicant. Although the applicant asked to borrow it, the victim understood that he would not get the money back.  
     
      
    9 The victim again attended the Twin Willows ATM and withdrew $1,000. The applicant took the money and asked for a further $200. The victim informed the applicant that he had exceeded his daily withdrawal and if the applicant returned the next day at 3:30 am he could get the rest to him. The victim’s bank statement show that $1,000 was withdrawn. 
     
      
    10 Count 3 is demand money with menaces with intent to steal occurring on 24 April 2003. The events in question were almost identical to the events related in Count 2. This time the victim said that he only had $750 and could not give the applicant $1,000. The bank statements show that the victim withdrew $600 from one of his accounts at 12:48 pm and $150.00 from another. The applicant took the money from him. On this occasion a person we now know to be the applicant’s cousin, Peter Stevenson, asked the applicant whether he was still working at Woolworths. After being informed of what had occurred, Stevenson said to the victim: 
     
      
       
        
        “If you had done that to me, I would kill you; take you out the back of Bourke, cut you into little pieces and feed you to the wild pigs.” 
        
       
       
      The victim said he had never been so frightened in his life.  
       
      
    11 Further, Stevenson told the victim not to go against the applicant at Court or make a statement against him. Stevenson poked his finger in the victim’s leg in a threatening manner. Other threats were made to the victim. Stevenson said to the victim: 
     
      
       
        
        “I’ll be down here with six other guys, we will spread you round the pub. Don’t go against Damien. Pay him the $750 and you will never see me again.” 
        
       
       
      When the victim left the pub, the applicant said to him: 
       
       
        
        “Look, nothing is going to happen to you unless I authorise it.” 
        
       
      
    12 Count 4 is demand money with menaces with intent to steal occurring on 22 May 2003. Once more the victim was confronted after work. This time the applicant told him that Peter (Stevenson) was going to ask the victim to get a loan. The victim said that there was no way he would be getting a loan. He walked to the ATM and took out a total of $500 from the two accounts earlier mentioned. The applicant followed him and took the money.  
     
      
    13 Count 5 is demand money with menaces with intent to steal occurring on 12 June 2003. This time the applicant was waiting for the victim when he arrived at work at 3:55 am. Statements were made by the applicant involving threats of grievous bodily harm against the victim by Peter Stevenson. The victim withdrew $390 and that amount was taken by the applicant.  
     
      
    14 Count 6 is demand money with menaces with intent to steal occurring on 19 June 2003. Once more the victim was approached when leaving work. The applicant told the victim to come to the hotel. At the hotel the applicant told the victim that he had to take out a loan for $5,000 as the applicant needed it for “legals”. Following this conversation the victim attempted to obtain a loan but each attempt was unsuccessful. The victim left the Sydney area and went to visit his family. After receiving some advice he ultimately went to the police.  
     
      
    15 The applicant was arrested and interviewed on 2 October 2003. He participated in an ERISP on that day but his response was inconsistent with guilt and/or remorse.  
     
      
    16 Ultimately the applicant pleaded guilty at Campbelltown District Court on 20 August 2004 and thereupon approached the police and offered to participate in a further record of interview. On 14 October 2004 he provided a further ERISP and nominated Peter Stevenson, his cousin, as the other person involved in the extortion. After the plea of guilty and for the purposes of the sentence, the applicant also sought to have the Court take into account 7 incidents of demand money with menaces against the same victim. Those offences were essentially to the same effect as the charges already described. They occurred on 12 April 2003, 13 April 2003, 17 April 2003, 7 May 2003, 15 May 2003, 30 May 2003 and 5 June 2003. Each were for demand money with menaces with intent to steal. 
     
      
    17 The formal sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Marien SC were: 
     
      
       
      Count 1 to 3 
      : On each Count a fixed term of imprisonment for two years commencing 24 January 2005 and expiring 23 January 2007; 
       
       
      Count 4 to 6 
      : On each Count, and taking into account the matters on the Form 1 on Count 6, non-parole period for two years commencing 24 January 2006 and expiring 23 January 2008 with a balance of term of 1 year expiring on 23 January 2009. 
       
       
      Together these amounted to an effective sentence of 3 years non-parole period and 1 year balance of term. As is clear, the ratio of non-parole period to the balance of term is precisely 3:1. (See s.44(1) of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
      ) 
       
       
      Remarks on Sentence 
       
      
    18 His Honour found, and the finding is not challenged, that the plea of guilty was entered at the first reasonable opportunity. The applicant had no prior convictions and had been leading an upright existence prior to leaving home and living with Stevenson. The applicant said that Stevenson was the person who came up with the idea of the extortion and for the loan.  
     
      
    19 The applicant freely and voluntarily approached the victim at first. Later, according to the applicant, Stevenson pressured him with threats of violence. While at first the two went 50:50 on the takings, the applicant says that fairly soon thereafter, all of the money went to Stevenson whom the applicant feared because the applicant use to go “schizo on the drugs, gambling habit.” The applicant said that he felt sick when Stevenson had threatened to kill the victim and he, the applicant, also, felt trapped in the situation. The applicant related a series of physical assaults during the beginning of June at the hands of Stevenson who believed that the applicant had “ripped him off”. His Honour the sentencing judge was a little incredulous of the applicant’s claim that he only received $200 out of the extortion, with the rest being given to Stevenson.  
     
      
    20 The sentencing judge found that the objective seriousness of these offences was “extremely high” for the following reasons: 
     
      
    · Any duress upon Wright cannot be taken as a mitigating factor;· He voluntarily entered the criminal enterprise and perhaps should have anticipated such a falling out;· The motive was greed;· The offences were planned;· It was, relatively, a lengthy time;· There were 13 separate occasions of demanding money;· The threats of violence were very serious, including those made at the start when the applicant said that he had people waiting for the victim and the only reason he was still walking was because of the applicant;· There was a high level of fear in the victim’s mind, increased by the applicant being in the company of Stevenson;· The applicant was present when Stevenson made threats to kill the victim; and· The applicant, having voluntarily entered the scheme, never sought to bring it to an end. 
     
      
    21 His Honour considered the following subjective factors: 
     
      
    · The applicant had a supportive family and has moved back home;· There was significant remorse and a feeling of shame at the conduct he had perpetrated;· His life had changed dramatically for the worse in the period of living with Stevenson;· Favourable reports were tendered from the current employer and the parish priest;· No prior record;· Early pleas of guilty;· The assistance to authorities in the investigation against Stevenson which included the second ERISP. The sentencing judge found that the information provided in the second ERISP was still not entirely frank;· The sentencing judge allowed a reduction of 40 percent for the plea at the first reasonable opportunity and the assistance to police. 
     
      
    22 The learned sentencing judge could not find that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend as the sentencing judge considered that there was no other motivation for these offences, that he could identify, other than greed. The sentencing judge received a submission from the Crown that it would be within the sentencing discretion to order a custodial sentence served by way of periodic detention. His Honour found that it would be “wholly outside my sentencing discretion to impose anything other than full-time custody.” 
     
      
    23 Lastly, his Honour took the view that because of the applicant’s good character and the fact that this was the first time that the applicant would be in custody that “there are special circumstances warranting a variation of the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the total term of the sentence.” 
     
      
    24 After referring to the High Court judgment in Pearce his Honour expressed the requirement that he “impose an appropriate sentence for each offence and then take into account matters of accumulation, concurrence and totality. …In my view it would be appropriate to partly accumulate the last three counts on the indictment on the sentences I will impose for the first three which will be concurrent.” 
     
      
       
      Manifest Excess 
       
      
    25 The applicant’s submission on manifest excess was, in part, based upon the applicant’s miscalculation of the starting point of the sentence. At the hearing, the applicant resiled from that miscalculation. It was accepted by all sides that the offences in question were serious. It should also be accepted that the offences arise from the one course of conduct. The sentencing judge allowed a discount of 40 percent, as previously stated, and the starting point for the overall sentence was, in aggregate, six years and eight months. That is a sentence which is well within the range of sentences available to his Honour and is not, and could not be, described as manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      Failure to Give Effect to the Finding of Special Circumstances 
       
      
    26 The sentencing judge, as previously outlined, found that there were special circumstances which warranted a departure from the statutory ratio. The overall sentence imposed was one which mirrors precisely the statutory ratio. 
     
      
    27 Prior to the offences in question, which occurred when the applicant was 24 and 25 years of age, the applicant had no criminal record. He had lived with his family and left the family to live with Peter Stevenson. It was during his cohabitation with Peter Stevenson that his lifestyle and attitudes seemed to have changed dramatically. By the time the sentencing judge imposed the sentence, the applicant was back living at home with his family and was enjoying their support. His father gave evidence on his behalf and the applicant, but for the short time already mentioned, appeared to be part of a stable and supportive family. There is little doubt that there was a basis for the finding by the sentencing judge of special circumstances.  
     
      
    28 The difficulty is that the sentencing judge imposed a sentence which does not in its overall effect reflect the finding of special circumstances.  
     
      
    29 The Crown submission on this question is correct. The mere fact that circumstances exist which are capable of constituting a “special circumstance” within the meaning of s.44(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act does not mean that a sentencing judge is obliged to vary the statutory proportion. There is abundant authority for that proposition. However, the submission, in that form, misses the point. The abundant authority to which reference is there made, makes clear that there is no obligation to vary the statutory ratio but those cases are concerned only with the alleged existence of such an obligation. In this case, unlike those on which the Crown relied, the judge expressly found that the special circumstances did justify a variation to the statutory ratio.  
     
      
    30 In relation to Counts 4 to 6, the statutory ratio was varied by the sentencing judge. The fact that there is an accumulation of sentences would, in ordinary circumstances, itself, justify the finding of special circumstances to give effect to the statutory ratio on the overall sentence. However, his Honour found that the statutory ratio should be varied, not because of the effect of accumulation, but because of the subjective special circumstances attributable to the applicant. It was his Honour’s express intention to have a shortened non-parole period and a longer period of supervision. That intention was not effected. In those circumstances, it was an error, having so found, not to reflect that finding in the sentence imposed. His Honour, with respect, having found special circumstances, failed to take into account those special circumstances in the fixing of the sentence and, in so doing, failed to take into account a relevant consideration in the exercise of his sentencing discretion.  
     
      
       
      Is a Lesser Sentence Warranted in Law? 
       
      
    31 The Crown relied on the provisions of s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, namely that, even if error were to be found, a less severe sentence is not warranted in law. Frankly, this does not sit well with the Crown submission during the original sentencing hearing that it was within the discretion of the sentencing judge to order that the custodial sentence imposed be served by way of periodic detention. While I agree with the sentencing judge that, notwithstanding the Crown submission, such an alternative was not available, the submission at sentencing is inconsistent with the proposition that the special circumstances found to exist by his Honour ought not be given effect in the fixing of a shorter non-parole period.  
     
      
    32 I do not consider that the overall sentence is, in any sense, outside the range available to his Honour, or excessive. Nor do I consider that either one of the sentences imposed for Counts 1 to 3 or Counts 4 to 6 are themselves excessive.  
     
      
    33 Taking into account the aberrant nature of this period of behaviour in the life of the applicant and that this is the first time that the applicant has been in custody, I take the view that the Court should implement the stated intention of the sentencing judge and propose that the following orders be made: 
     
      
    a Leave to appeal be granted;b The appeal be granted in part;c That the sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Marien SC on 24 January 2005 in relation to Counts 4 to 6 be quashed and in lieu thereof, on each Count, and taking into account on Count 6 the matters on the Form 1, such the applicant be sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 months, commencing 24 January 2006 and expiring on 23 July 2007 with a balance of term of 18 months expiring on 23 January 2009.d The applicant will be eligible for parole for these offences on 23 July 2007.34 SMART AJ: The background is set out in the judgment of Rothman J.35 The applicant pleaded guilty to six counts of demand money with menaces and asked that a further seven offences of demand money with menaces be taken into account. These 13 offences occurred over the period April to June 2003. The offender was the supervisor of the victim at their former mutual place of employment. Both worked in the stores area. The victim saw the offender assisting in what appeared to the victim to be the pilfering of liquor from the employer’s store. He was not meant to see this. When pressed by his employer he related what he had seen. On being subsequently confronted by the offender, the victim admitted he had, in response to questions from store management, stated what he had seen. The offender expressed his extreme displeasure about being “dobbed in”. 
     
      
    36 From what the offender said the victim sensed that trouble lay ahead. In the course of his many demands for money the offender terrified the victim. A worrying feature of the demands was that they were mostly made as the victim left or came to his employment. He was not allowed to go to and from his work in peace. 
     
      
    37 There was thus sustained criminality of a very severe degree. The maximum penalty for each offence was imprisonment for 10 years. 
     
      
    38 On each of Counts 1, 2 and 3 (being the demands made on 4, 11 and 24 April 2003) the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years commencing on 24 January 2005. On each of Counts 4, 5 and 6, and taking into account the matters on the Form 1 on Count 6, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 24 January 2006 and expiring 23 January 2008, with a balance of term of 1 year expiring 23 January 2009. 
     
      
    39 The applicant attributed his continuance with his demands for money to the overwhelming and baleful influence and pressure from his cousin, Peter Stevenson. This did not apply to the initial demand and the judge was sceptical about this proffered explanation. He doubted if the police had been told the full story. The applicant pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. He also offered to assist the authorities and the judge was told that some charges had been laid against Stevenson. The judge reduced the sentence by 40-per cent, taking into account the plea of guilty and future assistance. 
     
      
    40 The evidence did not enable the judge to identify what motivated the offender to engage in the criminal behaviour in question, other than greed. Accordingly, the judge did not feel he could make a finding that the offender was unlikely to re-offend. 
     
      
    41 The judge, however, found: 
     
      
       
        
        “because of his good character and that this will be his first time in custody that there are special circumstances warranting a variation of the statutory ratio between the non parole period and the total term of the sentence.” 
        
       
      
    42 After referring to Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, the judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “…it would be appropriate to partly accumulate [the sentences on] the last three counts on the indictment on the sentences I will impose for the first three which will be concurrent” 
        
       
        
      and 
       
        
        “… with respect to count 6, I must take into account the matters on the Form 1 … in the way as described … in  
        Attorney-General’s Application No 1 of 2002 
         [2002] NSWCCA 518.” 
        
       
      
    43 The sentence imposed on Counts 4, 5 and 6 does allow for special circumstances in that the parole period of 1 year was more than one-third of the non-parole period. 
     
      
    44 However, if the sentences are taken together the parole period is one-third of the total non-parole periods. The judge does not refer to the effect of the accumulation of the sentences. That in itself is capable of being a special circumstance. A judge does not have to allow a reduction in sentence because of it. The sentencing judge did not. 
     
      
    45 Even allowing for the applicant’s favourable subjective case, including the discount covering the plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities, the sentences were very lenient. It is hard to justify the low sentence imposed on Count 6, on which seven other offences of demand money with menaces with intent to steal property were taken into account. That sentence was concurrent with the sentences on Counts 4 and 5. 
     
      
    46 For the serious criminality revealed and despite the position as to special circumstances, lesser sentences than those imposed are not warranted in law. 
     
      
    47 While I would grant leave to appeal, I would dismiss the appeal.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 BELL J: Each of the accused was arraigned on an indictment containing ten counts on 5 August 2005. Certain of the counts were preferred by the Director of Public Prosecutions ex officio. Each accused moved on notice for orders separating various of the counts. These applications were stood over part-heard to be determined after the evidence of a number of indemnified witnesses had been taken at a hearing of the type contemplated in R v Basha (1989) 39 A Crim R 337.  
     
      
    2 During the course of the voir dire I made a direction pursuant to s 5B of the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act 1998 (the Act) that the evidence of Mr W and Mr X be taken by audio-visual link from a location outside the courtroom. The orders were in each case confined to the evidence that was to be given in the voir dire hearing. These are my reasons for making those directions.  
     
      
    3 On Monday 13 March 2006 Mr W was called to give evidence. At an early point in his cross-examination there was an incident. In response to evidence given by Mr W, one of the accused called out “bullshit” and after this, each of the accused called out remarks predominantly in Arabic. They rose from their seats and presented as agitated and aggressive. I directed that they be removed from the dock. During this incident Mr W said some words in Arabic. 
     
      
    4 The proceedings were adjourned on the Crown’s application so that a statement could be obtained from Mr W. The statement is exhibit C. Mr W stated that among the things called out to him by the accused were offensive remarks that convey to an Arabic speaker a serious threat. I accept that is so. Mr W expressed fears about continuing to give his evidence in the presence of the accused.  
     
      
    5 Mr Stanton, who has some familiarity with the Arabic language, informed the Court that from such of the exchange that he understood, it was open to say that Mr W “gave as good as he got”. I did not accept that submission. The incident was initiated by the accused and their presentation throughout it was aggressive and intimidating. I accepted that Mr W felt threatened by the conduct of the accused.  
     
      
    6 Mr X was called to give evidence on 15 March 2006. He, like Mr W, is an individual who has been involved in criminal activity in southwestern Sydney. Each has been given an indemnity by the Attorney General. Mr X was expected to give evidence of admissions made in his presence by two of the accused in relation to a number of the offences charged in the indictment.  
     
      
    7 Mr X was called on the afternoon of 15 March 2006. He refused to be sworn or affirmed, stating that he feared for his life. He asserted that he had received threats to his daughter and other children and that he had proof of the making of them. He said this: 
     
      
       
        
        I am not making a joke of the court or anything but I have got serious threats against myself, my kids and my family and I am not going to risk their life for anything (T 107). 
        
       
      
    8 I stood the proceedings over until the following morning to give Mr X an opportunity to obtain legal advice, after warning him of the consequences that may follow from a continued refusal to give evidence. 
     
      
    9 The following morning Mr O’Sullivan, of counsel, appeared and informed the Court that he had had provided advice to Mr X. Mr X was called and affirmed and gave short evidence in chief, identifying a number of statements that he had made to the police. Throughout his evidence his head was bowed and he avoided eye contact with the accused. His answers were barely audible. When the Court resumed after the morning adjournment I was informed that Mr X had fainted after leaving the court, striking his head and that an ambulance had been summonsed.  
     
      
    10 The proceedings were stood down until 2:00 pm. On the resumption of the hearing I was informed that Mr X was present at court and that he was complaining of a migraine style headache and did not wish to continue his evidence that day.  
     
      
    11 The Crown Prosecutor made an application pursuant to s 5B of the Act that the balance of Mr X’s evidence be taken by audio-visual link. This application was opposed by counsel for Adnan Darwiche and Naseam El Zeyat.  
     
      
    12 The Crown tendered the Ambulance Service Patient Health Care Record containing details of an attendance on Mr X that day. The history given by Mr X to the ambulance officers included that Mr X had not eaten for almost twenty-four hours and, “is under considerable stress due to court proceedings”. A physical examination revealed a minor haematoma to the occipital lobe. Mr X had refused a transfer to hospital and had been left in the care of the police officers.  
     
      
    13 Detective Senior Constable Nagle gave evidence on the application. She had examined a number of text messages that were recorded on a mobile phone that Mr X had handed to her. The number of the mobile phone was the number that the police had been given as Mr X’s contact mobile telephone number. He had been contacted by the police on this number over a period of some time. Detective Nagle understood that other police associated with the investigation had been informed by Mr X of the receipt of threatening text messages on 15 March. Her first knowledge of the matter was on the day of these events.  
     
      
    14 Detective Nagle said she had read the following text messages on the phone handed to her by Mr X: 
     
      
       
        
        13 March 2006 – 9:24 pm – “how’s Caroline”; 
        
       
       
        
        14 March 2006 - 6:50 pm – “it’s going to be you or Caroline, you’ll find out this week dog”; 
        
       
       
        
        14 March 2006 – 9:43 pm – “I’m going to fuck your wife, you dog, and your wife’s family starting with Angela, she’s first”; 
        
       
       
        
        15 March 2006 – 9:56 pm – “We have dramas, going to fuck you and your whole family”; 
        
       
       
        
        16 March 2006 – 2:09 pm – “Don’t do it, I am telling you or I am going to fuck you and your whole family one by one”. 
        
       
       
      Detective Nagle said that all the messages had been transmitted from the same Telstra payphone. She understood the person, Caroline, to be Mr X’s daughter. She did not know the significance of the person, Angela. 
       
      
    15 It is to be noted that the last of the text messages was received at a time when Mr X was present at the Downing Centre court complex. 
     
      
    16 Stacey Romeo, a solicitor with the Officer of the Director of Public Prosecutions, with the carriage of the prosecution, gave evidence of her discussions with Mr X on the afternoon of 16 March. He conveyed to her that he was extremely distressed about the prospect of giving evidence in open court as the result of threats that had been made to him outside court. He claimed his stress was also as the result of being present in the same room as the accused. He believed that the experience would be less stressful if his evidence was given by audio-visual link and that he would be able to concentrate better.  
     
      
    17 Section 5B of the Act makes provision for a court, either of its own motion or on the application of a party, to direct that a person give evidence by audiovisual link from a place other than the courtroom. Section 5B(2) provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (2) The court must not make such a direction if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the necessary facilities are unavailable or cannot reasonably be made available, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the court is satisfied that the evidence or submission can more conveniently be given or made in the courtroom or other place at which the court is sitting, or  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the court is satisfied that the direction would be unfair to the party, or  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) the court is satisfied that the person in respect of whom the direction is sought will not give evidence or make the submission.

        (3) In a proceeding in which a party opposes the making of a direction for the giving of evidence or the making of a submission to the court by audio link or audiovisual link from any place within New South Wales other than the courtroom or other place where the court is sitting, the court must not make the direction unless the party making the application satisfies the court that it is in the interests of the administration of justice for the court to do so. 
        
       
      
    18 The Crown bore the onus of establishing that it was in the interests of the administration of justice for the balance of the evidence of Mr W and Mr X to be taken by audio-visual link.  
     
      
    19 Mr Stanton submitted that Mr X is a person with a lengthy criminal record, including for perjury. He observed that it was well open to Mr X to have orchestrated the sending of the text messages or that persons unconnected with the accused may have been responsible for conveying threats to Mr X that are not related to these proceedings. I accepted that Mr X may have staged the threats. There was no evidence to suggest that he had. Mr X’s evidence to which I have referred at paragraph [7] above was that he considered the threats related to his role as a witness in these proceedings. This was a relevant consideration in my determination. I was not concerned with whether as a matter of fact the threats were made in connection with these proceedings.  
     
      
    20 There was no evidence that the accused were responsible for any threats made to Mr X. I approached the application on the basis that there was evidence that Mr X entertained fears for his safety and the safety of his family in connection with giving evidence against the accused and that those fears had occasioned considerable stress to Mr X. 
     
      
    21 The Crown submitted that there was the risk of further outbursts like the one that took place on 13 March 2006. The conduct of the voir dire had been attended by considerable delay. In the Crown’s submission, it was in the interests of justice that Mr X give his evidence without the risk of further interruption.  
     
      
    22 In making the direction with respect to Mr X and Mr W, I took into account that the evidence was being taken in the absence of the jury. The purpose of taking the evidence of these witnesses on the voir dire was to remedy any disadvantage to the accused flowing from the circumstance that the counts relating to the Lawford Street incident were preferred ex officio, and that while the accused were committed for trial in respect of the counts relating to the murder of Ahmed Fahda, Mr X did not give evidence at the committal hearing although an order had been made for his oral examination on that occasion. There was no prejudice to the accused arising from the evidence being given by audio-visual link at the voir dire. No question of assessing the credibility of the witnesses arose and there was no need to address considerations of any adverse inference being drawn by reason of the evidence being taken in this way.  
     
      
    23 I considered it in the interests of justice that the evidence on the voir dire be taken without further delay. The risk of an outburst, such as the earlier one, was, to my mind, greater at a hearing in the absence of a jury than may be the case at a trial, where there is an incentive to the accused to exercise self-control.  
     
      
    24 Both Mr Webb and Mr Stanton submitted that taking the evidence of the witness of Mr X by audio-visual link would be unfair to their clients because of, what was submitted to be, the right to confront one’s accuser in open court. I did not consider that the accused were being deprived of any such right by the evidence being taken by audio-visual link: R v Mainprize [2005] NSWCCA 311. 
     
      
    25 I considered that Mr W and Mr X each held fears about giving evidence in the presence of the accused. I was mindful that their evidence was being taken on a voir dire and that they would be required to give evidence again at the trial. I considered the interests of justice included ameliorating the strain imposed upon each of them in being required to give evidence in these proceedings on more than one occasion.

     REGINA v Faheem Khalid LODHI 
      
    In July 2005 the Appellant pleaded not guilty to terrorism-related charges brought against him pursuant to ss101.4, 101.5 and 101.6 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code. The Appellant challenged the validity of the indictment presented against him. Whealy J dismissed that challenge. The Crown presented a fresh indictment, to which the Appellant again pleaded not guilty. The counts in the fresh indictment alleged the following offences:· Collecting a document connected with preparation for a terrorist act (s101.5);· Doing an act in preparation for a terrorist act (s101.6);· Making a document connected with preparation for a terrorist act (s101.5);· Possessing a thing connected with preparation for a terrorist act (s101.4).The term “terrorist act” is defined in s 100.1 of the Criminal Code.The Appellant challenged the validity of the fresh indictment. He alleged that it failed to specify a terrorist act, that it was duplicitous, and that it failed to state the essential elements of the offence. The Appellant asserted that it was necessary for the Crown to prove that the Appellant intended to prepare for a particular terrorist act, which needed to be pleaded in the indictment. As to duplicity, the Appellant contended that, because Counts 2 and 4 referred to three different acts, namely “causing death or serious harm to other persons unknown, or causing serious property damage to property unknown’, each Count referred to three different acts. The Appellant put a similar argument in relation to Count 3. Finally, the Appellant argued that the definition of “terrorist act” disclosed three separate offences, depending upon whether the act would result in death, serious injury, or serious damage to property. The Appellant also submitted that elements of the offence found in the definition of “terrorist act” were not pleaded.Whealy J dismissed the Appellant’s challenges to the fresh indictment. The Appellant appeals from that judgement to this Court.On 15 February 2006 the Governor-General proclaimed Item 22 of Schedule 1 to the Anti-Terrorism Act (No 2) 2005 (Cth). This proclamation had the effect of giving retrospective operation to amendments made to the provisions of the Criminal Code that create the offences under which the Appellant was charged. Those amendments had been inserted by the Anti-Terrorism Act 2005 (Cth), which came into effect after the Appellant had been arraigned and pleaded. The amendments expressly stated that it was not necessary for the Crown to prove that preparations were made for a particular terrorist act. The proclamation gave retrospective effect to the amendments. The Appellant contended that the retrospective amendments did not to apply to a trial that had already commenced. He also asserted the amendments violated the Commonwealth Constitution. 
     
      
      HELD 
      
    Per Spigelman CJ, McClellan CJ at CL and Sully J agreeing1. The retrospective amendments do not apply to a criminal trial that has already commenced. Accordingly, it is not necessary to consider the Constitutional issues. [49], [50], [55], [56], [96], [111]

          (a) if the conduct is itself a terrorist act—the action or threat of action that constitutes the terrorist act; or 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) if the conduct is a preliminary act—the action or threat of action that constitutes the terrorist act to which the preliminary act relates.

    6 By the Anti-Terrorism Act 2005 (Cth) (the “ATA Act”) s101.4(3), s101.5(3) and s101.6(2) were each repealed and replaced by a new sub(3) (in the case of s101.4 and s101.5) and a new sub(2) (in the case of s101.6). This new subsection repeated the words “A person commits an offence under subsection (1) or (2) even if” as a chapeau. The balance of the old subsection was included as par (a), but was changed from reading “the terrorist act does not occur” to reading “a terrorist act does not occur”. New pars (b) and (c) were added in parallel terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “101.4(3) … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) the thing is not connected with preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in a specific terrorist act; or  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (c) the thing is connected with preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in more than one terrorist act. “ 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        “101.5(3) … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) the document is not connected with preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in a specific terrorist act; or  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (c) the document is connected with preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in more than one terrorist act. “ 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        “101.6(2) … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) the person’s act is not done in preparation for, or planning, a specific terrorist act; or  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (c) the person’s act is done in preparation for, or planning, more than one terrorist act.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    7 Whealy J delivered two judgments on the Notice of Motion to quash the indictment. The first on 23 December 2005 was concerned with the indictment in a somewhat different form to that presently before the Court. The second judgment of 14 February 2006 was concerned with the indictment in its present form. A number of the matters the subject of this appeal were determined in the first of the two judgments.

      Subsequent Legislation 
      
    14 The ATA Act amended each of s101.4(3), s101.5(3) and s101.6(2) of the Criminal Code by adding what appears as (a), (b) and (c), set out above. This Act received Royal Assent on 3 November 2005.15 On 14 December 2005 the Anti-Terrorism Act (No 2) 2005 (Cth) (the “ATA No 2 Act”) received Royal Assent. Item 22 in Sch 1 of that Act adds the following at the end of Div 106 of the Criminal Code: 
     
      
       
        
        “106.3 The amendments to this Code made by Schedule 1 to the  
        Anti-Terrorism Act  
        2005 apply to offences committed: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) before the commencement of this section (but not before the commencement of the particular section of the Code being amended); and 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) after the commencement of this section.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    16 Item 22 of Sch 1 of the ATA No 2 Act was expressed to commence on a day to be fixed by proclamation. Such proclamation was made by the Governor-General on 15 February, with the effect that Item 22 commenced operation on 16 February 2006. 17 The Crown contends that upon the commencement of the operation of Item 22, the amendments which had been made by the ATA Act relevantly, s101.4(3)(a), (b) and (c), s101.5(3)(a), (b) and (c) and s101.6(2)(a), (b) and (c) as set out above, apply irrespective of whether an offence was committed before or after such commencement. The Crown contends that the amendments made by the ATA Act, as made retrospective by the ATA No 2 Act, apply to the trial of the Applicant.18 The original indictment against the Applicant was presented and the Applicant pleaded, before the ATA No 2 Act received Royal assent on 14 December 2005. He pleaded when first arraigned in July 2005. He pleaded again when re-arraigned before Whealy J in early December. It was common ground that the proceedings had commenced before the new legislation relevantly came into force.19 In his judgments of 23 December 2005 and 14 February 2006 Whealy J dealt with a number of objections to the indictment based on alleged duplicity and on a failure of the indictment to plead essential elements of the offence. As noted above, the ATA No 2 Act was proclaimed after the second of his Honour’s judgments. His Honour has not dealt with the effect of that Act. Mr P Bolton SC, who appeared for the Applicant, conceded that if this amendment was effective then the appeal must be dismissed.20 It is, accordingly, appropriate to first consider the effect, if any, on these proceedings of s106.3, added by the ATA No 2 Act, which gives retrospective effect to each relevant offence provision.21 The Applicant submitted that, on its proper construction, the Act did not apply to these proceedings. Alternatively, he submitted that the relevant sections were not validly enacted, either on the basis that they failed to comply with the terms of the referral of powers by the States to the Commonwealth or, alternatively, that they could not be enacted by reason of a violation of Ch III of the Commonwealth Constitution. Constitutional issues do not arise if the Applicant succeeds on his first point concerning the interpretation of the retrospective provisions. 
     
      
      The Extent of Retrospectivity 
      
    22 It is common ground that the Applicant joined issue by pleading to the charges prior to s106.3 of the Criminal Code coming into effect. The Applicant relies on the principle of the common law that, absent clear words to the contrary, an act will be interpreted not to have retrospective operations. The Crown, and the intervening Attorney, rely on the express words of the section as indicating a clear Parliamentary intention that the legislation should have retrospective effect. The Crown and Attorney submit that there is no basis for reading down the words of s106.3 so as not to extend to pending criminal proceedings.23 Although frequently expressed as a canon of construction or principle of the law of statutory interpretation, the reference to “retrospectivity” encompasses a range of distinct circumstances in which the general principle has fallen to be applied. In terms of the element of injustice or unfairness associated with retrospectivity, variation of rights and obligations after the pre-existing law has been invoked or otherwise relied upon does add an element of injustice or unfairness which does not exist before any such step is taken. Accordingly, there is a body of case law in which retrospectivity with respect to pending proceedings is treated as a distinct category. (See e.g. Re Joseph Suche & Co Ltd (1875) 1 Ch D 48 at 50; Hutchinson v Jauncey [1950] 1 KB 574 at 579; Continental Liqueurs Pty Ltd v G F Heublein & Bro Inc (1960) 103 CLR 422 at 427; Zainal bin Hashim v Government of Malaysia [1980] AC 734 at 742; L’Office Cherifien Des Phosphates v Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co Ltd [1994] 1 AC 496 at 495-495 and 524-525; Wilson v First County Trust Ltd (No 2) [2004] 1 AC 816 at [19], [153], [186], [193]-[198], [200]-[201] and [219]; State of Victoria v Robertson (2000) 1 VR 465 esp at [21]-[22], [25]; Attorney General (NSW) v World Best Holdings Ltd [2005] NSWCA 261; 63 NSWLR 557 at [49]-[63].)24 When referring to the presumption that Parliament did not intend to affect pending proceedings, Lord Roger of Earlsferry said in Wilson v First County Trust supra: 
     
      
       
        
        “[198] … Since the potential injustice of interfering with the rights of parties to actual proceedings is particularly obvious, this … presumption will be that much harder to displace.” 
        
       
      
    25 There is a line of authority that the common law presumption against retrospectivity is not spent when it is clear that Parliament intended a statute to operate retrospectively. The extent of retrospective operation is itself a matter requiring interpretation of the statute. A statute will only be given retrospective operation to the extent intended by the Parliament and to no greater extent. This is to be determined by the words of the statute, construed in their full context, and in accordance with the scope and purpose of the legislation. 26 As Bowen LJ said in Reid v Reid (1886) 31 Ch D 402 at 408-409: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … [E]ven in construing an Act which is to a certain extent retrospective, and in construing a section which is to a certain extent retrospective, we ought nevertheless to bear in mind that maxim is applicable wherever we reach the line at which the words of the section cease to be plain. That is a necessary and logical corollary of the general proposition that you ought not to give a larger retrospective power to a section, even in an Act which is to some extent intended to be retrospective, than you can plainly see the Legislature meant.” 
        
       
      
    27 Furthermore, Lindley LJ said in Lauri v Renad [1892] 3 Ch 402 at 420-421: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is a fundamental rule of English law that no statute shall be construed so as to have a retrospective operation unless its language is such as plainly to require such a construction; and the same rule involves another and subordinate rule to the effect that a statute is not to be construed so as to have a greater retrospective operation than its language renders necessary.” 
        
       
      
    28 Similarly, in Moss v Donohoe (1915) 20 CLR 615 at 621, Griffiths CJ said, in dissent on the result: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … A larger retrospectivity should not be given to a statute which is to some extent intended to be retrospective than that which it can plainly be seen that the legislature intended.” 
        
       
      
    29 His Honour referred to Beal’s Cardinal Rules of Legal Interpretation Section VIII. The third edition of that work quotes Reid v Reid and Lauri v Renad with approval. See at 472-474. See also AG (NSW) v World Best supra at [48], [54].30 The presumption against retrospectivity falls within the concept of the principle of legality which has been developed in recent years as a unifying concept, identifying the higher purpose of a number of interpretive principles. (See generally Spigelman “Principle of Legality and the Clear Statement Principle” (2005) 79 ALJ 769 at 774-776.) 31 That the presumption against retrospectivity falls within such a general concept was identified in the first lengthy development of the idea of a principle of legality by Glanville Williams (Criminal Law: The General Part, London, Stevens & Sons Ltd (1953) at pp439-440). The concept of the principle of legality was reintroduced to contemporary jurisprudence by Lord Steyne, being a concept that he found in Halsbury’s Laws of England. (See R v Secretary of State for the Home Office; Ex parte Pierson [1998] AC 539 at 587. Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th ed) Reissue vol 8(2) (1996) para 6.) It has subsequently been adopted in Australia, first by Chief Justice Gleeson writing extra-judicially (see Murray Gleeson, The Rule of Law and the Constitution Boyer Lectures (2000) ABC Books pp2, 5) and subsequently in a number of judgments (see Al-Kateb v Godwin (2004) 219 CLR 562 at [19]; Electrolux Home Products Pty Ltd v Australian Workers’ Union (2004) 209 ALR 116 at [21], [23].) It has also been adopted by Chief Justice Elias in New Zealand (R v Pora [2001] 2 NZLR 37 at 53.)32 In the case which established the “principle of legality” as a unifying principle in English law, R v Secretary of State for the Home Department; Ex parte Simms [2000] 2 AC 115, Lord Hoffman said at 131: 
     
      
       
        
        “[T]he principle of legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political costs. Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words. This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process. In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual. In this way the courts of the United Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document.” 
        
       
      
    33 This passage was subsequently quoted with approval by Gleeson CJ (Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 30; Al-Kateb supra at [19] at fn 11), Kirby J (Daniels Corporation v ACCC (2002) 213 CLR 543 at 582) and by Elias CJ and Tipping J (R v Pora [2001] 2 NZLR 37 at 53). Lord Steyne has subsequently characterised it as a “trenchant statement” (Roberts (FC) v Parole Board [2005] 2 AC 738 at [93] and see at [30] per Lord Bingham). (See also B v DPP [2000] 2 AC 428 at 470; Ngati Apa Ki Te Waipounamu Trust v The Queen [2000] 2 NZLR 659 at [82]; A (FC) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] UKHL 71; 3 WLR 1249 at [51].)34 The same idea was stated forcefully by Lord Simon of Glaisdale in Ealing London Borough Council v Race Relations Boards [1972] AC 342 at 361 when he said that the canons of construction: “are … constitutionally salutary in helping to ensure that legislators are not left in doubt as to what they are taking responsibility for.”35 The principle of legality so understood supports the reasoning in Reid v Reid, Lauri v Renad and Moss v Donohoe that an overtly retrospective statute, which may have the effect of making past acts criminal, will not be understood to be applicable to criminal proceedings that have already been instituted, unless the Court can identify express words or a necessary intention that that is the intention of Parliament. In my opinion, there are no such express words nor is there any such necessary intention in either the ATA Act or the ATA No 2 Act.36 Mr H Burmester SC who appeared for the Attorney General submitted that the purpose of the legislative scheme was to clarify that, in prosecutions for terrorist offences, the prosecution was not required to identify a particular terrorist act. That purpose, he submitted, is best advanced by not confining the retrospective application of the amendments to offences in respect of which proceedings have not been commenced.37 The Supreme Court of the United States said in Rodriguez v United States, 480 US 522 (1987) at 525-526: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … No legislation pursues its purposes at all costs. Deciding what competing values will or will not be sacrificed to the achievement of a particular objective is the very essence of legislative choice – and it frustrates rather than effectuates legislative intent simplistically to assume that  
        whatever  
        furthers the statute’s primary objective must be the law.”  
        
       
      
    38 This passage has subsequently been cited with approval by Gummow J in Brennan v Comcare (1994) 50 FCR 555 at 574; see also Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd (1995) 185 CLR 410 at 459 per McHugh J and Gummow J; Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1997) 190 CLR 225 at 248 per Dawson J; Western Australian v Ward (2002) 213 CLR 1 at 283 fn 833 per Callinan J; Attorney-General (Western Australia) v Marquet (2003) 217 CLR 545 at [145] per Kirby J.39 This approach is particularly apposite wherever the principle of legality is engaged, and particularly so in the case of a statute creating a criminal offence.40 It is not, of course, necessary for Parliament to expressly address the question of pending actions. (See e.g. Hutchison v Jauncey supra and Zainal supra.) Whether a result is necessarily intended, in the objective sense of that word applicable in the law of statutory interpretation, requires careful consideration of the legislative scheme.41 Legislation giving a lessee the right to claim relief against forfeiture and which contained a number of retrospective provisions was held to extend to pending proceedings. (Quilter v Mapleson (1882) 9 QBD 672 esp at 677.) Similarly, the amendment to the migration law considered by the Full Federal Court in Madafferi v Minister for Immigration (2002) 118 FCR 326 was held at [72] to apply expressly in relation to ministerial decisions already taken and the section should not be read down so as not to apply to decisions that had already become the subject of judicial review proceedings made. Madafferi is, perhaps, the closest to the present case, but did not involve criminal proceedings. 42 In civil proceedings, where an order for indemnity costs may overcome any injustice, the presumption may not operate with great strength. (See Bawn Pty Ltd v Metropolitan Meat Industry Board (1970) 72 SR (NSW) 466 at 487 per Mason JA; AG (NSW) v World Best supra at [66].)43 Of particular significance in the present case is the fact that retrospective effect is sought to be given to a provision creating a criminal offence. Much of the case law is concerned with civil causes of action. The clear statement principle operates with particular force in the criminal context.44 The Applicant relied on the High Court judgment in Newell v The King (1936) 55 CLR 707. In that case the accused had pleaded to an indictment. Before the trial occurred the relevant jury legislation was amended to provide for a majority verdict. The High Court determined that the amendment did not apply to the trial of that accused. 45 As the Crown and intervening Attorney submitted, there was nothing in the legislation under consideration in Newell of a retrospective character. Nevertheless, the relevant provision was introduced with the words “If, on the trial of any criminal issue …”. The debate in the High Court was whether or not what was involved was a substantive right or a matter relating to procedure. The Court held that the right to a jury was a “fundamental right of citizenship” (711) and accordingly was substantive. 46 Dixon J referred to the words “on the trial of any criminal issue” and said at 712-713: 
     
      
       
        
        “They should be taken to mean on the trial of any criminal issue joined after the commencement of the Act. They should not be construed as depriving a prisoner standing in peril at the time of their enactment of so important a thing as his protection from conviction except by a unanimous verdict.” 
        
       
      
    47 This was a particular application of the principle that where Parliament has used general words the courts will frequently read the words down. (See e.g. the cases collected in R v Young (1999) 46 NSWLR 681; [1999] NSWCCA 166 at [23]-[31].) The terrorism context of the Act under consideration must be given weight in determining whether this principle of interpretation applies, but it is not determinative. (See R (Gillan) v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis [2006] UKHL 12; 2 WLR 537 at [13]-[15].)48 As Isaacs J put it in Ex parte Walsh and Johnson; Re Yates (1925) 37 CLR 36 at 93: 
     
      
       
        
        “The full literal intention will not ordinarily be ascribed to general words where that would conflict with recognised principles that Parliament would be prima facie expected to respect. Something unequivocal must be found, either in the context or the circumstances to overcome the presumption.” 
        
       
      
    49 In my opinion, Parliament is “prima facie expected to respect” the principle that a statute will not retrospectively alter a criminal offence where a trial has commenced.50 By the same process of interpretation that Dixon J applied in Newell, it is open to construe the words of s106.3 so as not to extend to “offences committed before the commencement of this section” on which criminal issue was joined before the commencement of the section. In my opinion, the principles of the law of statutory interpretation, particularly the clear statement principle, lead to the result that that interpretation should be adopted. The Parliament has not indicated an intention to achieve that result with sufficient clarity.51 There is another route to the same conclusion. The “amendments” to which s106.3 refers are amendments made to s101.4(3), s101.5(3) and s101.6(2) of the Criminal Code. The provision, said to constitute “amendments”, repealed the previous subsections and replaced them by new subsections. 52 The effect of a repeal is, subject to an intention to the contrary, to be determined in accordance with s8 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. It is pertinent to note that that section refers to a number of different ways in which repealed legislation continues to have effect and makes separate provision for each of them. 53 In particular s8 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “8 Where an Act repeals in the whole or in part a former Act, then unless the contrary intention appears the repeal shall not: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          …. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under any Act so repealed; or 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (e) affect any … legal proceedings … in respect of any such right, privilege, obligation liability … as aforesaid; 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        and any such … legal proceeding … may be instituted, continued or enforced … as if the repealing Act had not been passed.” 
        
       
      
    54 Section 106.3 plainly affects the criminal “liability” of persons who have committed offences and, accordingly, it is a clear indication of a contrary intention for purposes of s8(c). It is not, however, clear that s106.3 is intended to extend to affect any “legal proceeding” in respect of such a criminal liability, within the meaning of s8(e). 55 The very structure of s8, providing as it does for distinct matters, reflecting in this regard the legislative regimes common in Interpretation Acts throughout Australia, itself suggests that, at least in a criminal context, a clear advertence to existing legal proceedings should exist before the Court concludes that there is a legislative intention to the contrary of s8(e). I can detect no such legislative intention in either the ATA Act or the ATA No 2 Act.56 For these reasons I am of the opinion that the Applicant has made good the submission that, as a matter of construction, the Act does not apply in his case. Accordingly, the constitutional issues raised do not need to be considered. 
     
      
      The Duplicity Issue 
      
    57 With respect to counts 2, 3 and 4 the Applicant submits that the indictment fails to particularise with the requisite level of specificity the “terrorist act” in which the accused had allegedly engaged and is duplicitous. Each of these submissions turned on the definition of “terrorist act”. The Applicant submits that each count must identify a particular terrorist act.58 Section 101 of the Code is set out above together with the use of the definite article in each of s101.4(3), s101.5(3) and s101.6(2) as originally enacted, and in s100.4. The Applicant submitted that use of the definite article was deliberate and that the offence could only be committed if there was a definite terrorist act intended at the time that an accused committed the relevant actus reus expressed in the respective offence sections as: doing an act in preparation for a terrorist act; making a document connected with the preparation for a terrorist act; or possessing a document containing information connected with preparation for a terrorist act.59 The Applicant submits that Counts 2, 3 and 4 fail to particularise the terrorist act with the required level of specificity or are duplicitous arising from the fact that each contains multiple acts. Count 2 and Count 4 each refer to three terrorist acts: causing the death of persons, causing serious physical harm to persons, or causing serious damage to property. Similarly it is common ground that Count 3 also refers to three different acts: namely the bombing of three separate military establishments. 60 In his judgment of 23 December 2005, Whealy J rejected the submission made with respect to the indictment as it then stood in a lengthy passage from which it is sufficient to extract the following for present purposes: 
     
      
       
        
        “[43] In my opinion, the use of the definite article in s 101.5 (3) and s 101.6 (2) is no more than a reference to the phrase ‘a terrorist act’ in the earlier sub-sections. It does not seem to me that any ambiguity is involved in that regard at all. Nor am I persuaded that the appearance of the definite article in s 100.4 carries with it the meaning attributed to it by defence counsel. Generally the definite article in s 100.4 performs the same function I have identified, namely linking back to the phrases ‘a terrorist act’ or ‘terrorist acts’.” 
        
       
      
    61 In his subsequent judgment of 14 February 2006 his Honour further addressed this issue repeating and elaborating his analysis from the earlier judgment: 
     
      
       
        
        “[65] Although there are differences between s 101.4, 101.5 and 101.6, there are clear similarities. I shall confine myself, in examining the statutory language, to those parts of the provisions that are relevant to the present charges. Relevantly, each provides for the commission of an offence if an act is done. Under s 101.4, the act is the possession of a thing namely, in this case, a document. The act must be ‘connected with preparation for a terrorist act;. The person charged must know of the connection. Under s 101.5 the act is the ‘collection of a document’. The act must be ‘connected with the preparation for a terrorist act’. The person charged must know of the connection. Under 101.6, the offence is committed where the accused ‘does any act in preparation for a terrorist act’. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [66] In the case of each offence, the legislation provides, as I have noted earlier, ‘a person commits an offence…even if  
        the 
         terrorist act does not occur’ (my emphasis).  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [67] I remain of the opinion that the use of the definite article in ss 101.4(3), 101.5(3) and 101.6(2) is a reference to the phrase ‘a terrorist act’ in the earlier sub-sections. I remain of the view that there is no ambiguity involved in that regard at all. Nor am I persuaded that the appearance of the definite article in s 100.4 carries with it the meaning attributed by senior counsel for the accused. Generally, the definite article in s 100.4 performs the same function I have identified, namely a function of linking back to the phrases ‘a terrorist act’ or ‘terrorist acts’ in the section. Thirdly, I remain of the view that a reading of the definition of terrorist act (s 100(1), (2), (3) and (4)), in the light of an examination of the scope and the extent of the division generally, supports this construction. This is so, with one exception, for the reasons I gave in my original decision. I shall come to that exception later in these reasons. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [68] The general framework of Part 5.3 of Ch 5 of the Code supports the conclusion I have reached in the following way: the type of action that is made criminal in terms of the division ranges from actually engaging in a terrorist act (s 101.1) down to an act that is altogether preliminary to that engagement: for example, receiving training connected with preparation for a terrorist act (s 101.2(1) and (2)); possessing a thing connected with preparation for the engagement of a person in, or assistance, in a terrorist act (s 101.4(1) and (2)); possessing a thing connected with preparation for the engagements of a person in, or assistance in, a terrorist act (s 101.4(1) and (2)); collecting or making a document connected with the preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in, a terrorist act (s 101.5(1) and (2)); and doing an act in preparation for or planning a terrorist act (s 101.6). 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [69] The wide range of activities made significantly criminal is itself postulated on the possibility that the criminal offence will or may occur long before any terrorist act itself is carried out. Indeed, apart from the offence of engaging in a terrorist act, each of ss 101.2, 101.4, 101.5 and 101.6 makes it clear that the offence is committed even if ‘the terrorist act does not occur’. (As I have already concluded, this is a reference to the phrase ‘a terrorist act’ where relevantly appearing in relation to each section creating the offence). Against this background it would be expected, as a matter of logic and commonsense, that the definition of ‘terrorist act’, would fit in with the concepts revealed by the type of activities that might be expected to be quite preliminary to but connected with the preparation for a terrorist act. As I said in my earlier decision it would, as a matter of logic and commonsense, hardly be expected that cities would be bombed and scores of people killed before the legislation would have the capacity to bite. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [76] The width of the definition of ‘terrorist act’ supports the notion that the Crown will prove this element of the case beyond reasonable doubt (or perhaps more accurately this aspect of the relevant element) if it establishes any one of the characteristics of the contemplated action as is specified in s 100.1(2). The nature of the action, however, may make it quite plain that it possesses a number of the characteristics that are enumerated in the sub-section. For example, if the contemplated action relates to the explosion of a large bomb during working hours in a city building, it may well establish characteristics that include physical harm to a significant number of people; serious damage to a building and the death of a number of people and the endangering of many peoples’ lives. Depending on the nature of the building and its function in the government or state system, it may well be that it will also possess the characteristic of seriously interfering with the systems referred to in 100.1(2)(f). On the other hand, by way of example, the intended action may be the administration of poison to but one person. In my opinion, however, the Crown would be obliged to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the intended action possessed at least one of the characteristics mentioned in the sub-section. If, however, it possessed more than one of those characteristics, it does not seem to me that more than one offence is created.” 
        
       
      
    62 In his earlier judgment his Honour had given a range of examples in this regard: 
     
      
       
        
        “[52] … In my opinion, an offence will have been committed by a person acting in a preliminary way in preparation for a terrorist act even where no decision has been made finally as to the ultimate target. I cannot accept Mr Boulten’s argument that there needs to be ‘a different mens rea to bomb position X than to bomb position Y’. On the proper interpretation of the sections I have examined, it seems clear to me that an offence will have been committed provided there is an act done in preparation for an action that has (‘falls within’) or contemplates having the characteristics set out in sub-s (2). The requisite intention to satisfy the existence of the mental ingredient of the offence must be an intention that the act is done in preparation for an action or threat of action possessing those characteristics.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [53] May I place this rather abstract analysis in a more concrete setting: The Crown argued that a suicide bomber who is apprehended in busy George Street Sydney at peak hour with a bombing apparatus strapped to his back could not avoid a conviction on the basis that he had not, at the time of his apprehension, selected a final target. The Crown said that the fact that the suicide bomber had not determined whether to explode the bomb in a café a shop or on a crowded bus would not prevent his conviction. Mr Boulten countered this argument by suggesting that the example did not take the matter further because the apprehended suicide bomber would be simply guilty of engaging in a terrorist act under s 101.1. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [54] Let it be assumed, however, that a second person was apprehended at his home on that very day and was shown to have packed the suicide bomber’s bag with explosives. This person, however, had no idea of the target to be selected by the bomber, even though he knew it was contemplated that the bomb would be exploded somewhere in George Street so as to cause death to nearby bystanders. Could this individual escape liability on the basis that the Crown was unable to establish beyond reasonable doubt that he knew precisely the place in George Street where the bomb was to be exploded? In my opinion such a conclusion would yield an entirely unrealistic approach to the natural construction and meaning of the various section in the division, including the definition of ‘terrorist act’. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [55] Let it be further assumed, by way of further example, that in the particular given situation it was contemplated, to the knowledge of the person who packed the explosives, that the suicide bomber would detonate the device either in the Queen Victoria Building or in Dymocks Book store but that no final decision had been made as to which it would be. Again, could criminal responsibility be avoided by the second person who carried out the act of preparation stating, with appropriate candour, that he simply did not know which of the two places was to be the ultimate target? Again, in my respectful opinion, the answer to that question must be ‘No’. This is so essentially for the same reasons I have earlier identified. The actus reus is the packing of the bag with explosives. The necessary ‘mens rea’ is the intention that an action is intended to be carried out which possesses the characteristics of causing serious physical harm to a person, in causing a person’s death or causing serious damage to property (or for that matter any of the other characteristics set out in sub-s (2)). This mental element is necessarily present even if a terrorist act does not occur and it exists even where the ultimate target has not been finally determined or is, at least, not known to the person who has done an act in preparation for a terrorist act.” 
        
       
      
    63 Subject to some observations below, I agree with the analysis of Whealy J. Each offence-creating provision – 101.4(1) and (2), 101.5(1) and (2), 101.6(1) – employs the indefinite article: “a terrorist act”. That is the relevantly dominant provision into which the definition of “terrorist act” in s100.1 must be read. The definite article appears in a subordinate provision and cannot be read back into the offence-creating subsection. As Whealy J concludes, the use of the definite article is no more than a reference back to the words “a terrorist act” in the previous subsections. It should be understood as if it said “even if the act did not occur”.64 As Whealy J shows, the context of the sections and the scope and purpose of the legislative scheme confirms the interpretation suggested by the words creating each offence.65 Each of the offence sections is directed to the preliminary steps for actions which may have one or more effects. By their very nature, specific targets or particular effects will not necessarily, indeed not usually, have been determined at such a stage. In the present case, no complaint is made about Count 1 which identifies the terrorist act as bombing an unspecified “part” of the electricity system.66 Preparatory acts are not often made into criminal offences. The particular nature of terrorism has resulted in a special, and in many ways unique, legislative regime. It was, in my opinion, the clear intention of Parliament to create offences where an offender has not decided precisely what he or she intends to do. A policy judgment has been made that the prevention of terrorism requires criminal responsibility to arise at an earlier stage than is usually the case for other kinds of criminal conduct, e.g. well before an agreement has been reached for a conspiracy charge. The courts must respect that legislative policy.67 Each offence under the Criminal Code consists of a physical and a fault element (s3.1(1)). The duplicity issue focuses on the enunciation in each count of the physical element which can be, relevantly, either “conduct” or “a circumstance in which conduct occurs” (s4.1(1)(a), (c)).68 The relevant physical elements, based on the terminology of the relevant provisions, are: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 2: do an act i.e. seek information and the act is in preparation for or planning a terrorist act. (s101.6(1)) 
         
         
        Count 3: make a document connected with preparation for a terrorist act. (s101.4(1)) 
         
         
        Count 4: possess a thing i.e. document connected with preparation for a terrorist act. (s101.5(1)) 
        
       
      
    69 In each count, only one act is alleged – ‘doing’, ‘making’, ‘possessing’ – being the physical element of conduct. The additional words ‘preparation or planning’ and ‘connection with preparation’ – should be understood as a second physical element of a “circumstance”. In Count 2 there is only one circumstance – “sought information”. In Count 3 there are, it appears, photographs of three sites. In Count 4 there are a number of matters constituting the “circumstance” – poisons, explosives, etc., as charged.70 In an offence which is intended to apply before the offender has decided precisely what he or she intends to do, there is no duplicity in identifying a range of matters that may constitute a relevant “circumstance”.71 The Applicant asserted that counts 2 and 4 were duplicitous by reason of their reference to the nature of the harm. Each of the counts referred to “causing the death of or serious physical harm to a person or persons unknown or causing serious damage to property unknown”. The Applicant submitted that these are three distinct offences relating to, respectively, death, or serious harm to a person, or serious damage to property.72 The Applicant relied on the onus upon the Crown to prove that the alleged conduct is a “terrorist act” and that it does not fall within s100.1(3) of the Criminal Code relating to advocacy, protest, etc. That subsection refers to an absence of an intention to cause harm to persons. Accordingly, it was submitted that an action which is “advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action” and which is merely intended to cause property damage would not be a terrorist act. This differentiation indicates, it is submitted, a need to separate, at least as alternative counts, the causing of property damage.73 In this regard his Honour said in his second judgment: 
     
      
       
        
        “[95] In relation to the ‘nature of harm’ argument, I have not found this of significance in relation to either the construction of the legislation or the argument related to duplicity. It goes without saying that, in a particular case, the nature of the terrorist act is likely to have a bearing on the assessment of culpability and therefore will have an impact on the sentencing procedure where an accused has been convicted. This is to say no more than that the sentencing court will need to make factual findings consistently with the jury’s verdict, in relation to the nature of, inter alia, the terrorist act. Such a consideration might have, in an appropriate case, a capacity to bear on the question as to whether the statute creates one offence or more than one offence. In my view, for the reasons I have earlier outlined, here the section creates only one offence. That conclusion is supported by the fact, to use the terminology of Bray CJ in  
        Romeyko 
         at 552, the act under consideration ‘possesses one or several of such characteristics’. The fact that a sentencing court will have to make a determination about the characteristic or characteristics that apply, as part of the sentencing procedure, does not in this instance alter the construction conclusion. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [96] The second string to Mr Boulten SC’s bow in relation to this argument centred upon the definition of terrorist act, at least so far as damage to property was concerned. He argued that, having regard to sub-s 3 of s 100.1, the nature of the result intended could not be simply viewed as a characteristic of the offence. As a matter of construction of s 100.1, however, this conclusion is, in my view, too broadly stated.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [97] … As I have said, he argued that the nature of the result intended cannot be simply viewed as a characteristic of the offence but, to the contrary, the intended result goes to the heart of the elements the Crown is required to prove. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [98] I repeat that the proper construction of ‘terrorist act’ is this: a terrorist act is an action that is done (or a threat of action that is made) with each of the intentions specified in sub-paragraphs (b) and (c). The action must possess one or more of the features specified in sub-s (2) provided that it does not have the features specified in sub-s (3). The latter excludes advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action that is not intended to cause the consequences detailed in the sub-section. The breadth of the definition is such that advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action may be action that falls within sub-s (2), and be capable of founding a terrorist act, if it is not unaccompanied by the intentions specified in sub-s 3(b)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv). 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [99] It follows that, on its proper construction, the legislation makes it a criminal offence for a person to do an act in preparation for an act to be carried out that will cause serious damage to property provided that the action is to be done with the intentions specified in s 100.1(1)(b) and (c) and provided it does not fall within sub-s (3). But a distinction needs to be made as to the characteristics of the action in sub-s 2 and the matters in sub-s 3. The latter is concerned with advocacy, protest etc not  
        intended 
         (my emphasis) to cause the nominated consequences. The former is concerned with the nature of the contemplated action itself. It is a fine distinction perhaps but, nevertheless, a real one. In my view, it prevents Mr Boulten’s argument from leading to the conclusion he urged.” 
        
       
      
    74 I agree with the analysis of Whealy J. As Bray CJ said in Romeyko v Samuels (1972) 2 SASR 529 at 552: 
     
      
       
        
        “The true distinction, broadly speaking, it seems to me, is between a statute which penalises one or more acts, in which case two or more offences are created, and a statute which penalises one act if it possesses one or more forbidden characteristics. In the latter case there is only one offence, whether the act under consideration in fact possesses one or several of such characteristics. Of course, there will always be borderline cases and if it is clear that Parliament intended several offences to be committed if the act in question possesses more than one of the forbidden characteristics, that result will follow.” 
        
       
      
    See also CSR Ltd v Environmental Protection Authority (2000) 110 LGERA 334 at [33]-[37]; R v Salmon (1994) 70 A Crim R 536 at 544-546.75 I agree with Whealy J that the scope and nature of the legislative scheme, concerned as it is with terrorist acts, which recent experience suggests are likely to have all three effects at the same time, Parliament intended to create a single offence with one or more of the specified characteristics.76 In each count, the nature of each terrorist act is further particularised by specifying the three alternative effects of each single terrorist act (Counts 2 and 4) or the three possible targets (Count 3). In my opinion, the indictment is sufficiently precise so that the Applicant knows the allegations levelled against him. I accept, as Bray CJ said in Lafitte v Samuels (1972) 3 SASR 1 at 6: 
     
      
       
        
        ““The prosecutor … should not, in my view, strive to be as vague as possible in the hope that out of several ambiguities in the complaint one will ultimately be found to fit the evidence after it is all in.” 
        
       
      
    77 Nothing like that has happened here. In the case of each count the effects of an explosion (Counts 2 and 3) or the selection of a target is not necessarily, indeed not usually, determined at the time of the ‘doing’, the ‘making’, or the ‘possessing’. That is the point of making preparatory acts offences. It is not appropriate, let alone required, that each effect or each target be the subject of a separate count. What has been made an offence includes conduct where an offender has not decided precisely what he or she intends to do. 
     
      
      Failure to State Essential Elements 
      
    78 With respect to each of counts 1 to 4 the Applicant submits that the indictment fails to identify all essential factual elements of the respective offences. This issue is not affected by the subsequent legislation.79 The Applicant referred to the definition of “terrorist act” in the Code which covers a multitude of acts and a variety of intentions. He relies particularly on s100.1(1)(c) of the Code saying that actions must be done with one of a variety of intentions referring to coercion, influencing by intimidation, etc. Accordingly, it was submitted, each count in the indictment is bad because if fails to specify the purpose for which it is alleged the Applicant did the alleged acts. Furthermore, the Applicant relies on the reference to motivation in s100.1(1)(b) of the Code, namely the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause. He submits that the particular motivation is also an essential factual element and should be pleaded.80 In his second judgment, Whealy J set out a detailed analysis of the offence created by s101.4, which also applied to the offences alleged under each of the other sections. His Honour commenced by noting that the Criminal Code stipulates in s3.1(1) that each offence consists of physical elements and fault elements. His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[81] Count 4 in the indictment alleges that on about 26 October 2003 the accused possessed a thing namely a document containing certain information (s 101.4). This is the first physical element in the charge. Section 5.1 stipulates that a fault element for a particular physical element may be intention, knowledge, recklessness or negligence. If the law creating the offence does not specify a fault element for a physical element that consists only of conduct, intention is the fault element for that physical element. Consequently, the fault element in relation to the physical element of possession of the document is intention to possess the document. The Crown must prove the physical element and the fault element beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [82] The ‘possession’ of the document is alleged, by count 4, to be connected with preparation for a terrorist act. (In making this analysis I am acting on the assumption that the indictment will be amended as the Crown indicated in its written submission). Plainly, the second physical element relates to a circumstance in which conduct occurs (s 4.1). The fault element (that is, the mental element) is specifically stated in s 101.4. The accused, in possessing the document must know of the connection between the document and the preparation for a terrorist act. Section 5(3) provides that a person has knowledge of a circumstance or a result if he or she is aware that it exists or will exist in the ordinary course of events. The Crown will be obliged to prove the circumstances and the awareness of the accused in relation to those circumstances to prove both the physical and fault element beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [83] This analysis enables me to say that, in the case of an alleged offence against s 101.4, it is not necessary for the Crown to prove that, at the relevant time, the accused himself intended to prepare for either a particular or general terrorist act. Of course, the Crown may prove that state of mind and, in the general course of things, if such a state of mind were shown to have existed at the relevant time, this would demonstrate awareness on the part of the accused so as to satisfy s 5.3. But the point is that the Crown does not have to prove the existence of a concurrent intention on behalf of the accused to carry out or be involved in, for example, the bombing contemplated by the information contained in the document alleged to have been in his possession. The only potential exception to this position arises in relation to the provisions of s 101.4(5). Where the defendant meets the evidential burden contained in this sub-section, the Crown will carry the legal burden to negative beyond reasonable doubt the matter of intention mentioned in the relevant sub-sections (s 13.3(3) and (6)). This is not an ingredient of the offence and need not be set out in the indictment (s 13.3(3)). A similar situation arises in relation to an offence under s 101.5 (see s 101.5(5) of the Code).” 
        
       
      
    His Honour went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “[87] This analysis enables me to make one further comment about the arguments advanced on behalf of the accused. It will be recalled that, in relation to the argument regarding the alleged failure to state all necessary factual elements of the offence, Mr Boulten referred to the necessary mental element to be proved by the Crown and, as well, to the need to prove the motivation behind the act. In this regard, Mr Boulten made reference to s 100(1)(c) of the  
        Criminal Code 
        . Although this submission did not arise in relation to the duplicity argument, it is perhaps convenient if I deal with it at this stage. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [88] In my opinion, it is not an ingredient of the offence, for example, under s 101.4 that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time of the possession of the document by the accused, he had an intention of advancing a political religious or ideological cause. Similarly, I do not accept that the Crown must prove that the accused, at the relevant time, had the intention of coercing or influencing by intimidation the Commonwealth or State Governments; or that he had the intention of intimidating the public or a section of the public. Of course, it would be open to the Crown to prove that the accused had these intentions and, if it were to do so, this would provide evidence of the fault element in relation to the connection between the possession of the document and preparation for a terrorist act (or, at least, it might tend to do so). But the relevant fault element, it must be stressed, in relation to this particular offence and the circumstances of the connection between possession and preparation for a terrorist act is ‘awareness’ of the connection. For example, it might, in a particular case be the situation that an accused person who has been shown to have possession of a document had no personal interest in the carrying out of the terrorist act contemplated by the information in the document. He might, for example, simply be a paid mercenary. He might simply be doing a favour for a friend or repaying a debt. As I see it, it is not necessary for the accused to have any of the intentions mentioned in 100.1(b) and (c). The accused’s motivation is not an essential ingredient of the offences in the indictment.” 
        
       
      
    81 Finally, his Honour concluded with respect to this issue: 
     
      
       
        
        “[102] Mr Boulten argued that counts 1 to 4 should be quashed for failure to state all necessary elements. There is no dispute between senior counsel for the accused and the Crown that the principles are those stated as I have indicated when detailing Mr Boulten’s arguments. The Crown accepts these principles but has argued that the amended form of the new indictment does not fail to state all necessary factual elements. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [103] In my opinion, the Crown’s submissions are correct on this point. First, the indictment pleads each offence in the terms of the statute. The amended indictment will provide particulars in relation to counts 2 and 4 of the general nature of the terrorist act. Counts 1 and 3 each provided particulars of the alleged terrorist act. Secondly, I do not accept that it is an essential factual element of any of the charges that the accused’s purpose or motive in allegedly preparing for the terrorist act must be demonstrated. I have touched upon this earlier in these reasons and there is no need for me to repeat in detail the matters I mentioned earlier. Put simply, I do not accept that each of the intentions mentioned in s 100.1(b) and (c) have to be demonstrated as intentions held by the accused. Indeed, in relation to offences under ss 101.4 and 101.5, the accused’s ‘collection’, ‘making’ or ‘possession’ of a document must be ‘in connection’ with preparation for a terrorist act and he or she must know of the connection. Thirdly, the precise fault elements are those I have identified in relation to each offence at an earlier point in these reasons.” 
        
       
      
    82 The identification of each essential factual element in an indictment serves a number of important purposes of the administration of criminal justice. (See John L Pty Ltd v Attorney General (NSW) (1987) 163 CLR 508 esp at 519-520; R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 281; 223 ALR 580 at [52]-[53].) 83 The Applicant submits that the various component parts of the definition of “terrorist act’ in s100.1 of the Code are essential factual elements of the offence by reason of the use of the words “terrorist act” in the statement of the offence in each of s101.4(1), s101.5(1) and s101.6(1). 84 The Crown relies on s11 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “11 The description of any offence in the words of an Act … creating the offence, or in similar words, is sufficient in law.” 
        
       
      
    85 This section applies to the present proceedings by force of s79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). 86 The issue, however, is what are the ‘words of the Act’ which ‘create the offence’. Is the definition of terrorist act of such a character as to constitute part of the offence created?87 The submissions on behalf of the Applicant and the submissions on the part of the Crown focused on whether or not the reference to “intention” in s100.1(1)(c) – referred to in the Applicant’s submissions as either a motivation or a purpose – was a fault element of the offence and, as such, an essential element. The Crown relied upon the reasons of Whealy J for the rejecting this contention.88 I have set out the counts in the Indictment above. That part of each of Counts 2, 3 and 4 discussed under the heading of “Duplicity” above, concerned with the results of the terrorist act in terms of death, serious physical harm or serious damage to property represents the identification of some of the list of matters set out in subs (2) of the definition of terrorist act which are applied by par (a) of that definition. The Crown has, accordingly, pleaded in each count one part of par (a), relating to subs (2) of the definition. It has not pleaded the second part of par (a) namely the proposition that the alleged actions did not fall within subsection (3). Nor has it pleaded the “intention” referred to in either par (b) or par (c) of that definition. The issue is whether or not these matters constitute an essential element of the offence. In my opinion they do.89 This may not prove to be of great practical significance because on my above reasoning, in the context of dealing with the duplicity argument, the approach in Romeyko would apply equally to the respective component parts of the definition of “terrorist act”. An action falling within subs (2) will frequently be motivated by more than one “cause”. Motivations of a “political, religious or ideological” character frequently overlap. Similarly, an action falling within (2) of the definition will often tend to coerce or influence by intimidation more than one government, as well as intimidate the public or a section of the public. Contrary to the submissions of the Applicant, the further definition of the offence may not be of significance in restricting the scope of admissible evidence. Nevertheless, they should be so specified as an essential ingredient.90 The references to “intention” in each of pars (b) and (c) of the definition of “terrorist act” are not fault elements of the offence. Rather they identify the character of the action that falls within (2) of the definition. This is a physical element, being a “circumstance” within s4.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code. Accordingly, it is not, in my opinion, an essential element of the offence that an accused charged with doing any one of the acts identified in s101.4, s101.5 or s101.6 must himself or herself have the intention that the act advances a particular cause or is done with the requisite purpose of coercion or intimidation. Nevertheless, as an essential physical element, each of pars (b) and (c) should be pleaded, but no particularity is required as to the person who had the relevant “intention”. Of course, if the Crown was to assert that it was the Applicant who had the intention, it could plead or particularise that aspect of the case. 91 The relevant fault element is knowledge of the connection, as specified in s101.4(1)(c) and s101.5(1)(c). In the case of s106.1 it is recklessness by force of s5.6(2) of the Criminal Code. Counts 3 and 4 plead knowledge. However, Count 2 does not plead recklessness. It should.92 The indictments should specify the applicable Law Part Code, i.e. 51411. (See Supreme Court Rules 1970 Part 75 Rule 3D(2A).)93 Both limbs of par (a) of the definition of “terrorist act” are essential elements in the offence. It is, therefore, necessary for the Crown to establish that any action or threat of action “does not fall within subs (3)”, as par (a) stipulates. On this basis the Crown is required to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the action was not advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action or was not intended to have one of the effects identified in (b) of subs (3). This element should also be pleaded. Again, adopting the approach in Romeyko, there would be no duplicity if more than one factor is pleaded.94 The words “terrorist act” in each offence provision only have meaning in terms of the definition found in s100.1. Each of (a), (b) and (c) in that definition are, in my opinion, essential elements of each offence alleged against the Applicant. The Crown can only rely on s11 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 if each charge employs the words of the definition or similar words. It has not done so. 
     
      
      Conclusion 
      
    95 For the above reasons the Applicant is entitled to the following orders:(1) Leave to appeal granted.(2) The Indictment is quashed.(3) Remit the matter to Whealy J.(4) Paragraphs [8]-[13] of this judgment are not to be published, until further order of Whealy J.(5) Liberty to apply within two working days to McClellan CJ at CL to extend the scope of Order (4) to incorporate additional paragraphs of the judgment.(6) Direct that no copies of the judgment be made available to non-parties until the period of two working days has expired or the parties notify the Registrar of the Court of Appeal that no application under Order (5) will be made.(7) Direct that this judgment not be placed on the Court’s website, until further order of Whealy J, save a copy with the deletion of pars [8]-[13] and any additions made pursuant to Order (5).96 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of the Chief Justice in draft. I agree with his Honour but in relation to the argument that the indictments fail to state the essential elements add the following remarks.97 At common law an information was required to state “every essential ingredient of the offence, but also giving particulars of the acts relied upon as constituting the offence … The offence had to be described with accuracy and with sufficient particularity to enable a superior court to see for itself whether the acts alleged were sufficient to constitute the offence.” Jordan CJ in Ex parte Lovell: Re Buckley (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 153 at 156 and see Smith v Moody (1903) 1 KB 56 at 59. 98 Section 11 of the Criminal Procedure Act has its origins in s 145A of the Justices Act 1902. It is accepted that the section was designed to overcome the perceived rigidity of the common law. A literal reading of the section might suggest that an indictment which merely described the offence in the words of the relevant statute would be sufficient in law. Although the accused may be entitled to particulars, these could be separately provided in discharge of the prosecutor’s obligation of fairness. However, in practice the section has not proved to be without difficulty and it is now accepted that the obligation of the prosecutor has not been so narrowly confined.99 In De Romanis v Sibraa [1977] 2 NSWLR 264 Mahoney JA reviewed both the common law and statutory position. Notwithstanding the words of the statute, his Honour concluded that the correct approach appears to be that adopted by Dixon J in Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 476 where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A defendant is entitled to be apprised not only of the legal nature of the offence with which he is charged but also of the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge” at p 489.” 
        
       
      
    100 The High Court considered the problem in John L Proprietary Limited v The Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales [1987] 163 CLR 508. The case concerned the Consumer Protection Act 1969, which makes it an offence for a person to publish a statement which is intended to promote the supply of goods and which is to the knowledge of the person false and misleading. The relevant statement was made in relation to the promotion of motor vehicles. The majority held that the information was defective because it did not identify the “material particular” in which the statement was alleged to be false and misleading.101 In their joint judgment Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ said at p 519: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Was the information defective by reason of its failure to identify the ""material particular"" in which the alleged statement was alleged to be false or misleading? 
          
         
         
        The traditional function of an information was to found jurisdiction to deal with an alleged offence. Disregarding the effect of statutory provisions curing or precluding reliance upon a defect, the old authorities established that an information should be quashed as insufficient in law and invalid if it failed to inform the justices before whom it was laid of the nature of the offence and the manner in which it had been committed. The rationale of that requirement has, in more recent times, commonly been seen as lying both in the necessity of informing the court of the identity of the offence with which it is required to deal and in providing the accused with the substance of the charge which he is called upon to meet: ""an accused person could not be required to defend the charge if the information did not supply the particulars necessary to enable him to prepare his defence"":  
        Ex parte Lovell; Re Buckley

         (NSW) 153 at 166.  
        The nineteenth century United Kingdom legislation which was enacted to render summary proceedings before justices less open to technical objection (see, in particular,  
        Jervis' Act 
         1848 (11 & 12 Vict. c 43), ss 1 and 3 and the  
        Summary 
          
        Jurisdiction Act 
         1879 (42 & 43 Vict. c 49), s 39) was substantially adopted in New South Wales: see the discussion in  
        Ex parte Lovell; Re Buckle 
        y at 167-174 and, in particular,  
        Justices Act 
         1902, ss 65 and 145A. One can point to statements of authority which lend support for the view that that legislation did not go so far as to abrogate the requirement that a valid information must at least identify the essential factual ingredients of the actual offence: see, e.g,  
        Smith v Moody  
        [1903] 1 KB 56 at 60 
        ; Johnson v Miller  
        (1937) 59 CLR 467 at pp 486-487, 501 
        ; Ex parte Graham; Re Dowling  
        (1968) 88 WN (NSW) 270, at p 280. It is, however, unnecessary to pursue that particular question here since, putting to one side s 6 of the  
        Summary Jurisdiction Act 
         to which detailed reference is subsequently made, it is not suggested that Yeldham J was in error in holding that such of those legislative provisions which might have operated to cure the defect in the information in the present case were not applicable in respect of an information laid before, or to proceedings in, the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction. That being so, the common law requirement remains that an information must at the least condescend to identifying the essential factual ingredients of the actual offence.  
         
         
        In  
        De Romanis v Sibraa 
         [1977] 2 NSWLR 264 at 291, Mahoney JA correctly pointed out that there was no technical verbal formula which could be applied to determine whether an information sufficiently identified the essential ingredients of the alleged offence. As his Honour commented at 291-292:  
         
         
          
          ‘In  
          Johnson v Miller 
           (1937) 59 CLR at p 486, Dixon J saw the decision in  
          Smith v Moody 
           [1903] 1 KB at pp 61, 63 as requiring the information to specify `the time, place, and manner of the defendant's acts or omissions'; McTiernan J. at p 501 referred to `fair information and reasonable particularity as to the nature of the offence charged'. The rule does not require that the information contain all such material as a defendant may require, upon an application for particulars, for the preparation of his defence:  
          Ex parte N Ormsby & Sons Pty. Ltd.; Re Mason  
          (1964) 81 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 286 at pp 290, 291. 
           
          ...  
           
           
          These cases establish that it may not be sufficient for an information to state the offence charged: it may be required to condescend to particulars. But, ... they do not indicate that the information must go beyond the statement of the offence and the proper particularization of it.’ 
          
         
         
        … 
         
         
        As has been seen, the information in the present case failed to identify an essential factual ingredient of the actual offence, namely, the ""material particular"" in which the statement, which the appellant was alleged to have caused to be published, was false or misleading. That failure was not a merely technical one. It was fundamental.” 
        
       
      
    102 The approach endorsed by the High Court in John L Proprietary Limited has been applied by this Court. In Stanton v Abernathy (1990) 19 NSWLR 656 Gleeson CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As Mahoney JA pointed out, and as the High Court held in the case of  
        John L Pty Limited v Attorney General (NSW) 
         s 145A does not do away with the common law requirement that an information must identify the essential factual ingredients of the actual offence alleged to have been committed:  
        Smith v Moody  
        (1903) 1 KB 56;  
        Johnson v Miller  
        (1937) 59 CLR 467 and  
        Ex parte Graham re Dowling  
        (1968) 88 WN (NSW) 270.” 
        
       
      
    103 However, the difficulty as Gleeson CJ pointed out at 666, “is that the courts have never managed to produce a technical verbal formula of precise application which constitutes an easy guide, in the circumstances of any given case, as to whether the common law has been infringed to such an extent that s 145A, operating alone, would be insufficient to save the information.”104 More recent decisions of this Court have considered the validity of an indictment by determining whether it identifies the “essential factual ingredients” of the offence. This may be contrasted with the particulars required by an accused merely to ensure that he or she can prepare a defence, the latter not being considered to be essential particulars: Taylor v EPA (2000) 50 NSWLR 48; R v Cassell (CCA NSW) 24 July 1996.105 In the present case, as the Chief Justice has indicated, the relevant offences are provided in s 101 of the Criminal Code. The actions of a person described in the relevant subsection will constitute an offence if, in a relevant respect, they are related to a “terrorist act” as defined in s 100.1 of the Code.106 The definition of terrorist act is complex and applies to action or threat of action which has any one of a number of physical consequences (sub s (2)). However, the action or threat of action must also be motivated by the intention identified in (b) and (c). Even if the relevant motivation is present the action will not constitute a terrorist act if it has the character described in subs (3).107 There are many crimes provided by statute which are described by reference to a statutory definition. Offences which depend on the infliction of “grievous bodily harm”, offences involving acts of “sexual intercourse”, offences against a “law enforcement officer” are but some. Practices seem to vary as to essential elements of the indictment (see Butterworths Criminal Procedure and Practice Vol 4). There are also offences which depend upon the commission of a criminal offence by another eg s 315 of the Crimes Act which provides for the offence of “hindering an investigation of a serious indictable offence.” However, s 313 provides that knowledge that the offence was a serious indictable offence is not a requirement in relation to public justice offences and accordingly, the essential ingredients of the serious indictable offence would not have to be pleaded in an indictment alleging an offence contrary to s 315.108 An essential element of an offence under s 101.4 and s 101.5 is knowledge by the accused of the connection of his or her own action with a terrorist act. Of course, the terrorist act may be the accused’s own act or the act of another. Section 101.6 directly relates the actions of the accused to a terrorist act. In each case knowledge of the terrorist act is fundamental to the offence and accordingly, particulars of the terrorist act are essential factual ingredients and must be pleaded.109 As the Chief Justice points out the present indictments plead only one element of the definition being that part of paragraph (a) relating to subs (2). The other parts of the definition should be pleaded.110 I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Justice.111 SULLY J: I have had the privilege of reading in draft the judgments of both the Chief Justice and the Chief Judge. I agree with the entirety of what is said in each judgment. I wish to express particularly an emphatic support for the analysis by the Chief Justice, and the application in the present particular case, of the principles of statutory retrospectivity.112 I concur in the making of orders as proposed by the Chief Justice.

     REGINA v Anthony David DOYLE 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment of Rothman J in draft. I agree that error has occurred and the respondent must be sentenced to a period of full time custody. I also agree with the sentence proposed by Rothman J. 
     
      
    2 As Rothman J identifies the respondent was charged with having a blood alcohol reading of 0.205 grams per hundred millilitres of blood, although it may have been higher at the time of the accident. His Honour found that as a consequence at the time of the accident he was in a “state approaching unconsciousness …” and “had no idea what was happening… ” 
     
      
    3 Whatever may have been his personal circumstances, and it is apparent that he had experienced a number of significant difficulties the respondent must have been aware that he was, at the time he commenced to drive, affected by alcohol to a considerable degree and his driving was a danger to himself, his passengers and other road users. His psychiatric problems provide no excuse for his driving in what was obviously a highly intoxicated state and provide no reason to ameliorate the need to punish the respondent and deter others from the same conduct. 
     
      
    4 The respondent’s conduct displayed a high level of moral culpability and in all the circumstances, and notwithstanding the respondent’s psychiatric problems, a custodial sentence was required. 
     
      
    5 Almost everyday tragedies occur on our roads. Some are truly accidents, but, in many the taking of drugs or alcohol by the driver is a significant factor. Everyone in the community must understand that if, whilst driving in these circumstances, grievous harm is caused to others a custodial sentence will normally be imposed. 
     
      
    6 In my opinion, as this is a Crown appeal, the sentence proposed by Rothman J, commencing on 14 September 2005, is appropriate. 
     
      
    7 ROTHMAN J: The Crown appeals the sentence imposed on 14 September 2005, by Phegan DCJ, on Anthony David Doyle, who pleaded guilty to aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. The aggravation referred to in the offence was that the respondent had a blood alcohol reading of 0.205. The maximum penalty for this offence, a contravention of s.52A(4) of the Crimes Act 1900, is 11 years’ imprisonment and the respondent was sentenced to a fixed term imprisonment of two years, suspended for a period of two years upon entering into a bond, and was disqualified from driving for two years.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    8 On 2 July 2004 the respondent drove his car into another causing grievous bodily harm to Dominic Rudd. As earlier stated, the alcohol concentration with which the respondent was charged was 0.205 grams per hundred millilitres of blood, but his Honour, in fact, found that at the time of the accident, his blood alcohol reading would have been between 0.224 and 0.253 grams of alcohol per hundred millilitres, the respondent having consumed half of a 700ml bottle of vodka in the period immediately before commencing to drive.  
     
      
    9 His Honour’s findings of the effect of the alcohol on the respondent was that he was in a “state approaching unconsciousness …” and “had no idea of what was happening…”. The car driven by the respondent went onto the wrong side of the road and caused the accident. There were a number of people in the other vehicle, all of whom, bar one, suffered some injury. The injuries to some were minor, being cuts to the forehead and bruising and increasing in seriousness to the most seriously injured who was Dominic Rudd. Dominic suffered a ruptured spleen and was hospitalised for some 12 days while the injury was treated. The injury was potentially life threatening but was successfully treated and surgery was unnecessary. Dominic was one of the three siblings of the driver of the other vehicle in which their father was also a passenger.  
     
      
    10 The respondent’s personal history is, so far as relevant, that he was trained as a teacher and worked as a primary school teacher in Mount Druitt and the Blue Mountains for some years. During part of that time he was a teacher of developmentally disabled children and children with behavioural difficulties. He married in 1985 and the newly married couple moved to Orange where the respondent taught at a number of local schools, both primary and secondary. His teaching of developmentally disabled children developed in him an interest in developmental disabilities generally and he commenced work with the Department of Aging Disability and Home Care as a residential care worker with developmentally disabled persons who require 24-hour care.  
     
      
    11 The respondent has a history of depression and alcohol abuse. Much reliance was placed by the respondent, during the course of submissions, on the nature of the depression said to be suffered and, in that regard, reliance was placed upon the report of Dr Christopher Lennings and other material. Dr Lennings reports the information conveyed to him by the respondent and comments on it in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “He reports some self-harm ideation but denies any active self-harm attempts. He tells me he first became aware of his mood disorder about 10 years ago. He tells me he lacked insight into it and it was not until his wife pointed out to him that he was depressed and advised he should see someone. However, he says he did not seek a consultation with anyone until 1997 when he was diagnosed with Depression. It was only last year (2004) he was diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder. He says he was given that diagnosis by Dr Whitmill, although Dr Whitmill’s letter implies the diagnosis was one that he obtained from elsewhere. Mr Doyle says that a visiting psychologist, Mr Nathan Fleisch also diagnosed him with mild bi-polar condition. There seems to be some debate as to whether he has genuine bi-polar disorder or whether he suffers from depression which cycles into a hypermanic state. (The difference is that in a hypermanic state a person may have elevated mood, impulsive behaviour and some grandiosity but essentially remains reality oriented whilst in true mania, the person’s grandiosity is so inflated that they lose touch with reality) …  
        
       
       
        
        Mr Doyle presents as an intelligent man who from middle adolescence onwards has suffered from the moderately severe mood disorder. Although the major manifestation has been depression, it appears he experiences a cyclothymic disorder in which depression rapidly (usually within a day or two) cycles into mania or hypermanic states. He can remain moderately depressed for some time before the cycling takes place. It seems his depression has been long standing, but is responding well to recent changes in his medication. Currently he does not present with either depression or hypermania and whilst appropriately anxious, does not present as having any significant, current mental health problems. He also reports quite a severe problem with alcohol abuse, and has had repeated treatment attempts for this, including detoxification, Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and more recently, dedicated psychotherapy. He appears to have responded quite well over the last few months to his treatment. Indeed it seems he has suffered from both a mood disorder and a substance abuse disorder and each has probably contributed to the effects of the other.” 
        
       
       
      The Remarks on Sentence and Errors (if any) 
       
      
    12 This report of Dr Christopher Lennings was written on 15 July 2005 and was available to the sentencing judge. So too were the reports of a drug and alcohol specialist, Melissa Romeo, a Clinical Nurse Specialist Community Mental Health, John Crossman, and three pages of clinical notes from Dr Fleisch who noted the change in the respondent’s medication from Zoloft (100mg) to Epilim (200mg twice daily).  
     
      
    13 Because the intoxication was the factor which led to the aggravation and, therefore, the offence charged, the sentencing judge spent some time on the reasons for the consuming of alcohol and the culpability of the respondent in relation to it.  
     
      
    14 The sentencing judge referred to the accident and made the following findings: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no doubt whatsoever that the intoxicated state of the offender was the immediate cause of the accident. He had, it would seem, from the very limited evidence available, essentially lost control of the vehicle and indeed was probably in a state approaching unconsciousness in the sense that he had no recollection, which could only mean either a lapse of consciousness or some degree of post traumatic amnesia. It is likely that, given the circumstances of the accident, immediately before the collision, the offender had no idea of what was happening and that was a result of the consumption of alcohol over the period before he left home. However, a difficulty in this case is raised by the fact that the resort to alcohol itself was in the circumstances which I have described already, which included his state of depression and his psychiatric condition. The recourse to alcohol was a means of relieving some of the more serious symptoms. It is relevant that in June he had self-admitted to a detoxification program and the evidence is that on release from that program that he did remain free of any abuse of alcohol up to the date of the accident.” 
        
       
      
    15 The material before the sentencing judge did not prove, even on the balance of probabilities, that the respondent suffered a psychiatric condition. There was no doubt that he was being treated for depression but he is described by those that treated him, largely after the accident, as having been self-referred. He was treated with anti-depressant medication and had been warned, and was aware, that it was essential that alcohol not be consumed while those drugs were being administered. Notwithstanding that warning, the respondent deliberately embarked on what he knew beforehand was to be a significant binge of alcohol consumption. The difficulty that his Honour faced was described in his remarks on sentencing in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “The difficulty in assessing those events is one which was very clearly identified by the Crown. First of all the offender is a demonstrably intelligent, resourceful and self sufficient person. He had, over all of the years of alcohol abuse, over all of the years of quite acute periods of depression, still managed to lead what can only be described as an apparently normal life, certainly to those outside his immediate family. He had at all times remained in employment and not only remained in employment, but on the testimonials which I have in evidence before me (Exhibit 2) a highly valued employee and colleague. He had continued at least materially to support his family, although clearly the impact of his depression and his resort to alcohol was having a corrosive effect on his relationship with his wife.” 
        
       
      
    16 While there is abundant evidence to suggest that the respondent embarked upon his drinking binge for the purpose of “self-medicating”, it is also clear that he did so knowingly and deliberately contrary to the medical advice he had received. Further, there is no evidence that demonstrates an inability on the part of the respondent to understand the consequences of his conduct and no evidence that diminishes his culpability in embarking on a course of conduct, which included the excessive consumption of alcohol, driving and the commission of this offence.  
     
      
    17 His Honour Phegan DCJ cited a passage from R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [86]. I reiterate those comments:  
     
      
       
        
        “[86] Some of the relevant circumstances which can be said ‘objectively’ to affect the ‘seriousness’ of the offence will be personal to the offender at the time of the offence but become relevant because of their causal connection with its commission. This would extend to matters of motivation (for example, duress, provocation, robbery to feed a drug addition), mental state (for example, intention is more serious than recklessness) and mental illness or intellectual disability where that is causally related to the commission of the offence in so far as the offender’s capacity to reason, or to appreciate fully the rightness or wrongness of a particular act, or to exercise appropriate powers of control has been affected;  
        Channon v The Queen 
         (1978) 33 FLR 433 and  
        R v Engert 
         (1995) 84 A Crim R 67. Such matters can be classified as circumstances of the offence and not really circumstances of the offender that might go to the appropriate level of punishment. Other matters which may be said to explain or influence the conduct of the offender or otherwise impinge on her or his moral culpability, for example, youth or prior sexual abuse, are more accurately described as circumstances of the offender and not the offence.” 
        
       
      
    18 His Honour proceeds, purportedly in reliance on Way, to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “The condition of the offender at the time of the commission of this offence was, in my view, a condition relevant to both culpability and to what might be described as the more subjective circumstances.” 
        
       
      
    19 His Honour considered that the condition of the offender, which I take to mean his depression, was relevant to culpability. However, his depression was not causally related to the commission of the offence. It was not his depression which affected the respondent’s “capacity to reason or to appreciate fully the rightness or wrongness of a particular act or to exercise appropriate powers of control”. That capacity was affected solely by the alcohol. Nor can it even be said that the consumption of alcohol, to the extent evidenced here, was done in circumstances where the respondent had a diminished “capacity to reason or to appreciate fully the rightness or wrongness of a particular act or to exercise appropriate powers of control” even if those aspects were confined to the consumption of alcohol itself.  
     
      
    20 The respondent knew, until he was too drunk, precisely what he was doing, appreciated fully the rightness or wrongness of both driving under the influence of alcohol and consuming alcohol and, had he chosen so to do, could have exercised the appropriate powers of control. He chose, deliberately, to embark upon the course that he did, knowing that the effect of the alcohol would be increased because of the drugs he was taking and that the consumption of the alcohol and drugs, as a mixture, could well result in a hypermanic state which could affect his judgment. Even so, there is no evidence that his judgment was affected (other than by alcohol) or that he did not realise that, being drunk, he ought not to drive his motorcar.  
     
      
    21 His Honour referred to the principle in R v Pitt [2005] NSWCCA 304 which in turn reiterates the principle in Engert, supra, and others. The principles are summarised by Howie J in R v AN [2005] NSWCCA 239. AN also deals with a situation where there is a combination of youth and mental disorder. It suffices, for my purposes, to confirm the approach that in cases where a person is suffering from a mental disorder or severe intellectual handicap, general deterrence is a less relevant consideration than is otherwise the case. (See particularly R v Letteri, NSWCCA, unreported, 18 March 1992). In each case, however, it is a matter of balancing the relevant factors in a manner no different from what is involved in every sentencing exercise (R v Engert (1994) 84 A Crim R 67 per Gleeson CJ). The reliance upon these principles by Phegan DCJ must depend upon a finding, at least on the balance of probabilities, that the respondent was suffering a “mental disorder” which affected his capacity to reason and appreciate or control. There was no evidence which could have satisfied his Honour in that regard. 
     
      
       
      Sentence and Principles on Crown Appeal 
       
      
    22 The principles to be applied in a Crown appeal have been stated on a number of occasions and do not bear repeating. (See R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42; R v Prasad (2004) 147 A Crim R 385 at [27]; R v Abboud [2005] NSWCCA 251 at [20] – [23]; R v AA [2006] NSWCCA 55 at [27] – [29]) Relevantly, for the purposes of application of principle to this case, it is necessary to apply the principles of appellate review against the exercise of discretion and not merely substitute my own opinion for that of the sentencing judge. This means the application of long standing principles, that there must be an error of law or principle, or, in the case of a Crown appeal, manifest inadequacy in the sentence imposed. Further, the Court has and exercises a residual discretion, especially having regard to the principles of double jeopardy, to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown. If, notwithstanding the above, the Crown appeal is successful and a different sentence imposed by the Court on appeal, it will generally be less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court and be at the lower end of the available range of sentences.  
     
      
       
      Errors in Sentencing (if any) and Re-sentencing 
       
      
    23 The sentence imposed by his Honour Phegan DCJ is set in the context of two guideline judgments, which must serve as guideposts (or a framework or benchmark) for the sentencing judge. Nevertheless, the act of sentencing is necessarily a highly discretionary exercise and no two offenders are identical. The two guideline judgments to which I refer are, in relation to dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252, and in relation to high range PCA, the Application by the Attorney General under s.37 for a guideline judgment regarding high ranged prescribed concentration of alcohol (2004) 61 NSWLR 305. 
     
      
    24 The Court, in R v Whyte, sets out what it considers to be a “typical case”. That typical case includes the circumstances that the accused is a young offender; of good character with no or limited prior convictions; the incident has caused the death or permanent injury to only one person; the victim is a stranger; there is no or limited injury to the driver or driver’s intimates; there is genuine remorse; and there is a plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value. The Court of Criminal Appeal, in R v Whyte, said, of the typical case, that: 
     
      
       
        
        “A custodial sentence will usually be appropriate unless the offender has a low level of moral culpability, as in the case of momentary inattention or misjudgment.” (per Spigelman CJ at [214] with whom Mason P, Barr, Bell and McClellan JJ agreed) 
        
       
      
    25 The guideline judgment sets out a number of aggravating factors some of which are relevant to the current circumstances and at least one of which, while relevant, is incapable of being used as an aggravating factor. In this case, the extended nature of the injuries inflicted was, fortunately, not as great as it could have been and not as great as the general run of cases. A significant number of people were put at risk, not only the five passengers in the other car, but drivers of other vehicles in and around the offender at the time. The driver was driving erratically and the journey was not a short one. I do not consider, in the circumstances of this case, that the degree of intoxication and/or substance abuse is an aggravating factor because it is the basis upon which the aggravated version of the offence is charged and that factor may not be double counted. The legislature has fixed a 60 percent greater penalty for the aggravated version which occasions grievous bodily harm and, where death is occasioned, the aggravated version of the offence has a 40 percent greater penalty than without aggravation.  
     
      
    26 The guideline judgment sets a benchmark in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “[229] The guideline for offences against s.52A(1) and s.52A(3) of the  
        Crimes Act 1900 
        , for the typical case identified above should be: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Where the offender’s moral culpability is high, a full time custodial head sentence of less than three years (in the case of death) and two years (in the case of grievous bodily harm) would not generally be appropriate.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        [230] In the case of a low level of moral culpability, a lower sentence will, of course, be appropriate.  
        
       
       
        
        [231] In the case of the aggravated version of each offence under s.52A of the  
        Crimes Act 1900 
        , an appropriate increment to reflect the higher maximum penalty than what would generally be a higher level of moral culpability, is required. Other factors, such as the number of victims, will also require an appropriate increment.” 
        
       
      
    27 I have earlier stated that the respondent, unlike the “typical case” is not a young offender. When sentencing young offenders, a greater role is usually given to the most appropriate means of effecting rehabilitation rather than general deterrence.  
     
      
    28 Further, as already stated, the guideline judgment makes clear that a custodial sentence will usually be appropriate unless the offender has a low level of moral culpability.  
     
      
    29 The offender in question was not charged with or convicted of the offence of having a high range prescribed concentration of alcohol. Nevertheless, the circumstances of the offender’s aggravation are that he had a high range PCA at the time of the offence. A high range PCA would not usually be charged in circumstances such as this, amongst other reasons, because of the injury that was occasioned by the incident. In the Application by the Attorney General under s.37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (2004) 61 NSWLR 305, his Honour Justice Howie (with whom Spigelman CJ, Wood CJ at CL, Grove and Dunford JJ agreed) made it clear that, where there are a number of aggravating factors to a significant degree, or where any prior offence is of a high range PCA, a sentence of less severity than full-time imprisonment would generally be inappropriate. It is appropriate, in dealing with the sentence imposed by Phegan DCJ, to look at the usual sentence range for high range PCA in order to gauge the relative adequacy of the sentence imposed. It is also relevant in examining some of the reasons for the offence and any alleged mitigating factors in the commission of the offence. As the Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[142] Generally speaking, the reason for the consumption of alcohol will be irrelevant. The offence is not concerned with punishing the drinking of alcohol, but the driving thereafter. Therefore, it is of no significance that the alcohol was consumed at a wake or a celebration, or because the person was abusing alcohol either generally or on the particular occasion because of some emotional or psychiatric condition.” ( 
        Application by the Attorney General 
         61 NSWLR 305 at [142]) 
        
       
      
    30 There is little or no logic in treating the reason for the consumption of alcohol as irrelevant in a high range PCA offence, but relevant when considering aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm where the aggravation is a high range PCA. That alcohol was abused because of a psychiatric condition is irrelevant to a high range PCA and it is irrelevant to an aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm where alcohol consumption is the aggravating factor. The irrelevance of a psychiatric condition is not by reason of any lack of understanding of the condition, but stems from the proposition, earlier stated, that even if the drinking is understandable, it is the driving while intoxicated that is being punished, and not the drinking itself.  
     
      
    31 The respondent had a number of driving offences which I consider, like the sentencing judge, to be of marginal consideration by way of aggravation. However the respondent was also convicted in April 1999 of a mid-range PCA offence which is an aggravating feature in relation to the offence here in question. Otherwise the respondent had no prior criminal record.  
     
      
    32 His Honour held, in relation to the typical offender described in R v Whyte, supra, that there were a number of features said to be distinguishing. The respondent was not a young offender, a matter to which reference has already been made. There is no criminal history of the respondent, save for the mid-range PCA in April 1999. The injury sustained does not seem to be permanent and some of the persons in the other car were persons taught by the respondent when he was a school teacher and, therefore, not strangers to the appellant. There is also a reference to the respondent’s guilty plea and genuine remorse. His Honour considered that the utilitarian value of the plea was “substantial” because the trial would have been lengthy and difficult, although exactly why that is the case does not seem apparent.  
     
      
    33 His Honour also took into account, to the respondent’s benefit, the rehabilitation program undertaken prior to the commission of the offence and a lack of likelihood of re-offence. While it is to the credit of the respondent that he admitted himself to a detoxification program in 2004 in order to treat his abuse of alcohol, he engaged in the conduct in question, namely the binge drinking and driving, less than one month after the conclusion of the program.  
     
      
    34 The binge drinking as a means of self-medicating was conduct in which the respondent had engaged in the past but the sentencing judge gave much significance to the fact that it had not occurred in the month since the detoxification program.  
     
      
    35 Largely, the issues associated with the subjective and objective elements of the offender and offence, respectively, turned on the “depressive illness” of which mention has already been made.  
     
      
    36 One other matter needs to be discussed. The sentencing judge paid some regard to the special circumstances of the respondent and, in particular, “the value of keeping the offender in the community” because of the work that he performs. That the respondent performs work as a care worker, on a paid basis, for developmentally disabled persons is a factor that, with a number of others, goes to the subjective situation of the offender. Responsibility towards others in one’s occupational life is a two edged sword. On the one hand it shows the otherwise good character and communal responsibility of the offender. On the other hand it shows a person who, more than others, should be aware of the dangers of the conduct and the damage that it can cause. Most persons charged with dangerous driving of this kind, or high range PCA, will have a good character.  
     
      
    37 His Honour compared the current situation with that with which the Court of Criminal Appeal dealt in Douglass v R [2001] NSWCCA 250. The current situation can not be compared with that in Douglass. The Court of Criminal Appeal there suspended a sentence imposed by the trial judge. The conduct there in question caused the offender’s passenger, his wife, to become a quadriplegic, which, in turn, required the offender to engage in 24 hour care for her and made the case exceptional. The Court of Criminal Appeal said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[13] … Although any death or permanent injury to a family member caused by stupidity such as that of the applicant will almost inevitably have repercussions which amount to some punishment of the offender, such consequences cannot, in the ordinary case, be allowed to substitute for that for which Parliament has provided. In this case, the applicant is such that those consequences may fairly be taken into account. The extent to which he has immersed himself in his wife’s care provides justification for the observation of counsel for the applicant that, ‘The applicant has effectively served some three and a half years’ home detention during the time that his wife has been out of hospital since the accident.’ ” 
        
       
      
    38 The comparison between the current case and that of Douglass, cited above, is inappropriate. The respondent, in this case, is not effectively serving home detention to care, on a voluntary basis, for the victim. Here there is no death or permanent injury to a family member, the respondent is not required to provide 24 hour care to the victim on a voluntary basis and any activities of the respondent which could be taken into account, would be performed in the future. The fact that an offender, as part of her/his paid employment, cares for the public or performs a public duty may go to the offender’s good character, but it is not a substitute for the sentence for which Parliament has provided. Moreover, the comparison with Douglass does not pay sufficient regard to the fact that Douglass was, in the manner in which it treated this issue, exceptional and is not a basis for comparison in similar but not identical circumstances.  
     
      
    39 It is clear from the above that the sentence is manifestly inadequate and pays insufficient regard to the aspects of general deterrence and specific deterrence which were necessary.  
     
      
    40 His Honour also reduced the period of disqualification from driving from the prescribed three years to two years on the basis that: “the substantial inconvenience to which he is currently being put will, in my view, serve as an appropriate reminder of the seriousness of the offence, and the consequences of taking charge of a motor vehicle in circumstances of the kind that preceded this offence.” Inconvenience is not an appropriate sentence for an offence of this kind. Moreover, if the rationale of the sentencing judge is accurate in accepting that the depression was the sole or predominant cause of the offence, then no amount of inconvenience will serve to give the respondent an understanding of the consequences of this conduct.  
     
      
    41 While it is clear from the above that I consider the sentence manifestly inadequate and that there is error of principle in the manner in which his Honour has dealt both with the offence and the offender, the depression and attempts at rehabilitation are matters which I take into account in determining that there are special circumstances which warrant a departure from the statutory ratio between non-parole period and the balance of the term. 
     
      
    42 I propose that the Court make the following orders: 
     
      
    a Appeal be allowed;b The sentence imposed by Phegan DCJ on 14 September 2005 be quashed and in lieu thereof the following sentence be imposed:i. Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 18 months commencing 14 September 2005 and expiring on 13 March 2007 with the balance of the term of a further 18 months to expire on 13 September 2008;ii. The prisoner shall be released to parole on 13 March 2007 on the usual conditions relating thereto. iii. The prisoner is disqualified from driving a motor vehicle for a period of three years commencing 18 September 2004 and expiring on 17 September 2007.43 SMART AJ: The Crown appeals against a suspended sentence of 2 years imprisonment (with no non-parole period set) for the offence of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. The offender had a blood alcohol reading of .205. He drove his vehicle onto the wrong side of the road when there was little or no traffic around. He ran into a vehicle travelling on its correct side of the road and containing five members of the one family. Surprisingly, only one member of that family suffered grievous bodily harm. The offence occurred at 9.05pm on 2 July 2004. 
     
      
    44 The judge found that the intoxicated state of the offender was the immediate cause of the accident, that the offender had lost control of the vehicle, was probably in a state of unconsciousness and that it was likely immediately before the collision the offender had no idea of what was happening as a result of the consumption of alcohol over the period before he left home. 
     
      
    45 The judge was troubled by the factors which led to the offender’s resort to alcohol including his state of depression and his psychiatric condition. 
     
      
    46 The judge accepted the applicant’s evidence that his depression went back to his late teens and that, as the years passed, he succumbed to alcohol abuse as a means of dealing with his depression. The judge held: 
     
      
       
        
        “Over time and certainly more recently, the depression was interspersed with periods of euphoria or a hyperactivity, but it was not until the mid 1990s that he recognised the seriousness of the problem and at that point it was already having a damaging effect on his marriage. In fact it was only when his wife told him that he was, or appeared to be, suffering from depression, that he finally acquired some insight into his condition.” 
        
       
      
    47 The judge accepted that in 1997 the offender’s doctor (local general practitioner) diagnosed the offender was suffering from depression. He was placed on Zoloft, but that drug had adverse side effects. An effective treatment was not found and that position continued for a number of years. The judge held” 
     
      
       
        
        “The lack of any effective treatment at the time led to an increase in the offender’s reliance on alcohol as a means of what was described in some of the reports as ‘self medication’ in order to relieve his depression which had relatively short term effects but nonetheless sufficient to make them more attractive than the drugs and other medication which had proved to be unsuccessful.” 
        
       
      
    48 The judge found: 
     
      
       
        
        “[The offender’s] behaviour as a consequence of the combination of his bouts of depression and his increasing use of alcohol led to the separation of the parties to the marriage in January 2001 and this only served not surprisingly to exacerbate the state of depression.” 
        
       
      
    49 In late February 2004 the offender’s former wife referred him to the Curran Centre run by the Greater Western Area Health Service. On 1 March 2004, and at least in part as a result of his wife’s urging, he consulted Dr B Whitmill about his depression. Dr Whitmill records that the offender came with a history of being diagnosed with Bi-Polar Affective Disorder. Dr Whitmill had no note showing that he offender had that disorder in the past. It is not clear who made this diagnosis. The doctor prescribed Epilum to reduce the symptoms of depression and Campral to assist in withdrawing from his alcohol dependence.  
     
      
    50 The offender also attended at the Curran Centre on 1 March 2004 and saw Mr John Crossman, a Clinical Nurse Specialist, Community Mental Health. He continued as the offender’s case manager to 4 January 2005. The offender described to Mr Crossman on 1 March 2004, a deterioration in his mental state over the previous four years becoming more intense and changeable in the last twelve months. The offender said he changed from active and happy to bouts of deep lows. 
     
      
    51 Dr Whitmill saw the offender on 22 April 2004 and thought he was improving. On 24 June 2004 Dr Whitmill reviewed the offender. 
     
      
    52 Mr Crossman records: 
     
      
       
        
        “Tony’s moods gradually settled, however periodic depressive episodes, ‘overwhelming sadness’, as Tony described them, remained a concern. Tony admitted to using alcohol to cope with this. He described such an episode the day of the car accident on 2nd July 2004 when again used alcohol to try and eliminate his distress” 
        
       
      
    53 The offender admitted himself to the Lyndon Withdrawal Unit on 2 May 2004 and voluntarily discharged on 7 June 2004. The Discharge Summary records, “He completed detox of 7 days. Living Skills of 28 days was not completed.” 
     
      
    54 Dr Nathan Fleisch, Psychiatric Registrar, saw the offender on 13 July 2004 and diagnosed Bi-Polar Affective Disorder. Dr Fleisch increased the medication prescribed by Dr Whitmill. 
     
      
    55 Dr Whitmill and Mr Crossman continued to see and treat the offender after the collision of 2 July 2004. 
     
      
    56 Mr Crossman has written that the offender informed him on 8 July 2004 that on the day of the car collision he experienced a sudden and overwhelming feeling of despair descend upon him. Mr Crossman continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “I cannot say with any certainty that Tony’s self medicating on alcohol directly related to him being in a depressive episode of Bi-Polar Affective Disorder, however it is known in the past this is how he has tried to cope with these episodes.” 
        
       
      
    57 Dr Whitmill reported that the offender was “scheduled into Bloomfield in December 2004 when he was voluntarily presented due to depressed mood and thoughts of suicide and consuming large amounts of alcohol and was referred back to drug and alcohol counsellors at that time.” Dr Whitmill continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Doyle has been with a variety of methods including counselling, psychiatric assessment, drug and alcohol counselling, Epilum for Bi-Polar Affective Disorder and antidepressants for depression … 
        
       
       
        
        … a large amount of Mr Doyle’s problems is when he self medicates with alcohol and the most important thing for him to do would be to avoid and abstain from alcohol in the future.”  
        
       
       
      The offender gave evidence of being very depressed in April 2004 and contemplating suicide. 
       
      
    58 The offender gave evidence that on the day of the collision he had a serious bout of depression. He had to leave work. He telephoned a replacement staff member, who took over. The offender left work after an hour and went home. He had abstained from drinking after leaving Lyndon – a period of nearly four weeks. When he got home he drank heavily – at least half a bottle of vodka. His depression became very severe. His former wife came over to his home, having been contacted by members of his family, and they “discussed things and had some coffee and got through it and then my mood then just lifted, it went into that ‘over the top’ state.”  
     
      
    59 The offender said that it was very hard to describe how he was feeling. He gave this evidence: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “Q. Are you in control? 
           
          A. I would say no, not completely in control … its almost very spontaneous, well you do things without considering. 
           
           
            
            Q. … did you think about your drinking when you were elated like that 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       A. No I didn’t consider it.” 
       
      
    60 The offender said that when he overcame the depressive bout he decided to go to a friend’s house to play music in accordance with an earlier arrangement. Spontaneously, he said to himself, ‘I am going to play now.’ He felt really good. When asked if he had considered what he’d drunk before he got in the car he replied, “I wasn’t thinking about anything.” 
     
      
    61 The offender stated that he drove on the night of the collision because he had gone through the stages of depression and then just did it. He could not make sense of what he did. 
     
      
    62 The offender said that when he drank to overcome his depression he was usually at home. He did not think that he had some type of control over when he would drink when he was depressed. He stayed at home when he was depressed as he did not want people to see him in that state. 
     
      
    63 The offender agreed that if he was at work and an episode of depression came on he had enough control to wait until he arrived home. He also agreed that it was his choice to drink when he was depressed and that he would have had some control. He agreed that he was taking Epilum on the night of the collision. He knew that he should not drink and take Epilum at the same time. The offender said that at the time he was not thinking rationally and he did not consider the side effects of drinking and taking the medication at the same time on the day of the collision. He had been aware before that day that the medication could interact badly with alcohol. The offender gave this evidence: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “Q. Would you say that you, on at least some level, made a decision to get into the car to drive to your friend’s place? 
          
         
        
       
       A. I did decide to go there, yes. 
       
       … 
       
        
         
          
           
            
            A. I can’t say I didn’t have a choice but it was very spontaneous that I did.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    64 Despite suffering from depression the offender seems to have maintained employment and was regarded as a highly valued employee and colleague. He assisted to support his family materially. He also discharges fatherly duties for his children. The judge found that the offender was a demonstrably intelligent, resourceful and self-sufficient person. To those outside his immediate family he appeared to lead a normal life. 
     
      
    65 The offender was seen by Dr C J Lennings, a well qualified and experienced psychologist, for medico-legal purposes. The offender told Dr Lennings that “the deep depression periods usually only last for a few days but he switches to a hypermanic state in which he feels enthusiastic and energetic and in these states he can resume his employment. He says he is aware that his colleagues regard him as strange at times.” 
     
      
    66 Dr Lennings wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “There seems some debate as to whether [the offender] has a genuine bi-polar disorder or whether he suffers from depression which cycles into a genuine hypermanic state (… in a hypermanic state a person may have elevated mood impulsive behaviour and some grandiosity but essentially remains reality oriented whilst in true mania the person’s grandiosity is so inflated they lose touch with reality).” 
        
       
      
    67 The offender told Dr Lennings of his alcohol problems and of having sought treatment for them and that for a month prior to the accident he had battled with “waves of depression”. Dr Lennings wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the day of the accident [the offender’s] lapse into drinking seems associated with a worsening of his mood state.” 
        
       
      
    68 The offender gave to Dr Lennings substantially the same account of the events in the morning, afternoon and evening of the day of the collision as he gave in evidence. 
     
      
    69 Relying on the history given by the offender and an assessment of him, Dr Lennings thought that the offender had, from middle adolescence suffered from a moderately severe mood disorder. Dr Lennings continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although the major manifestation has been depression, it appears he experiences a cyclothymic disorder in which depression rapidly (usually in a day or two) cycles into manic or hypermanic states. He can remain moderately depressed for some time before the cycling takes place.” 
        
       
      
    70 Dr Lennings, in dealing with the effect of alcohol wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Doyle gives an account of the offence that indicates his use of alcohol was a significant contributing factor. He also gives an account that suggests his use of alcohol was triggered by a sudden worsening of his depression on the day of the offence. It seems he has used alcohol in the past as a mood regulator, to no good effect, and the unfortunate circumstances of the day appear to have unfolded as a function of a time worn path of using alcohol to self-medicate his depression. Although my interview is not sufficient to investigate the hypothesis, I wonder if the alcohol might not trigger the swing to mania (as such would represent an effective form of self-medication from the patient’s viewpoint as euphoric is a far more pleasant emotional state than depression). Unfortunately, in a euphoric state a person often fails to consider the consequences of their actions, they feel invulnerable, and leaves them prone to ill-considered and, as seems to have occurred in this case, potentially tragic outcomes.” 
        
       
      
    71 The question raised by Dr Lemmings is an intriguing and difficult one. The materials do not enable it to be answered. 
     
      
    72 The judge regarded this as a troubling and difficult sentencing exercise and so do I. On the one hand the alcohol offered a way of escaping depression which had reached a level of intolerable intensity, after building up often over some days. On the other hand, there was an opportunity for judgment and control which the offender did not exercise. One of the difficulties is determining the significance of that opportunity for a person in the condition of the offender on the day of the collision. 
     
      
    73 The criminality charged lies not in drinking but in driving a car dangerously and also heavily under the influence of alcohol. For many years much emphasis has been placed on the dangers of drink driving. 
     
      
    74 The judge accepted that the offender was intelligent and mature, with years of alcohol abuse behind him. There were obviously times when he was not seriously depressed and not under the influence of alcohol abuse. The judge upheld the Crown submission that it was impossible to accept that on the day of the collision the offender was so overwhelmed by his condition that he, in effect, was not in a position to exercise any judgment about the intended bout of drinking, its effects and driving afterwards. The judge held that in those circumstances the level of culpability was significant. The judge agreed with these Crown submissions: 
     
      
       
        
        “This was an offender who was more than capable of foreseeing the consequences of consuming excessive alcohol on this occasion or even starting to consume alcohol in circumstances where he knew from past experience it might lead to excess. He was also aware that having placed himself in that position he might fail to exercise appropriate judgment at a later stage. …” 
        
       
      
    75 The judge thought that by the day of the collision the offender had reached a point where things were literally running out of control. The judge held that the acute state of depression of the offender on that day must be taken into account, but it did not effectively eliminate the element of culpability. That conclusion is correct. 
     
      
    76 The judge paid careful attention to the subjective features of the respondent. He was satisfied that the offender’s remorse was genuine and that he was unlikely to re-offend. He acknowledged, correctly, the very favourable references in support of the offender. 
     
      
    77 The judge regarded the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty as quite substantial, as he thought that a not guilty plea may have resulted in a very lengthy and difficult trial. The prosecution evidence as to the dangerous driving and the level of alcoholic abuse was cogent but it would have taken some days to lead, unless shortened by agreement. The judge was probably contemplating extended evidence would be led on the issue whether the offender had a genuine Bi-Polar disorder and had lost touch with reality, or other evidence to the effect that his severe depression was very disabling and deprived him of the ability to think rationally. That would have necessitated a more detailed history from the offender and possibly also from his wife. There would also have had to be more detailed expert evidence to which the Crown might have wished to respond. The expert evidence placed before the judge lay in a small compass. It should not be assumed that this would happen at a trial. Depending on how the trial was conducted and the evidence led, I could envisage a trial taking the best part of two weeks. There could be debate whether the expert evidence went to guilt or sentence. If the evidence called by the offender did not reach the level necessary to bear upon the question of guilt, a trial may be much shorter. The judge’s view that there were problems facing the Crown in relation to the selection of the charge cannot be sustained.  
     
      
    78 The judge took an unduly benign view of the value of the plea of guilty. Its utilitarian value was not quite as high as he suggested. The indications were that the expert evidence would not reach the level required to provide an acceptable defence 
     
      
    79 The judge expressed the view that the level of injury once account was taken of the ingredients of the offence, and the prior record of the offender were matters of only marginal, if any, relevance to sentencing in the present case. Grievous bodily harm is an important element of the offence and an important consideration in sentencing. The injury suffered by the 9 year old child was serious and it was fortunate that it responded to, and was resolved by conservative treatment. Two of the traffic offences of the offender, namely that in 1999 of driving with middle range concentration of alcohol, and that in 2003 of exceeding the speed limit by more than 15 kmh, particularly the former, do not assist the offender. I do not think that they can be regarded as of marginal relevance. The traffic offences many years earlier can be disregarded. When the judge spoke of the offender being of good character, he was relying on the absence of any non-traffic offences, no previous major traffic offences, and the good qualities he had as emerged from the many references. 
     
      
    80 What led the judge to suspend the sentence was this combination of factors: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) the offender was most unlikely to re-offend, had good prospects of rehabilitation and was applying himself to the task of rehabilitation. He had also shown remorse; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the offender has rendered sterling service to others; “whether as a school teacher or as a care worker, his overriding commitment has been to assist those most in need of assistance”; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) he has embarked upon a substantial amount of voluntary work for the benefit of the community; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) the offence was entirely out of character and was not “the typical case of someone who has a record of reckless disregard of the public in the way that they drive a motor vehicle.” The word “typical” is not unimportant; 
        
       
       
        
        (e) the onset of an acute state of depression drove the offender to drink; “the exceptional circumstances that arose from his condition at that time should be taken into account …”; 
        
       
       
        
        (f) there was a very real risk that the significant progress which the offender had made to remove from his life the causes of the offence would be set back if he was sentenced to a period of full time custody; and 
        
       
       
        
        (g) the extremely valuable work which he does as a care worker would be interrupted to the detriment of those acutely in need of such care and his sons would be deprived for his period in custody of his financial support. 
        
       
      
    81 The judge did not consider the matters mentioned in (f) and (g) as in any way decisive. However, the judge held that they combined with all the other considerations to point to a conclusion that to put the offender in prison for any period of time would be in a number of respects be counter productive. The judge regarded this case as an exceptional one. 
     
      
    82 I would not cavil with the proposition that good care workers are in limited, if not short, supply. The judge was aware of this and was probably aware of the position in Orange.  
     
      
    83 The judge and the parties before us referred to and discussed a number of well-known decisions. I have preferred to focus on the unusual facts of the present case. 
     
      
    84 Essentially, an intelligent man, suffering from severe depression which led to him consuming a high amount of alcohol, drove a vehicle along a country road which was not carrying much traffic, crossed to the wrong side of the road and ran into a vehicle travelling on its correct side of the road in the opposite direction, and carrying five people, and inflicted grievous bodily harm on one of the passengers. It was dangerous driving with the offender having a blood alcohol reading of over 0.2. That is conduct which cannot be tolerated and merits stern punishment. 
     
      
    85 The judge has tended to underestimate the gravity of the offender’s culpability and criminality. 
     
      
    86 In sentencing, the good works and good qualities of an offender should be taken into account. It is not uncommon for prospects of treatment to be better in the community than in gaol, but that does not warrant, usually, a non-custodial sentence.  
     
      
    87 The hardships to those needing care and the offender’s children fall far short of that which is required to avoid a custodial sentence. 
     
      
    88 The combined matters on which the judge relied are not sufficient to justify not imposing a full time custodial sentence. They do bear upon the length of the sentence which should be imposed. The sentence imposed is manifestly inadequate for the criminality revealed. 
     
      
    89 In re-sentencing I have taken into account the affidavit of 24 February 2006 of the offender. He is still employed as a Residential Care Support Worker on a full time basis. He complies with his doctor’s directions “to take medication for my mental health disorders” and has specified what he takes. The offender continues to see the Drug and Alcohol Specialist in Orange Community Health Centre on a regular basis. Her report of 22 February 2006 is encouraging. The offender is committed to his rehabilitation. He needs to live in town on workdays and this has involved added expense. He has also struggled to pay legal fees. He continues to have follow-up interviews through the Shade Programme. His mental health is currently stable. He will be referred back to the mental health worker if necessary. The offender continues to have contact with his children on a regular basis and to pay maintenance for their support. 
     
      
    90 The applicant received his suspended sentence on 14 September 2005. It is now April 2006. A period of 7 months has elapsed. That is a substantial period. It is not suggested that there has been delay on the part of anyone. The offender was served with the Notice of Appeal on 2 October 2005. 
     
      
    91 Notwithstanding the double jeopardy to which the offender has been exposed, the evidence adduced on this appeal which has caused me to pause, and the lapse of time, the Court should still intervene and re-sentence. The offence was serious. Driving of the type in question must be adequately punished. 
     
      
    92 There are special circumstances warranting a longer period on parole. They include the offender’s need for rehabilitation and extended supervision. This is his first custodial sentence. 
     
      
    93 Having regard to the lapse of time since sentencing, double jeopardy, this Court’s order placing the offender in prison after he had received a suspended sentence, his observance of the terms of the bond attached to the suspended sentence, I agree with the orders proposed by Justice Rothman. The lowest permissible total sentence and non-parole period which could be imposed are respectively three years and 18 months. The dating of the sentences from 14 September 2005 recognises the aspect of double jeopardy and the period which the applicant has served pursuant to the bond and the suspended sentence in complying with the conditions imposed. He has done what was intended. 
     
      
    94 In reducing the period of disqualification from 3 years to 2 years, the judge was influenced by the time and difficulty which the offender experienced in travelling from his home to his place of work in Orange. It took several hours and he often had to walk and hitch hike. I do not regard that as an irrelevant consideration. However, the gravity of the offence is such that that consideration cannot prevail and lead to a reduction in the period of disqualification. Arising out of the offence in question anything less than a disqualification for three years would be inadequate. The judge dated the disqualification from 18 September 2004, being the day on which the police attended the offender’s address and suspended his licence. Part of the period of 3 years will be spent in custody. 
     
      
    95 I agree with the orders proposed by Justice Rothman. Although this judgment does entail the applicant serving a custodial sentence, I take the liberty of expressing the view for the possible assistance of future employers that, given the circumstances and nature of the offence, the qualities of the offender and his determined efforts at rehabilitation, this sentence should not be a bar to future employment in the fields of aged and disability care.

     REGINA v IDA RONEN, NITZAN RONEN, IZHAR RONEN 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 KIRBY J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: After a lengthy trial before Whealy J (the Judge) and a jury, Ida Ronen and her two sons, Nitzan Ronen and Izhar Ronen, were convicted of two offences contrary to the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (the Act) arising from a conspiracy between them to defraud the Commonwealth of taxation revenue. They were sentenced to terms of imprisonment on 7 October 2005; [2005] NSWSC 991. By notices dated 26 October 2005 the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed against what is asserted to be the inadequacy of the sentences imposed. The Ronens have sought leave to appeal against the sentences and for convenience I shall refer to them as the applicants. 
     
      
    4 The first charge alleged a conspiracy between about 1 October 1991 and 15 September 1995 contrary to s 86A of the Act. The second charge alleged a conspiracy between 16 September 1995 and 6 February 2001 to commit an offence against s 29D of the Act contrary to s 86(2) of the Act. Although there were two counts on the indictment, it was the Crown’s allegation that there was a single conspiracy on foot over the period from 1991 to 2001. The two counts reflected the fact that during the period of the conspiracy there was a change to the statutory provisions prescribing the offences charged. According to the relevant provision at the time of the commission of each of the offences, the prescribed maximum penalty for each offence was relevantly imprisonment for 20 years. However, after the offences were committed but before the appellants were sentenced, there was another legislative change and a question arises as to the effect of that change on the maximum penalty prescribed for the offences. 
     
      
    5 Mrs Ronen also pleaded guilty at the commencement of the sentencing proceedings to an offence contrary to s 31 of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth). That offence alleged that between 7 and 10 April 2000 she was knowingly concerned in conducting 11 cash transactions each of less than $10,000 in value which were structured so as to avoid reporting requirements under that Act. The maximum penalty for that offence is relevantly five years imprisonment. 
     
      
    6 Mrs Ronen was sentenced as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Count 1: Imprisonment for five years to commence on 28 January and to expire on 27 January 2010. 
         
         
        Count 2: Imprisonment for six years and six months to commence on 28 January 2007 and to expire on 27 July 2009. 
         
         
        S 31 offence: Imprisonment for eight months to commence on 28 January 2005 and to expire on 27 September 2005. 
        
       
       
      This is a total sentence of imprisonment for eight years and six months from 28 January 2005. The Judge specified a non-parole period of four years and six months to expire on 27 July 2009. 
       
      
    7 Nitzan Ronen and Izhar Ronen were each sentenced as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: Imprisonment for five years to commence on 28 January 2005 
         
         
        Count 2: Imprisonment for six years six months to commence on 28 January 2007. 
         
        
       
      This is a total sentence of eight years and six months from 28 January 2005. The Judge specified a non-parole period of five years and six months to expire on 27 July 2010. 
       
       
      The facts 
      
    8 The facts upon which the Judge sentenced the applicants were not in dispute and can be summarised briefly. The offences arose during the course of the operation of a clothing business that involved a number of companies trading in the retail and wholesale clothing industry. Each of the applicants was a director of, and shareholder in, these companies. There were a number of factory outlets selling clothing manufactured by the companies to the public at discount prices. These shops were operated by Ida Ronen. They had a large cash turnover. The applicants agreed to defraud the Commonwealth of income tax by concealing a substantial proportion of the cash income from these shops. 
     
      
    9 The Judge stated when sentencing the applicants that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that over the period of about a decade that this conspiracy was in operation the amount concealed was somewhere between 15 and 17 million dollars. 
     
      
    10 The agreement was that Ida Ronen on behalf of herself and her sons took most, if not all, of the cash received at the shops and distributed it to herself and her sons for their own purposes. Much of it was sent overseas. At the time of their arrest there was a sum of $209,525.00 in a safe in Mrs Ronen’s unit ready for distribution to Nitzan Ronen. Mrs Ronen meticulously recorded the actual takings from each of the shops and the amounts distributed by her. None of the cash taken by the applicants was declared as income in their personal tax returns or those of the companies. 
     
      
    11 After 1 July 2000 the Goods and Services Tax was introduced. The applicants had to devise a system for overcoming this hurdle. Mrs Ronen, secretly from her sons, involved her then de facto husband in the conspiracy in order that he could devise calculations to take into account the GST. These calculations were recorded in a computer kept at Mrs Ronen’s unit. Mrs Ronen also set about creating a set of false till rolls that would show a reduced amount of cash received at the shops. These false records were created on a cash register kept at Mrs Ronen’s unit for this purpose. By this method no more than ten per cent of the cash takings was banked. 
     
      
    12 The conspiracy came to light by chance during the lawful interception of a phone service in connection with an unrelated matter. Conversations alerted the authorities to the fact that the applicants were sending large amounts of money overseas. Surveillance was then undertaken on Mrs Ronen’s home where eventually a search warrant was executed on 7 February 2001. On that date the three applicants were arrested. 
     
      
    13 The additional offence to which Mrs Ronen pleaded guilty related to the amount of $99,395 sent to a bank in Israel to accounts of which she was the beneficiary. This was cash taken from the retail shops and had not been declared as income. On 7 April 2000 the money was collected by a chartered accountant on Mrs Ronen’s behalf and banked into a number of different banks by way of amounts structured so as to avoid the reporting conditions under the relevant legislation. The Judge held that this was part and parcel of the conspiracy in which the applicants were involved. 
     
      
    14 Following their convictions but before the sentencing proceedings, the appellants entered into a settlement of civil proceedings between them, their companies and the Commissioner of Taxation (the Commissioner). The settlement followed mediation sought by the applicants. I shall refer to this matter in more detail later as one of the applicant’s grounds of appeal relates to the weight to be given to the fact that the applicants had paid a considerable amount of money to the Commissioner as a penalty for their failure to divulge all of their income during the period of the conspiracy. 
     
      
       
      Subjective considerations 
      
    15 Mrs Ronen was aged 72 at the date of sentencing and was not in good physical health. She suffered from osteoporosis, lower back pain and osteoarthritis of both knees. She had conjunctivitis and bilateral cataracts. She also suffered high blood pressure and at the time of sentencing was anxious and depressed. There was a psychiatric report in evidence that set out her background but it is unnecessary to repeat it here, as it has no particular relevance to the outcome of the appeals. Mrs Ronen learned the clothing trade in Israel and established a business there before coming to Australia in the 1970s with her two sons. The Judge accepted that, as well as being a successful business woman, she worked hard to establish her business and was a good mother to her sons. 
     
      
    16 Because of her age and poor physical and mental health, the Judge concluded that Mrs Ronen would find the prison experience more difficult than it would be for a younger woman in good health. The psychiatrist recommended that she be referred to the Prison Psychiatric Services if she were sentenced to imprisonment. 
     
      
    17 There were a large number of references and testimonials placed before the sentencing court attesting to Mrs Ronen’s qualities as a mother, grandmother and friend. They noted her charitable works and the assistance she had provided to Bulgarian immigrants arriving in this country. They also referred to her contrition and the responsibility she felt towards her two sons in relation to the offending. 
     
      
    18 Nitzan Ronen was 47 years of age at the date of sentencing. He was married and had four children ranging from six and a half years to one year of age. The children were having difficulties coping with the loss of their father to prison. There was a psychiatric report in evidence stating that he admitted his guilt and regretted his conduct and the effect of it upon his children. He was depressed and angry. 
     
      
    19 There were also a number of references placed before the Court relating to this applicant. The Judge said of these: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The picture created is of a philanthropic man with strong feelings for his own family and for other families with difficulties. He is also depicted, as is undoubtedly the case, as a hard and industrious worker with considerable skill and experience in the clothing industry. 
        
       
      
    20 Izhar Ronen was 46 years of age at the date of sentencing. He was born in Israel and came to Australia at the age of 15. Like his brother he became involved in the clothing business shortly after completing his Higher School Certificate. He was married with two children aged 17 and 16. His younger child, a son, had been particularly affected by his father’s imprisonment. The applicant told the psychiatrist that he believed he had brought shame on the family. There were also in evidence testimonials as to his generosity and hard work. 
     
      
    21 The Judge said this about the general subjective circumstances of the applicants: 
     
      
       
        
         
        There is an obviously tragic aspect to the situation in which each of the offenders now finds himself or herself. Each offender is a person of previous unblemished good character. Each has worked very hard in the establishment and continuance of a highly successful business. Each offender is well regarded in the community especially in the Jewish community where they have practiced philanthropy at a high level. Each is regarded as an outstanding family member and is well regarded by friends and acquaintances in the business world and generally. Yet, each is imprisoned awaiting sentence for crimes of the most serious content. 
         
         
        
       
      The Judge noted the impact of a sentence of imprisonment would have on the families of the brothers but could not find that there was anything exceptional that would permit him to impose a lesser sentence on that account. 
       
      
    22 Although the applicants had pleaded not guilty to the offences on the indictment and the trial had been a lengthy one, the Judge found that contrition and remorse had been demonstrated by them. He noted that after they were convicted “the realisation of their wrongdoing came home to each offender in a markedly emphatic manner”. The Judge also noted that the settlement of the civil actions with the Commissioner was a practical demonstration of remorse. Notwithstanding that remorse and contrition came late in the day, the Judge held that it was a matter that he could and should take into account in assessing their likelihood of re-offending and their prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
       
      The application for leave to appeal 
      
    23 There were four grounds argued on behalf of the applicants as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in finding that the maximum penalty for the offences under s 86A and s86(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), (the conspiracy offences), was 20 years imprisonment. 
         
         
        Ground 2: The sentencing judge failed to have proper regard to: 
         
          
           
            
            (a) the imposition of penalty tax upon the applicant's prior to the sentencing proceedings; 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (b) the general and specific deterrence attached to the imposition of penalty tax, and 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (c) the level of punishment inherent in the imposition of penalty tax. 
            
           
          
         
         
        Ground 3: The sentencing judge was in error in partially accumulating the sentence he imposed on count 2 with the sentence imposed in relation to count 1. 
         
         
        Ground 4: The sentences imposed in relation to the conspiracy offences were manifestly excessive. 
        
       
       
      The maximum penalty 
      
    24 The Judge found that the maximum penalty for each of the counts in the indictment was imprisonment for 20 years. As has already been noted, that was the penalty prescribed in respect of each of the offences charged by the provision creating the offence. However, s 86(2) of the Act, the most recent provision in the Act dealing with defrauding the Commonwealth, was repealed on 24 May 2001 by the Criminal Code Amendment (Theft, Fraud, Bribery and Related Offences) Act 1999 (the Amendment Act). In its place a series of offences were created in the Criminal Code (CTH) (the Code) by s 135.4. The maximum penalty prescribed for offences falling within that section is imprisonment for ten years. 
     
      
    25 When introducing the bill containing the new Code provisions on 24 November 1999, the Attorney General described the amendments as providing “a wide range of modern offences to protect the Commonwealth Government and public officials from criminals who would cause them financial harm or seek to obstruct, threatened or harm them”. The Attorney also stated, “The bill……replaces existing Crimes Act 1914 offences with a modern and transparent scheme for preventing and punishing theft, fraud, bribery, forgery and related offences”. He also noted that the bill “brings about uniformity in penalties for key offences, which have long differed between state and federal jurisdictions, and between different acts” and referred to the maximum penalty of 10 years for the fraud offence. 
     
      
    26 The Explanatory memorandum in relation to the Bill contained the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Like proposed s135.1, proposed s135.4 is a series of general dishonesty offences. Proof of deception is not required. Indeed it has all the same components as proposed s 135.1 except there must be a conspiracy. …… The other difference is that the maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment. While conspiracy usually carries the same penalty as the primary offence, the proposed penalty reflects what was recommended for the Model Criminal Code (May 1997 report) and by the Gibbs Committee. Proposed s 135.1 will replace sub-s 86(2) of the  
        Crimes Act 1914 
         which has a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. This is far too high and is inconsistent with the penalty for similar offences in other jurisdictions. The usual maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment. 
        
       
      
    27 The repeal of the previous provisions of the Act in relation to conspiracy to defraud was effected by items 149 and 158 of Schedule 2 of the Amendment Act. There was a transitional provision contained in item 418 of Schedule 2 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        418. Transitional - pre-commencement of offences 
         
         
        1. Despite the amendment or repeal of a provision by this Schedule, that provision continues to apply, after the commencement of this item, in relation to: 
         
         
          
          (a) an offence committed before the commencement of this item; or 
           
           
          (b) proceedings for an offence alleged to have been committed before the commencement of this item; or 
           
           
          (c) any matter connected with, or arising out of, such proceedings 
           
           
          as if the amendment or repeal had not been made. 
           
          
         
        2. Subitem (1) does not limit the operation of section 8 of the  
        Acts Interpretation Act 1901 
        
       
      
    28 Section 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        8 Effect of repeal  
         
         
        Where an Act repeals in the whole or in part a former Act, then unless the contrary intention appears the repeal shall not:  
         
         
          
          (a) revive anything not in force or existing at the time at which the repeal takes effect; or 
           
          (b) affect the previous operation of any Act so repealed, or anything duly done or suffered under any Act so repealed; or 
           
          (c) affect any right privilege obligation or liability acquired accrued or incurred under any Act so repealed; or 
           
          (d) affect any penalty forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any offence committed against any Act so repealed; or 
           
          (e) affect any investigation legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right privilege obligation liability penalty forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid; 
           
          and any such investigation legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted continued or enforced, and any such penalty forfeiture or punishment may be imposed, as if the repealing Act had not been passed. 
          
         
        
       
      
    29 A further statutory provision relevant to the argument arising from this ground of appeal is s 4F(2) of the Crimes Act which relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Where a provision of a law of the Commonwealth reduces the penalty or maximum penalty for an offence, the penalty or the maximum penalty as reduced extends to offences committed before the commencement of that provision, but the reduction does not affect any penalty imposed before that commencement. 
        
       
       
      This provision was inserted into the Act by the  
      Crimes Legislation Amendment Act 1987 (Cth) 
       and a similar provision had been contained in s 45A of the  
      Acts Interpretation Act 
      . The Explanatory Memorandum in relation to the amendments made by s 4F(2) and related provisions states: 
       
        
         
        The intention of those sub sections is to ensure that a change in a penalty will not be to the detriment of a person convicted of an offence committed before, but for which he or she was sentenced subsequent to, the change. 
        
       
      
    30 The applicants argue that s 4F(2) operates in respect of the provisions under which they were charged such that the repeal of those offences from the Crimes Act and the creation of replacement offences in the Code with a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years resulted in the applicable maximum penalty to which the applicants were liable being 10 years and not 20 years as prescribed by the repealed provisions. 
     
      
    31 The argument was that, because the offences in the Code are in substance the same as those with which the applicants were charged, it should be taken that the maximum penalty for an offence of defrauding or conspiring to defraud the Commonwealth has been reduced regardless of the particular statutory basis for such an offence. It was submitted that the term “an offence” for the purposes of s 4F(2) should be considered broadly in order to achieve the beneficial purpose of the provision rather than denying its effect by a too formalistic or technical approach. The argument was that, although item 418 of the transitional provisions in the Amendment Act does not affect the application of s 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act, s 8 only applies “unless the contrary intention appears” and s 4F(2) evinces a contrary intention displacing s 8. 
     
      
    32 In my opinion the argument should be rejected for very much the same reasons as the sentencing Judge rejected it. The simple fact is that the maximum sentence prescribed by the repealed Crimes Act provisions were not reduced in any real sense. It is artificial in my view to describe the repeal of one offence and the enactment of a different offence as a reduction in the sentence for the repealed offence. Although the offences in s 135.4 of the Code may cover the same criminal activity as did the repealed Crimes Act provisions, they are different offences with different elements and are affected by the Code’s provisions in relation to criminal responsibility in Chapter 2. The provisions of the Crimes Act were interpreted according to common law principles that are not completely identical to those that apply to the Code offences. For example, there is no requirement under the Code that the prosecution prove that the offender used dishonest means in carrying out the fraud as there was under the provision in the Act: see Peters v The Queen (1998) 192 CLR 493. It is clear from the second reading speech of the Attorney General that the new offences in the Code were not seen by the legislature as being simply a re-enactment of the offences in the Crimes Act and they should not be treated as if they were. 
     
      
    33 Had the legislature intended that the penalty for the repealed offences should be reduced in line with the new Code offences, it could have said so in plain language within the transitional provisions. I doubt that the legislature intended that this result should be derived from the somewhat convoluted path argued for by the applicants. To the contrary, the specific transitional provision in item 418 on its face and by its preservation of the operation of s 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act contemplates that the repealed provisions would continue to apply to offences committed before 24 May 2001 in all their aspects including the prescribed maximum penalties. 
     
      
    34 Of course it should be borne in mind that it was not just the fraud provisions of the Crimes Act that were being repealed and replaced with new offences in the Code. The Attorney noted in the second reading speech that the bill “simplifies and reduces the size of the Commonwealth statute book by repealing over 250 offences which cover conduct dealt with by the new offences”. The fraud offences were only part of the scheme of offences that was introduced into the Code by the amending legislation. 
     
      
    35 Section 4F is a general provision concerned not only with the reduction in penalty for an offence but also with the situation where the penalty for an offence is increased. In my opinion it is concerned with variations in penalties for existing offences and not with the creation of new offences, whether or not they happen to correspond in some general, unspecific way with offences that they replace. 
     
      
    36 The applicant’s relied upon R v Melville (2003) 27 WAR 224. That was a case where the offence of rape under a provision of the Criminal Code (WA) had been repealed and replaced by an offence of sexual assault in the same Act. The penalty for rape was life imprisonment but the penalty for sexual assault was imprisonment for 14 years. The new offence was broader than the offence of rape because of the expanded definition of “sexual penetration”. Section 10 of the Sentencing Act (WA) stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        If the statutory penalty for an offence changes between the time when the offender committed it and the time when the offender is sentenced for it the lesser statutory penalty applies for the purposes of sentencing the offender. 
         
        
       
      
    37 The question arose whether the statutory penalty for rape had been reduced to 14 years imprisonment. A majority of the Court, Murray and Anderson JJ, thought that it had by reason of s 10. They interpreted the words “offence” in that section to mean “an act or omission committed in circumstances which make it punishable as an offence”; per Murray J. There was an identity between the act and the circumstances in both the old offence of rape and the new offence of sexual assault: all of the ingredients of the offence of rape having been included in the offence of sexual assault: per Anderson J. 
     
      
    38 McKechnie J was in the minority. He held that the offence of rape had not become the offence of sexual assault because the elements of the two offences were different. His Honour interpreted s 10 to read in the case before the Court, “If the statutory penalty for rape changes between the time when the offender committed it (ie prior to 1 April 1986) and the time the offender is sentenced for it (ie 2003) the lesser statutory penalty applies for the purpose of sentencing the offender.” 
     
      
    39 With respect I prefer the reading of the section adopted by McKechnie J. As did his Honour, I believe that such a provision is intended to operate only where the actual penalty for the precise offence is amended and not where an existing offence is replaced with another offence even though the two offences may have some common features or may be addressing similar prohibited conduct. In any event, the present is a different situation than that which was being considered by the Court in Melville because here, as I have already noted, it was not simply the replacement of one offence in one statute with another offence in the same statute. There were specific transitionary provisions contained in the amending legislation that in my view operated according to their terms. Section 4F(2) did not in my opinion evince a contrary intention to s 8, a provision that was specifically applied by the transitional provisions. 
     
      
    40 The Crown relied upon Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Derbas (2002) 167 FLR 269 a decision of this Court dealing with offences under the Excise Act (Cth). In that case there was an increase in the prescribed pecuniary penalty for an offence after the commission of the offence by the respondent. In the District Court, and contrary to the view taken by the sentencing magistrate, it was held that the increase in penalty did not apply. A case was then stated to this Court. The section being considered was s 4F(1) that in effect provides that an increased penalty does not apply to an offence committed before the increase came into effect. The Court held that the transitional provision relating to the increased penalty was specific and prevailed over the general provision in s 4F(1) so that the increased penalty was to apply to the respondent. Although this is an example of a specific provision over-riding the general provision, that was a much clearer case than the present and I do not believe it assists significantly in determining the present ground of appeal. 
     
      
    41 However, notwithstanding that I am of the opinion that the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 20 years for the conspiracy offences, it may not necessarily follow that the fact that the maximum penalty for the fraud offences in the Code is imprisonment for 10 years is totally irrelevant. The Judge in the present case, as a matter of fairness and justice, took into account the change in attitude of the Parliament to the seriousness of the type of offences committed by the applicants when determining the appropriate sentences to impose upon them. The Crown has argued on its appeal that the Judge was in error in his approach in this regard and I will address this matter when dealing with the Crown appeal. 
     
      
       
      The relevance of penalty tax 
      
    42 As was noted earlier, the applicants were prepared to enter into mediation with the Commissioner in relation to outstanding civil proceedings in respect of unpaid taxes and, before the sentencing proceedings commenced, had entered into terms of settlement with the Commissioner. Those terms are to remain secret but some reference can be made to the result of the settlement. It has been noted that the Judge took into account the conduct of the applicants in this regard as being evidence of contrition on their part. 
     
      
    43 The Judge had evidence before him that the Commissioner had imposed penalties under s 226J of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (the Tax Act) of $7,180.508.00. By the time that the appeal was heard the whole of that amount had been paid. 
     
      
    44 Section 226J is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        226J Penalty tax where shortfall caused by intentional disregard of law 
         
         
        Subject to this Part, if: 
         
         
          
          (a) the taxpayer has a tax shortfall for a year; and 
           
           
          (b) the shortfall or part of that was caused by the intentional disregard by the taxpayer or by a registered tax agent of this Act or the regulations; 
          
         
         
        the taxpayer is liable to pay, by way of penalty for the additional tax equal to 75% of the amount of the shortfall or part. 
        
       
       
      Relevant definitions in the Tax Act are: 
       
        
         
        “Tax shortfall"", in relation to a taxpayer and a year, means the amount, if any, by which the taxpayer's statement tax for that year at the time at which it was lowest is less than the taxpayer’s proper tax for that year. 
         
         
        ""Proper tax"", in relation to a taxpayer and a year, means the tax properly payable by the taxpayer in respect of that year on the taxpayer’s taxable income after allowing credits property available to the taxpayer. 
        
       
      
    45 In the course of the sentencing remarks the Judge referred to the principles applicable to sentencing for offences of fraud on the revenue as set out in R v O’Connor (2002) 129 A Crim R 505 at 537. It is unnecessary to set them out in this judgment because, except in respect of one matter, there was no suggestion by the applicants that the Judge had erred in relation to the sentencing principles he applied. The only matter that was in dispute before the Judge and in this Court was the effect to be given to the fact that the applicants had paid a considerable amount by way of penalty tax. 
     
      
    46 The Judge quoted with approval from a passage in Sheller JA’s judgment in DPP v Hamman (NSWCCA, unreported, 1 December 1998). That was a Crown appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court for offences under s 29B and s 29D of the Crimes Act. Sheller JA stated (my underlining): 
     
      
       
        
         
        General deterrence is a predominate consideration when sentencing for offences of defrauding the revenue. 
         
         
        Appeal Courts have discussed and emphasised the seriousness of frauds committed to the detriment of the public revenue. Inevitably, the Australian system of tax collection depends upon the honesty of taxpayers and, in particular, upon their fully declaring in each year of income what their gross income is. In a free society, such as Australia, the tax collector cannot check that every taxpayer has done so. The effect of dishonesty and non-disclosure of income increases the burden on all other taxpayers and particularly those who have truly disclosed their gross income. This demonstrates the serious nature of the offences charged against the respondent and the importance when punishing such offences to put in the forefront of the principles to be applied that of general deterrence.  
         
         
        While undoubtedly it is a matter to be taken into account, it is, in my opinion, of small account, that when caught out the offender pays the tax due and additional tax by way of penalty for which the offender is liable to a greater or lesser extent, according to the Commissioner's discretion, whatever the reason for non-disclosure. 
         Past integrity and good character, devotion to family and work and contributions to the community, impeccable though they have been, carry little weight against the confession by a plea of guilty that over a period of three years which ended only when the respondent was caught out, the respondent knowingly on three occasions understated his income by very large amounts for his own benefit or advantage.  
         
        
       
      
    47 It was submitted to the Judge and to this Court on behalf of the applicants that the underlined passage was no longer good law in light of the decision of the High Court in Rich v Australian Securities and Investment Commission (2004) 220 CLR 129 because it pays too little regard to the significance that a penalty has been imposed upon the offender independent from, and additional to, that imposed by the court in respect of the same conduct. In Rich the Court held that there was no clear distinction between “protective” and “punitive” orders so that an order disqualifying a person from acting as a director of any company should be considered to be a penalty regardless of the purpose for which the order was made. The blurring of the distinction between the criminal and civil law in relation to penalties was recognised in Grey v Motor Accident Commission (1998) 196 CLR 1 at [16]. 
     
      
    48 It was argued on behalf of the applicants that the Judge had too much regard to general deterrence and gave insufficient weight to the imposition of an extra-curial penalty arising from the same conduct as that with which the Judge was concerned. It was submitted that the Judge overlooked the fact that civil penalties have a deterrent effect, as was recognised by Hayne J in Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Labrador Liquor Wholesale Pty Limited (2003) 216 CLR 161 at [114]. It was argued that significant weight should have been given to the payment of the penalty tax in order to avoid double punishment because the Commissioner imposed the penalties and chose not to remit them under s 227 of the Tax Act notwithstanding that the applicants had been convicted of the conspiracy offences with respect to the same subject matter. 
     
      
    49 Reliance was placed on behalf of the applicants upon statements of members of the Federal Court in R v Whitnall (1993) 42 FCR 512 as to the impact of a penalty administratively imposed by the Commissioner upon a court’s discretion to sentence an offender. Drummond J referred to the court’s discretion being to an extent fettered by the imposition of the penalty tax and thought that there was “an element of oppression involved in asking the court to deal severely with an offender who has already been heavily punished by the Commissioner”. 
     
      
    50 Reference was also made to the judgment of Hulme J in R v Gay [2002] NSWCCA 6 at [23] where his Honour expressed his disagreement with the statement made by Sheller JA in Hamman. After quoting from the passage in Hamman set out above, Hulme J wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [23] So far as these remarks relate to payment of the tax due, I agree. An offender can claim small credit for performing his legal obligations in common with most of the community. The same may be said of so much of the additional tax as represents interest on tax not paid, certainly if this interest is at more or less a commercial rather than a punitive rate. However, I am unable to agree that payment of additional tax is necessarily to be regarded as of small account. If, of course, the amount of additional tax is small, or perhaps even if large, is of little consequence to a particular offender, this may be an appropriate view but otherwise it seems to me that the significance of the payment of additional tax should be assessed on its merits. If it amounts to a significant punishment in its own right, then it may well be that it should significantly mitigate the punishment which would otherwise be imposed.  
         
         
        [24] Sheller JA gave no authority or reasoning for his view. In Whitnall (at 125) Higgins J, with whom Drummond J agreed, said that the degree of hardship imposed by a pecuniary penalty imposed administratively was relevant. Drummond J went on to say that if a heavy penalty has been imposed by administrative action, there is an element of oppression involved in asking a court to then deal severely with the offender. It may be that that is not necessarily so in every case but it clearly is a distinct possibility. The preferable approach is to consider every case on its own merits recognising that, even though Parliament may have provided for 2 punishments, it has nowhere said that the quantum of the first should not be fairly taken into account in any determination of the second.  
         
         
        [25] Furthermore, it must also be relevant to consider all of the consequences to an offender of his criminality…….. 
        
       
       
      The other members of the Court in  
      Gay  
      did not expressly approve of these views although Mason P, with whom Hidden J agreed, noted the punitive element in the amended assessments and took into account delay in prosecution and the payment of penalty tax as reasons for reducing the sentence. 
       
      
    51 The principles set out in Hamman were applied by this Court in R v Cappadona (2001) 122 A Crim R 52. However, the sentences under review in that case were considered on the basis that no penalty tax had been, or was to be, paid by the respondents to the Crown appeal. Cappadona was applied in O’Connor but there was no reference in that case to any payments having been made to the Commissioner by way of penalty or otherwise. In seems to me that, in light of the decision in Rich, the statement in Hamman in relation to the weight to be given to the payment of penalty tax ought not to be followed if it is regarded as an inflexible sentencing principle. I favour the approach of Hulme J to the effect that each case should be considered on its own merits, but recognising that the payment of penalty tax is a form of punishment that has been imposed upon the offender in addition to that which the Court imposes by way of sentence. This is consistent with the approach that courts have taken to extra-curial punishments generally: see Application by the Attorney General under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for a Guideline Judgment Concerning the Offence of High Range Prescribed Concentration of Alcohol Under Section 9(4) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 (No. 3 of 2002) (2004) 60 NSWLR 305 at [114]. 
     
      
    52 In many cases the extra-curial penalty might not be given great weight having regard to the need to denounce the criminal conduct by the imposition of a prison sentence and the importance of general deterrence that might not be reflected sufficiently in the payment of the penalty tax. Much might depend upon the capacity of the offender to pay the penalty or the effect that the penalty has had in real terms upon the offender. Hardship arising from the imposition of the tax penalty might be important in determining what further punishment is required to achieve its purpose of protecting the community. But the absence of hardship does not mean that little regard should be had to the additional penalty imposed administratively. 
     
      
    53 The Crown argued that the Commissioner does not impose the penalty at all and that the only discretion the Commissioner retains is to remit the payment. Material was placed before this Court to show that the Commissioner had no discretion to determine the rate of penalty tax under the different sections of the Tax Act because that was to be determined by the facts of the particular case. On the facts of the present matter s 226J applied so that the rate had to be 75 per cent. But that does not seem to me to be a matter of any great relevance. Even if the penalty was imposed by legislation, it does not mean that the court cannot or should not have regard to it and give it what weight it deserves in the particular case. Similarly the fact that there was nothing to show in the present case that the discretion of the Commissioner to remit the tax had been enlivened does not detract from the fact that the applicants had paid a not insignificant penalty before the Court imposed sentence. 
     
      
    54 There has been considerable debate, particularly by written submissions after the Court reserved its decision, as to the weight to be given in this case to `the penalty payment made having regard to the terms of settlement and other benefits the applicants might have received, such as by the remission of some part of their obligations under the Tax Act. Some account should be given of the history of the proceedings regarding reassessment and the settlement between the Commissioner and the applicants. 
     
      
    55 In 2001, as a result of material obtained from the execution of search warrants, the Commissioner issued amendment assessments of income-tax to the applicants and a company that they operated called On Fovo Pty Limited (On Fovo) under s 170(2)(a) of the Tax Act. The amended assessments related to the years of income ending 30 June 1993 to 30 June 1999 inclusive for Mrs Ronen and the years 30 June 1994 to 30 June 1999 inclusive for the company and the brothers. The assessments included assessments of primary tax, shortfall interest, and additional tax by way of penalty. Because the tax assessed was not paid by the due date, the company and the applicant became liable to pay the General Interest Charge (GIC) until the tax was paid. In 2001 the applicants paid part of the personal tax claimed by the Commissioner and the Commissioner accordingly reduced the rate at which GIC was levied. 
     
      
    56 Under the Tax Act penalty tax is payable under s 226G, s 226H and s226J of the Tax Act respectively at three rates: 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · 25% when the tax shortfall is caused by lack of reasonable care.· 50% when the shortfall is caused by recklessness.· 75% when the shortfall is caused by intentional disregard of the law. 
     
      
       
      The present case was held to fall within the maximum rate of 75 per cent. There was a dispute between the parties about the exercise of discretion to remit the whole or part of the penalty tax payable under s 226J. I do not find it necessary to resolve this dispute for present purposes. 
       
      
    57 The Deed of Settlement sets out the amounts that it was agreed that the applicants and On Fovo would pay for primary tax, shortfall interest and penalty tax. It was agreed that, if the applicants and the company paid these amounts, the Commissioner would remit the GIC payable on post assessment amounts. There was an argument as to whether, in taking into account the amounts paid by the applicants, the Court should have regard to the remission of the GIC to offset the impact of the tax penalties. The Crown submitted that the Court should have regard to the payments of penalty tax in context of the settlement as a whole and, therefore, view the penalty paid against the amount of GIC waived. The applicants argued that the Commissioner obtained a benefit in the compromise between the parties by recovering from On Fovo and remitted the GIC for commercial reasons. Therefore, it was argued, it should not be taken into account to negate the impact of the penalties imposed. The Crown disputed that this inference could be drawn from the material before the Court. It points out that GIC has been considered as penal in nature: see Elias v Commissioner of Taxation (2002) 199 ALR 246 at [23]. 
     
      
    58 Shortfall interest is payable under s 1709AA of the Tax Act and is calculated in accordance with s 214A of that Act at a rate of 4 percent points above the 13 week Treasury Note. Shortfall interest is referrable to the period up to the date of the amended assessment. GIC is payable under s 204(3) of the Tax Act and relates to the post assessment period. To some degree it would appear that the applicants have received the benefit of interest free use of funds for some period and the victim of the fraud, being the Commonwealth, has not been fully compensated for being out of funds for that period. Nevertheless, the waiver of the GIC amounts was a consensual settlement. There can be no doubt that the amount of compensation paid to the victim of the fraud was a very substantial proportion of the loss incurred and this is entitled to weight in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. The Judge gave it such weight. 
     
      
    59 The Crown submitted that the weight to be given to the payment of the additional tax by way of penalty under s 226J of the Tax Act is affected by the fact that the taxpayers were not required to pay post assessment GIC. In my view this matter goes principally to the question of the degree of compensation paid and does not detract from the fact that a very substantial penalty has been imposed upon the applicants. 
     
      
    60 It should be accepted that the parties to the settlement each saw a benefit to be derived from the terms agreed upon. No doubt the applicant’s were legitimately seeking to obtain as much benefit as they could in the sentencing proceedings on the basis of the amount of penalty tax they were required to pay under the terms of settlement. However, it is difficult to assess the relevance of this amount as an extra-curial penalty when nothing is known about the ability of the applicants to pay it. There is no real suggestion of hardship other than that Mrs Ronen sold her unit in order to meet the tax liability. However, it remains unclear how much money was sent overseas or what was done with it. The applicant’s gave no evidence on the sentencing proceedings and there was no information as to the financial position of the companies in which the applicants were involved, other than On Fovo, or what assets the applicants had either in this country or overseas. If the applicants wish the Court to take into account the full impact of the penalty tax as a matter in mitigation of the sentence to be imposed by the Court, they have an onus of demonstrating the impact of the penalty upon them. Nevertheless on any view the amount paid by way of penalty tax was a very substantial amount indeed. Although its precise impact on the financial position of the applicants is not known, its very size will serve the purpose of personal and general deterrence to some degree. 
     
      
    61 Although the approach of the Judge to the taxation penalty was in accordance with binding authority of this Court, it seems to me with respect to have been erroneous when expressed as an immutable sentencing principle. However, before determining what should be the outcome of this error, I will deal with the remaining grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      The accumulation of sentences 
      
    62 The applicants argue that the Judge erred in imposing partially cumulative sentences having regard to the fact that it was a technicality that there were two offences and not one. The Crown had always accepted that there was a single course of criminal conduct throughout the period of the offending. It was submitted that in those circumstances it was erroneous for the Judge to do other than impose completely concurrent sentences. 
     
      
    63 The Judge indicated that, according to Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, “it is the duty of the sentencing court to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well as questions of totality”. After indicating the sentence for each offence, the Judge said, “I have concluded that a degree of accumulation is necessary in relation to the sentences because I consider that the criminality in the second offence cannot comprehend the total of the criminality in the two offences”. 
     
      
    64 It has been made clear that, generally speaking, it is a matter for the discretion of a sentencing judge whether to make sentences concurrent or cumulative: R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66. But one circumstance where that discretion must be exercised against imposing concurrent sentences is where the appropriate sentence for one offence cannot comprehend or reflect the criminality involved in all offences. It was well open to the Judge to determine that in this case the sentence for either one of the offences could not reflect the criminality involved in the entire conspiracy. If there had been one offence encompassing the whole of the criminality involved in the conspiracy, the penalty for that offence ought to have been greater than that imposed by the Judge for each of the offences. In my opinion it would have been an error for the Judge to have imposed purely concurrent sentences, as that course would have required him to inappropriately inflate the sentence for one of the offences in order to comprehend the total criminality of them both. 
     
      
       
      Manifestly excessive sentence 
      
    65 In my opinion the sentences were not manifestly excessive having regard to the criminality involved in the applicants’ offending. In my opinion the Judge was correct to consider that the offending was within the worst category given the length of time over which the conspiracy operated, the amount of money defrauded from the Commonwealth and the manner in which the fraud was carried out. There was little mitigation due to the subjective features of the applicants having regard to the period of the offending and its systematic nature. 
     
      
    66 The only error in the sentencing Judge’s reasoning that was disadvantageous to the applicants that I can identify was the error as to the weight to be given to the payment of the taxation penalties. But in my opinion the criminality of the applicants was so great that the payment of the penalty tax, particularly in the absence of any evidence as to what it meant in real terms to the applicants, could be given limited weight having regard to the purposes of punishment for this type of offending. It has been stated time and time again and in all jurisdictions that the most important aspect of punishment in relation to frauds on the Commonwealth’s revenue is general deterrence. Although I accept that the payment of a penalty tax can have a deterrent effect, it is not usually of the same magnitude in white collar crime as that arising from the imprisonment of persons who are otherwise of good character and are well respected in the community. Further, it was particularly important in this case to denounce almost a decade of persistent, fraudulent conduct in contempt of the taxation laws and motivated by pure greed. The payment of the penalty tax could not sufficiently achieve that purpose. A heavy personal penalty in addition to the financial penalties imposed upon the applicants and On Fovo was called for in this case. 
     
      
    67 Even giving full weight to the payment of the taxation penalty I am not persuaded that any lesser sentences are warranted so serious was the offending by the applicants: see s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704. The non-parole period imposed upon Mrs Ronen adequately reflected her particular subjective circumstances and the difficulty she would face serving a sentence of imprisonment. 
     
      
    68 I would grant the applicants leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
       
      The Crown appeal 
      
    69 The Crown relied upon two grounds of appeal as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Ground 1: The sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 2: The level of accumulation was inadequate 
        
       
       
       
      Manifest inadequacy 
      
    70 The Crown argued that the Judge should not have taken into account the maximum penalty for the offences under the Code or what was said about the maximum penalty for the repealed offences in the Executive Memorandum. The Crown submitted that to take into account the 10 year maximum penalty for the Code offences was to act contrary to the legislature’s wishes as evidenced by the transitional provisions that preserved the maximum penalty for the repealed offences for prosecutions of those offences after their repeal. The Crown alternatively submitted that, if the Judge was entitled to take into account the legislative changes, this could only result in a “modest reduction in the sentence”. 
     
      
    71 It is unusual in my experience to find a parliament acknowledging by act or statement that a legislatively prescribed penalty was excessive for the criminality inherent in the offence to which it related. Yet that is what occurred in the present case. In the future offenders, such as the applicants, will face a maximum penalty under the Code that is half of that which applied under the Act. The Executive Memorandum contains a clear acknowledgment that the penalty under the Act was “far too high”. It is impossible in my opinion for a court, sentencing persons such as the applicants for offences under the Act, to ignore these two indications of Parliament’s change of mind as to the seriousness with which it views the kind of conduct that was committed by the applicants. 
     
      
    72 The courts have always treated the maximum penalty for an offence as a pronouncement of the policy of the legislature: R v Oliver (1980) 7 A Crim R 174 at 177. The maximum penalty reflects the seriousness of the crime in the mind of the public as given voice through parliament: R v H (1980) 3 A Crim R 53 at 65. In the joint judgment in Markarian v The Queen (2005) 79 ALJR 1048 at [30], their Honours wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [30] Legislatures do not enact maximum available sentences as mere formalities. Judges need sentencing yardsticks. It is well accepted that the maximum sentence available may in some cases be a matter of great relevance. In their book Sentencing, Stockdale and Devlin. observe that: 
         
          
           
           A maximum sentence fixed by Parliament may have little relevance in a given case, either because it was fixed at a very high level in the last century … or because it has more recently been set at a high catch-all level … At other times the maximum may be highly relevant and sometimes may create real difficulties … 
          
         
         
          
           A change in a maximum sentence by Parliament will sometimes be helpful [where it is thought that the Parliament regarded the previous penalties as inadequate]. 
          
         
         
        [31] It follows that careful attention to maximum penalties will almost always be required, first because the legislature has legislated for them; secondly, because they invite comparison between the worst possible case and the case before the court at the time; and thirdly, because in that regard they do provide, taken and balanced with all of the other relevant factors, a yardstick. ……………… 
         
        
       
      
    73 I find it impossible, consistently with this approach, to ignore legislative acts or statements that indicate that Parliament’s view of the seriousness of particular criminal conduct, as reflected in the maximum penalty for an offence punishing that conduct, has changed. This is particularly so where the offending occurs at a time relatively proximate to the expression of the change of view. The applicants’ criminal conduct came to an end in 2001 the same year that the legislation was amended. 
     
      
    74 In my opinion the Judge was correct to take into account the change in the legislature’s attitude to this type of offending and to reduce the impact of the maximum penalty accordingly. Even though the transitional provisions retained the maximum penalty, those provisions applied to all the offences that were being repealed and not simply the offence with which the applicants had been charged. That general provision as it applied to the applicants had to be considered against the specific indications of Parliament’s change of attitude with respect to fraud offences such as those with which the applicants had been charged.  
     
      
    75 For my part I believe this to have been a very significant matter indeed and could convert a sentence that might otherwise have appeared to be manifestly inadequate as against the theoretical maximum penalty to one within the range of an available sentencing discretion having regard to the practical effect of the change of view of the seriousness of such offending expressed by Parliament both in the statement contained in the Executive Memorandum and by its action in reducing the penalties for the new fraud offences. The significance is not watered down simply because the new fraud offences were different to the offences for which the applicants were to be sentenced. They were to be in the future the offences that would protect the Commonwealth’s revenue against frauds of the nature of that committed by the applicants. The Judge was bound to take the change of legislative policy into account, not simply as a matter of fairness to the applicant, but also because it maintains consistency in the way that the courts are guided in sentencing by the legislature’s view of the seriousness of the offending expressed through the maximum penalty prescribed for an offence. 
     
      
    76 I accept that, had it not been open to the Judge to take into account the change of the legislature’s policy toward fraud offences, the sentences imposed as against a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years would have been inadequate in light of the Judge’s finding that the offences fell into the worst category of their type. But it seems to me that the situation was one where the Judge was entitled to take into account that the maximum penalty prescribed was no longer an appropriate yardstick to the sentence to be imposed and had little relevance as a guide to the seriousness of the applicants’ conduct. That approach is consistent with the passage quoted from Markarian above. 
     
      
    77 In my opinion the individual sentences were within his Honour’s discretion having regard to the subjective factors taken into account by him and in light of the penalty tax paid by the applicants. 
     
      
       
      Level of accumulation 
      
    78 The Crown argued that, because the individual sentences were so low, it was not open to the Judge to make them partially concurrent. It was submitted that a total sentence of eight and a half years was manifestly inadequate as against the statutory maximum of 20 years. 
     
      
    79 As I have already indicated, I believe that the Crown submission oversimplifies the situation in which the Judge found himself because the maximum penalty was not a reliable guide to the legislature’s view of the seriousness of the offending and did not have the relevance it might have had but for the change in legislative policy to this type of crime. The overall sentence imposed was in my opinion within the Judge’s legitimate discretion in the unusual circumstances of this particular sentencing exercise. 
     
      
    80 I would dismiss the Crown’s appeal. 
     
      
       
       
      
    81 The orders I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal granted but the appeal is dismissed. 
       
      2. The Crown appeal is dismissed.

     JUDGMENT 
      
    1 HODGSON JA: I will ask James J to give the first judgment.2 JAMES J: Christopher Robert Crago applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him in the District Court by his Honour Judge Marien SC on 4 March 2005. 3 The applicant had pleaded guilty to 12 charges, being:- a charge of firing a firearm in a manner likely to endanger the safety of a specified person (count 1 in the indictment presented against the applicant); nine charges of using an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely malicious wounding, while in the company of another person (counts 2-10 in the indictment); a charge of maliciously damaging a motor vehicle (count 11 in the indictment); and a charge of possessing a firearm, namely an air rifle, without being authorised to do so (count 12 in the indictment).4 The first count in the indictment was a charge under s 93G of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years. 5 Counts 2-10 in the indictment were charges under s 33B(2) of the Crimes Act of using an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence whilst in the company of another person, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 15 years. 6 Count 11 in the indictment was a charge under s 195(a) of the Crimes Act, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for five years. 7 Count 12 in the indictment was stated to be a charge under s 7 of the Firearms Act, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years. 8 His Honour Judge Marien imposed the following sentences:- For the offence charged in count 1 of the indictment, a fixed term of imprisonment of two years commencing on 13 March 2004. For each of the offences charged in counts 2, 3 and 4 of the indictment, a fixed term of imprisonment of two years and nine months commencing on 13 September 2004, the three sentences to be served concurrently.For each of the offences charged in counts 5, 6 and 7 of the indictment, a fixed term of imprisonment of two years and nine months commencing on 13 September 2005.For each of the offences charged in counts 8, 9 and 10 of the indictment, a non-parole period of two years and nine months commencing on 13 September 2006 and a balance of term of one year and three months commencing on 13 June 2009.For the offence charged in count 11, a fixed term of imprisonment of one year commencing on 13 September 2006.For the offence charged in count 12, a fixed term of imprisonment of two years commencing on 13 March 2004.9 The overall effect of the sentences imposed was that of sentences totalling six and a half years commencing on 13 March 2004 and expiring on 12 September 2010 and fixed terms of imprisonment and non-parole periods totalling five years and three months commencing on 13 March 2004 and expiring on 12 June 2009.10 The statement of the facts of the offences by the sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence was based on a statement of facts admitted without objection in the proceedings on sentence and was not the subject of any criticism upon the hearing of this application. All of the offences were committed on the same day, being 11 January 2004. His Honour’s statement of the facts of the offences was:- 
     
      
       
        
        “…with respect to count 1, that on the morning of 11 January 2004, the offender was in the company of a Michael Rogan at the suburb of Fairy Meadow. At about 8.15 am he went to a tavern where Rogan was employed as a contract cleaner. That tavern overlooks a car park attached to a Woolworths supermarket store. The offender used his air rifle to shoot at magpies in the rear garden of the tavern. After he had shot a magpie, Rogan also used the air rifle to shoot the magpie. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Nancy Frazer, aged sixty years, who was in the company of her eighty year old mother was in the Woolworths car park loading groceries into the boot of her car. Mrs Frazer heard a loud thud and felt a sharp pain to the back of her arm. She told her mother she had been shot. Mrs Frazer then sought medical attention and x-rays were taken. There was no pellet found on the x-ray and no exit wound. Her treating doctor was of the opinion that her injury was consistent with a graze by a projectile. Mrs Frazer attended the Wollongong Police Station and reported the matter. The facts state that there is no evidence that the offender deliberately shot at or in the direction of Mrs Frazer. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Count 2. On 11 January 2004, at 4.55 pm, the victim Mary Khoder, aged sixty-five years was walking in Railway Parade, Fairfield with the assistance of a walker and felt a sharp pain in her right shoulder. The victim was treated by her local doctor and a small air rifle pellet was removed from her shoulder area. Police were notified. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Count 3. On 11 January 2004 at 5.25 pm, Thanh Vuong aged thirty-nine years, was shot in the lower back region whilst at the corner of Peel and Canley Vale Road, Canley Valle. A small metallic object was located in his shirt after the shooting. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Count 4. Between 5.30 pm and 6 pm on the same day the victim Consuelo De-Leon, aged fifty-one years, was walking in the Fairfield Forum approaching her motor vehicle when she felt a pain to the rear of her head with blood flowing freely from the injury. The victim was conveyed to Fairfield Hospital and a small air rifle projectile was surgically removed. The victim saw a white van near her when she was shot. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Count 5. At 5.45 pm the victim Bradley Wright, aged fifteen years was walking in Canley Vale Road and heard a loud noise similar to a firearm discharging and immediately felt pain to his chest area. The victim was conveyed to hospital and an air rifle pellet was recovered from his wound. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Count 6. At 6 pm or shortly thereafter, the victim Sam Ly, aged fifty years, was standing on the footpath outside a restaurant in The Boulevard, Fairfield when he felt a sharp pain to his chest area. He was taken to Fairfield Heights Medical Centre and later transported to Fairfield Hospital for treatment for a penetrating wound to his chest, the result of being shot by an air rifle projectile. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Count 7. Around 6 pm on the same day, the victim David Chalabi, aged eleven years, was riding his bicycle in Barbara Street, Fairfield when he heard a loud noise similar to a cap gun discharging. The victim then saw blood flowing from his left arm. The victim looked up and saw a white van take off at speed away from the area. The victim was admitted to Liverpool Hospital where a small projectile was identified as being lodged in his hand. Because of the proximity of the pellet to the nerves in the hand it was not possible to remove the pellet without the risk of further nerve damage. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Count 8. At 6.45 pm, the victim Andre Khoury, aged fifty-four years was walking in Sackville Street, Fairfield and felt a sharp pain to his elbow area which bled. He was taken to the Spencer Street Medical Centre, Fairfield. A small projectile was removed from his right elbow area. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Count 9. On the same day, between 6.30 pm and 7 pm, the victim Thi Thu Pham, fifty-one years old, parked her car in the Fairfield car park. She commenced walking towards the shopping centre and felt a sharp pain to her upper left chest area. She noticed the area was bleeding and a small metal object was stuck to the outside of her clothing, consistent with an air rifle pellet. The victim continued walking towards the front entrance of the Fairfield Forum and noticed a white van with a male driver parked near this entrance. The victim attended her local doctor the following day and was treated for her injury. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Count 10. On the same day, Riva Yaco, aged seventeen years, was walking along Harris Street, Fairfield in the company of a friend when he felt a sharp pain to his chest. He was bleeding from a wound to his chest. He went home where he informed his parents what had happened. Following publicity regarding the other shooting incidents, the victim sought medical attention on 16 January 2004, but there was no evidence of a penetrating injury. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Count 11. On the same day at 5.15 pm, Irena Korunoska, was driving her father’s motor vehicle in an easterly direction along Canley Vale Road Canley Heights, when she heard a loud bang on the driver’s side of the car. She stopped the car and noticed a dent above the rear passenger door on the driver’s side consistent with being struck with an air rifle. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Count 12. Relates to an air rifle that was found in the possession of the offender. The offender admitted to police that he purchased it for fifty dollars at the hotel in Queensland in December in 2003”. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
       
      
    11 As a result of the information received by police, the van the applicant was driving was stopped. Police searched the van and found a packet of air rifle pellets. In the rear part of the van there was a sofa facing the side window, which could be opened. After the van was stopped and searched, the applicant was arrested.12 When first interviewed by police the applicant denied any knowledge of the packet of air rifle pellets and denied any knowledge of the shootings. 13 Police received information from a fellow employee of the applicant that the applicant had admitted that on 11 January 2004 he had been driving a vehicle, while a passenger “Jeremy” shot at victims. 14 Information was also received from another person that he had observed the applicant near bushland. When police searched this area, the air rifle which had been used in the shootings was found. 15 The applicant was again interviewed by police and in this interview he declined to answer most questions, in the exercise of his right to silence but, to the extent he answered questions, he denied any knowledge of the shootings. However, after this second interview the applicant informed police that a friend of his, Jeremy Smith, had been the shooter and that the applicant had been driving the van while the shootings took place.16 The applicant was again interviewed by police and in this interview the applicant admitted that he owned an air gun, that he had been driving the vehicle while Smith fired the air gun and that he had subsequently attempted to conceal the air gun.17 The air rifle and the pellets recovered from the victims were examined by a ballistics expert. Two of the pellets were positively identified as having been discharged from the air rifle owned by the applicant.18 The applicant was sentenced on the basis that, although he had not been the shooter, he had been a party to a joint criminal enterprise with Smith to commit the offence of malicious wounding in company. The applicant had participated in the commission of the offences by driving the van, knowing that Smith was shooting with the air rifle from the rear of the van. The applicant had also provided the air rifle and the ammunition.19 In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge commented that the offences were “of the most extreme objective seriousness.” Over a period of some hours Smith, as part of the joint criminal enterprise with the applicant, had deliberately and randomly shot at and injured nine persons, ranging in age from 11 to 65 years.20 In his remarks on sentence his Honour noted some of the subjective features of the applicant. The applicant was 35 years old at the time of the commission of the offences. He had begun using cannabis at 15 years of age and this had escalated to daily use of cannabis from about the age of 18. He had also abused alcohol. After his arrest and while in custody he had abstained from using drugs and had attended counselling and a number of drug and alcohol courses.21 Ms Collins, a psychologist who had interviewed and assessed the applicant, expressed the opinion that the applicant impressed as genuine in wanting to remain drug free but that he would need ongoing drug and alcohol counselling when released from gaol in order to reduce the risk of relapsing.22 In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge dealt with a number of matters. His Honour accepted that, although the applicant had been committed for trial on far more serious charges under s 33 of the Crimes Act, his pleas of guilty had been entered at the first reasonable opportunity after the charges against him had been reduced from charges under s 33 of the Crimes Act to charges under s 33B.23 With regard to parity or proportionality of sentencing as between the applicant and the co-offender Smith, the sentencing judge observed that Smith, who had previously been sentenced by his Honour, had been sentenced for offences under s 33 and not s 33B; that Smith had not been sentenced for any offences corresponding to the charges in counts 1 and 12 of the indictment against the applicant; that Smith had only been 19 years old at the time of the commission of the offences; that Smith had no previous criminal convictions, whereas the applicant had a record of prior criminal convictions, although none for crimes of violence; that in sentencing Smith Judge Marien had made a finding that Smith had been led into the commission of the offences by the applicant as an older man, but that no such finding was being made in the sentencing of the applicant.24 His Honour found that the applicant had provided assistance to the authorities, in that he had nominated Smith as the co-offender. His Honour found that, without this assistance, the police would have had difficulty in identifying Smith as being the co-offender.25 His Honour found that he should allow a combined discount of 50 per cent for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty and the assistance provided by the applicant to the authorities. 26 His Honour considered there should be some partial accumulation of sentences, on the grounds that wholly concurrent sentences would not adequately reflect the applicant’s total criminality.27 His Honour found special circumstances justifying a variation of the usual ratio between the term of the sentence and the non-parole period in the need of the applicant for on-going and close supervision “with respect to drug and alcohol management”.28 His Honour found the following aggravating factors within s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. At the time the offences were committed the applicant was on bail (s 21A(2)(j)). Although it was not a case of a high degree of sophisticated planning, the offences were, to some degree, planned(s 21A(2)(n)). The offences involved a series of criminal acts involving multiple victims (s 21A(2)(m)). The offences occurred in a public place without due regard for public safety (s 21A(2)(i)). 29 With regard to the offence charged in count 12 of the indictment, the sentencing judge noted that the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 14 years and that a standard non-parole period of three years had been set. His Honour observed, correctly, that because the applicant had pleaded guilty to the offences, the standard non-parole period was not directly applicable but that, nevertheless, it remained of relevance in the sentencing as a reference point, bench mark or guide post. His Honour proceeded to find that the present offence, because of the nature of the firearm as an air rifle, fell, not within the middle of the range of objective seriousness for such offences but at the lower end of the range.30 The applicant was arrested on 13 January 2004 and refused bail. On 15 April, whilst he was in custody, he was sentenced in the Local Court to a fixed term of imprisonment of four months commencing on 13 January 2004 for contravening an apprehended domestic violence order. Rather than make the sentences he was about to impose commence from either 13 January 2004 or 13 May 2004, that is on the expiration of the sentence of four months, his Honour decided to make the sentences he was about to impose commence half way through the sentence of four months, that is 13 March 2004. 31 Counsel for the applicant relied on four grounds of appeal, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The sentencing judge failed to give effect to the finding of special circumstances. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        2. The sentencing judge failed to adequately take into account totality. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        3. The individual sentences and the total effective sentence are manifestly excessive. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        4. The difference in the penalties imposed on the co-offender gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance to the applicant”. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
          
         
        
       
      
    32 I will deal with the grounds of appeal in order.Ground 133 As I stated earlier in this judgment, his Honour found special circumstances in the applicant’s need for ongoing supervision after his release from prison, with respect to the management of his problems with drugs and alcohol. His Honour further found that those circumstances would justify a variation of the usual ratio between the term of a sentence and the non-parole period of the sentence.34 His Honour gave effect to those findings in the sentences he imposed for the offences charged in counts 8, 9 and 10 of the indictment. Each of those sentences was for a total term of four years with a non-parole period of two years and nine months, with the balance of the term of one year and three months exceeding one-third of the non-parole period. 35 However, when the sentences are viewed overall, the total of the terms or head sentences is six and a half years and the total of the fixed terms of imprisonment or non-parole periods is five years and three months, so that, viewing the sentences overall, not only does the balance of one year and three months, during which the applicant would be eligible for release on parole, not exceed one-third of the total period the applicant would have to serve in prison, it is less than one-third of the total period the applicant would have to serve in prison. The position is exacerbated, to a small degree, by the circumstance that the applicant had to serve two months in prison, before commencing to serve the sentences imposed by his Honour.36 Counsel for the Crown referred to the decision of this Court in Regina v Maxfield [2005] NSWCCA 136. However, in that case the sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence expressly stated that he would vary the usual ratio in the sentences he pronounced, only for such sentences as would not be fixed terms of imprisonment.37 I conclude that in imposing the sentences he did and in structuring those sentences as he did, the sentencing judge failed to give effect to his own findings and that this ground of appeal should be upheld.Grounds 2 and 3 38 These grounds of appeal can conveniently be dealt with together. 39 It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that, considered in their totality, the sentences imposed by his Honour were manifestly excessive. It was submitted that the sentence for the offence charged in count 1 of the indictment was itself manifestly excessive. 40 It was conceded that the offences were serious and it was a serious aggravating factor that the offences were committed whilst the applicant was on bail. However, it was pointed out that the offences charged in counts 2-10 of the indictment were offences under s 33B of the Crimes Act, and not s 33, and did not include any element of an intention to inflict really serious bodily injury. 41 It was pointed out that the applicant had not been the actual shooter. 42 It was submitted that some of the aggravating factors specified in the charges or found by the sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence should have been accorded little weight. 43 It was pointed out that the sentencing Judge said that he had allowed a combined discount of 50 per cent for the applicant’s pleas of guilty and for the assistance provided by the applicant to the authorities, so that, before allowing this discount, the sentencing judge must have had in mind sentences totalling 13 years.44 In its submissions the Crown relied on the number of offences, the number of victims, the prominent role played by the applicant in the commission of the offences, even if he had not been the actual shooter; the injuries to the victims; the fact that in some cases the air rifle pellet had to be medically extracted from the victim’s body; and the circumstance of aggravation that the offences had been committed whilst the applicant was on bail.45 In my opinion, it should be held that the sentences in their totality were manifestly excessive.46 I accept that the offences were serious and merited a substantial total term of imprisonment. That the applicant was on bail when he committed the offences was a serious circumstance of aggravation. Furthermore, although the applicant was not the actual shooter, he provided and drove the vehicle and he provided both the air rifle and the ammunition. As was stated by the High Court in G A S v The Queen (2004) 217 CLR 198, there is no universal principle that the culpability of an aider and abetter is less than that of a principal offender.50 However, although I regard the offences as serious, I consider that the sentencing judge was over-stating their seriousness in characterising them as being “of the most extreme objective seriousness.” 47 It is a simple matter to postulate other cases of discharging a firearm at a number of persons, which would be of much greater objective seriousness than the present offences. The firearm used in the commission of the present offences was an air rifle and not any of the much more dangerous firearms that fall within the operation of the Firearms Act. 48 As counsel for the applicant submitted, it must be kept in mind that the offences charged in counts 2-10 of the indictment, to which the applicant pleaded guilty, did not include as an element any intention to cause really serious bodily injury.49 Many of the aggravating factors included in the charges, or found by his Honour, apart from the fact that the applicant was on bail, should have been given very little weight. There was very little planning and, although there were a number of offences, each offence involved only a single criminal act and a single victim. 50 As was submitted by counsel for the applicant, his Honour, before allowing a combined discount of 50 per cent for the applicant’s pleas of guilty and assistance to the authorities, must have had in mind sentences totalling 13 years, which I consider would have been manifestly excessive, if the applicant had not pleaded guilty and had not provided assistance.51 As stated earlier in this judgment, the offence charged in count 12 of the indictment was treated as an offence under s 7 of the Firearms Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years and for which a standard non-parole period of three years has been set. However, s 7 applies only to a “prohibited firearm or pistol” and an air rifle is not a prohibited firearm within the meaning of that expression in the Firearms Act, nor, of course, is it a pistol (see the Firearms Act s 4 and Schedule 1).52 The applicant should not, in fact, have been convicted of an offence under s 7 of the Firearms Act. He would have been guilty of an offence under s 7A of the Firearms Act, of possessing a firearm without being authorised, but the maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for only five years and no standard non-parole period has been set.53 As stated earlier in this judgment, his Honour, although holding that the standard non-parole period set for an offence under s 7 of the Firearms Act was not directly applicable to sentencing the applicant for the offence charged in count 12 of the indictment, nevertheless regarded the standard non-parole period as being a point of reference, a bench mark and a guide post. 54 In so regarding the standard non-parole period for an offence under s 7 of the Firearms Act, his Honour was in error in his sentencing of the applicant for the offence the applicant had actually committed. However, more fundamentally, it seems to me that his Honour’s belief that unauthorised possession of the firearm which had been used in committing the offences was itself an offence for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 15 years and for which a standard non-parole period of three years had been set, played a part in causing his Honour to overstate the objective seriousness of the offences.55 I would uphold grounds of appeal 3 and 4. 
     
      
      Ground 4 
      
    59 Having regard to my conclusions that the previous grounds of appeal should be upheld, it is not really necessary to consider this ground of appeal. 56 The co-offender Smith had been previously sentenced by Judge Marien for nine offences under s 33 of the Crimes Act of maliciously shooting at persons with intent to do grievous bodily harm and one offence of maliciously damaging property. Smith was not sentenced for any offences corresponding with either the offence charged in count 1 in the indictment against the applicant or the offence charged in count 12 of the indictment against the applicant. 57 For six of the offences under s 33 of the Crimes Act Judge Marien imposed fixed terms of imprisonment of three years and for three of the offences under s 33 his Honour imposed sentences of imprisonment for five years with non-parole periods of three years. For the offence of maliciously damaging property, his Honour imposed a sentence of a fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months. After some of the sentences were partly accumulated, the total of the terms of imprisonment imposed was seven years and the total of the fixed terms and the non-parole periods was five years. 58 There were clearly differences between both the objective criminality and the subjective features of the applicant and of Smith. Nevertheless it was accepted by Judge Marien, and I would accept, that there was a need for his Honour, in sentencing the applicant, to endeavour to achieve some sort of proportionality with the sentences which had been imposed on Smith.59 There were some factors favouring the applicant and some factors favouring the co-offender. The applicant was sentenced for a larger number of offences. On the other hand, Smith was sentenced for offences under s 33 of the Crimes Act, whereas the applicant was sentenced for offences under s 33B of the Act. The applicant was 35 years old at the time of the offences, whereas Smith was only 19. In sentencing Smith the sentencing judge had found that Smith, to some extent, had been led into committing some of the offences by the applicant, who was an older man. Smith had no previous criminal history, whereas the applicant had some prior criminal convictions, although none for acts of violence. The applicant was on bail at the time of committing the offences. Each of the applicant and Smith was given a combined discount of 50 per cent for early pleas of guilty and assistance.60 It is not a simple task to balance out these various factors and, if I had not upheld the previous grounds of appeal, I might well have concluded that it was open to his Honour to regard the sentences he was imposing on the applicant as properly proportional to the sentences he had imposed on Smith. However, it is unnecessary for me to reach any final decision on this ground of appeal.61 Having upheld the first three grounds of appeal it is necessary for this Court to re-sentence the applicant. I have already set out the objective facts of the offences and the subjective features of the applicant. In re-sentencing the applicant I take into account the relevant provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In re-sentencing the applicant I would retain the same grouping of offences as the sentencing judge made and the same commencement date for the first offence. I would also retain the same combined discount for the pleas of guilty and the assistance provided, even though that discount might arguably be regarded as somewhat generous. I would find special circumstances as found by his Honour. I would also adopt a similar kind of partial accumulation of sentences to that adopted by his Honour.62 I propose the following orders should be made:-63 Leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by Judge Marien SC on 4 March 2005 granted. Appeal allowed. Sentences imposed by Judge Marien SC quashed and in lieu thereof the following sentences imposed: (1) For the offence charged in count 1 of the indictment, a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months commencing on 13 March 2004 and expiring on 12 September 2005. (2) For each of the offences charged in counts 2-4 of the indictment, a fixed term of imprisonment of two years commencing on 13 September 2004 and expiring on 12 September 2006.(3) For each of the offences charged in counts 5-7 of the indictment, a fixed term of imprisonment of two years commencing on 13 March 2005 and expiring on 12 March 2007. (4) For each of the offences charged in counts 8-10 of the indictment, a non-parole period of one and a half years commencing on 13 March 2006 and expiring on 12 September 2007, with a balance of term of one and a half years commencing on 13 September 2007 and expiring on 12 March 2009.(5) For the offence charged in count 11 of the indictment, a fixed term of imprisonment of one year commencing on 13 March 2006 and expiring on 12 March 2007. (6) For the offence charged in count 12 of the indictment, a fixed term of imprisonment of one year also commencing on 13 March 2006 and expiring on 12 March 2007.64 The total effect of the sentences is imprisonment for terms totalling five years commencing on 13 March 2004 with fixed terms of imprisonment and non-parole periods totalling three and a half years, expiring on 12 September 2007.65 The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole will be 12 September 2007.66 I confirm the orders made by Judge Marien SC under s 166 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.67 HODGSON JA: I agree.68 HOEBEN J: I agree with the orders James J has proposed.69 HODGSON JA: The orders of the Court are as proposed by James J.
