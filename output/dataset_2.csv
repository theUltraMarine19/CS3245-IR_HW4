 District Judge Chiah Kok Khun:
Introduction
1       This case involved a claim for costs of repairs to a motor vehicle following a road traffic accident. The accident involved a collision between two cars. The damage was not severe. The quantum of the claim was agreed by parties before the trial to be $20,000. The trial was on the question of liability for the accident only. The witnesses at the half-day trial were the drivers of the two cars. The drivers were also the parties to the case, as they were the registered owners of their respective cars. The claim was made by Mr Mohamed Rafin Bin Kadim, the Plaintiff. He was driving a Porsche Panamera at the time of the accident. He was the Chief Corporate Officer of the Park Hotel Group.
[note: 1]
 The Defendant was Chia Sze Kim Justin Mark, who was driving a Golf GTI MK 5 at the time of the accident. He was unemployed.
[note: 2]
2       It was not disputed that the collision took place on 23 April 2014 at about 12.20pm, along the stretch of North Bridge Road after the Coleman Road junction and before the High Street junction. This portion of North Bridge Road had four lanes. The first lane on the left was a bus-lane, which was in operation. It was not disputed that traffic was heavy at the time of the collision.
[note: 3]
 It was the lunch hour.
The two versions of the collision
3       As with every road traffic accident case that came before the courts, each opposing party had a different version of the accident. The Plaintiff’s version was that he was travelling on the second lane from the left when the Defendant’s car cut suddenly into his lane from the bus lane on the left thereby causing the collision. He braked but could not prevent the collision. The damage to his car was at the front left portion of the car and the damage to the Defendant’s car was to its rear right corner.
[note: 4]
 The Defendant apologized to him after the collision for causing the accident.
[note: 5]
4       The Defendant denied that he cut in from the left into the second lane where the Plaintiff’s car was travelling in. His version was that he was driving on the second lane when a taxi in front slowed down and stopped. He did likewise and was coming to a stop when the Plaintiff’s car collided into the rear right of his car.
[note: 6]
 In other words, his version was that of a typical front to rear collision on the roads. After the collision, the Plaintiff asked him why he had slowed down; and also mentioned that he was late for lunch. The damage to the Plaintiff’s car was around the front left of the bumper area. The damage to his car was at the area around the rear right of the bumper, as well as a punctured rear right tyre.
[note: 7]
5       The key difference between the two versions therefore was that the Plaintiff said that the Defendant had cut in from the left into the path of the Plaintiff’s car, thereby causing the Plaintiff’s car to collide into the rear right corner of the Defendant’s car; whereas the Defendant said that he did not cut in from the left, but was travelling in front of the Plaintiff’s car when the accident happened. The entire case turned on the question of which version of the accident was more probable.
The objective evidence
The resting position of the vehicles
6       As was typical of road traffic accident trials, both parties stuck to their versions on the stand. I turned therefore to the objective evidence. These would firstly be the photographs of the resting position of the vehicles taken at the scene of the accident by the parties themselves, in particular the photographs at Agreed Bundle (“AB”), pg 15, 22 to 24, and 28.
[note: 8]
 There was a yellow box drawn on the road at the site of the collision. The yellow box covered both the bus lane and the second lane from the left, where the collision took place. The road was straight at this stretch and there were no bends at any point along the road. It was not disputed that both the vehicles were not moved before the photographs were taken at the scene.
7       As seen in the photographs, the resting position of the two cars depicted the Defendant’s car very close to the left edge of the second lane. It was clear from the photographs that its left wheels were in the lane to the left, which was the bus lane. This suggested that the Defendant’s car had moved in from the bus lane just prior to the collision taking place.
8       The Plaintiff’s car was resting in the second lane. Although it was towards the right portion of the lane, the entire vehicle was within the second lane itself. Clearly, the resting position of the two cars was more consistent with the Plaintiff’s version of the accident than the Defendant’s. There was no reason for the defendant to be driving with his car’s left wheels straddling the left lane markings of the second lane if he was travelling straight along the second lane when the accident happened. It was also not his case that he was driving in that manner. The inference was that it was likely that he had cut into the second lane from the left, resulting in the collision.
9       Further, the point of impact, as seen in the photographs was entirely consistent with the Plaintiff’s version of how the collision took place. The point of contact was the rear right corner of the Defendant’s car and the front right corner of the Plaintiff’s car. The point of impact was at the opposite corners for the two cars. This was consistent with the Defendant’s car having cut into the second lane from the left just before collision. On the other hand, if the two cars were both in the second lane before collision (the Defendant’s version), the point of impact would have been nearer to the centre of the back of the Defendant’s car and the centre of the front of the Plaintiff’s car; or the point of impact for at least one of the two cars would have been nearer the centre. The photographs however, showed that the point of impact for 
both
 the cars were at their opposite corners.
[note: 9]
 The inference was that the Plaintiff’s version of the accident was more probable.
The damage pattern
10     The other objective evidence would be the damage pattern of the vehicles. The Plaintiff’s car was damaged at the front left part of the car.
[note: 10]
 The Defendant’s car was damaged at the rear right corner. The damage pattern showed that the collision was not the typical front to rear collision as suggested by the Defendant’s version of the accident. In a typical front to rear collision the damage to the vehicles would be found closer to the centre portion of the front and back respectively of the colliding vehicles. In fact, a closer look at the damage to the Defendant’s car would show that the damage to the right rear corner of the car extended towards the right side of the car.
[note: 11]
 This was more consistent with the Plaintiff’s version of the accident. The damage pattern suggested that the Defendant’s car had cut from the left into the path of the Plaintiff’s car when the collision took place. As with the resting position of the vehicles, the inference from the damage pattern was that the Plaintiff’s version of the accident was more probable.
The Defendant’s Contentions
The Defendant’s explanation for the resting position of his car
11     I considered the other points raised by the Defendant. In respect of the resting position of the cars, the Defendant stated that his car was in that position because his car had been 
lifted
 up and pushed forward after the collision before it eventually came to a stop at an angle closer to the bus lane.
[note: 12]
 This statement was made by the Defendant to give an explanation for the resting position of the Defendant’s car, which weighed against the Defendant’s version of the accident. The Defendant was essentially saying that his car ended up at the left edge of the lane, with the left wheels in the bus lane because it was pushed there from the centre of the lane by the Plaintiff. There was however firstly, no objective evidence of the Defendant’s car been lifted up and pushed forward to that position. Further, the implication of the statement was that the Defendant’s car was pushed to the left edge of the lane after a collision from 
behind
, although it was travelling along a straight road. By his own case, the Defendant had applied brakes and his car had slowed down and was coming to a stop. The Defendant had also stated that he saw from his 
rear view
 mirror that the Plaintiff’s car was suddenly 
very close behind
 his car, about half a car’s length or less away, just prior to the collision.
[note: 13]
 That been so, there was no explanation as to why the Defendant’s car would have been pushed to the left edge of the lane when both the cars were travelling one behind the other just prior to the collision.
12     Moreover, the Defendant’s explanation for how his car had ended up in the resting positon did not take into account the impact point and damage been at the respective corners of the cars. As the point of impact between the two cars was clearly at the rear right corner of the Defendant’s car and the front left of the Plaintiff’s car, for the Defendant’s car to be pushed by the Plaintiff’s car from the centre of the lane to the left edge, the Plaintiff’s car would have to be straddling the next lane to the right at the start of the collision. Neither side however said that the Plaintiff’s car was in that position just prior to the collision. The Defendant’s explanation for the resting position of his car was plainly inconsistent with the objective evidence.
That the Defendant observed the Plaintiff driving erratically prior to the accident 
13     Next, the Defendant stated in his AEIC that he first noticed the Plaintiff’s car before the junction of Coleman Street with North Bridge Road. The Defendant saw that the Plaintiff’s car was travelling on the third lane from the right, and after the Coleman Street junction he noticed the Plaintiff’s car moving into the lane that he was travelling on. Further, the Defendant also stated that he noticed the Plaintiff driving erratically.
[note: 14]
 The Defendant’s case was that his car was travelling ahead of the Plaintiff’s car at all material times. That been the case, the Defendant would have observed all of the above in his 
mirrors
 as he was driving. Whilst it is not uncommon for a driver to notice a particular vehicle moving in front of him on the roads, it is unusual for a driver to pay so much attention to a vehicle moving some distance 
behind
 him and for an extended period. Drivers pay attention to the front as they drive, for obvious reasons. Wayward driving ahead would naturally attract attention, not just because it is simply in the line of sight; but more importantly, drivers would need to respond to situations on the road in their direction of travel. On other hand, there is no reason to pay particular attention to vehicles that are not travelling immediately behind. Further, it would be challenging to do so as the only means of looking behind when driving are the rear view and wing mirrors. In this case, it was not disputed by parties that traffic was heavy at the material time. By the Defendant’s case, the Plaintiff’s car did not at any time pass the Defendant’s car, even up to the point of collision. Despite this, the Defendant claimed to have noticed in the midst of heavy traffic, not only the manner in which the Plaintiff was driving, but also the different lanes he was driving on at different points on the road. I found this improbable; and his claim contrived.
14     The Defendant plainly thought this might be so. In the next paragraph of his AEIC he stated as follows:
[note: 15]
 
“I am extra observant on the road as I used to work for BMW and have also test-driven many sports and/or high end cars. Additionally, I have also attended defensive driving courses at the Institute of Advanced Motoring in the United Kingdom.”
 
15     The Defendant had sought to explain his interest in the coming and going of the Plaintiff’s car before the collision. However, that the Defendant was “extra” observant on the road did not explain why he would have noticed the Plaintiff’s car among the many vehicles travelling behind him on that day along North Bridge Road, in what was said to be heavy traffic. The Defendant did not explain why he needed to be observant of the Plaintiff’s car which was not travelling immediately behind him; and his reasons for expending such efforts.
That the Defendant saw that the Plaintiff’s car was suddenly very close behind his car just prior to collision
16     As alluded to above, the Defendant had stated that he saw from his rear view mirror that the Plaintiff’s car was suddenly very close behind his car, about half a car’s length or less away, 
just
 prior to the collision. The Defendant said that the Plaintiff must have therefore accelerated and overtaken other vehicles to get to be immediately behind the Defendant.
[note: 16]
 The thrust of the Defendant’s point presumably was that the Plaintiff was driving in a hurried manner.
17     For the Defendant to see the Plaintiff’s car in the rear view mirror when it was very close behind the Defendant’s car, the Plaintiff’s car must be directly behind the Defendant’s car just before the collision. If so, the point of impact would not have been the rear right corner of the Defendant’s car and front left of the Plaintiff’s car, as the damage pattern showed. The two cars would have been square to each other just before collision; and the point of collision would have been around the centre portion of the two cars. Further, a perusal of the photographs (see Annex) taken of the resting position of the vehicles showed that the two vehicles were in a staggered position, rather than directly one behind the other. The objective evidence was contradictory to the Defendant’s assertion. There was no attempt made by the Defendant to reconcile his case with the objective evidence of the resting position and damage pattern of the vehicles.
That there were inaccuracies in the Plaintiff’s GIA report
18     The Defendant through his counsel raised in his oral closing submissions that though the Plaintiff’s GIA report gave the impression that there was another car which had allegedly driven off, there was no mention of another car in his AEIC.
[note: 17]
 A perusal of the report would show that what the Plaintiff stated was that the 
Defendant
 had claimed that there was a car in front that braked suddenly. The Plaintiff then added that the car in front of the Defendant drove off and was not involved in the accident. In the next line of the report, the Plaintiff stated that “luckily” he “jammed” his brakes and that he took photographs to prove that the Defendant had cut into his lane. The Plaintiff had clearly stated that it was the Defendant who had claimed that there was another car in front. The Plaintiff did not say that he had accepted that as a fact.
19     The Defendant’s counsel also said that whilst the Plaintiff stated in his AEIC that there was a bus in the bus lane, there was no mention of a bus in his GIA report.
[note: 18]
 However, it was not disputed that the bus played no part in causing the accident. It was not a material fact that needed to be reported. In my view, the GIA report must not only be taken in its context, but must be read as a whole. The thrust of the Plaintiff’s GIA report was that the Defendant had cut into his lane; which remained the thrust of his case in court.
Conclusion 
20     The objective evidence in this case were:
(a)     The resting position of the vehicles.
(b)     The damage pattern.
21     The inference from the objective evidence was that the Plaintiff’s version of the accident was more probable.
22     The other arguments put up by the Defendant were:
(a)     His explanation for the resting position of his car.
(b)     That he observed that the Plaintiff was driving erratically prior to the accident.
(c)     That he saw that the Plaintiff’s car was suddenly very close behind his car just prior to collision.
(d)     That there were inaccuracies in the Plaintiff’s GIA report.
23     Having considered these arguments put up by the Defendant, I found that they did not advance the defendant’s case. Taking into consideration all of the above and in the totality of the evidence, I preferred the Plaintiff’s version of how the accident happened. In the circumstances, I found that the Plaintiff had proven his case on a balance of probability. I noted however, from the damage pattern that the Defendant’s car would have been ahead of the Plaintiff’s car at the point of collision. This suggested that the Plaintiff ought to have the Defendant’s car in view when it cut in from the left. The Plaintiff ought to have kept a better look out whilst on the road; and taken the appropriate action to avoid the collision. There was a duty for road users to keep a look out for contingencies; even if it is a car cutting in from a bus lane. Given the circumstances, I attributed a 20% contributory negligence to the Plaintiff.
24     I accordingly gave judgment for the Plaintiff to the extent of 80% of the agreed damages of $20,000, interest at 5.33% from date of writ to judgment; and costs fixed at $4,700, with reasonable disbursements to be agreed or taxed; and GST.
Postlude: The application to call a new witness after closing submissions
Circumstances under which the application was made
25     After the conclusion of the trial and just before oral judgment was to be delivered, the Defendant suddenly made an oral application to call a new witness. The matter had been set down for a one-day trial, as is the usual practice for such road accident damage claims in the State Courts. The cross-examination of all witnesses had concluded in the morning and both counsel had given their oral closing submissions just before the lunch hour. The matter was stood down to 3 pm in the afternoon for me to deliver oral judgment. This is again the ordinary way road accident damage claims are disposed of in the State Courts. At about 3 pm, just when I was about to deliver oral judgment however, the Defendant’s counsel Mr Narayanan made a sudden application to call a new witness.
26     The new witness was said to be the security manager of the Supreme Court, one Mr Tay Wee Boon (“Tay”). According to the Defendant, he had made contact with Tay after the accident requesting for the footage of the Supreme Court security cameras facing North Bridge Road. Tay told him that the security footage had been over-written. Tay also told him that “the whole incident was blocked by a pillar”.
[note: 19]
 The Defendant and his counsel however made no effort to make any arrangement to call Tay as a witness, for one and half years from the time of the accident to the trial. At the latest, the Defendant and his counsel would know when the Writ was filed against the Defendant in Oct 2014, a year before the trial that the Plaintiff was proceeding against the Defendant. They took no steps to arrange for Tay to give evidence. Instead, they decided to make an application to call him as a witness, for the very first time, after the trial had concluded. No reason was proffered for not taking any steps to arrange for the calling of Tay before the trial. There was also no reason given for choosing to make an application to call Tay after closing submissions. There were a total of four pre-trial conferences before the trial date was given. No intimation was given by the Defendant or his counsel to either the court or the other side that he was going to call Tay to give evidence.
The nature of the purported evidence
27     Aside from the above inexplicable delay in arranging and applying to call Tay as a witness, several other issues arose from this belated application to call Tay as a witness. The first was that Tay had made it clear that the video footage was over-written. Tay was to come to court to 
recall
 what he saw on the 
security footage
 one and a half years ago, before it was over-written. In other words, he was not an eye-witness to the accident. He was recalling what he saw recorded by a recording device. Further, Tay made it clear that the 
entire
 incident was blocked by a pillar in the security footage. Whilst his evidence might be admissible, the weight to be given to it was another question.
28     However, what was of greater concern was that there was no indication on the day of the trial (or to-date) that formal approval had been given to Tay to give evidence in this case. I noted that Tay’s proposed evidence was connected with his official duties as the security manager of the Supreme Court. However the dispute was a private one between two members of the public which did not concern the Supreme Court or Tay. Tay would purportedly come to court to relate what he saw in the security footage for purposes of a private dispute. More pertinently, his evidence would obviously involve information that might be sensitive to the security of the Supreme Court. As it were, Tay had already revealed that the security footage became over-written and was irretrievable. The period, frequency and extent of the over-writing were potentially sensitive information. Tay had also said that a portion of the road, including the entire accident area was blocked by a pillar. His evidence would relate to possible blind-spots in the security cameras facing North Bridge Road. Such blind-spots, if any, were plainly sensitive information. If Tay were to be cross-examined by counsel, such information would be revealed if counsel was to test his evidence. Setting any parameters of the cross-examination would not only be impracticable, but would prevent his evidence to be tested fully by counsel. Whilst Tay had readily told the Defendant that he was prepared to give evidence for him, Tay did not have the last word on the matter. His superiors had to give the approval. There was however no indication that the prior approval of his superiors were sought when the application to call him as a new witness was made at the end of the trial.
The proportionality principle
29     There was no question that if I had allowed the application at the end of the trial for Tay to be called, the trial would have to be adjourned. Tay was not in court and his AEIC had not been prepared. Further, no approval had been obtained from his superiors for him to give evidence. Moreover, the parties, both of whose evidence were completed would likely have to be recalled to the stand. The closing submissions, which were completed, would have to be repeated. The result was tantamount to restarting the trial. Juxtaposed against this was the fact that the trial had completed and judgment was about to be delivered when the application was made.
30     In the context of a claim arising out of a minor road traffic accident and involving the sum of $20,000, from the perspective of proportionality, there is much to be said for the finality of proceedings. The answer that the Plaintiff could be compensated by costs holds less water in small value civil cases where overall costs should be proportional to the value of the claim. Compensating any party with costs in exchange for protracting a small value dispute in court is anathema to the proportionality principle. It will be going down a regressive path. Further, besides costs, the proportionality principle prescribes that time and effort expended on a case should be proportional to the value of the claim, the importance of the case and the complexity of issues; and the consideration of allotting to a case an appropriate share of the court’s resources, while taking into account the need to allot resources to other cases. Protraction of the case on secondary evidence, at the end of the trial, would plainly run counter to the sense of proportion.
31     Proportionality must be distinguished from reasonableness in relation to costs or reasonableness in the conduct of the case. The assessment of reasonableness in relation to costs or conduct involves the consideration of the circumstances at the time without the need to give consideration to an overall balance. Proportionality on the other hand takes a broader approach. The test for proportionality on a particular manner of conducting litigation is more holistic. A step in proceedings that may be reasonable in terms of costs and conduct should still be subject to the question of whether the step is proportionate.
[note: 20]
32     In Australia and United Kingdom, the proportionality principle has been gaining traction in recent decades. Legislative reforms have included inserting statements of “overriding purpose” in procedural rules. The overriding purpose is usually stated to include dealing with cases in ways which are proportionate to the amount of the money involved, the importance of the case and the complexity of the issues. It also includes allotting to a case an appropriate share of the court’s resources, while taking into account the need to allot resources to other cases.
[note: 21]
33     In 
Towards Proportionality – The “Quick, Cheap and Just” Balance in Civil Litigation
, Brenda Tronson noted as follows:
[note: 22]
 
“Of particular interest is the growing acceptance that justice and fairness, taken in their totality, affects the right of a party to their “day in court”. Traditionally, that concept included a significant tolerance for the manner in which a party chose to present their case. Now, as the High Court has observed, there is an assumption that the overriding purpose in case management legislation “will coincide with the dictates of justice”. In other words, justice and fairness no longer necessary mean providing a party with every opportunity to present their case, but now require a court to take into account the impacts of litigation (including costs and delays) on the parties, on third parties and on the administration of justice in general.”
 
34     Whilst this is said in the context of the Australian jurisdiction, the proportionality approach of the Australian courts provides illumination for the way forward.
35     In my view, the test often applied in deciding whether to allow an application by a party, being whether there is prejudice to other side which cannot be compensated by costs, should no longer be germane. The test is too narrow. The proportionality principle calls for a broader approach. The amount of money involved in the case, the importance of the case, the complexity of the issues and allotting an appropriate share of judicial resources are overriding considerations. That the other party can be compensated by costs is no reason to protract a case. The time to be taken by parties and their lawyers to do the work, the impact on court resources and the duration of litigation on the whole are all relevant factors. Proportionality should be the principal consideration.
My decision on the application 
36     In respect of the belated application to call Tay, I therefore took into consideration the following:
(a)     The late stage of the application, it being made 
after
 closing submissions and just before delivery of oral judgment in a one-day trial. If Tay were to be called, the trial would have to be adjourned and restarted.
(b)     The Defendant and his counsel had made contact with Tay just after the accident, one and a half years before the trial. Yet no attempts were made to apply to call him as a witness. No reason was given for the failure to make arrangements before the trial for Tay to give evidence; just as no reason was given for applying to call him only 
after
 all the evidence and closing submissions.
(c)     Not only would Tay be giving secondary evidence, his evidence would be based on what he saw on a video recording. Further, he had stated that part of the road in question was obscured in the video recording.
(d)     There was no indication on the day of the trial that formal approval had been given to Tay to give evidence in this case.
(e)     Allowing the belated application would result in restarting the trial and recalling the witnesses, on an adjourned date.
(f)     For a road traffic accident claim involving the sum of $20,000, from the perspective of proportionality, a finite end to proceedings was paramount. Protraction of the case on secondary evidence, at the end of the trial, would plainly run counter to the sense of proportion.
(g)     The argument that the Plaintiff could be compensated by costs held less water in small value civil cases where overall costs should be proportional to the value of the claim. In deciding whether to allow the application to call a new witness after the completion of the trial, the consideration was whether doing so would be proportionate to the quantum of the case, the importance of the case and the complexity of the issues. Further, I took into consideration the need to allot to the case an appropriate share of the court’s resources, while taking into account the need to allot resources to other cases.
37     In view of the considerations above, I disallowed the oral application, made just before the delivery of judgment, to call a new witness in Tay.

Woo Bih Li J:
1       In Criminal Case No 26 of 2008, Yong Vui Kong (“Yong”) was charged in the High Court (“HC”) with trafficking in 47.27g of a controlled drug, namely diamorphine, an offence under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”). After a trial, Yong was convicted on 14 November 2008 and sentenced to suffer death.
2       Yong filed an appeal in Criminal Appeal No 13 of 2008. However, his then counsel, Mr Kelvin Lim subsequently stated in a letter dated 23 April 2009 to the Registrar of the Supreme Court of Singapore (“the Registrar”) that he was instructed to apply for leave to withdraw the appeal. On 29 April 2009, the Court of Appeal (“CA”) affirmed the decision of the court below after receiving confirmation that Yong was withdrawing his appeal.
3       Mr M Ravi, counsel for Yong, said he had been instructed by Yong’s brother Yong Yun Leong (“Yun Leong”) to act for Yong. Mr Ravi requested to interview Yong in prison and eventually received permission to interview Yong on 2 December 2009.
4       In the meantime, the President of the Republic of Singapore (“the President”) declined Yong’s clemency petition on 20 November 2009. According to Mr Ravi, this decision was conveyed to Mr Lim who in turn conveyed the information to Yun Leong on 23 November 2009.
5       Apparently, information was also given that Yong was due to be executed on 4 December 2009.
6       As a matter of urgency, Mr Ravi filed Criminal Motion No 41 of 2009 (“CM 41/2009”) to, essentially, challenge the constitutionality of capital punishment under the MDA.
7       Although the heading of the Notice of Motion filed in CM 41/2009 referred to the CA, the opening paragraph of the substance referred to a petition “before the Justices of the HIGH COURT…”.
8       CM 41/2009 was fixed for hearing before me on 2 December 2009 as a matter of urgency. On that day, Mr Ravi intimated at the outset that he considered the hearing before me to be before the HC and that CM 41/2009 should be heard by the CA and not the HC. He also accepted that the application ought to have a first prayer for extension of time to appeal to the CA (since the initial appeal had been withdrawn). The application, as it stood, did not have that prayer.
9       In view of the imminent date of execution, Mr Ravi urged me to grant a stay of execution pending the hearing of the application by the CA.
10     Mr Jaswant Singh for the prosecution submitted that I had no jurisdiction to grant a stay of execution. He cited my previous decision in 
Vignes s/o Mourthi v PP
 (No 2) 
[2003] 4 SLR 300
 (“
Vignes s/o Mourthi No 2
”) as authority for that proposition.
11     He also submitted that there were only two avenues available to Yong. First, Yong could seek a stay of execution from the President pursuant to Art 22(P)(1)(b) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (“the Constitution”) or, secondly, Yong could apply for the stay of execution when his application for extension of time to appeal was heard by the CA. Mr Singh’s submission therefore appeared to accept that the CA has jurisdiction to order a stay of execution pending the hearing of the application for an extension of time to appeal.
12     Before I address the submissions, I would like to set out briefly the process of appeal.
13     Under s 45(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”), every notice of appeal to the CA shall be filed with the Registrar within 14 days after the date on which the decision appealed against was given.
14     Under s 46(1) SCJA, the trial judge shall record in writing the grounds of his decision, if he has not already written a judgment, when a notice of appeal is filed. Such a written judgment or grounds of decision shall form part of the record of proceedings.
15     Under s 46(2) SCJA, the Registrar shall thereafter cause to be served a notice that a copy of the record of proceedings is available.
16     Under s 47(1) SCJA, the appellant is to file a petition of appeal and five copies thereof addressed to the CA within ten days after service of the said notice from the Registrar.
17     Section 50 SCJA deals with the extension of time for any period of time prescribed by ss 45 or 47 and s 51 deals with a stay of execution. They state:
 
 
 
 
50. The Court of Appeal may, in its discretion, on the application of any person desirous of appealing who may be debarred from so doing by reason of his not having observed some formality or some requirement of this Act, permit an appeal upon such terms and with such directions as it may consider desirable in order that substantial justice may be done in the matter, and may, for that purpose, extend any period of time prescribed by section 45 or 47.
 
51. —(1) Except in the cases mentioned in subsection (4), no appeal shall operate as a stay of execution.
 
(2) The trial court or the Court of Appeal may stay execution on any judgment, order, conviction or sentence pending appeal on such terms as to security for the payment of any money or the performance or non-performance of any act or the suffering of any punishment ordered by or in such judgment, order, conviction or sentence as to the court may seem reasonable.
 
(3) …
 
(4) In the case of a conviction involving sentence of death or corporal punishment —
 
(
a
) the sentence shall not in any case be executed until after the expiration of the time within which notice of appeal may be given under section 45, or any extension of time which may be permitted under section 50; and
 
(
b
) if notice is so given, the sentence shall not be executed until after the determination of the appeal.
 
 
 
 
18     Section 51(2) is not free from difficulties.
19     It states that “the trial court or the CA” may stay execution. In my view, there is a difference between a reference to the trial court and a reference to the HC in the SCJA. The two are not synonymous. In the present case, I was not the trial court as Yong was convicted by another judge.
20     Fortunately for Yong, there is another enabling provision. This is found in s 251 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). It states:
 
 
 
 
251    No appeal shall operate as a stay of execution, but the courts below and the High Court may stay execution on any judgment, order, conviction or sentence pending appeal on such terms as to security for the payment of any money or the performance or non-performance of any act or the suffering of any punishment ordered by or in the judgment, order, conviction or sentence as to the court seem reasonable.
 
 
 
 
21     As can be seen, s 251 CPC is similar to s 51(1) and (2) SCJA but s 251 CPC enables “the courts below and the HC” to stay execution. The latter is not confined to the trial court as in s 51(2) SCJA. Accordingly, I was of the view that 
prima facie
 I had jurisdiction to grant a stay of execution under s 251 CPC.
22     However, there was another question to my mind although it was not raised by either counsel. Both s 51(2) SCJA and s 251 CPC refer to a stay of execution “pending appeal”. Literally speaking, there was no pending appeal since the extension of time had not yet been granted. Nevertheless, I was of the view that a purposive construction would mean that a pending application for extension of time to appeal does come within the meaning of a pending appeal under both s 51(2) SCJA and s 251 CPC.
23     Accordingly, I was of the view that the two avenues mentioned by Mr Singh were not the only avenues available to Yong and that the HC has jurisdiction to grant a stay of execution.
24     I reached the above view even though I was aware that it is arguable that in the circumstances of this case, the CA has no jurisdiction to grant an extension of time under s 50 SCJA because this is not a situation where Yong is debarred from appealing “by reason of his not having observed some formality or some requirement” of the SCJA. He had observed the requirements but had chosen not to proceed with his earlier appeal. On the other hand, there might be another source for the CA’s jurisdiction to grant an extension of time to appeal, if it was minded to grant such an extension. Those considerations were to be decided by the CA and did not mean that I had no jurisdiction to grant a stay of execution.
25     As for 
Vignes s/o Mourthi No 2
, the facts there were different. There, the accused’s appeal had been heard and dismissed by the CA. He was applying to the HC to order a re-trial by the trial court and to order a stay of execution on the death sentence pending the re-trial. As his appeal had been dismissed by the CA after it had heard the appeal, there was therefore no question of an application for an extension of time to file an appeal.
26     Mr Singh also made another point. He submitted that if a stay of execution was granted now, it would then allow an accused person to circumvent the clemency process. On the other hand, Mr Ravi relied on 
Thomas v Baptiste
 
[2000] 2 AC 1
 to argue that the executive should not carry out an execution before an appeal is heard. He also referred to 
Ong Ah Chuan v PP
 
[1981] AC 648
 for the proposition that a condemned man has the right to the protection of the law under Art 9 of the Constitution.
27     I did not think that there was any quarrel with the general propositions which Mr Ravi was relying upon. The point which Mr Singh was making was that Yong had voluntarily given up his right to an appeal and to any protection of law arising from an appeal.
28     In any event, it seemed to me that Mr Singh’s submission about the circumvention of the clemency process went to the merits of the application of the stay rather than the jurisdiction to grant the stay. As this was the first case before the court of an accused person seeking to appeal after he had withdrawn his appeal and his petition for clemency had been declined and since the refusal to grant a stay might render a successful application for extension of time to appeal nugatory, I was of the view that the only appropriate course of action was to grant a stay of execution pending a decision by the CA which I did.",2009-12-03 00:00:00,SG High Court

Philip Pillai JC:
1       This is an appeal by the first defendant (also the “appellant”) against the decision of the district judge issued on 26 June 2009 in which the district judge adjudged the first defendant to be 100% liable for the accident where the first defendant’s car hit the second defendant’s taxi causing it to hit the plaintiff’s car in front of the taxi.
2       It is conceded by all counsel as trite law that the duty of an appellate court is simply as stated in 
Aircharter World Pte Ltd v Kontena Nasional Bhd
 
[1999] 3 SLR 1
 at [19] (which cited with approval Lord Shaw in 
Clarke v Edinburgh
 and 
District Tramsways Co 1919 SC
 (HL) 35 at p 36):
 
 
 
 
… In my opinion, the duty of an appellate court in those circumstances is for each judge of it to put to himself, as I now do in this case, the question, Am I- who sit here without these advantages, sometimes broad and sometimes subtle, which are the privileges of the judge who heard and tried the case - in a position, not having those privileges, to come to a clear conclusion that the judge who had them was plainly wrong? If I cannot be satisfied in my own mind that the judge with those privileges was plainly wrong, then it appears to me to be my duty to defer to his judgment.
 
 
 
 
Also at [19] (which cited with approval Lord Thankerton in 
Watt v Thomas
 [1947] 
AC 484
 at p 487–488):
 
 
 
 
… an appellate court which is disposed to come to a different conclusion should not do so unless it is satisfied that any advantage enjoyed by the trial judge by reason of having seen and heard the witnesses could not be sufficient to explain or justify the trial judge’s conclusion. …
 
 
 
 
3       The grounds of this appeal are that first, the judgment of the district judge is improbable and against the weight of the evidence; second, that it is wrong in light of established documents, contemporaneous reports and photographs; and third, it disregards material facts.
4       In support of his case, the appellant submits the following factors as justifying an appellate court to reverse the trial judge’s decision:
(a)     firstly, that nowhere in the relevant contemporaneous Singapore Accident Statement or the Police Report of a Traffic Accident did any of the parties indicate that the plaintiff stopped for what the plaintiff stated in his evidence under cross examination that he stopped for 7-8 seconds before impact;
(b)     secondly, that the plaintiff had failed to call his wife who had been with him in his car as a witness; and
(c)     thirdly, that the trial judge had wrongly rejected the appellant’s version of first collision and accepted the plaintiff’s version of the prior collision.
5       Having considered the submissions carefully, I am not satisfied that these constitute sufficient grounds for me to alter the district judge’s decision on liability. All these submissions have, in fact, already been canvassed before the district judge.
6       It was further argued before me by the appellant’s counsel that some apportionment should have been appropriately ordered by the district judge to the second defendant based on the following factors:
 
 
 
 
 
(a)
 
 
 
the dark and rainy conditions at the time of the accident; and
 
 
 
 
 
(b)
 
 
 
the failure of the second defendant to keep a proper distance of one car length behind the car in front of it based on the Highway Code standard of keeping such distance for every 16 kmph, as all cars were approaching the Fort Road exit of the ECP. It is also argued that had this distance been kept, there might have been no impact or lesser damage to the plaintiff and his car.
 
 
 
 
 
7       Again, all these were fully canvassed before the district judge and nothing has been submitted before me which leads me to be satisfied to vary the district judge’s decision that the appellant be held 100% liable to the plaintiff.
8       I would dismiss the appeal.

1       This is an appeal against the learned District Judge’s (“DJ”) decision of 16 July 2009 whereby the appellant, who had pleaded guilty to two charges of forgery for the purpose of cheating under s 468 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed), was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment on each charge. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently. The DJ noted that the facts are sufficiently unique and warrant a lenient sentence but he might have felt constrained in deciding what the appropriate lenient sentence should be. I am of the view that the sentence of 12 months imprisonment was manifestly excessive and that an appropriate sentence should be two months imprisonment for each charge.
2       The offences were committed in March and April 2007. The appellant is the wife of the complainant, Lim Chin Foong. She had misappropriated funds from the complainant’s joint fixed deposit accounts with his mother by forging the complainant’s signature on bank documents. Four other charges relating to the forgery of the complainant’s signature on three insurance policy surrender requests and a letter in respect of a fixed deposit account were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The total amount misappropriated by the appellant came to S$152,453.22. The appellant used the money to settle personal debts and other expenses.
3       The appellant has no previous convictions for any offence. She claimed, and the learned DJ acknowledged, that some of the misappropriated monies went into meeting expenses jointly incurred by the complainant and the appellant.
4       The appellant had pleaded guilty and confessed her intention to deceive the banks. When confronted by the complainant prior to his making a police report, she had confessed and offered to compensate him although she was unable to do so immediately. The appellant eventually entered into an agreement with both the complainant and the complainant’s mother in which she agreed to forgo her right to claim maintenance for their one-year old child if she was not required to make restitution. The learned DJ was of the view that the complainant’s mother was the real victim in this case as the monies represented her life savings and the agreement reached would be of poor comfort to her. While that may be true, the settlement agreement that the mother consented to was not utterly without comfort to her. It would not be productive to speculate the precise nature of this comfort save to note that, the mother’s loss was not, in itself, sufficient to impose a custodial sentence of 12 months on the facts of this unusual case. For that reason, the sentence here would not be a general precedent.",2009-10-02 00:00:00,SG High Court

Introduction
1       The plaintiff, Dr Wang Sam Lin, is a businessman whose hobby is the owning and racing of racehorses. The defendant, Steven Harold Burridge, is a horse trainer who operates his business under the name “Steven Burridge Racing Stables”. In or about October 2005, the plaintiff engaged the defendant to train several race horses including the horse that is the subject matter of this action, an animal named “King and King” (hereinafter sometimes “K&K”). The relationship between the parties ended badly and the plaintiff has sued the defendant on the basis of averments that:
(a)     the defendant committed trespass to K&K;
(b)     the defendant negligently breached his duty of care to K&K; and
(c)     the manner in which the defendant treated K&K was in breach of the defendant’s contract in relation to the care and training of the horse.
2       The defendant denies all the plaintiff’s allegations. Additionally, he contends that even if he did do what was alleged, the plaintiff has not suffered any loss and damage by reason of his actions and therefore cannot maintain a claim against him. The defendant had mounted a small counterclaim for $1,432.38 being the balance of disbursements incurred by the defendant in respect of the plaintiff’s horses but the sum claimed was paid by the plaintiff after the trial ended. Accordingly, I do not have to consider the merits of the counterclaim.
The background
3       The plaintiff first came to know the defendant in or about October 2005. Subsequently, the plaintiff bought five horses, including K&K, and placed these horses with the defendant for training. The parties did not enter into a written training contract. Their agreement was purely oral.
4       The defendant first raced K&K on 30 October 2005 and on this occasion the horse came in first. Thereafter, it ran well until it fell during a race held on 29 October 2006. Prior to that fall, the horse had won six races in 2006. Due to the fall, K&K did not run again until 16 March 2007 when it came in second. It continued to perform well in subsequent races with the following positions: 2/12, 1/10, 2/8, 1/16 and 3/14. Unexpectedly, K&K finished eleventh out of thirteenth horses in a race held on 28 October 2007 and it was this poor showing that precipitated the events that led to this action.
5       Unhappy with the poor result and dissatisfied with the performance of the defendant, the plaintiff decided to transfer K&K from the defendant’s stables to those of another trainer, one Desmond Koh. This decision was reached over a lunch held on 29 October 2009, which was attended by the plaintiff, Mr Koh, the horse’s jockey for the race on 28 October 2007, and some others. It was taken some time before 1.30pm that day.
6       Mr Koh gave evidence that he had told the plaintiff to reconsider the decision to transfer K&K and that he would wait for further instructions after the plaintiff had discussed it with the defendant. As a matter of etiquette, Mr Koh notified the defendant at about 1.55pm of the plaintiff’s intention to transfer the horse. After speaking with Mr Koh, the defendant called the plaintiff to get confirmation of what he had been told and was informed that the plaintiff was on his way to the defendant’s office.
7       The plaintiff was not prepared to reconsider his decision so, after lunch, he went straight to the office of the Malayan Racing Association (“MRA”) to give formal notice, as required by the Rules of the MRA (“MRA Rules”) of the change in the horse’s trainer. After filling in the necessary forms to transfer all his horses to Mr Koh, the plaintiff and his assistant, Sadasivan Premkumar (“Mr Kumar”), proceeded to the defendant’s office to formally notify him of the transfers. They arrived at the office at about 2pm. The defendant was not there at the time but came in about five minutes later. The plaintiff told the defendant that he wanted to transfer his horses to another trainer and the defendant responded that the plaintiff would have to pay all outstanding fees in cash before the transfer could be effected. The defendant then left the office.
8       The plaintiff told the defendant’s secretary, Angela Foong, that he was only transferring two horses, 
viz
, K&K and another named “King and Infinite”. After she had calculated the outstanding amount for these horses, the plaintiff asked Mr Kumar to cash a cheque for the same. About 20 minutes later, the defendant returned and after finding out that plaintiff intended to transfer two horses only at that time, requested that all four horses in his care be removed. For that purpose, he required full payment of the amounts due for the other horses as well and the plaintiff found that he had insufficient cash to pay the extra amount. He then sent out another representative to get more cash but the bank was closed and the money could not be obtained. In the end it was agreed that the balance could be paid the next day but that the plaintiff’s representatives could remove all four horses the same day.
9       At about 5pm that evening, Mr Koh sent his handlers over to the defendant’s stables to take over the horses and they were all moved to Mr Koh’s premises.
10     The next morning, Mr Koh following his usual procedure upon taking over a horse, sent urine samples of the horses’ urine to be tested. It was discovered that K&K had been treated with a steroid. The plaintiff was then told that K&K had been injected with a steroid without his knowledge and that by reason of such injection, the horse would not be able to participate in any race for 40 days. The plaintiff also learnt that morning that the defendant had withdrawn the horse from participation in the Singapore Gold Cup race which was scheduled to be run on 11 November 2007.
11     The plaintiff was very upset and angry and, through Mr Kumar, he subsequently lodged a complaint with the Stipendiary Stewards of the Singapore Turf Club (“the Stewards”). Shortly thereafter, the Stewards convened an inquiry “regarding the circumstances surrounding the stable transfer and treatment of KING AND KING on Monday, 29 October 2007” (“the Inquiry”). I will come to the determination of the Inquiry shortly but first I should set out the defendant’s account (in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief) of his activities and decisions on 29 October 2007.
12     The defendant stated that at about 5am on the morning of 29 October 2007, he went to his office and sent off by fax the entry form entering K&K for the Singapore Gold Cup on 11 November 2007. Then he went to the stables where he noticed that K&K had not eaten the feed that had been given to him the night before and that morning itself. At about 8.30am, the defendant took the horses that had raced the day before, including K&K, to the veterinary department of the Singapore Turf Club (the “clinic”) for a routine check up. There, K&K was given a Butasyl and Amino injection which was a normal procedure for horses that had raced recently. After the injection, the defendant trotted K&K at the clinic but it could hardly trot.
13     The defendant then realised that K&K was sore in the leg and he looked “tucked up” and his coat was dull. The defendant went back to the clinic to have the horse checked and medicated further if necessary but since the clinic was full, he was told to return in the afternoon. At that stage, the defendant was of the opinion that K&K needed a few weeks of rest. He considered that K&K would not be able to recover from his sore leg soon enough to race in the near future. After considering the risks and benefits of forcing K&K to race before a full recovery, the defendant decided against it. In his opinion, the Singapore Gold Cup race would be run before there was a chance of a reasonable recovery for K&K and therefore the defendant decided that it was in the best interest of the horse and its owner that he withdrew K&K from that race. Withdrawing the horse meant notifying the handicapper, one Mark Webbey, of the decision. So, at about 10.30 that morning, the defendant spoke to Mr Webbey and asked him to withdraw K&K from the race. Mr Webbey responded that whilst he would note the defendant’s request, the defendant should send in the paperwork necessary to formalise the withdrawal. The defendant gave Mr Webbey the necessary papers in the afternoon of 29 October 2007.
14     At about midday, the defendant inspected K&K again and found that its condition had not improved. He decided that it would be best to take the horse back to the clinic soon after 2pm when the clinic opened. At about 1.55pm, he received a phone call from Mr Koh. Mr Koh informed the defendant that the plaintiff had asked him to take the plaintiff’s horses over from the defendant. The defendant then called the plaintiff to find out what was going on and was told that the plaintiff was coming to meet him at his office. While waiting for the plaintiff, the defendant decided to carry on with his duties as usual and he therefore prepared K&K to be taken to the clinic.
15     Later in the afternoon, the defendant took K&K to the clinic. He told the vet on duty that K&K had an injury and was lame and asked that a short-acting anabolic steroid injection be administered to help the horse recover. The defendant said that he had read about the good properties of such injections in horseracing magazines and had also been told of this by vets in Australia. He had used anabolic steroid injections when working in Malaysia and he believed that the treatment was beneficial and could be used to promote a horse’s recovery during difficult racing and training periods. The defendant asserted that he believed in good faith that an anabolic steroid injection could help K&K in its recovery.
16     The vet examined K&K and agreed with the defendant’s suggestion. The defendant had to sign a veterinary request form and thereafter the injection was administered. The vet informed the defendant before administering the injection that the withholding period for the drug was 40 days. By this, the vet meant that the horse would not be able to race for least 40 days and that at the expiry of that period, the horse would have to undergo a blood test to ensure that it was free from the steroid before being allowed to race again. The defendant was not concerned about this period because he had already withdrawn K&K from the Singapore Gold Cup race and he was intending to rest K&K before racing him again. The Committee Prize race on 2 December 2007 was also too close a race for K&K to recover fully and be able to race. As for the Cathay Pacific Hong Kong Invitation Cup race on 10 December 2007, that was not an issue as the date of the race was just after the withholding period. Thus, provided K&K had recovered and had been invited to race, it would be able to participate. Therefore, the defendant told the vet to proceed with the injection.
17     The defendant stated that the injection was given to the horse at about 2.30pm and he then returned the horse to the stable. He also said that at about 2.15pm he received a phone call from his secretary who told him that the plaintiff had arrived at his office and was waiting for him there. The defendant then made his way back to the office where the plaintiff told him that he wished to transfer all the horses to Mr Koh. The defendant responded that he wanted to be paid in full for all the horses before he would sign the transfer papers. According to the defendant’s statement, he was in and out of the office several times that afternoon while the plaintiff was waiting there (from about 2.15pm to well after 4.30pm). It was only much later in the afternoon that it became clear to him that the plaintiff was taking his horses to Mr Koh.
18     The Inquiry took place over three days: 31 October, 5 November and 7 November 2007. Four of the Stewards formed the panel. They took evidence from the defendant, one Dr Matthias Muurlink, the vet who had examined K&K on 29 October 2007, the plaintiff and Mr Koh. After hearing the evidence, on the third day, the chairman informed the defendant that the Stewards believed that he had a charge to answer under Rule of Racing 152(3) of the MRA Rules which reads:
 
 
 
 
No person shall act in a manner which in the opinion of the committee or the local committee or the Stewards, is, or may be prejudicial to the integrity or proper conduct or reputation of: a) horse racing in Singapore and/or Malaysia.
 
 
 
 
The charge itself was formulated under Rule 152(3)(a) and the particulars thereof were as follows:
 
 
 
 
You a licensed Trainer, Mr Steven Burridge, did after being informed that the racehorse, KING AND KING was to be transferred from your Stable, arrange for that gelding to be treated with Veterinary Medication on Monday, 29 October 2007. The result of this treatment effectively ruling KING AND KING ineligible to start in any race for a minimum period of forty days. This action was carried out without the knowledge or consent of the Owner and/or the new Trainer and is in the opinion of the Stewards an action prejudicial to the good reputation of horse-racing in Singapore.
 
 
 
 
19     The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge. He subsequently read out and submitted a statement in relation to his actions on 29 October 2007 and the panel asked him further questions. Having deliberated on the matter, the panel returned and the chairman informed the defendant that they believed the charge to be substantiated and formally found him guilty of the charge as read. There was then a hearing on penalty. At the end of the hearing and upon further deliberation, the chairman informed the defendant that the nature of the charge was quite a serious one and while the appropriate penalty was one of a fine, the fine was of a significant amount as the matter was serious and the amount must be seen to be a deterrent to others. The panel then imposed a fine of $25,000 on the defendant.
The claim
Trespass
20     As stated in 
[1]
 above, the plaintiff’s claim proceeds on three bases. The first basis, which he describes as his “principal claim”, is that of trespass.
21     
Clerk & Lindsell on Torts
 (Sweet & Maxwell, 19
th
 Ed, 2006) (“
Clerk & Lindsell
”) at [17-123] defines trespass to goods as follows:
 
 
 
 
The action of trespass to goods, 
de bonis asportatis
, has always been concerned with the direct, immediate interference with the claimant’s possession of a chattel. Though the reference to asportation suggests what is perhaps the most common feature of this form of trespass, that is, the taking away or removal out of the claimant’s possession, 
the wrong of trespass includes any unpermitted contact with or impact upon another’s chattel
. [Emphasis added]
 
 
 
 
22     The general view taken by English writers is that trespass to chattels is actionable 
per se
 (ibid.):
The better position seems to be that direct and deliberate interference is trespass even if no damage ensues.
In the case of 
The Kota Bakti
 
[1993] 1 SLR 849
, the Court of Appeal emphasized that trespass to goods is “a wrongful physical interference with them” (at 861).
23     To establish that there was direct interference amounting to trespass, it would suffice that the defendant had used the chattel deliberately or was negligent in causing damage (
Clerk & Lindsell
 at [17-124]):
 
 
 
 
If he uses a chattel deliberately, erroneously believing that it is his, that is a deliberate and direct act amounting to trespass, though it is accidental, as far as he is concerned, that the legal result is wrong. It is sufficient that he intended to do the act complained of, or was negligent in producing an injury; he need not foresee the legal consequence of his interference.
 
 
 
 
24     It can be seen from the above definitions that where the trespass consists of wrongful use rather than interference with possession, it is important to establish such wrongful use that the trespasser had no authority from the owner to carry out the action complained of. In this particular case, K&K was initially put into the defendant’s care and control by the plaintiff and the plaintiff authorised the defendant to do all such things as were necessary for the proper care and training of the horse. The defendant’s evidence was that while he was the trainer of the horse, he made all the decisions regarding its care and medication and the plaintiff did not require him to get prior approval before taking such decisions. The plaintiff himself acknowledged in the course of the trial that it was never the practice for the defendant to discuss with him or inform him of the treatment the defendant was giving to the plaintiff’s horses prior to such treatment being administered. Thus, the defendant obviously had the plaintiff’s authority to take all such steps as he deemed fit for K&K’s well being.
25     In establishing trespass on 29 October 2007 therefore, it must first be established whether at the time that the steroid injection was administered to K&K, the defendant still had authority from the plaintiff in relation to the care of the horse. The plaintiff’s position was that the defendant’s appointment as trainer of K&K had been terminated by the time the injection was administered. He submitted that the contract was terminated at about 2.15pm on 29 October 2007 and that thereafter, the defendant had taken the horse to the vet and the steroid was given while the plaintiff was waiting in the defendant’s office for his cheque to be cashed so that the defendant’s bills could be paid off. The defendant’s case was that the horse was treated by a qualified vet of the Singapore Turf Club while the defendant was still the plaintiff’s trainer in possession of K&K with a duty to care for it until it was transferred to the new trainer.
26     The defendant in his submissions relied on his explanation that he had already made arrangements in the morning to take K&K to the vet for treatment in the afternoon. It was only after this that he had heard about the plaintiff’s intention to transfer the horses from the new trainer, Mr Koh. Mr Koh had requested the defendant to sort out any differences he had with the plaintiff and had expressed the hope that the defendant and the plaintiff would resolve any misunderstanding that they had “and continue their partnership”. The plaintiff had turned up at the defendant’s office at 2.15pm and the two were talking about the plaintiff’s concerns. In the midst of discussions, the defendant’s assistant had turned up with K&K and the defendant then left with the assistant to keep the pre-arranged appointment at the veterinary clinic. The defendant relied on evidence given by Mr Koh that the plaintiff had only made the final decision to transfer the horses later in the afternoon. This, the defendant submitted, must have been after 4.30pm. Thus, prior to the final decision being made, the plaintiff’s horses were still under the custody, care and control of the defendant and he had a duty to care for a sick horse expeditiously rather than to abandon his obligations at the first indication that the plaintiff may appoint another trainer and transfer the horses.
27     A comparison between the defendant’s accounts of the timing of the injection as contained in his affidavit and as contained in his evidence in court and the subsequent submissions shows that the defendant had changed his stand. Although the defendant did not expressly state so in his affidavit, the strong impression that he gave there was that he had taken the horse to the vet prior to the plaintiff’s arrival at his office and that at the time of the injection he thought there was still a possibility of changing the plaintiff’s mind about moving the horses since Mr Koh was not keen on taking over the animals. On the other hand, his closing submissions showed his recognition of his admission in court that he had spoken with the plaintiff in his office before he took K&K to the vet in the afternoon. His testimony in court was that the plaintiff had arrived at the office at about 2.15pm with seven other people and when he asked the plaintiff what the matter was, the plaintiff’s reply was that he had to change trainers and that he had lost face the previous day. The defendant had then told the plaintiff that K&K had been with the defendant for two and half years and had had a great amount of success. Whilst he was trying to persuade the plaintiff not to change trainers, his boys who were handling the horses came to the door and told him that he was late for the vet and he then left the office and took the horse to the vet. At the clinic he had the SA injection administered because he was doing his best to look after K&K and he considered the horse was still his responsibility.
28     The shifts in the defendant’s evidence are telling. From an insinuation that the horse was treated before he saw the plaintiff, the evidence changed to a position where he had treated the horse after seeing the plaintiff but when he was still not certain that the horse would be taken away. On a consideration of the evidence, it is probable that by the time the horse was given the injection, the defendant’s contract with the plaintiff had been terminated and the transfer of the horses (including K&K) was simply, to the defendant’s knowledge, a matter of time in that the transfer would take place as soon as payment of the bills had been made. It is definite that the defendant was aware at the time of the injection that the plaintiff wanted to terminate his services. First, he had been notified of this intention by Mr Koh and second, even before meeting the plaintiff in his office, he knew that the plaintiff was on his way to the office and must have inferred that the purpose of the visit was to terminate the contract even if the plaintiff had been reluctant to say as much during the telephone conversation. The defendant was aware of the plaintiff’s unhappiness with K&K’s performance and the consequence of that unhappiness had been conveyed to him by Mr Koh. So at the time the defendant was at the clinic in the afternoon, he knew what was in store.
29     I think, however, that in fact the plaintiff had already met the defendant in the latter’s office before the horse was taken to the vet in the afternoon. I also consider that at that stage, the defendant knew that the plaintiff was not going to change his mind. Mr Koh may have expressed some reluctance to take the horses over from the defendant but no such reluctance to terminate the defendant’s engagement was shown by the plaintiff during the meeting. This was clear from the account of what had happened given by the defendant’s secretary, Ms Foong. She said when the defendant met the plaintiff in the office at about 2.15pm, the plaintiff told the defendant that he wanted to transfer his horses to another trainer and when the defendant asked why, the plaintiff explained that it was like man and wife who would have to separate if they could not get along. The defendant then asked the plaintiff the settle his outstanding account in cash and the plaintiff agreed. After this, the defendant left the office and went towards the stables. Whilst the defendant tried to imply that the discussion on the cash payment took place later in the afternoon, Ms Foong’s evidence confirmed that the payment discussion took place during the parties’ first meeting in the office. Given that it was after that first meeting that the defendant took the horse for the SA injection, the defendant must have known then that the plaintiff was not changing his mind and the contract had ended. I therefore do not accept the defendant’s evidence that at the time of the injection he still thought that he could sort out the matter with the plaintiff and prepare the horse for its next race.
30     In my judgment therefore, by the time the injection was administered, the defendant knew that he no longer had the plaintiff’s authority to handle K&K. All that the plaintiff wanted was to take the horse away and the previous understanding in which the plaintiff trusted the defendant to look after the horse and take all necessary steps for its care no longer existed. Even if the defendant had only known of the plaintiff’s intentions from his conversation with Mr Koh and the plaintiff’s statement that he was going to meet the defendant in the office, the defendant would still not have been justified in administering the SA injection to the horse without the plaintiff’s express consent. This was recognised by the Inquiry which found the defendant guilty of undertaking an action prejudicial to the good reputation of horseracing in Singapore when he, knowing of the intended transfer of the horse, had the injection administered. In my judgment, the administration of the injection was a wrongful physical interference with K&K and as such administration was ordered or caused by the defendant’s instructions, the defendant committed trespass on K&K.
31     In this respect, I should state that although the injection was administered by a vet in the clinic, it was clear from the evidence that the practice of the vets at the Singapore Turf Club (the “Turf Club”) was to administer such injections at the trainer’s request. The plaintiff’s expert witness, Dr Russell Glenn Robertson-Smith, a vet from Australia, explained the uses of anabolic steroids as follows:
 
 
 
 
It’s a – a drug which certainly helps them to eat, it improves their appetite. It also, er, causes, them --- the anabolic part of the drug causes them to lay their muscle, so if we have a horse with a soft tissue injury such as a tearing of the muscle, or a long-term lameness where the horse has lost musculature, we might advise that an anabolic steroid would be an appropriate treatment in those circumstances to ensure the horse eats well, and that there is some recovery to the soft tissue.
 
 
 
 
Dr Robertson-Smith being from Australia was not familiar with the practice followed in Singapore but evidence of this was given by a vet at the Turf Club, Dr Curry Keoughan, who also looked after K&K when it was taken over by Mr Koh. Dr Keoughan testified:
 
 
 
 
If a trainer requests a drug, we always examine the horse to an extent to determine whether it would be safe to administer that drug. It’s not always the same as saying I agree that I would use SA. I would probably never choose to recommend SA to any horse but that doesn’t mean it’s not an acceptable viable treatment and the trainer does have quite a valuable input on the treatment of the horses. So I believe I might be deemed confusing again but Dr TS(?) would have examined the horse and felt it safe to give the drug. But that doesn’t mean he would have necessarily come up with his own idea to treat the horse with the drug.
 
 
 
 
The above evidence was consistent with that given by Dr Koos van den Berg, the head veterinarian at the Turf Club at the material time. Dr van den Berg stated that in 2007, anabolic steroids were favoured by trainers to promote the appetite of a horse and very often a trainer would request that this medication be administered. Dr van den Berg explained that if a horse had a poor appetite this was a condition that was difficult for a vet to verify from examination so what happened was that the anabolic steroid would be administered on the trainer’s request. If a trainer asked for the injection, the vet would make sure that the trainer was aware of the withdrawal time and thereafter would administer the drug but the vet would not need to examine the horse before doing so. The defendant himself straightforwardly testified that he had requested that the steroid injection be administered. He considered the request justified on the basis that he was doing the best he could to ensure the welfare of the horse.
32     The defendant maintained throughout that what he did was done in the best interests of the plaintiff and the horse and that there was nothing malicious or wrongful in his decision to treat K&K with an anabolic steroid. These arguments even if accepted in full do not afford the defendant a defence to the claim of trespass. As pointed out above, an action in trespass to goods requires unpermitted contact or wrongful interference. There is nothing inconsistent between having a duty to care for the horse and having a duty not to wrongfully interfere with the plaintiff’s possession of the horse. The scopes of those duties are distinct: any act that falls within the duty of care does not fall within the scope of wrongful interference. However, that is not to say that the boundaries of those duties do not shift according to the circumstances. Once the defendant was told that his services were terminated and that K&K was to be transferred pending payment in cash (which was being arranged for immediately), the defendant was under a duty not to do anything to the horse that would deprive the plaintiff of the benefit of the horse, subject to, perhaps, a duty to treat the horse due to reasons of urgency or pressing need but even then, given that the plaintiff was in the defendant’s office and could be consulted immediately on any decision to be taken in respect of the horse, the scope of the defendant’s discretion in relation to K&K was extremely small.
33     Second, his best intentions and lack of malice are not a defence to an action in trespass. That is clear from the passage from 
Clerk and Lindsell
 cited at 
[23]
 above and also in the passage at [25-11] of 
Bullen & Leake & Jacob’s Precedents of Pleadings
 (Vol 1, London Sweet & Maxwell) which states that “deliberate conduct (in the erroneous belief held by the defendant that he was acting lawfully) does not amount to a defence if the act otherwise amounts to trespass”. Finally, although the SA injection caused no physical injury to the horse, it did result in a withholding period of over 40 days, a period during which the horse could not have been entered for any race.
34     Having already been told that his services were terminated, the defendant proceeded to have K&K injected with the anabolic steroid which on all the evidence was an optional treatment and not occasioned by any urgency or emergency. At that time, it would have still been open to the defendant to have asked for the consent of the plaintiff or Mr Koh before doing so. The defendant failed to give any explanation whatsoever as to why he did not attempt to take either course before administering the SA injection despite knowing full well what the consequence of the treatment was. The defendant also could not show that there was an urgent need to administer the SA injection. Despite the defendant’s pleas of innocence, it has been established that there was unpermitted contact and wrongful interference with the horse.
Negligence and breach of contract
35     The plaintiff submitted that if the court found that the defendant’s act of causing K&K to be given the injection constituted trespass to the horse, then it should follow that the defendant was also liable for breach of his service contract; in the alternative, if the court was of the view that the trespass occurred after the service contract had been terminated, then the plaintiff said that the defendant, by failing to keep the horse from being interfered with, was negligent.
36     As far as breach of contract is concerned, I have accepted the plaintiff’s submission that the contract had been terminated by the time that the injection was administered. Accordingly, the plaintiff does not have an action for breach of contract. However, I will consider the issue briefly on the basis that the contract was ongoing at the time the injection was given.
37     In relation to the contractual claim, the plaintiff had pleaded that it was orally agreed between him and the defendant that the defendant would train K&K and the plaintiff would pay the monthly training fees, veterinary fees and entry fees and other expenses incurred for the horse. It was also pleaded that this contract contained implied terms that the defendant had a duty to maintain the health and fitness of the horse so that it would be fit and in the best condition to run in races, not to do anything that would cause personal injury and/or affect its health and to conform to the MRA Rules to which all trainers had to adhere to and the direction by circulars sent by the Turf Club to trainers.
38     The dearth of submissions on the contractual claim is some indication of the level of the plaintiff’s confidence in this basis of claim. As regards the assertion that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty to maintain the health and fitness of the horse, such a duty would be consistent with the defendant’s duties as a trainer. It is, however, unlikely that such a duty is an unqualified one amounting to a warranty that K&K would always be healthy and fit or in the best condition to run races at all times. There was no evidence produced that that was the parties’ intention either. There was no express term the horse should not be given a substance that would result in it not being able to race for 40 days and I do not see the basis for implying such a term since the purpose of the contract was not that the horse should race in every race regardless of its physical condition but that the horse should be looked after so that it could be in fit condition to race.
39     Additionally, the plaintiff has not adduced any evidence to show that the defendant had failed to maintain and care for the health and fitness of K&K. As noted above, Dr van den Berg had testified that the anabolic steroid treatment was used to stimulate the appetite of horses and was often given upon a trainer’s request. The plaintiff therefore cannot show that the defendant failed to maintain or care for the health of K&K by administering the injection. None of the three vets who testified said that the defendant’s treatment was inappropriate for treating the horse and Dr Keoughan also agreed that the SA injection was not harmful to the horse. Therefore, any allegation that the defendant breached his contractual duty to maintain or care for the health of K&K must fail.
40     As for the alleged implied term that the defendant would conform to the MRA Rules and to the directions by circular sent by the Turf Club to trainers, the plaintiff did not put in any submissions on why such terms should be implied into the contract between him and the defendant. There was no evidence either that terms of this nature were commonly found in contracts between horse owners and horse trainers or were recognised by the industry as being customary in the trade.
41     Further, a term that the defendant will conform to the MRA Rules cannot pass the “business efficacy” test which is a common test used to determine whether a particular term is implied into a contract or not. The MRA Rules are the rules that govern and regulate the sport of horseracing at four turf clubs in Malaysia and Singapore. The MRA Rules provide a regulatory framework for those turf clubs to ensure proper horseracing standards and enforce disciplinary measures. Accordingly, a large part of the MRA Rules governs conduct and persons that are beyond the owner-trainer relationship.
42     The relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant was one where the defendant, as trainer, took possession and care of the horse. The plaintiff paid the defendant his salary and disbursements. There is no necessity to imply that the defendant had to conform to the MRA Rules for the arrangement between the plaintiff and the defendant to work.
43     The contractual claim must, therefore, fail.
44     As for negligence, I do not see any cause of action here either. The pleading of negligence in the statement of claim reads as follows:
 
 
 
 
31.    Further or in the alternative, the Plaintiff … says the Defendant had a common law duty of care to the Plaintiff in training the said horse King and King and not doing anything that may cause injury to the horse or to the health of the horse and to conform to the MRA Rules of Racing for which he was paid training fees monthly and had negligently breached the said duty.
 
 
 
 
It can be seen that the pleading in negligence was a rehash of the pleading relating to breach of contract.
45     The defendant was not careless in relation to the care of the horse. The action complained of was one that was taken deliberately and was, on the medical evidence, an action that could benefit the horse in that it could stimulate K&K’s appetite and could also improve its muscle condition. The adverse effect would be on the horse’s ability to race during a specified period rather than an adverse effect on the horse itself. The duty imposed on the defendant was to care for the horse. The plaintiff did not plead that the defendant had a common law duty to ensure that K&K could always qualify to race in the sense that it would meet the racing regulations in relation to the presence of proscribed substances in its blood. In my view, the plaintiff’s complaint relates to the consequence to him that the treatment had rather than to the consequence it had on the horse. There was no evidence that the SA injection harmed K&K physically in any way and as I have noted, Dr Keoughan’s evidence was to the contrary. I do not think the duty of care that the plaintiff relies on can be stretched to be a duty to care for the plaintiff’s economic interests in the sense of having a duty to never dose the horse with something that would prevent the horse from racing and possibly winning a prize for the plaintiff. In any case, though I may be repeating myself, such a duty was not pleaded and really is beyond the scope of this judgment.
Damages
46     Although trespass is actionable 
per se
, the plaintiff will only be entitled to nominal damages unless he can show how the trespass caused him to sustain substantial damages. In the statement of claim, the plaintiff pleaded that he had suffered the following loss and damage:
 
 
 
PARTICULARS OF LOSS AND DAMAGE
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1)    The horse could not be entered for the Singapore Gold Cup worth $1.35 million and deprived the Plaintiff of a chance to win the prize money.
 
(2)    The horse could not be entered for the Committee Prize Cup worth $200,000.00 and deprived the Plaintiff of the chance to win the prize money.
 
(3)    The horse could not be entered for the Cathay Pacific Hong Kong Invitation Cup worth HK$15 million and deprived the Plaintiff of the chance to win the prize money.
 
(4)    The horse could not be entered for any other race for at least 40 days and had to clear a blood test before it was allowed to race and deprived the Plaintiff of the chance to win any prize money.
 
 
 
 
It can be seen from these particulars that the plaintiff was characterising his damages as arising from the loss of a chance for K&K to win prize money in horse races during the 40 days following the injection.
47     The seminal case on loss of a chance as a head of damages is 
Chaplin v Hicks
 
[1911] 2 KB 786
 (“
Chaplin v Hicks
”). This case has been applied locally in 
Asia Hotel Investments Ltd v Starwood Asia Pacific Management Pte Ltd
 
[2005] 1 SLR 661
 where Chao Hick Tin JA, delivering the judgment of the majority, summarised the principles established by 
Chaplin v Hicks
 as follows:
 
 
 
 
139    … At the end of the day, in a case like the present, two questions should be asked and answered. First, did the breach on the part of the defendant cause the plaintiff to lose a chance to acquire an asset or benefit? Second, was the chance lost a real or substantial one; or putting it another way, was it speculative? While, as a rule, the plaintiff always has the burden of proof, the question as to who has to prove a particular fact, and whether in a particular fact situation the evidential burden shifts, are matters dependent wholly on the circumstances. …
 
 
 
 
48     Following the above pronouncement on the law, the first thing that I have to consider in relation to the damages aspect is, whether the trespass committed on K&K by the defendant caused the plaintiff to lose the chance of winning prize money in the ensuing 40 days being the withdrawal period during which the horse could not race. In this case, the answer to the question would, at least superficially, appear to be “yes”. This is because the plain result of the administration of the injection was that the horse was not qualified to enter any races during that period and if the horse could not race, it could not win any prizes. The plaintiff was therefore deprived of the possibility that the horse would win one or more races.
49     The defendant submitted, however, that notwithstanding the inevitable disqualification caused by the injection, the plaintiff did not lose any chance to gain any prize money because during the period the horse was not fit to run and would not have run even if the injection had not bee administered. He submitted that his action was not the effective cause of the loss of the plaintiff’s chance and cited 
JSI Shipping (S) Pte Ltd v Teofoongwonglcong (a firm)
 
[2007] 4 SLR 460
 where the Court of Appeal commenting on the “but for” test of causation usually applied observed at [141]:
 
 
 
 
141    By way of introduction, we must clarify that the “but for” test is a necessary but sometimes insufficient litmus test. It is but an exclusionary test serving to filter out non-causal occasions for the loss (John G Fleming, 
The Law of Torts
 (The Law Book Company Limited, 9th Ed, 1998) at p 220; Harvey McGregor, 
McGregor on Damages
 (Sweet & Maxwell, 17th Ed, 2003) at para 6-008). Therefore, the respondent’s failure to verify Riggs’ remuneration may survive this test, but may still not qualify as an “
effective cause
” or “
proximate cause
”, a concept used to determine whether it is fair to hold the negligence responsible for the loss where other factors have contributed to or intervened in the chain of causation (AM Dugdale & KM Stanton, 
Professional Negligence
 (Butterworths, 3rd Ed, 1998) at para 18.01; 
Chitty on Contracts
 vol 1 (Sweet & Maxwell, 29th Ed, 2004) at para 26-029). The elusiveness of such a concept was incisively alluded to by Andrews J in 
Helen Palsgraf v The Long Island Railroad Company
 (1928) 248 NY 339 at 352, where he opined that “proximate” means that “because of convenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of justice, the law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events beyond a certain point. This is not logic. It is practical politics”.
 
 
 
 
The defendant submitted that it was K&K’s lame and unfit condition that prevented it from racing from 29 October 2007 onwards and not the treatment administered by the defendant.
50     I do not think that in this case it is helpful to the defendant for me to consider whether the administration of the injection was the “effective cause” or “proximate cause” of the loss because obviously the withdrawal period meant that the horse could not race at all for 40 days and this in turn means that the injection was effective to prevent the horse from racing. The injection must, therefore, have been an effective cause of the inability of the horse to win any prize money. On the other hand, if the horse would have not been able to run in any race even if the injection had not been given, then the chance that the plaintiff lost was not a real chance but a speculative one and he would not be entitled to recover any damages. Accordingly, I think that the proper way of assessing the plaintiff’s loss here is to determine the answer to the second question posed in the assessment of damages for loss of a chance 
ie
 whether the chance lost was a real chance or a speculative one.
51     I now turn to the evidence. First, Mr Koh’s evidence: when he received K&K at about 5pm on 29 October 2007, he took note of its condition and decided that the horse needed a break from racing. He found K&K to be sore in the back and to have slight inflammation in both front leg joints and stiffness in both the hind hocks. Mr Koh testified that K&K would not have been permitted by the race officials to run in any races in the condition in which it was on 29 October 2007. He also said that he told the plaintiff that the horse was not fit to run. The next day, Mr Koh took K&K to the clinic to be examined by Dr Keoughan.
52     Second, the evidence was that K&K’s condition did not improve for quite a long period of time and it was only in January 2008 that Mr Koh started to give the horse fast work. He told the court that the horse was rested for at least two months before training resumed and during the two month resting period, K&K was checked frequently by Dr Keoughan. The records of the clinic showed that on 9 November 2007, the horse was x-rayed because of soreness in its front knees, its fetlocks, its feet, its stifles and its hocks. On that day, Mr Koh was advised not to race the horse for a further seven days at least. The horse then visited the vet again on 30 November 2007 and on this occasion Dr Keoughan injected K&K with butasyl because the horse was sore.
53     During cross-examination Mr Koh was asked about the 40 day of withdrawal period. It was pointed out that there were two races within this period (the Singapore Gold Cup and the Committee Prize) and one race, the Cathay Pacific Hong Kong Invitation Cup, outside this period. He was asked whether he agreed that K&K had been unfit to run any of those races. Mr Koh replied in the affirmative and explained that the horse was unfit because he was sore and he needed treatment. The first time K&K was presented to race after going to Mr Koh’s stables was on 20 April 2008, some five months later.
54     Dr Keoughan gave evidence of his treatment of the horse with reference to the clinic notes. He confirmed that on his first inspection on 30 October 2007, the horse was passively lame in three legs and actively lame in four legs. Although fit, the horse was lame enough that it needed to be rested and Dr Keoughan would not have recommended racing it on that day. He informed the court that before each race, a horse must pass a pre-racing lameness examination and if it cannot do so, it is not allowed to race. The vets in the Turf Club have an accepted guideline for determining lameness, the American Association of Equine Practitioners’ Guide to Lameness, and Dr Keoughan was confident that his assessment of K&K’s lameness would have been endorsed by any competent horse vet following the Guide.
55     After 30 October 2007, Dr Keoughan saw K&K every two to four days in the course of his regular visits to Mr Koh’s stables. He continued to check the horse’s condition and it was only on 14 January 2008 that he finally thought the horse was in a condition to begin fast work again. He also considered that during the period between 1 November 2007 and 14 January 2008, K&K would not have passed a pre-race soundness examination.
56     The evidence therefore establishes that even if K&K had not received the steroid injection on 29 October 2007, it would not have been fit to take part in the three races specified by the plaintiff or, for that matter, in any other race which was held during the 40-day withdrawal period. Even if it had been able to start, in its lame condition, it would not have been able to win any prizes. It must be remembered that even before the horse was transferred to Mr Koh, it was not in good condition and had placed eleventh out of thirteen horses in the race run on 28 October 2007. On the morning of 29 October, the defendant had been concerned enough about K&K’s condition and fitness to race that he had, even before having any inkling of the plaintiff’s intention to terminate his services, taken steps to withdraw K&K’s entry from the Singapore Gold Cup. After the transfer, K&K’s condition appears to have worsened rather than improved (it was not noted to be lame on 29 October) and the horse required more than 40 days rest before it was able to go back to fast work in its training programme.
57     Having regard to all the circumstances therefore, I must hold that the chance of winning prize money that the plaintiff lost by reason of the administration of the injection was, due to the condition of the horse, a speculative rather than real chance. The plaintiff did not suffer any real loss by reason of the defendant’s action. I should add that if one used the “but for” test of causation, the result would be the same. To the question: “But for the administration of the injection, would K&K have participated in races during the 40-day period starting on 30 October 2007”, the obvious answer on the evidence would be that it would not have as it was not fit enough to race during that period. Thus, the defendant’s action did not cause the plaintiff to lose any prize money.
58     The evidence also made it plain that in any event, K&K would not have been able to run in either the Singapore Gold Cup or the Cathay Pacific Hong Kong Invitation Cup races. As regards the first, the closing date for entries was 29 October 2007 and therefore once the defendant had withdrawn K&K from this race, there was no possibility of it being re-entered by Mr Koh. In this respect, I accept the defendant’s evidence that the withdrawal was done in the morning even though the papers were filed in the afternoon. The decision to withdraw the horse was made purely on the basis of its condition and fitness to race. The defendant’s evidence on the time of withdrawal was supported by that of Mr Webbey. As for the Cathay Pacific Hong Kong Invitation Cup, both Mr Koh and the defendant testified that in order to participate in this race, the horse would have to receive an invitation from the organisers. The defendant sent in a nomination to the organisers asking for K&K to be invited but the evidence was that no invitation was issued thereafter either to the defendant while he was still K&K’s trainer or to Mr Koh after the horse was transferred. In the absence of an invitation, K&K would not have been able to enter that race.
59     In his reply submission, the plaintiff submitted that he was entitled to damages for breach of contract even if he could not show that the steroid injection caused the horse to be unable to race. The plaintiff asserted that the defendant breached his duty to him by failing to advise him of any need to rest the horse earlier. I have no hesitation in rejecting this submission as being out of bounds. It was not based on any pleaded case and not put to the defendant while he was on the stand.
Conclusion
60     I have found that the defendant committed trespass on K&K. Accordingly, there must be judgment for the plaintiff. As the plaintiff has failed to prove that he suffered any real loss by reason of the trespass, I award him nominal damages of $100. The plaintiff should not have brought this action since no real damage was sustained. Therefore the plaintiff must pay the defendant’s costs of defending the action and the costs of the counterclaim to which he had no real defence.",2009-11-06 00:00:00,SG High Court

Choo Han Teck J:
1       The accused was a 59 year old man charged with 44 charges of sexual offences. He pleaded guilty to nine and the remaining 35 were taken into account for the sentencing of the nine charges. Of the nine charges, five were charges under s 376(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) for having sexual intercourse with the female (“complainant”) over a period of time when she was 8 years old to the time she was 11 years old. One charge was under s 7 of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev Ed) for penetrating the same female’s vagina with a banana when she was 13 years old. One charge was under s 377 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) for anal intercourse when the same female was 13 years old. Two charges were for offences under s 376A(1)(a) and s 376A(1)(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) for penetrating the same female’s vagina with his penis and a wooden stick respectively when she was 15 years old.
2       The accused and the complainant’s father were mediums in a Chinese temple. They also worked as odd job labourers for a common employer. The accused came to know the complainant when she was 7 years old. By that time the accused and the complainant’s family were friends and he often stayed over at the complainant’s family flat at Bangkit Road from time to time. The accused had his own flat at Lower delta Road. The complainant’s parents divorced in 2004 and the matrimonial flat in which the family lived was sold. The complainant moved to a flat at Gangsa Road to live with her mother. Her three siblings lived with the father elsewhere.
3       The offences against the complainant began in the Bangkit Road flat about January or February 2001 when the accused was then 51 years old. The offence under s 7 of the Children and Young Persons Act was committed in the Lower Delta Road flat sometime in June 2006 when the complainant was 13 years old. The offence under s 377 of the Penal Code for committing anal sex was committed in the Gangsa Road flat around the same time. The two offences under s 376A(1) of the Penal Code – (a) and (b) – were committed in May and February 2008 respectively.
4       The offences in question were all serious offences, and there was not much that the accused had shown by way of mitigation other than his age and the fact that he pleaded guilty. The Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) set out a series of what he considered to be aggravating factors – the age of the complainant, the serial nature of the offences, breach of the trust and regard the complainant’s family had for him, the offences having been committed in the sanctuary of the family’s home, the number of offences committed, and also the residual harm to the complainant.
5       Taking all that the DPP had submitted in his submission on sentence, I was of the view that a total of 24 years imprisonment would be a sufficient punishment. The accused was sentenced to 16 years imprisonment for the 1

 charges. The sentences were to run concurrently. He was sentenced to one year’s imprisonment on the 28

 charge. Those two terms were to run concurrently to the 16 years imprisonment in respect of the first set of sentences. Finally, the accused was sentenced to eight years imprisonment each in respect of the 42

 and 43

 charges. The two terms were to run concurrently but consecutively to the previous sets of sentences. The terms of imprisonment were to take effect from 21 July 2008.",2009-08-14 00:00:00,SG High Court

V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the court):
1       The respondent, a 46-year-old
[note: 1]
 Indian male, was charged on 2 November 2007 with the offence of rape under s 376(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”). The complainant, a 15-year-old
[note: 2]
 Chinese female, was moderately mentally retarded with an IQ of 44. She testified that she had gone to buy titbits at the market place across the road from her home at [address redacted] on 1 November 2007. At about 2.30pm
[note: 3]
, as she was walking back to her home through the open deck of the ground floor of Block [xxx], the respondent who was inhaling glue near a low brick wall, grabbed her by the arm as she passed him, pulled her up a nearby staircase and then raped her
[note: 4]
.
2       The respondent denied this charge. He claimed that he was sitting on the low brick wall of Block [xxx] and inhaling glue when the complainant suddenly came up to him and asked for $10
[note: 5]
. According to the respondent, the complainant said that if he gave her $10, she would do anything for him. Although he told her to go away, she continued to pester him. To avoid her, he proceeded to the staircase and sat at the landing, leading to the second floor of Block [xxx], where he continued to inhale glue. Despite this, the complainant followed him, sat next to him and asked him again for money. He then got up and went to the parapet wall. The complainant again followed him and then stood in front of him. She continued to pester him for money. Irritated by her persistent conduct, he pushed her away with his right arm. Suddenly, he heard a stranger, Loo Kin Liak (PW6) (“Loo”), shout at them. He ran away as he thought that Loo was a police officer wanting to arrest him for glue sniffing.
3       The Prosecution called 18 witnesses to prove its case. These witnesses testified as to what they had seen and as to the physical and medical condition of both the complainant and the respondent after the incident. At the close of the Prosecution’s case, the trial judge (“the judge”) called for the defence. The respondent entered his defence and gave his account of what had happened (see 
[2]
 above). At the end of the trial, the judge found that the Prosecution had proved that the respondent had sexual intercourse with the complainant. However, he was of the view that the evidence was not sufficiently cogent to show that the complainant had not consented to the act of sexual intercourse. In particular, he noted, 
inter alia
, what was in his view, the following unbridgeable gaps in the Prosecution’s case, 
viz
:
(a)     that there was no evidence of spermatozoa on the complainant or on the respondent’s clothing or that the complainant was in any distress; and
(b)     that there were inconsistencies with the complainant’s evidence in relation to her reference to the incorrect floor of the block where the incident took place, a previous similar incident the day before in another block, the lifts in Block [xxx] and her description of the sexual acts.
4       Notwithstanding these “gaps”, the judge was satisfied, on the basis of the medical evidence and Loo’s evidence, that the respondent had penetrated the complainant vaginally. In relation to the element of consent, the judge, however, found the evidence inadequate. He found the evidence of the complainant “weak and inconclusive” and was also concerned by the lack of sufficient corroborative evidence indicating the absence of consent, 
viz
, evidence of physical struggle, physical distress after the event and injuries on the complainant’s body. The judge then amended the charge and convicted the respondent of the offence of “carnal connection” with the complainant, pursuant to s 140(1)(
i
) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed) (“Women’s Charter”). The respondent was accordingly sentenced to four years’ imprisonment with effect from 19 August 2008
[note: 6]
.
5       The Prosecution appealed against the judge’s decision to convict the respondent for the offence of carnal connection under the Women’s Charter. Initially, the respondent did not appeal his conviction. At the first hearing before us on 20 May 2009, his counsel indicated that he had already, albeit unsuccessfully, advised the respondent to appeal against his conviction. We adjourned the hearing and advised counsel to speak to the respondent again on whether he wished to appeal his conviction, whereupon the respondent then decided to appeal. We then decided to give the respondent the opportunity to file his appeal out of time. He filed his appeal, and this is our short grounds of judgment on both appeals.
6       We first address the respondent’s appeal. In our view there is no merit in this appeal. The following items of evidence prove this beyond reasonable doubt:
(a)     the medical evidence of Dr Su Lin Lin (PW15) (”Dr Su”) that the complainant (who was until the incident a virgin) had a fresh tear in her hymen that was consistent with penile penetration
[note: 7]
 and that the complainant also had the following marks on her body (“the marks”), 
viz
:
(i)       a 1.5cm linear red mark anteriorly near the lower end of the complainant’s right shoulder;
(ii)       a 2 x 2cm area of bruise anteriorly near the complainant’s left elbow; and
(iii)       six red lines on the complainant’s right flank.
(b)     the evidence of Loo, an independent witness, who testified that he saw the respondent, who was face-to-face with the complainant, embracing her 
and
 doing a backward and forward “pumping movement”
[note: 8]
.
The only person who could have inflicted these marks on the complainant and caused the complainant’s hymenal tear could only have been the respondent and no one else. Loo’s evidence was corroborative as to how this had happened. He had seen the respondent embracing and “pumping” the complainant who was trying to push the respondent away. It was limply suggested to Dr Su that the hymenal tear could have been caused digitally, but this was clearly not the respondent’s defence and was not seriously pursued thereafter by the respondent’s counsel.
7       As to the Prosecution’s appeal, the crux of its case was that the complainant did not consent to the penile penetration of her vagina by the respondent. We have read the transcript of the complainant’s evidence-in-chief and under cross-examination very carefully, and are satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that the complainant did not consent to the respondent’s sexual assault on her. The only issue that had apparently troubled the judge was really whether or not, because of her low IQ, the complainant understood that what the respondent did to her was the act of sexual intercourse. In our view, it was because the judge could not make up his mind on this issue that he found that the Prosecution had not discharged the burden of proving the absence of consent on the complainant’s part. In our view, the complainant’s evidence in this respect was not only quite graphic but also consistent as to how the respondent had assaulted her sexually. She was able to describe the acts of the respondent quite intelligibly although she might not have been clear as to how many times the respondent had tried to penetrate her.
8       The complainant’s account was also consistent with Loo’s testimony that he saw the respondent in the course of a “pumping action” when the respondent was holding the complainant in his arms and she was trying to use her hands to push him away
[note: 9]
. That the respondent was holding onto the complainant tightly is also confirmed by the marks found on her body at the time of the incident (see 
[6]
 above). The fact that the complainant was also sexually assaulted was also supported by her dishevelled physical state and appearance shortly after the incident. Khairunnisa binte Mohamad Ishak (PW13) (“Khairunnisa”), a police officer who arrived at the scene shortly after the incident and who was the first to interview the complainant, testified that the complainant’s hair and clothes were untidy
[note: 10]
 and that she:
(a)     was all sweaty
[note: 11]
;
(b)     was in a “very traumatised condition”
[note: 12]
;
(c)     was talking so fast that she could not understand her
[note: 13]
; and
(d)     kept on saying “He touched me, he touched me”
[note: 14]
.
Vicnaysen s/o Vilasamy (PW3), another police officer who arrived shortly after Khairunnisa, also confirmed that the complainant “was a bit dazed” and “seemed a bit lost”
[note: 15]
. The respondent did not challenge this evidence, and the court below did not given sufficient, if any, consideration to the physical state of the complainant as a corroborative fact.
9       We have mentioned earlier that the respondent’s defence was a bare denial of the charge (see 
[2]
 above). His evidence was that he was inhaling glue when the complainant approached him and pestered him for $10. This evidence was not credible as the complainant’s father had testified that she disliked talking and interacting with strangers
[note: 16]
. But even if the complainant did approach the respondent first, he had no credible explanation for the pumping action in the light of the fresh tear in her hymen.
10     In our view, the judge fell into grave error in concluding that the Prosecution had not shown that sexual intercourse had taken place without the complainant’s consent and that the corroborative evidence was “weak and inconclusive”. The absence of spermatozoa in this case was immaterial given that “sexual intercourse” under s 375 of the Penal Code is established once it is proven that the respondent had penetrated the complainant’s vagina with his penis. Given the finding that the respondent had sexual intercourse with the complainant, the above facts, contrary to the judge’s view, all point compellingly to the conclusion that sexual intercourse had indeed occurred without the complainant’s consent: see 
[7]
–
[8]
 above. Three independent witnesses had seen the complainant struggling while she was being restrained by the respondent. Further there was no suggestion, let alone evidence, that the complainant was a promiscuous girl, or someone who would be involved in paid sex. We therefore find it impossible to believe that the complainant, in spite of her low IQ, would have accosted a total stranger and consented to do anything for him for $10 as the respondent had alleged.
11     For the foregoing reasons, we are satisfied that the twin elements of rape under s 375 of the Penal Code are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we 
allow
 the Prosecution’s appeal and 
dismiss
 the respondent’s appeal. We hereby set aside the conviction of the respondent of the carnal connection charge under s 140(1)(i) of the Women’s Charter and convict the respondent on the charge of rape under s 376(1) of the Penal Code. We adjourn the matter for sentencing on a date to be fixed. In the meantime, the Prosecution may wish to consider obtaining a victim impact report for this purpose. If the Prosecution decides to do so, a copy should be forwarded to counsel for respondent for consideration, and to the court at the sentencing hearing.

Lee Seiu Kin J:
1       The four accused persons are Bangladeshi nationals who have entered or remained in Singapore illegally to seek work. They face a joint charge, that on 9 December 2007 between 10pm and 11pm at Block 18 Ghim Moh Road #03-123, together with one another and in furtherance of their common intention, they caused the death of Mohamad Azanil bin Aman (“the deceased”) by applying a ligature to the deceased’s neck with a towel, occluding the deceased’s nostrils and mouth with another towel, and wrapping around the deceased’s head a bed sheet, with the knowledge that such acts were likely to cause the deceased’s death by strangulation and suffocation, thereby committing an offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder punishable under s 304(b) read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)(“the Act”).
2       Three of them, namely Md Mosharaf (“Mosharaf”), Shamim Ahmed (“Shamim”) and Sobuj Miah (“Sobuj”) also faced a second charge of entering Singapore without a valid pass under s 6(1)(c) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 2008 Rev Ed)(“IA”). The fourth accused, Mamun, faced a second charge of remaining unlawfully in Singapore after expiry of a special pass under s 15(3)(b) of the IA.
Statement of Facts
3       On 29 May 2009, the four accused persons pleaded guilty before me of the two charges faced by each of them. The statement of facts tendered by the prosecution, to which they all admitted without reservation, read as follows:
Accused Persons
1    The four accused persons are all Bangladesh nationals.
They are :-
a) 
 
Md Mosharaf (“Mosharaf”), Fin No G 9043309T, male 21 years old;
b) 
 
Shamim Ahmed (“Shamim”), Fin No F 9070248M, male 37 years old;
c) 
 
Sobuj Miah (“Sobuj”), Fin No G 9043308W, male 21 years old; and
d)
Mamun, Fin No G 9036244K, male 34 years old.
Informant
2    The informant is Shahreezan (“the Informant”) NRIC No. : S 8635521-C, male 22 years old, residing at Blk 15 Ghim Moh Road #05-09, Singapore.
Complainant
3    The complainant is Masmi Binte Osman (“the Complainant”) NRIC No. : S 1218375-E, female, 53 years old, residing at Blk 18 Ghim Moh Road #03-123, Singapore (“the Flat”). She is unemployed and the registered resident of the Flat.
Deceased
4    The deceased is Mohamad Azanil Bin Aman (“the Deceased”) NRIC No. : S 7048682-B, male, 37 years old at the time of his death.
5    At the time of his demise, the Deceased was employed as a security guard. He was a divorcee and was cohabiting with the Complainant in the Flat.
First Information Report
6    On 12 December 2007, at about 9.45 p.m., the Complainant returned to the Flat and discovered the Deceased lying motionless on the floor in the bedroom. She quickly approached the Informant and requested him to call for the police. The Informant then called the police and requested for assistance.
7    On the same day, at 10.08 p.m., Senior Staff Sergeant Lim Yen Teck (“SSSgt Lim”) and his partner arrived at the scene. SSSgt Lim found the Complainant at the ground floor of Blk 18 Ghim Moh Road and he went up to the Flat.
8    Upon entering the bedroom of the Flat, SSSgt Lim found that the room had been ransacked and he saw the Deceased lying motionless on the floor. The Deceased was lying face down. The Deceased’s head was wrapped with a bed sheet, his hands were tied crisscrossed to the back, and his legs were bound together with cloth materials. There appeared to be no sign of life in the Deceased. SSSgt Lim also did not see any visible wound on the Deceased. The Deceased’s legs were nearer to the entrance of the bedroom while the Deceased’s head was nearer to the wall next to the bedroom door. The rear pocket of the Deceased’s trousers was also turned inside out.
9    At 10.21 p.m., Staff Sergeant Tay, a paramedic with the Singapore Civil Defence Force, arrived at the scene. He confirmed that the Deceased was dead but could not provide a time of death as the Deceased’s body was in a state of decomposition.
Facts relating to the charges against the four accused persons under section 304(b) read with section 34 of the Penal Code
10    Sometime in September or October 2007, the Deceased rented out the only bedroom of the Flat to the four accused persons, Shamim, Mosharaf, Sobuj and Mamun. Each of the accused persons had to pay rent of S$150 per month. Although each accused person paid the rent to the Deceased on time, the Deceased had on many other occasions demanded ‘pocket-money’ from the four accused persons. Being immigration offenders, the four accused persons felt compelled to give tens of dollars to the Deceased each time, sometimes even up to hundreds of dollars. The Deceased never repaid any of the ‘pocket-moneys’ to the four accused persons.
11    On occasions when the four accused persons refused to give money to the Deceased when he demanded from them, the Deceased would hurl profanities at them until late into the night. There were also occasions where the Deceased threatened to call the Police if he did not receive any money from the four accused persons. The Deceased also resorted to threatening the four accused persons by saying that he would get his son who was a ‘gangster’ to beat them up if they did not give him (the Deceased) any money.
12    On 9 December 2007, at around 10 p.m., when all four accused persons were in the Flat, the Deceased demanded money from them again. Mosharaf and Mamun had each already given S$50 to the Deceased the day before when he demanded money from them. Thus, the four accused persons refused to give anymore money to the Deceased on 9 December 2007. The Deceased got angry and he picked up his mobile phone from the table and threatened to call the Police.
13    Shamim snatched the mobile phone from the Deceased and handed it to Mosharaf. The Deceased then began to hurl profanities at them, shouting and kicking the furniture in the living room of the Flat to show his dissatisfaction. The Deceased then lost his balance and fell backwards onto a chair.
14    As the main door of the Flat was left open, the four accused persons were worried that the commotion would draw the attention of the neighbours who might then call the police. Mamun then used his right hand to grab the Deceased’s neck. Sobuj used his right hand to cover the Deceased’s mouth to muffle his shouts.
15    As the Deceased was trying to free himself from Mamun and Sobuj, Shamim and Mosharaf each held onto the Deceased’s hands to his back. They pushed the Deceased into the bedroom of the Flat.
16    The Deceased struggled as the four accused persons pushed him into the bedroom. In the bedroom, the four accused persons forced the Deceased to lie face downwards on the floor beside the bed.
17    In order to prevent the Deceased from making more noise, Mamun used a ‘gamcha’, which is a multi-coloured towel used by Bangladeshis, to gag the Deceased’s mouth. Shamim and Mosharaf assisted Mamun by holding the Deceased’s head down. Mamun secured the gag by tying a knot on the left side [of] the Deceased’s neck. As the Deceased was still making noise, a pink-and-white towel was wrapped around the lower part of the Deceased’s face and it was secured with a knot on the left side of the Deceased’s nose.
18    Shamim then used another ‘gamcha’ to tie the Deceased’s wrists behind his back while Sobuj held the Deceased’s hands.
19    Thereafter, Sobuj moved towards the Deceased’s legs and held the Deceased’s legs together. Shamim then used another towel to tie the Deceased’s shins together. In order to secure the legs firmly together, Shamim further used a T-shirt to tie the Deceased’s legs together just above the shins.
20    While Sobuj was holding down the Deceased, the Deceased was still struggling and trying to make noise, albeit his shouts were muffled by the cloth covering his mouth. The rest of the accused persons went about packing their personal belongings as they planned to leave the Flat permanently. When Mamun was done with his packing, he took over from Sobuj and held the Deceased down while Sobuj went to pack his belongings.
21    Before the four accused persons left the Flat, Mamun used a bed sheet to wrap around the Deceased’s head and secured the bed sheet with a knot on the left side of the Deceased’s face as the towel around the Deceased’s mouth had become loose such that the Deceased was able to scream and shout.
22    Sobuj then took the Deceased’s wallet out from the rear pocket of the Deceased’s trousers and handed it over to Mamun who took about $4 out of the wallet. Thereafter, Shamim told Mosharaf to leave the Flat first with the personal belongings of the four accused persons and to go to Kranji MRT Station. Mosharaf then left the Flat first followed by Mamun. Shamim then closed the bedroom door and left the Flat together with Sobuj after they closed the main door of the Flat and locked the padlock on the main gate of the Flat. Mamun waited for Sobuj and Shamim at the ground floor of Blk 15 Ghim Moh Road and when Sobuj and Shamim came down from the Flat, the three of them took a taxi to Kranji MRT Station.
23    At about 11:30 p.m., Mamun, Sobuj and Shamim met Mosharaf at Kranji MRT Station. They spent a night at a monsoon drain next to the MRT Station. The next morning, the four accused persons left the drain and went their separate ways.
24    On 10 December 2007, at about 4 p.m., the Complainant’s sister Maimoon Bte Osman (“Maimoon”) received a phone call from Shamim. The Complainant was with Maimoon at that time. Shamim informed that when he returned to the Flat, he saw the Deceased’s hands and legs were tied up and he asked the Complainant to return to the Flat. The Complainant thought that it was a ruse instigated by the Deceased to trick her into returning to the Flat after her quarrel with him a few days earlier. Maimoon told Shamim to call for the Police and he hung up the phone.
25    On 11 December 2007, at about 5 p.m., the Complainant returned to the Flat with Maimoon. Upon arrival at the main gate of the Flat, the Complainant realised that she had forgotten to bring the keys to the Flat. Thus, she was unable to gain entry into the Flat. She knocked on the main door of the Flat but there was no one in the Flat. The padlock on the main gate was locked but she managed to open the faulty wooden main door to look into the Flat. The Complainant saw the bedroom door was closed and there was no response from the Deceased when she called out for him. She waited outside the Flat for awhile but no one returned to the Flat. The Complainant then left the Flat.
26    On 12 December 2007, the Complainant found her keys to the Flat. She returned to the Flat on the same day at about 9.45 p.m. and found the Deceased’s body in the bedroom.
Arrests
27    On 14 December 2007, at about 7.45 a.m., Shamim was arrested at Blk 552 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10, Singapore. On the same day, at about 3.40 p.m., Mosharaf was arrested at a construction site located at Outram Road. At the point of arrest, Mosharaf was found to be in possession of the mobile phone ‘Singtel’ SIM card which belonged to the Deceased.
28    On 18 December 2007, at about 7.45 a.m., Sobuj was arrested in a warehouse at Defu Lane. Later on that day, at about 10 a.m., at the same warehouse, Mamun was arrested.
Pathologist’s Medical Examination
29    On 13 December 2007, at about 2.15 a.m., Senior Consultant Forensic Pathologist Associate Professor Gilbert Lau conducted a preliminary examination of the Deceased’s body at the Flat. He estimated that the post-mortem interval was approximately a day, meaning that the Deceased had been dead approximately since the early hours of 12 December 2007.
30    On 13 December 2007, at about 9.50 a.m., Associate Professor Gilbert Lau conducted a post-mortem autopsy on the Deceased.
31    Associate Professor Gilbert Lau found on the Deceased’s body bruising of the sternomastoid, sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles, accompanied by fractures of both greater cornua of the hyoid bone and the right superior horn of the thyroid cartilage, corresponding to the ligature around the neck.
32    Associate Professor Gilbert Lau also found a bed sheet firmly enwrapped around the head of the Deceased almost in its entirety, and secured by means of a partial knot on the left side of the face. Beneath the bed sheet, a pink-and–white towel was firmly wrapped around the lower part of the face, occluding both nostrils and the mouth of the Deceased. The towel was twisted over the posterior aspect of the neck and secured by a partial knot on the left side of the nose. A multi-coloured piece of thin cloth rolled upon itself was firmly applied as a circumferential, double-looped, ligature to the neck and it was secured with a partial knot on the left side of the neck.
33    There were also fractures of the Deceased’s right 6
th
 and 7
th
 ribs, anterollaterally, associated with bruising of the pectoral muscles bilaterally.
34    The medical findings of Associate Professor Gilbert Lau show that the Deceased’s death would have been consistent with asphyxia due to strangulation by ligature and suffocation. There was no morphological evidence of any natural disease which could have caused or contributed to the death. A copy of Associate Professor Gilbert Lau’s autopsy report is enclosed in Annex ‘A’.
35    The acts were done by the accused persons with the knowledge that they were likely to cause the death of the Deceased but without any intention to cause death. Thus, on 9 December 2007, between 10.00 p.m. and 11.00 p.m., at the Flat, the four accused persons had, in furtherance of the common intention of all, committed the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder by causing the death of the Deceased under Section 304(b) read with Section 34 of the Penal Code.
Facts relating to the charge against Mosharaf under section 6(3)(a) of the Immigration Act
36    Sometime in July 2007, Mosharaf entered Singapore illegally without a valid passport. On 14 December 2007, Mosharaf was arrested at a construction site at Outram Road.
37    Thus, Mosharaf has committed an offence of entering Singapore illegally under Section 6(1)(c) of the Immigration Act (Cap. 133) and punishable under Section 6(3)(a) of the said Act.
Facts relating to the charge against Shamim under section 6(3)(a) of the Immigration Act
 
38    In November 2006, Shamim entered Singapore without a valid passport. On 14 December 2007, Shamim was arrested at Blk 552 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10.
39    Thus, Shamim has committed an offence of entering Singapore illegally under Section 6(1)(c) of the Immigration Act (Cap. 133) and punishable under Section 6(3)(a) of the said Act.
Facts relating to the charge against Sobuj under section 6(3)(a) of the Immigration Act
40    On 10 December 2006, Sobuj entered Singapore illegally without a valid passport. On 18 December 2007, Sobuj was arrested at a warehouse at Defu Lane.
41    Thus, Sobuj has committed an offence of entering Singapore illegally under Section 6(1)(c) of the Immigration Act (Cap. 133) and punishable under Section 6(3)(a) of the said Act.
Facts relating to the charge against Mamun under section 15(3)(b) of the Immigration Act
42    The Controller of Immigration of the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore (“ICA”) had issued a special pass to Mamun that was valid until 16 September 2007. Upon expiry of the special pass, Mamun failed to report to ICA and he remained in Singapore unlawfully. He was arrested on 18 December 2007 at a warehouse at Defu Lane.
43    Thus, Mamun has committed an offence of overstaying in Singapore unlawfully for a period of 93 days under Section 15(3)(b) of the Immigration Act (Cap. 133).
Mitigation Plea
4       In mitigation, Mr Edmond Pereira (“Mr Pereira”), who acted for all four of them, provided their respective backgrounds which were strikingly similar. They were all young men, aged from 20 to 30 years, who came from impoverished families with many children. They all paid to agents what to them were substantial sums of money – the equivalent of $2,500 to $7,500 in Bangladeshi currency – to be smuggled into Singapore. When they got here they found work in various construction sites. Mr Pereira did not suggest that the slight variations in their individual circumstances warranted any difference in the sentences for the joint charge of culpable homicide. In view of the facts of the case, in particular the similar roles that each played in the commission of the offence, I would consider that they deserve the same sentence for the joint charge.
5       Mr Pereira said that the four accused persons, who had come from poor families, were promised employment in Singapore by agents who absconded with their money without landing them jobs. The four accused persons had harboured hopes of a decent income in Singapore with the objective of providing a future for themselves and their families back home. Instead, after raising a hefty sum of money, they had been cheated and left in the lurch in Singapore. However, there was no turning back as they had no money to return home and also needed to recoup the money their families had raised to get them here.
6       In terms of the events surrounding the commission of the offence, Mr Pereira pointed out that the four accused persons had cooperated fully with the Police after their arrest. They had provided full details of the events and readily admitted to their roles. This had expedited the investigation and they had shown their remorse by agreeing to plead guilty at the earliest opportunity. Mr Pereira’s mitigation plea in respect of the events leading to the offence is found in paras 23 to 41 of his written mitigation and I reproduce them below:
23    Your Honour, we submit that our Clients did not plan the offence nor were they armed with any dangerous weapons on the fateful day. The offence was committed on the spur of the moment.
24    It was not our Clients’ intention to kill the Deceased. The Deceased chose to confront our Clients, constantly demanding more moneys for their stay in the flat. The Deceased also resorted to vulgarities and threatened violence on our Clients. The Deceased had always been the aggressor and on several occasions demanded moneys from our Clients. This continued for a period of about four and a half months. On one occasion the Deceased even took $1.00 from Shamim, when he had only that amount with him at the material time.
25    Each of the accused persons had to pay rental of S$150.00 per month. Although each Accused person paid the rent to the Deceased on time, the Deceased had on many other occasions demanded ‘pocket-money’ from the four Accused persons. Being immigration offenders, the four Accused persons felt compelled to give moneys to the Deceased each time, sometimes even up to hundreds of dollars. The Deceased never repaid any of the ‘pocket-moneys’ to the four Accused persons.
26    On occasions when the four Accused persons refused or were unable to give money to the Deceased when he demanded from them, the Deceased would hurl profanities at them until late into the night. There were also occasions where the Deceased threatened to call the Police if he did not receive any money from the four Accused persons. The Deceased also resorted to threatening the four Accused persons by saying that he would get his son who was a ‘gangster’ to beat them up if they did not give him (the Deceased) any money.
27    Mosharaf and Mamun had each already given S$50.00 to the Deceased the day before the incident when he demanded money from them. This time around (9 December 2007), the four Accused persons refused to give any more money to the Deceased. The Deceased got angry and threatened to call the Police. The Deceased then began to hurl profanities at them, shouting and kicking the furniture in the living room of the flat to show his dissatisfaction. The four Accused persons were worried that the commotion would draw the attention of the neighbours who might then call the police. It was in these unfortunate circumstances, that the 4 Accuseds decided to gag the Deceased’s mouth, to keep him quiet.
28    It is humbly submitted that the Accused persons had endured a period of psychological abuse from the Deceased. It is clear the Deceased was the aggressor in the events that led to his death.
29    We are instructed that the Accused persons were worried about the Deceased after they left the flat. The following day on 10 December 2007, Shamim made a call to the Complainant’s sister, Maimoon. Shamim informed her that when he returned to the Flat, he saw the Deceased’s hands and legs were tied up and he asked the Complainant to return to the flat. We are instructed that they wanted to alert the Complainant so that she could render help to the Deceased as soon as possible. Our Clients were truly concerned.
30    It is humbly submitted that our Clients had endured a period of psychological abuse from the Deceased. The Deceased would direct the vulgarities on our Clients and their families as well. It was very insulting.
31    We are instructed that the verbal abuse our Clients suffered at the hand of the Deceased went for about four months (September/October 2007 to 9 December 2007). As such, our Clients were victims of sustained verbal abuse from the Deceased.
32    It is pertinent to note that our Clients did not use any weapons to inflict injuries on the Deceased although there were weapons such as knives in the flat. It is humbly submitted that this fact is an ameliorating factor compared to those cases where death resulted from stabbing of the victims with weapons.
33    Our Clients do not have any antecedents of any violent nature both in Singapore or Bangladesh. As such, it is submitted that there is no real likelihood of recurrence of similar offence(s) in the future.
34    In our Clients’ 122(6) statements, they have stated that they felt very tortured by the Deceased and that it was not their intention to kill the Deceased. Our Clients only wanted to stop the Deceased from shouting. In 
Md Mosharaf’s statement
 he has stated as follows:
“The Deceased always tortured us and scolded vulgarities at us. He always drunk and threw things at us. We cannot tolerate him. He always asked us for money. Four of us were in the house and we wanted to beat him. I pulled the Deceased’s forearm and pulled him into the bedroom. While I was pulling the Deceased, my other three friends were pushing him into the bedroom. When we were in the bedroom, one of my friends asked me to pack my belongings and to leave the house. I packed my belongings and I left the house. That is all.”
In 
Shamim Ahmed’s statement
 he has stated as follows:
“He used to beat and torture us because of money. To protect ourselves, we had to push him and save ourselves. He used to scold vulgarities and shout at us. As he was shouting, all of us went inside the room and he also followed us into the room. We then caught hold of him. All of us tied him up and covered his mouth by a cloth. We tied the cloth around his mouth so that he will not shout at us as we are all illegal immigrants. We were afraid that Police might come. We had no intention of doing such an act. We walked out of the room. We didn’t expect all this will happen. That’s all.”
In 
Sobuj Miah’s statement
 he has stated as follows:
“I had no intention to beat ‘uncle’ in such a manner. I am an illegal here. I followed my friends to stay there and this ‘uncle’ used to ask money everyday. He used to drink and come and beat us and scold us vulgarities. It was beyond our tolerance and that’s why all this happened. I have not got involved in such a thing before, this was due to the misunderstanding and beating I am very sorry for what I have done. I just want the Singapore Police to help us in which ever way they can. That’s all.”
In 
Mamun’s statement
 he has stated as follows:
“Deep from my heart, I have no intention to do such a thing on him. He used to torture us by scolding vulgarities and beating us. Everyday he used to ask for money. We were tolerating him a lot. We had no intention to beat him up. I am deeply sorry. I regret for what I have done and what had happened. I did not expect the person to pass away in this manner.”
35    We are instructed that it was not the intention of the Accused persons to kill the Deceased. They acted on impulse and their collective act of gagging the Deceased and wrapping him to prevent him from moving, led to the unfortunate death of the Deceased. Admittedly, their action collectively would in the ordinary course of nature cause death. But it was not the intention then, to kill the Deceased. Our Clients are deeply saddened by the death and genuinely regret committing the offence.
36    Our Clients realize that the offences for which they are charged have very serious consequences and state that they have learnt a very painful lesson from the unfortunate episode.
37    Our Clients do not wish to downplay the seriousness of their wrong doing and accepts responsibility for the offences committed. Our Clients have gone through the photographs depicting the injuries sustained by the Deceased and couldn’t bear to look at the pictures. Our Clients sincerely apologize to the Deceased’s family including the Complainant.
38    Our Clients deeply regret their actions and are genuinely contrite for their actions. Our Clients do not possess grave killer instincts. They are willing to make amends and learn from their mistakes. Our Clients have a decent family background and are not individuals with history of violence. Being away from their family, having been cheated of their jobs and money, being illegal immigrants and now facing a culpable homicide charge, all in a foreign country have been a living nightmare for the four (4) young men.
39    This entire episode has been a difficult pill for their respective families to swallow. Their families had built high hopes on their sons that they would help ease their financial hardships. With the promise and hope of a brighter future for all instead, they are in a bad situation and are struggling to make ends meet, straddling with debts, which they incurred to send their sons for a promising future ahead.
40    Our Clients plead for leniency and some compassion for the wrong the[y] have done. They know that if they were given a last chance, they would do something good with their life.
41    Our Clients have expressed deep remorse and regret for their involvement in the attack on the Deceased and his untimely death. They know that they will be forever haunted by the death of the Deceased.

Submissions on Sentence
7       Mr Pereira relied on the following cases to support his contention that the term of imprisonment should be on the low end of the scale:
(a)     
Public Prosecutor v Jamal anak Nyalau
 
[2002] 3 SLR 66
: The three accused persons were charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder in furtherance of their common intention, an offence under s 304(b) read with s 34 of the Act. The second accused had introduced the deceased to a prostitute who provided sexual services to the deceased. The deceased subsequently called on the prostitute for sexual services again and offered her $20. However she demanded $150. The first accused asked the deceased if he wanted her services for $150, but the deceased declined. The first accused then punched the deceased repeatedly. The deceased, who did not retaliate, collapsed on the ground. The other two accused also attacked him. The second accused took $15 from the deceased’s wallet. They carried and left the deceased a short distance away along the back lane, where he was later found, dead. All three accused persons pleaded guilty and were sentenced to six years and six months’ imprisonment.
(b)     
Public Prosecutor v Katun Bee Binte S Ibrahim
 
[2004] SGHC 46
: The accused, a woman, claimed trial to a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304(b) of the Act. She had stabbed her lover in the abdomen with a knife after a quarrel and after both of them had been drinking. In mitigation, the accused pleaded that she had had a very difficult life. She had raised her five children practically single-handedly. She had failed relationships with two men before becoming involved with the deceased. That relationship also did not turn out well. It was a frustrating one to her as he was spending her hard-earned money on drink and was abusive to her when drunk. Although the trial judge found that the accused was the one who took a knife from the kitchen and stabbed the deceased, he was also of the view that all her frustrations had came to a head when she committed the act. The accused was sentenced to three and a half years’ imprisonment.
(c)     
Public Prosecutor v Lim Boon Seng
 
[2004] SGHC 113
: The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304(b) of the Act. The accused was indebted to the deceased in the sum of $1,800. The deceased, on being told that an instalment that was to have been paid would be delayed, confronted the accused at his fruit stall. The deceased shouted vulgarities at the accused and started fisting him. The accused retreated a short distance when he was hit and noticed a knife nearby. He grabbed it and used it, killing the deceased with a single stab. The accused was sentenced to three years and six months’ imprisonment.
(d)     
Public Prosecutor v Lim Ah Seng
 
[2006] SGHC 122
: The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304(b) of the Act. The accused had been estranged from his wife, the deceased. He had been subjected to repeated physical and psychological abuse by the deceased. On the day of the offence, the deceased informed the accused that she wanted to go to the house of the accused’s mother to see their six-year-old daughter. He told her to go there on her own. In the evening, while the accused was at home, the deceased arrived and said that she did not have the keys to his mother’s home. The deceased said she wanted to bring the daughter to Jakarta to which the accused objected and a quarrel ensued. They then engaged in sexual intercourse at the invitation of the deceased. Thereafter, the deceased again raised the subject of her taking the daughter to Jakarta. She said that if the accused refused, she would lodge a police report that he had raped her. They had another argument and she slapped him. She also told him she had a record with the Institute of Mental Health and it would be alright for her to kill him. She then rushed into the kitchen and tried to grab a knife but was stopped by the accused. She ran back into the bedroom and he followed her to stop her from throwing things around. The deceased slapped the accused again and tried to strangle him. The accused retaliated by strangling her instead. After a while, her grip on his neck weakened and she fell. The accused tried to wake her up but to no avail. The accused then called his mother. When the police and other officers arrived, the accused was in the living room. He went to the kitchen and returned with two knives. There, he apparently stabbed himself in the thighs. Eventually, he surrendered himself. The accused was sentenced to two years and six months’ imprisonment.
(e)     
Public Prosecutor v Chan Soi Peng
 
[2007] SGHC 184
: The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304(b) of the Act. The accused was earlier provoked by the deceased and had tried to avoid him. The deceased later struck the accused in the face with a bottle of liniment that he was carrying. The accused retaliated with his fists and a violent fight ensued. Following this, the accused went to get a knife from the kitchen, and in the subsequent fight, he stabbed the deceased in the chest. The accused pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years and nine months’ imprisonment.
8       The prosecution on the other hand submitted that this merited a term of imprisonment on the high end of the scale and cited the following precedents:
(a)     
Public Prosecutor v Yan Haibing
 (CC 7 of 2007, unreported) (“
Yan Haibing
”): The accused pleaded guilty to a charge under s 304(b) of the Act for causing the death of a prostitute. He had engaged her sexual services but was unhappy with it. He decided to teach her a lesson. A struggle ensued in the course of which the accused punched her head twice. To prevent her from shouting and struggling, the accused placed his hand on her throat and stuffed a towel into her mouth. He then wrapped her head with a towel and secured it with adhesive tape. Finally, he tied her wrists and ankles together with adhesive tape. The cause of death was certified as “cerebral anoxia, due to mechanical asphyxia”. The accused was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment.
(b)     
Tan Chee Hwee v Public Prosecutor
 
[1993] 2 SLR 657
 (“
Tan Chee Hwee
”): This case involved a bungled burglary of a house, resulting in the death of the domestic maid. She had returned early to the house and chanced upon the burglary in progress. A struggle ensued between the maid and the appellants. In their attempt to subdue her and to stop her from screaming, the maid was strangled to death by an electrical cord. The trial court convicted them of murder but this was overturned by the Court of Appeal which accepted that the appellants had acted out of “
fear that the maid’s screaming would alert the neighbours who might send for the police and not the fear that they would be recognised by the maid
.” The Court of Appeal convicted them instead of a reduced charge under s 304(b) of the Act. Each appellant was sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment.
(c)     
Public Prosecutor v Budiman Bin Hassan
 
[1994] SGHC 28
 (“
Budiman
”): The accused was charged with murder for killing a prostitute by strangling her with a lanyard in order to keep her quiet when she shouted and struggled with him during a heated dispute. The trial judge found that the accused did not intend to cause serious injury to the prostitute and that he had only intended to stop her from struggling and shouting. The trial judge then convicted the accused of a lesser charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304(b) of the Act. The trial judge sentenced the accused to six years’ imprisonment. In determining the appropriate sentence, the trial judge noted that the accused was “
in a state of panic when the deceased started to shout and struggle with him
”. Upon the prosecution’s appeal, the sentence was enhanced by the Court of Appeal to nine years’ imprisonment.
9       The prosecution pointed out the following aggravating circumstances of the case. The four accused persons clearly outnumbered the deceased. They had resorted to excessive force to immobilise the deceased in order to facilitate their escape. There was no way the deceased could have put up any resistance against them. Furthermore, the nature of the injuries suffered as highlighted in paras 31 and 33 of the statement of facts and the manner in which the four accused persons had sought to immobilise the helpless deceased showed the degree of cruelty of the four accused persons and the extent to which the deceased suffered. In fact, he suffered in this painful and contorted position for more than two days before dying. The prosecution highlighted that the four accused persons had perpetuated the offence against the deceased for fear of being caught by the police as immigration offenders. It was for this self-serving purpose of evading possible apprehension that they had caused the death of the deceased. This was similar to the reason for which the two appellants in 
Tan Chee Hwee
’s case had caused the death of the deceased in that case. This showed the length that immigration offenders would go to avoid detection and due punishment. It was therefore an aggravating factor that the offence was committed in order to avoid punishment for immigration offences. Taking into account the sentences imposed in the three cases cited, the prosecution submitted that the facts of the present case merited an imprisonment term of not less than eight years for each of the accused persons.
My Decision
10     In this written grounds of decision I shall only set out my considerations in respect of the sentence for the offence of culpable homicide. The sentences for the immigration offences did not deviate from the norm and it is therefore not necessary to deal with them.
11     The four accused persons were charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder, punishable under the limb (b) of s 304 of the Act, which provides for imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments. Under this limb, the act was done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. In 
PP v Wan Chin Hon
 
[2005] SGHC 121
, Choo Han Teck J (“Choo J”) said at [5]:
The punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304(b) is a range of imprisonment that may extend to ten years, or a fine, or both imprisonment and fine. The sentencing of an offender requires a steadfast devotion to two broad principles – the principle that like cases must be treated alike, and that each case must be assessed on its own merits. These principles are more easily stated than applied. In the case of the act of causing death, the law discriminates a number of categories of culpability, and the range of sentences prescribed varies accordingly. The sentence in each case must be assessed according to such considerations as are right, proper, and fair …
12     In the precedents cited to me by the prosecution and the defence the sentences range from two and a half years to nine years, affirming the view of Choo J that the courts consider each case on its own merits. In relation to the cases cited by the prosecution in which the imprisonment terms ranged from seven to nine years, I noted that the circumstances under which the deaths were caused were rather aggravating. In 
Yan Haibing
, the accused, after punching the victim twice on her head, placed his hand on her throat when she continued to struggle. He pressed her throat forcefully to prevent her from shouting and this succeeded in making her stop. However he maintained the chokehold even as the victim’s arms were flailing. He then stuffed a towel in her mouth, wrapped another towel around her head and used adhesive tape to secure the second towel. He also used tape to tie the victim’s wrists and ankles. The victim had by this time stopped struggling. In 
Tan Chee Hwee
, the two accused persons were trying to subdue the hapless maid and stop her from screaming. During this struggle she was strangled until she lost consciousness and stopped resisting. In the event, she had died from strangulation. In 
Budiman
, the accused had looped a lanyard around the deceased’s neck and pulled it back until she stopped struggling. In all three cases, the accused persons had maintained their chokehold on the victims until they stopped struggling. The cause of death was asphyxiation. In those circumstances, in all probability, the victims stopped struggling because they had died.
13     In the present case, according to the pathologist, the time of death was estimated to be the early hours of 12 December 2007. The four accused persons had tied the deceased up and left him in the flat between 10pm and 11pm on 9 December 2007. This meant that the deceased had remained alive for at least 48 hours before he died of asphyxiation. This indicated that the deceased was not tied so tightly around the neck, mouth and nose as would cause asphyxiation within minutes or even hours. Instead he had remained alive for more than two days. One can only surmise that by then he was so weak from hunger and perhaps from his struggles to free himself that he became unable to continue with his efforts to breathe through the restraints around his nose and mouth. The present case is therefore different from the cases cited to me by the prosecution in which the accused persons had virtually strangled the deceased until they died. Further, the four accused persons were also concerned enough about the deceased being abandoned to call his estranged girlfriend to induce her to return to the flat to free him. This meant that their frame of mind was that he was alive and only needed to be freed. It may be inferred from this that they did not think that the manner in which the deceased was tied up posed an immediate danger to his life. Unfortunately for him and for the four accused persons, the deceased’s girlfriend thought it was a ruse and did not return immediately. And when she finally decided to do so, she forgot to bring the key. These delays turned out to be fatal to the deceased.
14     I took into account the mitigating factors submitted by Mr Pereira. Although the four accused persons had entered or remained in Singapore illegally, they were nevertheless here on account of economic reasons, in the hope of earning and saving enough money to help out their impoverished families back in Bangladesh. Apart from their immigration offences and the culpable homicide offence, they were otherwise law abiding and simply wanted to work for money to send home. They had paid what to them were enormous sums of money to come to Singapore to find work and were cheated by their agents when they got here. The deceased had exploited their situation and had repeatedly extorted money from them. When they did not pay him, he abused them to the extent of threatening to report them to the authorities and getting gangsters to beat them up. The four accused persons endured this psychological abuse for some four months. I took into account the fact that the act was not planned and it was committed on the spur of the moment.
15     Be that as it may, a life has been lost. I cannot ignore the fact that the four of them had ganged up on the deceased and the manner in which they restrained the deceased went beyond the immediate need to keep him quiet and immobile. Instead of merely tying the deceased’s hands and feet to immobilise him and gagging him to keep him quiet, they tied a cloth around his nose and another around his neck, as well as covering his head. Death was by asphyxiation, caused by a combination blockage of the nose and strangulation of the neck. Furthermore, their motive in restraining the deceased was to escape apprehension and subsequent punishment for their immigration offences. The deceased must have spent the last 48 hours of his life in terror and agony as he struggled to breathe against the obstructions in his nose and mouth.
16     Taking into account the circumstances of the offence set out above, I considered that the appropriate sentence for each of the four accused persons on the joint charge of culpable homicide was four years’ imprisonment and sentenced them accordingly.",2009-07-10 00:00:00,SG High Court

Chan Sek Keong CJ:
1       This is a criminal motion filed on 27 February 2009 by the applicant for leave to appeal out of time against his conviction on five charges involving the possession and sale of 1,270 pieces of counterfeit Indian bank notes of 500-rupee denomination (“Indian notes”). The charges were as follows:
(a)     in District Arrest Case No 35420 of 2006 (“DAC 35420/2006”), for possession of 450 pieces of counterfeit Indian notes on 5 August 2006 at about 2.30pm, having reason to believe the same to be counterfeit and intending to use the same as genuine, an offence punishable under s 489C of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“PC”);
(b)     in District Arrest Case No 42714 of 2006 (“DAC 42714/2006”), for selling as genuine 100 pieces of counterfeit Indian notes on 2 August 2006 between 1.00pm and 2.30pm, having reason to believe the same to be counterfeit, an offence punishable under s 489B of the PC;
(c)     in District Arrest Case No 42715 of 2006 (“DAC 42715/2006”), for selling as genuine 120 pieces of counterfeit Indian notes on 3 August 2006 between 1.00pm and 2.30pm, having reason to believe the same to be counterfeit, an offence punishable under s 489B of the PC;
(d)     in District Arrest Case No 42716 of 2006 (“DAC 42716/2006”), for selling as genuine 300 pieces of counterfeit Indian notes on 4 August 2006 between 1.00pm and 2.00pm, having reason to believe the same to be counterfeit, an offence punishable under s 489B of the PC; and
(e)     in District Arrest Case No 42717 of 2006 (“DAC 42717/2006”), for selling as genuine 300 pieces of counterfeit Indian notes on 4 August 2006 between 4.00pm and 5.00pm, having reason to believe the same to be counterfeit, an offence punishable under s 489B of the PC.
2       The applicant pleaded not guilty to the charges. The Prosecution called 11 witnesses to testify against him on the charges. The applicant elected to defend himself and cross-examined ten of the 11 witnesses. His defence was called, and he elected to give evidence. His defence was basically that he received the Indian notes from one Bachu in the course of his business, and that he did not know that the Indian notes were counterfeit as he had checked them with an ultraviolet light. He testified that he was a commission agent for a company called Greenwest International Equity Corporation (“Greenwest”) based in Europe with a branch in Bangkok, and that Bachu, through a courier, gave him the Indian notes to pay for the supply of goods by his principal. He accepted the Indian notes as payment because he would make a profit of $1.00 on each note.
3       At the conclusion of the trial (which lasted three days) on 16 November 2006, the district judge (“the DJ”) found him guilty as charged and sentenced him as follows:
(a)     in DAC 35420/2006, to five years’ imprisonment; and
(b)     in DAC 42714/2006 to DAC 42717/2006, to four years’ imprisonment on each charge.
The sentences in DAC 42714/2006 and DAC 42715/2006 were ordered to run consecutively, and the other charges to run concurrently, thus giving a total of eight years’ imprisonment with effect from 7 August 2006.
4       Although the applicant’s application was filed 27 months out of time, he had written to the Registrar of the Supreme Court earlier on 3 November 2008 (about 24 months out of time) for an extension of time to file his appeal, and to explain why he did not appeal in time and why he should be allowed to appeal out of time. He gave the following reasons:
(a)     Having “expended all [his] arguments” at the trial, he “felt quite impotent” without the aid of any counsel.
(b)     Following an “epiphany” in December 2007, his perusal of the trial papers showed that there was a discrepancy between the report from the Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”) which referred to 1,270 Indian notes and a report from the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) which referred to 1,290 Indian notes. He argued that this discrepancy “should serve to technically disprove the [Prosecution]’s evidence”.
(c)     The DJ had ruled, on the first day of the trial on 1 November 2006, that the Indian notes be sent to the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) in Mumbai for testing, but, on the second day of the trial on 10 November 2006, the DJ informed him that the Prosecution had decided not to do so. As this was contrary to the DJ’s ruling, the applicant queried the DJ, who “cited his incapacity on the issue; stating in response that his was only an arbitrary role”.
(d)     As the Prosecution did not produce any directive from the Attorney-General’s Chambers (regarding the decision not to send the Indian notes to RBI) to the court, this “obliged [the applicant] to assume the perversion of justice by the [Prosecution], and postulate that the RBI analysis results being inimical to the [Prosecution]’s case [were] expediently suppressed to enable [his] conviction to proceed unhindered”.
(e)     If there was indeed such a directive from the Attorney-General’s Chambers, it would be construed as being “highly irregular” as it was “tantamount to executive interference in the independant [
sic
] exercise of judicial authority”.
5       Upon the receipt of this letter, the Registrar advised him of the proper procedure to follow. Hence, the applicant filed this motion which is supported by his affidavit dated 27 February 2009 in which he reiterated the matters set out in sub-paras (a) to (d) of 
[4]
 above.
6       After filing the motion, the applicant filed written submissions dated 26 March 2009 in reply to the Prosecution’s written submissions, in which he repeated his earlier statements, and also made the following allegations:
(a)     “Disturbingly enough, [he] found that the compilied [
sic
] ‘Notes of Evidence’, ostensibly signed by [the DJ], to be incomplete and at gross variance in key points from what had transpired at trial Court on the said dates”.
(b)     The notes of evidence are “contextually selective in [their] representation and [appear] to be a subtle adaptation of actual trial transcripts. Certain portions of trial examinations and testimony of witnesses had been excluded wholly or in part in the hope of adversely influencing the Court to favour the [Prosecution’s] Submissions to deny [his] criminal motion.”
7       At the hearing of this criminal motion, the applicant made the following additional arguments to show that there was merit in his appeal:
(a)     He was not aware that the Indian notes were counterfeit.
(b)     The HSA witness (PW9), who testified that the 1,270 Indian notes were counterfeit, was not competent and did not have the expertise to determine whether the notes were counterfeit because she had no experience in testing Indian bank notes.
(c)     The Indian notes should have been sent to RBI for testing. The DJ had adjourned the matter for hearing because, after looking at the HSA report, the DJ felt that the Indian notes should be tested by RBI in India. The Prosecution had asked for extra time for the Indian notes to be sent for testing in India, hence the hearing was adjourned to 10 November 2006 even though the applicant had asked for an earlier hearing date.
(d)     The Prosecution had not proved that the counterfeit Indian notes belonged to the applicant due to the lapse of time and because the Indian notes had changed hands before the applicant was arrested.
8       In reply, the Prosecution made the following points:
(a)     It was proved, and the DJ accepted, that a chain of evidence had been established to show that the counterfeit Indian notes belonged to the applicant.
(b)     The Prosecution had proved at the trial below that the applicant had reason to believe that the Indian notes were counterfeit because:
(i)       the applicant admitted to the investigating officer that he was part of a syndicate;
(ii)       when he was confronted by a moneychanger with the allegation that his Indian notes were counterfeit, he offered to pay money to the moneychanger in order to settle the matter;
(iii)       even after his Indian notes were rejected by one moneychanger, he tried to sell them to another moneychanger, thereby indicating that he had more than ample basis for believing that the Indian notes were counterfeit; and
(iv)       he refused to offer any explanation when he was cautioned under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”), which entitled the DJ to disbelieve his defence in court.
(c)     A ruling by the DJ that the Indian notes had to be sent to India for testing would have been irregular. If testing was not done in India, the DJ would still have to make a finding of fact based on the available evidence. At the trial, the DJ heard the testimony of the forensic scientist from HSA who had examined the Indian notes (PW9). He would also have read the HSA report before making his finding that the Indian notes were counterfeit.
(d)     The applicant’s argument, that the DJ ordered the Indian notes to be tested in India after looking at the HSA report, had no basis, as the alleged order was made on 1 November 2006 even before PW9 had given evidence in court on 10 November 2006.
(e)     The proceedings below were not adjourned to 10 November 2006 as a result of the DJ’s order for the Indian notes to be tested in India. Instead, at an earlier pre-trial conference, 1 November 2006 and 10 November 2006 along with two other hearing dates were allocated for the trial of this matter.
9       The established tests in determining whether I should exercise my discretion to allow the criminal motion under s 250 of the CPC are, first, the sufficiency of the explanation for the delay, having regard to the length of the delay and, second, whether there is a real prospect of success if leave is granted (see 
Lim Hong Kheng v PP
 
[2006] 3 SLR 358
 at [37]).
10     In my view, this application fails on both tests. The applicant has not given an acceptable explanation for his undue delay of at least 24 months. His argument, that he was not represented by counsel and could not afford to be so represented, is not sufficient as he did not need counsel’s advice just to file a notice of appeal. Moreover, he conducted his defence quite competently and cross-examined ten of the Prosecution’s 11 witnesses. His letter dated 3 November 2008 to the Registrar of the Supreme Court, in which he set out his reasons for wanting to appeal, showed that he was quite inventive in making the best of a bad case. He complained that he could not get any assistance from the prison wardens, but that could not possibly be true because he did manage to write to the Registrar of the Supreme Court.
11     As regards the second test, I find that this appeal has absolutely no prospect of success, even though the DJ has not written his grounds of decision. Having read the notes of evidence, it is clear to me that the DJ did not believe the applicant’s versions of the events which could exculpate him. When he was charged with the five charges and cautioned under s 122(6) of the CPC to give a statement under s 122(5) of the CPC, he refused, and thereby opened himself to being disbelieved at the trial. Furthermore, the evidence against him was overwhelming. From 2 to 4 August 2006, he sold some of the Indian notes to two employees of a moneychanger (PW4 and PW5) at New Bugis Street who then sold some of the Indian notes to another moneychanger (PW3) over a period of three days. PW3 suspected that the Indian notes (which were new) were counterfeit when he felt that they were thicker and smoother than a genuine note and saw that the face of Gandhi appeared cartoonish. He informed PW5 of his suspicions. On 5 August 2006, he asked three experienced fellow moneychangers (PW6, PW7 and PW8) to look at the Indian notes and they confirmed his suspicions. PW3 then informed PW5 of his finding. On the same day, when the applicant came back to sell more new Indian notes to PW5, both PW3 and PW4 confronted him with the fake Indian notes. The police came, arrested the applicant and found more Indian notes (450 pieces) in his bag.
12     The applicant also told the investigating officer (PW1), whilst they were in the police car, that he had received the Indian notes from a foreign agent whom he believed was from a well-organised syndicate doing money laundering, that his role was to exchange Indian rupees to Singapore dollars, and that the syndicate would pay him $1.20 to $1.80 per piece of currency note. He was told not to exchange the Indian notes at Mustafa Centre as that area was covered by other agents. He tried to exchange the Indian notes with moneychangers at Desker Road unsuccessfully, but managed to do so at New Bugis Street (where he was eventually arrested).
13     However, at the trial, he gave an entirely different account of how he came into possession of the Indian notes (see 
[2]
 above). He said he went with the courier, sent to him by Bachu, to change the Indian notes at New Bugis Street. After that, he called Bachu, who owed money to Greenwest, to pay up his debt and Bachu sent him more Indian notes. In brief, his defence was that he was an innocent receiver of the Indian notes whilst acting as a commission agent.
14     This was a nice story which the DJ obviously did not believe since the applicant had never mentioned the existence of Bachu to the police prior to the trial and did not produce any evidence of the existence of Greenwest, much less his relationship with Greenwest.
15     Now let me deal with his arguments specifically, since they had a semblance of plausibility until one reads the notes of evidence.
16     The first argument relates to the alleged discrepancy of 20 Indian notes between the report from CAD which referred to 1,270 Indian notes and the HSA report of PW9, which referred to 1,290 Indian notes (see [4(b)] above). There is no merit in this argument as the police had indeed seized 1,290 Indian notes from the moneychanger and all of them were found to be counterfeit by PW9. The Prosecution’s explanation of the “discrepancy” was that the investigating officer had established that the extra 20 Indian notes were not sold by the applicant, and so the applicant was only prosecuted in connection with 1,270 Indian notes.
17     As to his argument, that the Prosecution had not proved that the counterfeit Indian notes belonged to him due to the lapse of time and because the Indian notes had changed hands before he was arrested, it is equally without merit. All the moneychangers involved in the transactions were called to give evidence and it was established that the applicant’s Indian notes were distinctive in that they were brand new and in very good condition.
18     There is also no merit in the argument that PW9 was not competent to examine the Indian notes. PW9 had worked for HSA for four years and part of her work was to examine questionable currency notes. In her testimony she described how she went about examining the Indian notes, using the list of security features which were found on RBI’s website. The 1,270 Indian notes seized from the applicant failed every one of these security features.
19     With respect to the applicant’s allegation that the DJ had ruled that the Indian notes were to be tested in India after looking at the HSA report and had adjourned the hearing so that such testing could be done, the notes of evidence show otherwise. At the end of the first day of the trial on 1 November 2006, the DJ adjourned it for further hearing on 10 November 2006. The Prosecution then made the following application:
 
 
 
 
[Prosecution]:
 
 
 
Applying for 3 bundles of notes marked “P13” “P14” “[P15 to P17]” to be released to the Prosecution to have them sent to the Bank of India for reports to be prepared regarding the genuineness of these notes. This case was fixed on an urgent basis because the [applicant] is in remand, and was assigned to me only on 11 Oct 2006 … I undertake to return the notes. I will be applying for the case to be adjourned for two months as we need to send the notes to India. The Investigating Officer will bring them there and back.
 
 
 
 
 
[Court]:
 
 
 
“P13” “[P]14” “[P15 to P17]” released to [P]rosecution on the usual undertakings.
 
 
 
 
It would appear from the recorded notes that the case had been fixed for hearing on an urgent basis and, even though the Prosecution had by the time of the trial obtained the HSA report, it was not entirely sure about the case against the applicant. Otherwise, the Prosecution’s request for the release of the Indian notes in order to send them to India for examination would be inexplicable.
20     Be that as it may, the trial resumed on 10 November 2006 without the Prosecution producing a report from RBI. The applicant alleged that the DJ informed him that the Prosecution had decided not to send the Indian notes to RBI for examination. As this was contrary to the applicant’s understanding of the DJ’s ruling, the applicant queried the DJ on the Prosecution’s failure to comply with the DJ’s order. The DJ (as alleged by the applicant) then “cited his incapacity on the issue; stating in response that his was only an arbitrary role”. However, as this account of the exchange is not recorded in the notes of evidence, it has led the applicant to allege that the notes of evidence were “incomplete and at gross variance in key points from what had transpired at trial” (see [6(a)] above) and he has continued to remain suspicious of the integrity of the notes of evidence. It is not difficult to understand his state of mind as the notes of evidence did not record what had happened after the Indian notes were released to the Prosecution and when they were returned to the court. There is no record of any explanation given by the Prosecution as to why it did not send the Indian notes to RBI. This is a pity, because it would seem unlikely that the Prosecution had not given any explanation at all or that the DJ had not asked for any explanation.
21     However, piecing together what the applicant has alleged, it seems to me that if what he said had indeed occurred, it did not occur in the way as described by him, due to either his faulty memory after such a long lapse of time or the likelihood of his trying to interpret his exchange with the DJ in his own favour. As I indicated during the hearing, the only reasonable explanation was that the Prosecution must have informed the DJ that it was not necessary to send the Indian notes to RBI for examination as PW9 would be called to testify on her findings, and when the applicant protested, the DJ must have replied that his role was only that of an arbitrator, and not “arbitrary” as the applicant had alleged.
22     The last argument of the applicant is that he did not know that the Indian notes were counterfeit as he had merely received them from Bachu in payment of a debt due to his principal. He exchanged the Indian notes only because he could make some money from the exchange. In my view, the evidence shows that the applicant had reason to believe that the Indian notes were counterfeit. First, his early attempt to change some of them at Desker Road was unsuccessful. Second, if he were merely an innocent recipient of the Indian notes as an agent, there would be no reason for him to examine the notes under an ultraviolet light. Third, when confronted by PW3 and PW4, he did not express surprise but agreed to pay $750 to buy back the Indian notes so that he could sell them at another location. Fourth, he gave no explanation as to how and why he came into possession of the Indian notes when he was cautioned five times under s 122(6) of the CPC.
23     The applicant seems an astute person from the way he presented his arguments before me. It is a pity that he did not use his intelligence in a lawful activity. For the foregoing reasons, the criminal motion is dismissed.",2009-04-27 00:00:00,SG High Court

            “If any Event of Default shall have occurred or in the event of any proceedings or steps being taken to exercise or enforce any powers or remedies conferred by any incumbrance over the Property, the Lender may redeem such incumbrance or procure the transfer of it to himself and may settle and pass the accounts of any incumbrancer entitled to such security and any accounts so settled or passed shall be conclusive and binding as well between the Lender and Borrower as between such incumbrancer and the Borrower. In such event, the title deeds and documents of the Property kept by any such incumbrancer shall be delivered to the Lender. The Borrower shall take all such steps and action as shall be necessary to effect such redemption and delivery of title deeds as aforesaid.”[7] 
            (9) 在訂立該貸款協議前，房委會並沒有收到該物業的補價評估申請；此外，截止2014年10月10 日為止，房委會沒有收到該物業根據《房屋條例》附表所提及的補價。 
            (10) 該貸款協議的條款並沒有預先獲得房委會或房屋署署長的書面批准。 
    
        裁判官的裁斷 
        3.  裁判官作出了以下的裁斷： 
         
            (1) 上訴人與葉女士就相關物業有一項關乎土地的押記協議。 
            (2) 無論如何，涉案貸款協議和協議內提及的押記均與涉案物業有關，他肯定押記協議是一項關乎土地的協議，亦符合《房屋條例》第27A(a) 條的要求。 
            (3) 協議中的押記部份是無效的，因為葉女士沒有獲得房委會的書面准許將涉案單位如此押記。 
            (4) 即使貸款協議並非完全無效，只要押記部份違反了條例第17B(2)條的規定，基於押記部份無效，第27A條的罪行便已被干犯。 
         
        4.  據此裁判官裁定上訴人罪名成立。 
        上訴理據 
        5.  在上訴時，上訴人由馬維騉大律師代表[8]，他提出以下上訴理據： 
         
            裁判官錯誤裁定相關協議為一項關乎土地協議，而相關協議對葉女士所持的物業構成一項押記，因而根據條例第17B條是無效的。 
         
        條例的相關條文 
        6.  本案主要關乎《房屋條例》中的以下兩項條文： 
        「第27A條 
         
            (1) 凡─ 
            (a) 任何人看來是就土地設定按揭或以其他方式將土地押記，或將土地轉讓或以其他方式讓與，或訂立一項關乎土地的協議，而不論該人是以貸款人或借款人身分或是以其他身分行事；及 
            (b) 該項看來是如此作出的按揭、其他押記、或該項看來是如此作出的轉讓、其他讓與、或該項看來是如此作出的協議，根據第17B條是無效的， 
            該人即屬犯罪，可處罰款$500,000及監禁1年。 
            第17B條 
            (1) (略去) 
            (2) 凡─ 
            (a) 第(1)(a)(ii)款描述的土地[9] 是在委員會書面准許下出售的；及 
            (b)(i) 獲出售該土地的人看來是將該土地按揭或以其他方式押記，而該人並沒有獲得委員會書面准許將該土地如此按揭或押記；或 
            (ii) (略去) 
            則該項看來是如此作出的按揭或其他押記，連同任何關於如此按揭或以其他方式押記的協議，均屬無效。 
            (3) （略去）」 
     
        討論和考慮 
        7.  上訴聆訊時，代表答辯方的署理高級檢控官雷明雋說明，本案的檢控基礎是：相關協議包含將土地押記的協議，因此是一項關乎土地的協議。 
        8.  馬大律師表示這也是上訴方在原審和上訴時的理解。 
        9.  基於上述情況，本席的考慮，因此首先集中於相關協議是否一項將土地押記的協議。 
        10.  馬大律師基於以下理據，力陳相關協議並非一項將土地押記的協議： 
        （一） 協議第8.01段所指的失責事項並非與本案的貸款協議有關，而是與葉女士和第一按揭銀行之間的按揭有關； 
        （二） 第8.01段只賦予上訴人酌情權去贖回其他產權負擔或將該項負擔轉到上訴人名下，如果上訴人選擇不行使這酌情權，條文也便沒有實質效力。馬大律師指出：只有下列三個條件全被滿足，相關協議才有可能被視作導致一項衡平法按揭[10] 的產生： 
         
            (i) 發生了與第一按揭有關的失責事件；  
            (ii) 上訴人選擇贖回其他產權負擔或將該產權負擔轉至上訴人名下，並結清產權負擔人享有的抵押；和 
            (iii)  有關業權契據被送到上訴人手上。 
            在這些條件未被滿足之前，將土地押記的情況並未存在。 
            （三） 裁判官錯誤裁定協議雙方有對該物業作出押記的意圖，尤其是： 
            (i) 上訴人並沒有一個當下的權利[11]，只有一個將來的權利[12]； 
            (ii) 協議第8.01段並沒有將相關物業分隔開用以償還該貸款協議的債項； 
            (iii) 裁判官推論從事借貸業務的上訴人不會在沒有任何抵押的情況下向葉女士借出550,000元的款項，犯了錯誤，亦有違證據。 
         
        11.  就上述各事項，本席有以下觀察。 
        第一點 
        12.  雖然協議第8.01段在「Settlement of Other Incumbrances」這標題之下，本席不同意這段所指的失責事項與本案的貸款無關。第8.01段這樣描述會引發相關權力的情況、或上訴方所述的失責事項： 
         
            “If any Event of Default shall have occurred or[13] in the event of any proceedings or steps being taken to exercise or enforce any powers or remedies conferred by any incumbrance over the Property, the Lender may[14] redeem such incumbrance or procure the transfer of it to himself and may settle and pass the accounts of any incumbrancer entitled to such security and any accounts so settled or passed shall be conclusive and binding as well between the Lender and the Borrower as between such incumbrancer and the Borrower. In such event, the title deeds and documents of the Property kept by any such incumbrancer shall be delivered to the Lender. The Borrower shall take all such steps and actions as shall be necessary to effect such redemption and delivery of title deeds as aforesaid.” 
         
        13.  本席認為, “If any Event of Default shall have occurred” 必定是指對本案的任何失責情況。 
        14.  就涉案協議的違約情況包括什麼，在協議第7 段‘Events of Default’ 下有所列明，包括貸款人不還款或被申請破產[15]，這些情況都和第一按揭無關，而直接和本案協議有關。馬大律師陳詞說協議第7段也包括一些與針對第一按揭的失責情況，例如第7(b) 和 (k) 段。即使協議第7段可能包括一些針對第一按揭的失責情況，這並不表示協議第8.01段並沒有涵蓋針對本案協議的失責情況。 
        15.  本席認為，引發相關權力可以行使的情況、或失責事項，有二： 
         
            (1) 關乎本協議的任何失責情況；和 
            (2) 因執行第一按揭或行使該按揭賦予的權力而作出的行動或訴訟，這便是協議第8.01段[16] ‘or’[17] 那個字之後所述的情況。 
         
        協議用上‘or’這字眼，明顯立意表明兩種情況任何一種出現，便可引發相關權力。因此，本席裁定，協議第8.01段的作用不限於與第一按揭有關的失責情況，也涵蓋本協議的失責情況。 
        第二點 
        16.  第8.01段只賦予上訴人酌情權，顧及協議中用上‘may’[18] 這個字眼，本席是認同的。不過，這是不少協議中的情況，貸款者想在如何應付違約或失責的情況時給自己留有空間，是普遍的。 
        17.  馬大律師也接受，他所稱的酌情權，和一般合約權利，起碼以本案而言，不存在實質分別。 
        18.  馬大律師的陳詞重點是：上訴人一天未行使這權力，以致業權契據在它手上，按揭情況並未出現，押記也一樣。 
        19.  馬大律師援引Wise Wave Investments Ltd. v TKF Services Ltd.[19]一案，支持他的論點：一份文書如果只是產生一個在將來要給予一個押記的責任的話,該文書是不會產生一個衡平法押記[20] 的。 
        20.  Wise Wave Investments一案源自一宗樓宇買賣。賣方欠下大筆管理費因而引起買方顧慮，要求賣方付清所欠管理費或提供足夠的保證才完成交易。賣方不允，並在交易時間過後將買賣合約視為終結，更沒收了訂金。買方要求法庭頒布强制履行令 [21]，完成交易。 
        21.  該案其一議題是：在這樣欠交管理費的情況下，大廈公契的以下條文是否已將物業押記了： 
         
            “It is hereby declared that: 
            (a) Any sums or part thereof payable by any Owner under this Deed as shall be unpaid for 30 days next after the due date for payment of the same shall be a charge upon the share and interest of the defaulting Owner of and in the Property.” 
 
        22.  本席認為，該案與本案的背景、性質、事實情節和議題都難以相提並論，對支持馬大律師的論點的作用有限。 
        23.  一來，該案的裁決，相當程度是受《物業轉易及財產條例》[22] 第5(1)(a)條的押記必須以文書來設立和文書須簽署這兩項規定所影響，而本案不涉這方面的考慮。 
        24.  二來，每項合約條款的作用，涉及條文的詮譯和尋求立約意圖，這都是要顧及每宗案件的獨特情況的。 
        25.  三來，本案關乎《房屋條例》第27A條，該案則不涉《房屋條例》。 
        26.  馬大律師也陳詞說：相關協議只是一項貸款協議，即使有第8.01段的條款，協議是貸款協議這本質並沒有改變。 
        27.  本席不同意這論點，以《房屋條例》第27A條的情況來說，只要有關乎土地的協議，即使這只是一個協議中的條款之一，如果根據第17B條是無效的話，便屬於第27A條的涵蓋範圍。 
        28.  根據協議第8.01段，將第一按揭的貸款清還，贖回業權契據並將契據交付上訴人保存，效用令上訴人的地位和保障等同第一按揭的貸款人，這是一個將土地押記的情況。 
        29.  就這一點，馬大律師並無異議。他强調的是：未出現失責、或上訴人不行使權利、又或契據未交付上訴人，這未構成押記。 
        30.  代表答辯方的署理高級檢控官雷明雋，援引Pine Enterprises Ltd v Cyber Strategy Ltd & Another[23] 一案，陳詞說本案協議已設定了土地押記。 
        31.  在該案，高等法院原訟法庭暫委法官（當時官階）杜溎峰有以下見解： 
         
            “151. Whether a document has the effect of creating a charge is essentially a matter of construction of the relevant terms of the document. The question is one of intention of the parties. As explained by Atkin LJ in National Provincial and Union Bank of England v. Charnley [1924] KB 431 at 449: - 
            “The first question that arises is whether or not this document does create a mortgage or charge, and to determine that it is necessary to form an idea of what is meant by a ‘charge’. It is not necessary to give a formal definition of a charge, but I think there can be no doubt that where in a transaction for value both parties evince an intention that property, existing or future, shall be made available as security for the payment of a debt, and that the creditor shall have a present right to have it made available, there is a charge, even though the present legal right which is contemplated can only be enforced at some future date, and though the creditor gets no legal right of property, either absolute or special, or any legal right to possession, but only gets a right to have the security made available by an order of the Court. If those conditions exist I think there is a charge. If, on the other hand, the parties do not intend that there should be a present right to have the security made available, but only that there should be a right in the future by agreement, such as a licence, to seize the goods, there will be no charge.” (Emphasis added.) 
        To similar effect was the approach set out by Buckley LJ in Swiss Bank Corporation And Lloyds Bank Ltd and Others [1982] AC 584 at 595: - 
            “... whether a particular transaction gives rise to an equitable charge of this nature must depend upon the intention of the parties ascertained from what they have done in the then existing circumstances. The intention may be expressed or it may be inferred. If the debtor undertakes to segregate a particular fund or asset and to pay the debt out of that fund or asset, the inference may be drawn, in the absence of any contra indication, that the parties’ intention is that the creditor should have such a proprietary interest in the segregated fund or asset as will enable him to realise out of it the amount owed to him by the debtor: compare In re Nanwa Gold Mines Ltd [1955] 1 WLR 1080 and contrast Moseley v Cressey’s Co (1865) LR 1 Eq 405 where there was no obligation to segregate the deposits. But notwithstanding that the matter depends upon the intention of the parties, if upon the true construction of the relevant documents in the light of any admissible evidence as to the surrounding circumstances the parties have entered into ... an equitable charge ... the fact that they may not have realised this consequence will not mean that there is no charge. They must be presumed to intend the consequences of their acts.” (Emphasis added) 
          152.  Counsel have no dispute about the above principles.  Their dispute is whether the parties intended to create a charge over Lecture Kit’s 510,002 shares in UR Limited.  However, Mr Li draws attention to the underlined part of Buckley LJ’s dicta and submits that the inference that a charge has been created will be drawn if three conditions are satisfied, namely: (a) the debtor undertakes to segregate a particular asset; (b) the debtor undertakes to pay the debt out of that segregated asset; and (c) there is no contra indication of the creation of the charge.  I would not go that far as to say that Buckley LJ was laying down criteria which must be fulfilled in order to create a charge.  His Lordship was only giving an example, and a very strong one, of when the intention to create a charge would be inferred.  Obviously, segregation of asset is a very strong indication of such intention.  Whether the debtor has undertaken to pay the debt out of the segregated asset is another piece of evidence on which the intention of creating a charge over the segregated asset could be inferred.  But I do not think anything short of that would preclude the intention from being inferred.  Whether there is contra indication is also one of the factors to be considered in ascertaining the intention.  The real test is whether reading the Lecture Kit Shareholders’ Agreement as a whole and in the light of the admissible surrounding circumstances the Court is satisfied that it is the intention of both parties that by virtue of clause 5.2 Lecture Kit has given the right to Pine over its 510,002 shares in UR Limited held by the Custodian for the purpose of securing Lecture Kit’s and Cyber Strategy’s payment obligation.” 
         
        32.  馬大律師沒有質疑Atkin LJ 在National Provincial and Union Bank of England一案中的觀點，他其實也援引了此案支持他的論述。 
        33.  不過，馬大律師强調，本案協議並未設立了一個現存、或當下的權利[24]，而雷檢控官的陳詞則是權利已經因本案協議存在。 
        34.  本席認為，以本案而言，雙方訂立協議時的意圖[25] 明顯不過，是在本文第15段所述的其一情況出現時，上訴人便有權執行協議第8.01段的權力。 
        35.  不過，假設如馬大律師所述，沒有出現失責情況、或上訴人選擇不行使協議賦予他的權力、又或有關業權契據沒有送達上訴人時，上訴人會已經違反了條例的規定嗎？抑或因為這不算是Atkin LJ 在National Provincial and Union Bank of England 一案所述的現有的權利因而未致將土地押記呢？本席認為，權利是現存的，因為只要出現違約的情況，上訴人便可行使權力，而不用再加商討或協議，葉女士也有合約責任令業權契據交付上訴人，也使上訴人在相關單位上有財產利益。協議第8.01段最後一句這樣說： 
         
            ‘The Borrower shall take all such steps and actions as shall be necessary to effect such redemption and delivery of title deeds as aforesaid.’ 
         
        36.  因上述理由，本席認為相關協議是將土地押記了的。 
        37.  此外，本席也認為，當局訂立第27A條時，看重的是協議雙方的意圖，尤其是條文用上的字眼是「看來是 。。。將土地押記 。。。」。 
        38.  本席認為，條文用上「看來」這字眼，是有用意的。條文的英文版本用字是 ‘purports to create’。‘Purport’ 這詞一般有表達或標榜之意。在Shorter Oxford English Dictionary,這字有意圖去做的事[26] 或做一些事使某一些事情發生[27] 的意思。 
        39.  在詮譯《房屋條例》第27A條時，應顧及相關條例的立法目的。在CHEUK SHU YIN v YIP SO WAN & Another[28] 一案，終審法院常任法官陳兆愷指出：在詮譯《房屋條例》第17B 條和27A條的規定時，必須顧及居者有其屋計劃的背景和環境。陳法官强調房屋委員會售賣居屋，價格是有折讓的，既低於市價，也沒有將土地價值計算在內。上述條例的規定和限制，旨在防止購得居屋的人藉此折讓並利用未被批准的相關行為賺取利潤，未經房屋委員會准許而將單位按契押記，正是要防止的行為。 
        40.  根據《釋義及通則條例》[29] 第19條： 
         
            「條例必須當作有補缺去弊的作用，按其真正用意、涵義及精神，並為了最能確保達致其目的而作出公正、廣泛及靈活的釋疑及釋義。」 
         
        41.  簡而言之，本席認為，相關協議將土地押記了。這協議、或起碼這部份協議，是一項土地協議，而這協議因沒有遵守條例第17B條的規定而無效。 
        第三點 
        42.  這點關乎裁判官就雙方立約意圖的裁斷。 
        43.  馬大律師對裁判官作出的批評，可見於本文第10 （三）段。 
        44.  以第 (i) 點來說，因為剛才所述的理由,本席認為上訴人已經有了一個現存或當下的權利，並非只有一個將來的權利，因為只要出現協議所述的失責的情況，上訴人便有權立即行使權利。 
        45.  第 (ii) 點，將物業分隔，是押記的明顯指標，但正如杜法官在Pine Enterprises Limited一案的觀察，沒有將物業分隔，並不一定便否定押記的存在，一切視乎整體情況。 
        46.  第 (iii) 點，本席同意，裁判官過份看重這情況，而且也忽略了葉女士是提供了一名擔保人的。 
        47.  裁判上訴以重審方式進行[30]，本席有權根據已在裁判官席前的證據作出裁斷。 
        48.  要裁定雙方必有設定押記（在指定情況出現時）的意圖，這必須是整體證據支持的唯一合理推論。 
        49.  馬大律師力陳，協議涉及相關物業，這只是提供給上訴人去考慮是否貸款的一項資料而已。本席對此難以苟同。 
        50.  毫無疑問，協議中有8.01段和8.02段[31] 的條款，必然是為了在葉女士沒有償還對上訴人的債項[32]、她面臨破產[33]、或她的擔保人沒能力負上責任[34] 等等情況出現時,上訴人可以行使權利將涉案單位從第一按揭銀行贖回，將業權契據收歸己有，儼然成為第一按揭持有人。意圖若非如此，根本不會將這條款納入協議之中。 
        51.  雖然，協議雙方都沒有出庭作證，本席裁定，將土地押記，必然是立約雙方的意圖，這是整體證據支持的唯一合理推論。 
        總結 
        52.  本席裁定，雙方的意圖是將土地押記，這是一項關乎土地的協議。因為該押記沒有得到房委會書面准許，所以屬無效。即使這項協議只是整個「貸款協議」[35] 的一部份，而且即使相關部份因條例第17B條而致無效，協議其餘部份仍然是有效的 [36]，本席同意裁判官的看法，如果協議中設立押記的條款，根據條例第17B是無效的話，上訴人便違反了條例第27A條。 
        53.  基於上述理由，本席駁回上訴，維持定罪原判。

        判案書
		  
    1.  上訴人是一間財務公司，它被控以貸款人身分訂立了根據《房屋條例》[1] 第17B條是無效的一項關乎土地的協議罪[2]。它不承認控罪，於東區裁判法院審訊後，特委裁判官（下稱裁判官）裁定上訴人罪名成立。上訴人不服定罪，提出上訴。 
        案情 
        2.  本案的基本案情並無爭議，全部藉《刑事訴訟程序條例》[3] 第65C條呈堂為證據，要點如下： 
         
            (1) 涉案物業是一個居者有其屋（下稱居屋）單位； 
            (2) 房屋委員會（下稱房委會）獲授權就該單位提名購買人； 
            (3) 該地段所建的單位的出售和讓與，均受《房屋條例》列明的條款、契據和條件所規限[4]； 
            (4) 1994年6月29日，一名鄭女士和一名胡先生購入涉案物業； 
            (5) 2008年8月21日，一名葉女士被房委會提名購買該物業；[5] 
            (6) 根據一份2008年9月30日的轉讓契據,鄭女士和胡先生以1,120,000元的價錢將該物業轉讓予葉女士; 
            (7) 2013年7月26日，上訴人與葉女士訂立了一項貸款協議[6],上訴人批出一筆550,000元的貸款給葉女士。 
            (8) 該貸款協議有以下條款： 
            “If any Event of Default shall have occurred or in the event of any proceedings or steps being taken to exercise or enforce any powers or remedies conferred by any incumbrance over the Property, the Lender may redeem such incumbrance or procure the transfer of it to himself and may settle and pass the accounts of any incumbrancer entitled to such security and any accounts so settled or passed shall be conclusive and binding as well between the Lender and Borrower as between such incumbrancer and the Borrower. In such event, the title deeds and documents of the Property kept by any such incumbrancer shall be delivered to the Lender. The Borrower shall take all such steps and action as shall be necessary to effect such redemption and delivery of title deeds as aforesaid.”[7] 
            (9) 在訂立該貸款協議前，房委會並沒有收到該物業的補價評估申請；此外，截止2014年10月10 日為止，房委會沒有收到該物業根據《房屋條例》附表所提及的補價。 
            (10) 該貸款協議的條款並沒有預先獲得房委會或房屋署署長的書面批准。 
    
        裁判官的裁斷 
        3.  裁判官作出了以下的裁斷： 
         
            (1) 上訴人與葉女士就相關物業有一項關乎土地的押記協議。 
            (2) 無論如何，涉案貸款協議和協議內提及的押記均與涉案物業有關，他肯定押記協議是一項關乎土地的協議，亦符合《房屋條例》第27A(a) 條的要求。 
            (3) 協議中的押記部份是無效的，因為葉女士沒有獲得房委會的書面准許將涉案單位如此押記。 
            (4) 即使貸款協議並非完全無效，只要押記部份違反了條例第17B(2)條的規定，基於押記部份無效，第27A條的罪行便已被干犯。 
         
        4.  據此裁判官裁定上訴人罪名成立。 
        上訴理據 
        5.  在上訴時，上訴人由馬維騉大律師代表[8]，他提出以下上訴理據： 
         
            裁判官錯誤裁定相關協議為一項關乎土地協議，而相關協議對葉女士所持的物業構成一項押記，因而根據條例第17B條是無效的。 
         
        條例的相關條文 
        6.  本案主要關乎《房屋條例》中的以下兩項條文： 
        「第27A條 
         
            (1) 凡─ 
            (a) 任何人看來是就土地設定按揭或以其他方式將土地押記，或將土地轉讓或以其他方式讓與，或訂立一項關乎土地的協議，而不論該人是以貸款人或借款人身分或是以其他身分行事；及 
            (b) 該項看來是如此作出的按揭、其他押記、或該項看來是如此作出的轉讓、其他讓與、或該項看來是如此作出的協議，根據第17B條是無效的， 
            該人即屬犯罪，可處罰款$500,000及監禁1年。 
            第17B條 
            (1) (略去) 
            (2) 凡─ 
            (a) 第(1)(a)(ii)款描述的土地[9] 是在委員會書面准許下出售的；及 
            (b)(i) 獲出售該土地的人看來是將該土地按揭或以其他方式押記，而該人並沒有獲得委員會書面准許將該土地如此按揭或押記；或 
            (ii) (略去) 
            則該項看來是如此作出的按揭或其他押記，連同任何關於如此按揭或以其他方式押記的協議，均屬無效。 
            (3) （略去）」 
     
        討論和考慮 
        7.  上訴聆訊時，代表答辯方的署理高級檢控官雷明雋說明，本案的檢控基礎是：相關協議包含將土地押記的協議，因此是一項關乎土地的協議。 
        8.  馬大律師表示這也是上訴方在原審和上訴時的理解。 
        9.  基於上述情況，本席的考慮，因此首先集中於相關協議是否一項將土地押記的協議。 
        10.  馬大律師基於以下理據，力陳相關協議並非一項將土地押記的協議： 
        （一） 協議第8.01段所指的失責事項並非與本案的貸款協議有關，而是與葉女士和第一按揭銀行之間的按揭有關； 
        （二） 第8.01段只賦予上訴人酌情權去贖回其他產權負擔或將該項負擔轉到上訴人名下，如果上訴人選擇不行使這酌情權，條文也便沒有實質效力。馬大律師指出：只有下列三個條件全被滿足，相關協議才有可能被視作導致一項衡平法按揭[10] 的產生： 
         
            (i) 發生了與第一按揭有關的失責事件；  
            (ii) 上訴人選擇贖回其他產權負擔或將該產權負擔轉至上訴人名下，並結清產權負擔人享有的抵押；和 
            (iii)  有關業權契據被送到上訴人手上。 
            在這些條件未被滿足之前，將土地押記的情況並未存在。 
            （三） 裁判官錯誤裁定協議雙方有對該物業作出押記的意圖，尤其是： 
            (i) 上訴人並沒有一個當下的權利[11]，只有一個將來的權利[12]； 
            (ii) 協議第8.01段並沒有將相關物業分隔開用以償還該貸款協議的債項； 
            (iii) 裁判官推論從事借貸業務的上訴人不會在沒有任何抵押的情況下向葉女士借出550,000元的款項，犯了錯誤，亦有違證據。 
         
        11.  就上述各事項，本席有以下觀察。 
        第一點 
        12.  雖然協議第8.01段在「Settlement of Other Incumbrances」這標題之下，本席不同意這段所指的失責事項與本案的貸款無關。第8.01段這樣描述會引發相關權力的情況、或上訴方所述的失責事項： 
         
            “If any Event of Default shall have occurred or[13] in the event of any proceedings or steps being taken to exercise or enforce any powers or remedies conferred by any incumbrance over the Property, the Lender may[14] redeem such incumbrance or procure the transfer of it to himself and may settle and pass the accounts of any incumbrancer entitled to such security and any accounts so settled or passed shall be conclusive and binding as well between the Lender and the Borrower as between such incumbrancer and the Borrower. In such event, the title deeds and documents of the Property kept by any such incumbrancer shall be delivered to the Lender. The Borrower shall take all such steps and actions as shall be necessary to effect such redemption and delivery of title deeds as aforesaid.” 
         
        13.  本席認為, “If any Event of Default shall have occurred” 必定是指對本案的任何失責情況。 
        14.  就涉案協議的違約情況包括什麼，在協議第7 段‘Events of Default’ 下有所列明，包括貸款人不還款或被申請破產[15]，這些情況都和第一按揭無關，而直接和本案協議有關。馬大律師陳詞說協議第7段也包括一些與針對第一按揭的失責情況，例如第7(b) 和 (k) 段。即使協議第7段可能包括一些針對第一按揭的失責情況，這並不表示協議第8.01段並沒有涵蓋針對本案協議的失責情況。 
        15.  本席認為，引發相關權力可以行使的情況、或失責事項，有二： 
         
            (1) 關乎本協議的任何失責情況；和 
            (2) 因執行第一按揭或行使該按揭賦予的權力而作出的行動或訴訟，這便是協議第8.01段[16] ‘or’[17] 那個字之後所述的情況。 
         
        協議用上‘or’這字眼，明顯立意表明兩種情況任何一種出現，便可引發相關權力。因此，本席裁定，協議第8.01段的作用不限於與第一按揭有關的失責情況，也涵蓋本協議的失責情況。 
        第二點 
        16.  第8.01段只賦予上訴人酌情權，顧及協議中用上‘may’[18] 這個字眼，本席是認同的。不過，這是不少協議中的情況，貸款者想在如何應付違約或失責的情況時給自己留有空間，是普遍的。 
        17.  馬大律師也接受，他所稱的酌情權，和一般合約權利，起碼以本案而言，不存在實質分別。 
        18.  馬大律師的陳詞重點是：上訴人一天未行使這權力，以致業權契據在它手上，按揭情況並未出現，押記也一樣。 
        19.  馬大律師援引Wise Wave Investments Ltd. v TKF Services Ltd.[19]一案，支持他的論點：一份文書如果只是產生一個在將來要給予一個押記的責任的話,該文書是不會產生一個衡平法押記[20] 的。 
        20.  Wise Wave Investments一案源自一宗樓宇買賣。賣方欠下大筆管理費因而引起買方顧慮，要求賣方付清所欠管理費或提供足夠的保證才完成交易。賣方不允，並在交易時間過後將買賣合約視為終結，更沒收了訂金。買方要求法庭頒布强制履行令 [21]，完成交易。 
        21.  該案其一議題是：在這樣欠交管理費的情況下，大廈公契的以下條文是否已將物業押記了： 
         
            “It is hereby declared that: 
            (a) Any sums or part thereof payable by any Owner under this Deed as shall be unpaid for 30 days next after the due date for payment of the same shall be a charge upon the share and interest of the defaulting Owner of and in the Property.” 
 
        22.  本席認為，該案與本案的背景、性質、事實情節和議題都難以相提並論，對支持馬大律師的論點的作用有限。 
        23.  一來，該案的裁決，相當程度是受《物業轉易及財產條例》[22] 第5(1)(a)條的押記必須以文書來設立和文書須簽署這兩項規定所影響，而本案不涉這方面的考慮。 
        24.  二來，每項合約條款的作用，涉及條文的詮譯和尋求立約意圖，這都是要顧及每宗案件的獨特情況的。 
        25.  三來，本案關乎《房屋條例》第27A條，該案則不涉《房屋條例》。 
        26.  馬大律師也陳詞說：相關協議只是一項貸款協議，即使有第8.01段的條款，協議是貸款協議這本質並沒有改變。 
        27.  本席不同意這論點，以《房屋條例》第27A條的情況來說，只要有關乎土地的協議，即使這只是一個協議中的條款之一，如果根據第17B條是無效的話，便屬於第27A條的涵蓋範圍。 
        28.  根據協議第8.01段，將第一按揭的貸款清還，贖回業權契據並將契據交付上訴人保存，效用令上訴人的地位和保障等同第一按揭的貸款人，這是一個將土地押記的情況。 
        29.  就這一點，馬大律師並無異議。他强調的是：未出現失責、或上訴人不行使權利、又或契據未交付上訴人，這未構成押記。 
        30.  代表答辯方的署理高級檢控官雷明雋，援引Pine Enterprises Ltd v Cyber Strategy Ltd & Another[23] 一案，陳詞說本案協議已設定了土地押記。 
        31.  在該案，高等法院原訟法庭暫委法官（當時官階）杜溎峰有以下見解： 
         
            “151. Whether a document has the effect of creating a charge is essentially a matter of construction of the relevant terms of the document. The question is one of intention of the parties. As explained by Atkin LJ in National Provincial and Union Bank of England v. Charnley [1924] KB 431 at 449: - 
            “The first question that arises is whether or not this document does create a mortgage or charge, and to determine that it is necessary to form an idea of what is meant by a ‘charge’. It is not necessary to give a formal definition of a charge, but I think there can be no doubt that where in a transaction for value both parties evince an intention that property, existing or future, shall be made available as security for the payment of a debt, and that the creditor shall have a present right to have it made available, there is a charge, even though the present legal right which is contemplated can only be enforced at some future date, and though the creditor gets no legal right of property, either absolute or special, or any legal right to possession, but only gets a right to have the security made available by an order of the Court. If those conditions exist I think there is a charge. If, on the other hand, the parties do not intend that there should be a present right to have the security made available, but only that there should be a right in the future by agreement, such as a licence, to seize the goods, there will be no charge.” (Emphasis added.) 
        To similar effect was the approach set out by Buckley LJ in Swiss Bank Corporation And Lloyds Bank Ltd and Others [1982] AC 584 at 595: - 
            “... whether a particular transaction gives rise to an equitable charge of this nature must depend upon the intention of the parties ascertained from what they have done in the then existing circumstances. The intention may be expressed or it may be inferred. If the debtor undertakes to segregate a particular fund or asset and to pay the debt out of that fund or asset, the inference may be drawn, in the absence of any contra indication, that the parties’ intention is that the creditor should have such a proprietary interest in the segregated fund or asset as will enable him to realise out of it the amount owed to him by the debtor: compare In re Nanwa Gold Mines Ltd [1955] 1 WLR 1080 and contrast Moseley v Cressey’s Co (1865) LR 1 Eq 405 where there was no obligation to segregate the deposits. But notwithstanding that the matter depends upon the intention of the parties, if upon the true construction of the relevant documents in the light of any admissible evidence as to the surrounding circumstances the parties have entered into ... an equitable charge ... the fact that they may not have realised this consequence will not mean that there is no charge. They must be presumed to intend the consequences of their acts.” (Emphasis added) 
          152.  Counsel have no dispute about the above principles.  Their dispute is whether the parties intended to create a charge over Lecture Kit’s 510,002 shares in UR Limited.  However, Mr Li draws attention to the underlined part of Buckley LJ’s dicta and submits that the inference that a charge has been created will be drawn if three conditions are satisfied, namely: (a) the debtor undertakes to segregate a particular asset; (b) the debtor undertakes to pay the debt out of that segregated asset; and (c) there is no contra indication of the creation of the charge.  I would not go that far as to say that Buckley LJ was laying down criteria which must be fulfilled in order to create a charge.  His Lordship was only giving an example, and a very strong one, of when the intention to create a charge would be inferred.  Obviously, segregation of asset is a very strong indication of such intention.  Whether the debtor has undertaken to pay the debt out of the segregated asset is another piece of evidence on which the intention of creating a charge over the segregated asset could be inferred.  But I do not think anything short of that would preclude the intention from being inferred.  Whether there is contra indication is also one of the factors to be considered in ascertaining the intention.  The real test is whether reading the Lecture Kit Shareholders’ Agreement as a whole and in the light of the admissible surrounding circumstances the Court is satisfied that it is the intention of both parties that by virtue of clause 5.2 Lecture Kit has given the right to Pine over its 510,002 shares in UR Limited held by the Custodian for the purpose of securing Lecture Kit’s and Cyber Strategy’s payment obligation.” 
         
        32.  馬大律師沒有質疑Atkin LJ 在National Provincial and Union Bank of England一案中的觀點，他其實也援引了此案支持他的論述。 
        33.  不過，馬大律師强調，本案協議並未設立了一個現存、或當下的權利[24]，而雷檢控官的陳詞則是權利已經因本案協議存在。 
        34.  本席認為，以本案而言，雙方訂立協議時的意圖[25] 明顯不過，是在本文第15段所述的其一情況出現時，上訴人便有權執行協議第8.01段的權力。 
        35.  不過，假設如馬大律師所述，沒有出現失責情況、或上訴人選擇不行使協議賦予他的權力、又或有關業權契據沒有送達上訴人時，上訴人會已經違反了條例的規定嗎？抑或因為這不算是Atkin LJ 在National Provincial and Union Bank of England 一案所述的現有的權利因而未致將土地押記呢？本席認為，權利是現存的，因為只要出現違約的情況，上訴人便可行使權力，而不用再加商討或協議，葉女士也有合約責任令業權契據交付上訴人，也使上訴人在相關單位上有財產利益。協議第8.01段最後一句這樣說： 
         
            ‘The Borrower shall take all such steps and actions as shall be necessary to effect such redemption and delivery of title deeds as aforesaid.’ 
         
        36.  因上述理由，本席認為相關協議是將土地押記了的。 
        37.  此外，本席也認為，當局訂立第27A條時，看重的是協議雙方的意圖，尤其是條文用上的字眼是「看來是 。。。將土地押記 。。。」。 
        38.  本席認為，條文用上「看來」這字眼，是有用意的。條文的英文版本用字是 ‘purports to create’。‘Purport’ 這詞一般有表達或標榜之意。在Shorter Oxford English Dictionary,這字有意圖去做的事[26] 或做一些事使某一些事情發生[27] 的意思。 
        39.  在詮譯《房屋條例》第27A條時，應顧及相關條例的立法目的。在CHEUK SHU YIN v YIP SO WAN & Another[28] 一案，終審法院常任法官陳兆愷指出：在詮譯《房屋條例》第17B 條和27A條的規定時，必須顧及居者有其屋計劃的背景和環境。陳法官强調房屋委員會售賣居屋，價格是有折讓的，既低於市價，也沒有將土地價值計算在內。上述條例的規定和限制，旨在防止購得居屋的人藉此折讓並利用未被批准的相關行為賺取利潤，未經房屋委員會准許而將單位按契押記，正是要防止的行為。 
        40.  根據《釋義及通則條例》[29] 第19條： 
         
            「條例必須當作有補缺去弊的作用，按其真正用意、涵義及精神，並為了最能確保達致其目的而作出公正、廣泛及靈活的釋疑及釋義。」 
         
        41.  簡而言之，本席認為，相關協議將土地押記了。這協議、或起碼這部份協議，是一項土地協議，而這協議因沒有遵守條例第17B條的規定而無效。 
        第三點 
        42.  這點關乎裁判官就雙方立約意圖的裁斷。 
        43.  馬大律師對裁判官作出的批評，可見於本文第10 （三）段。 
        44.  以第 (i) 點來說，因為剛才所述的理由,本席認為上訴人已經有了一個現存或當下的權利，並非只有一個將來的權利，因為只要出現協議所述的失責的情況，上訴人便有權立即行使權利。 
        45.  第 (ii) 點，將物業分隔，是押記的明顯指標，但正如杜法官在Pine Enterprises Limited一案的觀察，沒有將物業分隔，並不一定便否定押記的存在，一切視乎整體情況。 
        46.  第 (iii) 點，本席同意，裁判官過份看重這情況，而且也忽略了葉女士是提供了一名擔保人的。 
        47.  裁判上訴以重審方式進行[30]，本席有權根據已在裁判官席前的證據作出裁斷。 
        48.  要裁定雙方必有設定押記（在指定情況出現時）的意圖，這必須是整體證據支持的唯一合理推論。 
        49.  馬大律師力陳，協議涉及相關物業，這只是提供給上訴人去考慮是否貸款的一項資料而已。本席對此難以苟同。 
        50.  毫無疑問，協議中有8.01段和8.02段[31] 的條款，必然是為了在葉女士沒有償還對上訴人的債項[32]、她面臨破產[33]、或她的擔保人沒能力負上責任[34] 等等情況出現時,上訴人可以行使權利將涉案單位從第一按揭銀行贖回，將業權契據收歸己有，儼然成為第一按揭持有人。意圖若非如此，根本不會將這條款納入協議之中。 
        51.  雖然，協議雙方都沒有出庭作證，本席裁定，將土地押記，必然是立約雙方的意圖，這是整體證據支持的唯一合理推論。 
        總結 
        52.  本席裁定，雙方的意圖是將土地押記，這是一項關乎土地的協議。因為該押記沒有得到房委會書面准許，所以屬無效。即使這項協議只是整個「貸款協議」[35] 的一部份，而且即使相關部份因條例第17B條而致無效，協議其餘部份仍然是有效的 [36]，本席同意裁判官的看法，如果協議中設立押記的條款，根據條例第17B是無效的話，上訴人便違反了條例第27A條。 
        53.  基於上述理由，本席駁回上訴，維持定罪原判。

 Choo Han Teck J:
1       Shi Ka Yee (“Shi”) lives in a large house on 12 Astrid Hills. She has been living there since 1979. On her land is an old rain tree that has been there even longer than she. Shi says that the tree is at least 80 years old. Nasrat Lucas Muzayyin (“Nasrat”) and his wife Priscillia Goh (together the “Muzayyins”) live next door on 13 Astrid Hills. Some branches from Shi’s rain tree overhang into the Muzayyins’ land. In October 2014, the Muzayyins asked the National Parks for permission to prune those overhang branches because they feared that the branches might fall off and cause injury. The National Parks told the Muzayyins that they could if they sought Shi’s permission.
2       Differing accounts of the discussions between the Muzayyins and Shi between October 2014 and February 2015 were given in evidence. But the undisputed fact was that on 17 February 2015 the Muzayyins had an arborist trim the overhanging branches from Shi’s rain tree. An enraged Shi drove to the Muzayyins’ house, perhaps en route elsewhere – we do not know; the house, large as it is, is only next door. What happened thereafter was not pleasant. Shi went onto the Muzayyins’ property and berated the Muzayyin family. She left when Nasrat told her to leave, but returned shortly. This time she walked up to the arborist’s lorry known as a “cherry-picker” because of its tall crane on which his worker was pruning the branches of the tree. Shi removed the key from the cherry-picker, causing the engine and electrical circuit to stall. The workman was thus stranded up on the rain tree for about an hour.
3       When Shi wanted to drive off in her Porsche, Nasrat stood in front of her car to stop her from leaving because he wanted her to return the key to the arborist’s truck. Shi, instead, revved the engine of her car and “edged her car towards [him]”. She then drove off with the key (which had not been returned even at trial). The police and the Civil Defence Force arrived and helped the stranded worker down.
4       The Muzayyins sued Shi for the nuisance of her ever-growing rain tree, and for Shi’s trespass onto their land. Nasrat also sued for assault for Shi’s putting him in fear of injury. Nuisance, trespass and assault are causes of action in the law of torts. They are not complicated or difficult laws and magistrate Chiah Kok Khun (“the magistrate”) found Shi liable on all the grounds. Mr Christopher De Souza, counsel for the Muzayyins asked for aggravated damages. The magistrate accepted his submission and awarded $4,300 for the nuisance caused by the overhanging branches, which, because of the incomplete pruning, dripped sap onto the Muzayyins’ driveway. Shi’s own arborist reported to her in January 2016 that the branches may be in danger of falling off. The magistrate ordered $4,000 as aggravated damages for Shi’s trespass on her neighbour’s land. He also ordered $1,500 for Shi’s assault on Nasrat.
5       Shi’s solicitors instructed Mr Francis Xavier SC to apply before me for leave to appeal against the whole of the magistrate’s decision. Mr Xavier argued that the court below was wrong in both fact and law. The thrust of Mr Xavier’s argument was that the rain tree had a girth of more than a metre and was a tree that was protected under s 14(1) of the Parks and Trees Act (Cap 216, 2006 ed). He submitted that Shi herself cannot cut the tree and therefore cannot be blamed for refusing consent. In response, Mr De Souza referred to s 14(6) which allows a protected tree to be cut “where the condition of the tree constitutes an immediate threat to life or property”. He argued that there was ample evidence from both sides that showed that the protruding branches were in danger of breaking off.
6       Complaints about overhanging branches are almost as old as there are neighbours. This is not a new situation, and the common law has dealt with it sensibly by allowing the tree owner’s neighbour to cut branches that protrude over his land; but he may not keep any fruit found on those branches (see 
Lemmon v Webb
 (1895) AC 1 and 
Mills v Brooker
 (1919) 1 KB 555). Section 14(1) of the Parks and Trees Act is to preserve grand old trees in a “tree conservation area” or in “any vacant land”. Evidence that Shi’s property is in a “tree conservation area” must be proved by evidence from the National Parks but Shi did not call the Board for such evidence. Copies of old maps and diagrams are not sufficient unless verified by an officer from the National Parks. It is also not clear whether Shi is claiming that her property is “vacant land” although she seems to have claimed that her property was unoccupied. “Vacant land” and “not occupied” may not mean the same thing. Since the question of whether Shi’s property was in a conservation area or was a vacant land was not an issue between the parties in this application and in the trial below, I will assume that this is not an issue in spite of the fact that it was not properly proved and will assume that s 14(1) applies. Mr Xavier’s argument that followed was this: Since the tree was a protected tree, Shi could not cut it herself and the Muzayyins could not do so either. It must be said at once that this was not a case in which it was suggested that either party intended to have the tree cut down.
7       The only issue was whether the Muzayyins could cut the overhanging branches when Shi had refused her consent. The trial judge found as a fact that some of the overhanging branches were “a hazard that [were] likely to cause and ha[d] caused damage”. Mr De Souza submitted that that being the case, s 14(6) permitted his clients to cut the protruding branches. Mr Xavier complained that the trial judge made no reference to s 14(6) and the Muzayyins cannot therefore rely on that provision. I do not think that this is a justifiable complaint. Section 14(6) provides an exception to the prohibition under s 14(1) in that if the tree or its branches poses a hazard and threatens life or property it may be cut. The judgment is not wrong just because the judge did not mention s 14(6). The crucial finding is whether the protruding branches were a hazard, and this he did find.
8       The Parks and Trees Act, like all statutes, must be interpreted sensibly. The relevant provisions are intended to prevent a protected tree on private land within ‘a tree conservation area’ from being cut. Cutting is defined to include ‘lobbing’ and that means cutting of some branches rather than the entire tree. It is common knowledge that trees need trimming, and s 14(1) cannot be understood to make every trimming of the tree an offence. It will be remarkable to hold that s 14 will not allow careful and sensible trimming. Many might have welcomed the extended canopy of a grand and lovely tree such as the 80-year old one on 12 Astrid Hills, but the Muzayyins are entitled to have the old limbs cut if those branches protrude over their land and become a threat to their life or property.
9       In arguing that Shi was justified in entering her neighbours’ land to complain about the tree cutting, Mr Xavier must not forget that the initial entry might have been reasonable, but the evidence found by the trial judge was that she left after being asked to leave, but she quickly returned and “took away the key from the cherry-picker”. Her entry into the Muzayyins’ property after she knew that she was not welcome constitutes a trespass. Whether her removal of the key and her vocal haranguing were sufficient to justify an award of aggravated damages is a little more difficult to justify. However, given that the amount was not large, the trial judge should be given some discretion in finding that Shi’s conduct justified the aggravated damages of $4,000.
10     Mr Xavier argued that the finding of assault was wrong because Nasrat stood in front of Shi’s car. We do not know whether Shi could have reversed and avoided Nasrat. That is a matter of fact; and the trial judge found as a fact that Shi revved her car and edged towards Nasrat. His conclusion that it caused Nasrat an apprehension of injury is not unreasonable.
11     Finally, this dispute should not have involved so many lawyers and so much time in court. Trees from one property may stretch over to another, just as trees from the Muzayyins’ home might stretch their limbs elsewhere. Boundaries have no meaning to trees which obey only the law of nature. Boundaries establish to owners of property rights in law, but more often than not, mutual acts of neighbourliness obviate the need for law. Neither side ought to think of this as a victory or defeat. Victories and defeats are found in the language of war. There is no one who wins when neighbours go to war. There is therefore no merit in letting this case incur any more court time when cases with greater social issues are waiting in line. I therefore refuse leave to Shi to appeal.
12     I will hear parties on the question of costs here and below on another date if they are unable to settle it themselves.",2016-07-20 00:00:00,SG High Court

 See Kee Oon JC:
1       This is an appeal against sentences imposed by the District Court in respect of six charges under s 323 read with s 73(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). The appellant had pleaded guilty to these charges and consented to have a further 12 charges involving various related offences taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. Nine of these 12 charges were also in respect of offences under s 323 read with s 73(2) of the Penal Code, with the remaining three charges falling under s 352, s 506 and s 509 read with s 73(2) of the Penal Code respectively.
2       The offences in question all involved the abuse of a foreign domestic worker, Ms Tin War War Khing (“the victim”), who worked in the appellant’s household and was employed by the appellant’s mother. They were committed over a duration of about 3 months, from December 2011 to February 2012. On appeal, the appellant sought to persuade the court to set aside the custodial sentences in favour of Community-Based Sentences (‘CBS”), such as a Mandatory Treatment Order (“MTO”), a Short Detention Order and/or a Day Reporting Order or any suitable combination of CBS.
Background facts
3       On 3 June 2013, the appellant pleaded guilty in a District Court to the abovementioned six charges. After several adjournments, the District Judge first called for a pre-sentence report to determine her suitability for probation or to comply with a MTO. The probation report (P5) contained a reference to the appellant suffering from major depressive disorder, having regard to a medical report dated 2 April 2013 prepared by Dr Johnson Fam (“Dr Fam”). In the MTO report dated 25 September 2013 (P6), the IMH psychiatrist Dr Leong Oil Ken (“Dr Leong”) noted that she was previously diagnosed (by Dr Fam) to be suffering from major depressive disorder but stated that “there was 
no direct contributing relationship
 between her depression and her offences” [emphasis added]. He further observed that the appellant was “under fairly significant caregiver stress” and that could have had “some indirect effect on her level of frustration tolerance”. He stated that he was inclined to recommend a MTO as “one of her sentencing options”.
4       In a supplementary report dated 21 October 2013 (P7), Dr Leong stated that the major depressive disorder which was diagnosed in April 2012 by Dr Fam “
can be considered
 a contributing factor which 
could
 cause [the appellant] to commit the offences” [emphasis added]. As the District Judge evidently took the view that the opinions expressed by Dr Leong in his two reports (P6 and P7) were inconclusive, he decided to convene a post-conviction (Newton) hearing upon the prosecution’s application to question Dr Leong.
5       The Newton hearing did not commence until 3 January 2014 and the subsequent hearing dates were intermittently distributed over the course of the next ten months or so up to 14 October 2014. All in all, 3½ days were spent hearing evidence as to whether the appellant did suffer from major depressive disorder which could be said to be “a psychiatric condition which is susceptible to treatment” and “one of the “contributing factors for [her] committing the offence(s)”, having regard to the language of s 339(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”). After various other adjournments to obtain clarifications and for other reasons, the District Judge ultimately found on 29 April 2015 that she did not suffer from major depressive disorder. The appellant was eventually sentenced to two months’ imprisonment for all the charges except for one (DAC 46283/2012 – which involved pouring hot water onto the victim’s back), for which she received a sentence of five months’ imprisonment. The District Judge’s grounds of decision (“the GD”) is reported at 
Public Prosecutor v Low Gek Hong
 
[2015] SGDC 192
.
6       The District Judge ordered three of the sentences to run consecutively, resulting in an aggregate sentence of nine months’ imprisonment. He reasoned that the offences were serious and both specific and general deterrence required custodial sentences of substantial length to be imposed. Specifically, he pointed to various aggravating factors including the serious injuries, the sustained duration of the abuse, the number of incidents as well as the egregious nature of many of the instances of hurt caused.
7       As revealed in the Statement of Facts which the appellant had admitted to without qualification, the victim was made to suffer prolonged and extensive abuse over the duration of three months or so beginning from December 2011. The District Judge summarised these instances of abuse at [65] of the GD, where he noted that the appellant “started to abuse the victim approximately three months into the victim’s employment. The [appellant] used a pair of scissors, a mug filled with hot water, a metal hanger, sandals and a cup to assault the victim. Further, the [appellant] scratched the victim’s face, arms, ears and also bit her on her arms and hands. This abuse went on for 3 months.”
8       The context of the appellant’s offending conduct however would also merit some elaboration. It was not disputed that the appellant had taken on the role of caregiver to her bedridden father along with her mother, after he had become dependent on a life-support machine in 2009. The victim was engaged as a domestic helper only in September 2011 to assist in household chores and also to take care of the appellant’s father.
My decision
The Newton hearing and s 339(9) of the CPC
9       It is unfortunate that this case has taken considerable time to reach a conclusion after the appellant pleaded guilty in June 2013. The conduct of the Newton hearing and the numerous adjournments were major contributors to the length of time it took for the District Judge to resolve the issue of whether the appellant did suffer from major depressive disorder and if so, whether it was causally linked to her commission of the offences.
10     I note that it was the prosecution that made the application to question Dr Leong on 11 December 2013, leading to the District Judge’s decision to convene a Newton hearing. In their reply submissions tendered for this appeal, the prosecution now submits that the Newton hearing ought not to have been convened at all as s 339(9) of the CPC makes it clear that the opinion of the psychiatrist shall be “final and conclusive”. They contend that the District Judge thus had no power to seek clarifications, much less to order a Newton hearing to determine any “disputed” point(s) arising from Dr Leong’s report of 25 September 2013 (“the 1st report”). The prosecution recognises the potential absurdity of their approach
[note: 1]
 but maintains that a strictly literal reading should be adopted, no matter how “disconcerting” this position might seem
[note: 2]
. With great respect, I am unable to see merit in the prosecution’s submission. It appears to be premised on an unnecessarily restrictive reading of s 339(9) of the CPC.
11     To my mind, if an obvious clerical or administrative error results in the wrong report (
eg
, one which contains wholly erroneous contents) being tendered to the court, surely that “opinion” cannot be accepted as being “final and conclusive” such that the court is precluded from seeking any clarification whatsoever. Alternatively, if the report erroneously draws conclusions that are obviously at odds or internally inconsistent with the remainder of the report, it surely cannot be that the court is expected to unquestioningly adopt such conclusions on account of the report being “final and conclusive”. I do not see why there must be a blanket prohibition on any form of enquiry or clarification if the report is unclear and particularly where it draws manifestly wrong, illogical or absurd conclusions.
12     Having made these observations, I should add that a Newton hearing should generally be a measure of last resort. In this regard, I am of the view that the District Judge had incorrectly exercised his discretion to convene a Newton hearing. The 1st report plainly did 
not
 conclude that the appellant 
was
 suffering from major depressive disorder at the material time. Dr Leong conceded that he made no such independent finding but was relying on Dr Fam’s diagnosis from April 2012. More importantly, Dr Leong opined from the outset that there was “
no
 direct contributing relationship” between her disorder and the commission of the offences.
13     I note that in his supplementary report dated 21 October 2013 (“the 2nd report”), Dr Leong again chose not to make definitive observations that the appellant’s major depressive disorder 
was
 a contributing factor for her commission of the offences. He postulated that it “
can be considered
” a contributing factor but went on to say in non-committal and tenuous terms that it “
could cause
” her to commit the offences. A similar vague phrase fraught with ambiguity (“could have caused”) was used in his additional clarification report dated 30 March 2015 (P13) where he added a further gloss by referring to her condition as an “
indirect
 contributory factor”. This qualified characterisation falls short of the requirement specified in s 339(3)(
c
) of the CPC which makes no mention of “indirect contributory factors”.
14     I do not think all this was a mere matter of semantics. If there was a valid finding that the appellant had a relevant psychiatric condition, either it was a contributing factor that caused the commission of the offences or it was not. But Dr Leong had 
not
 been prepared to say that it was so from the outset, even after a simple clarification was sought. These considerations would have been sufficient to dispose of the matter. In that sense, therefore, the prosecution had correctly opined that the report was “final and conclusive”.
15     The duty of the appointed psychiatrist in preparing the MTO report is to assist the court and he must state his opinion definitively to the best of his ability, avoiding ambiguity or room for vagaries and subjectivity in interpretation. If he fails to do so or is not prepared to do so and yet goes on to recommend that the offender is suitable for a MTO, any such recommendation is inherently unreliable and ought to be rejected. The essential point I wish to make is that if a psychiatrist does 
not
 state clearly in his MTO report that any psychiatric condition 
is
 “one of the contributing factors” of the offending conduct in question (in the language of s 339(3)(
c
) of the CPC), then as far as the court is concerned it must mean that he has made 
no
 such finding. Put another way, if he had been prepared to make such a finding, the natural and reasonable assumption is that he ought to and would have specifically said so.
16     The psychiatrist’s duty is cast in binary terms: if there is a finding of a relevant psychiatric disorder, he must state whether it was a contributing factor to the commission of the offence(s). If he does not do so, the matter should ordinarily end there; the purpose of s 339(9) of the CPC in providing for his opinion to be “final and conclusive” is precisely to avoid or at least minimise the possible protraction of the sentencing process with satellite litigation aimed at challenging or re-interpreting what the psychiatrist has stated, or not stated, as the case may be.
17     I do recognise that in the circumstances the District Judge found himself in a quandary. Had he proceeded on this basis in assessing the contents of the 1st and 2nd reports, he would have arrived at the same conclusion which he did at [62] of the GD – that the appellant did 
not
 suffer from major depressive disorder at the material time when the offences were committed. Any psychiatric condition she might have suffered from was in any event 
not
 a contributing factor for her commission of the offences. In the result, I agree with the prosecution that the Newton hearing ought not to have been convened, albeit on different grounds.
The District Judge’s reasons and conclusion
18     Although I am of the opinion that the matter had been unduly protracted, I find that the District Judge had ultimately arrived at the correct conclusion in determining that neither probation nor community-based sentencing would be appropriate for the appellant. He took note that the degree of pain and suffering endured by the victim was extensive, given the number and severity of the assaults on her as well as the sustained and prolonged nature of the abuse she suffered at the appellant’s hands.
19     It was however not wholly accurate for the District Judge to describe the appellant’s conduct as “deliberate and planned”, let alone “calm, collected and deliberate” in respect of the 8th charge involving pouring hot water onto the victim or “controlled and deliberate” in respect of the 9th charge (at [30] of the GD). They were no doubt intentional and deliberate acts. They were not one-off instances but were persistent. But I am unable to discern from the facts any evidence of anything resembling calm planning or control; the acts in question appeared to be rash, thoughtless and spontaneous outbursts and (over)reactions on the appellant’s part. This did not make them significantly less aggravated in any event.
20     In my view, the District Judge had correctly taken most of the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors into account in deciding that a custodial sentence was necessary, except for one troubling aspect. With respect, it appears that he had not adequately considered the finding of “fairly significant caregiver stress” on the part of the appellant. There is clear evidence of this condition affecting her even though it did not translate into a finding that she had suffered from major depressive disorder from the outset when the offences were committed. However, no mention of this aspect as a mitigating factor is made in any part of the GD. A passing reference to it appears at [62] where he accepted that she may well have experienced caregiver stress since her father’s illness in 2009. But it would appear that he had decided that it did not merit any consideration, taking instead the view that it had not “inevitably morphed into any form of mental illness or a psychiatric depressive disorder before or during the time of her offences”.
21     I differ from the District Judge’s view; the uncontroverted fact that the appellant was suffering from “fairly significant caregiver stress” ought to have been given due weight in determining her overall culpability. It was clearly something which took a serious toll on her both mentally and physically. The trying circumstances she found herself in rendered her more prone to unpredictable and irrational acts including those involving violence on the victim. I do not condone her conduct, much less excuse it, but I am not inclined to believe that she would have behaved or reacted in a similar fashion under ordinary circumstances.
Conclusion
22     The prosecution did not appeal against the sentences but alluded to the leniency of the sentence imposed in respect of DAC 46283/2012, which involved pouring hot water over the victim’s back. Visible second-degree burn injuries and scalding were noted in the medical report from Changi General Hospital dated 6 May 2012 (P3), along with a host of other injuries including bruises and scratches as well as a fracture to her left hand little finger proximal phalanx base.
23     I agree with the District Judge that deterrence is necessary and a substantial custodial sentence is justified. In my assessment, the individual sentences as well as the aggregate sentence of nine months’ imprisonment appear to err more on the side of leniency, particularly in view of the prolonged and sustained nature of the abuse and the seriousness of the assaults as evidenced by the range of injuries inflicted on the victim. Indeed, higher individual sentences might well have been warranted to reflect the appellant’s culpability. As such, notwithstanding my observations above at [20] – [21] in relation to the relevance of “caregiver stress” as a mitigating factor, I am unable to see sufficient basis to reduce the sentences. In the overall analysis, I am drawn to conclude that the sentences imposed are not manifestly excessive. The appeal is therefore dismissed.

1       Civil Appeal No 129 of 2015 (“CA 129/2015”) and Civil Appeal No 133 of 2015 (“CA 133/2015”) arise from a professional negligence suit brought by the plaintiff, Nava Bharat (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“the plaintiff”), against the defendant solicitors, Straits Law Practice LLC and its senior director, M Rajaram (“the defendants”). Following a trial that lasted more than 40 days, the Judge delivered a 327 page judgment, dismissing the plaintiff’s claim. The decision of the High Court is published as 
Nava Bharat (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Straits Law Practice LLC and another and another suit
 
[2015] SGHC 146
.
2       The Judge was presented with a wide array of issues, but in the appeals before us, only a single issue remains, and on that issue, both parties have appealed. The sole issue in question pertains to an oral undertaking that was furnished on 19 December 2008. The context of the undertaking may be stated briefly. The defendants were engaged as the plaintiff’s solicitors in a transaction concerning the plaintiff’s acquisition of an interest in a coal mine in Indonesia. In the course of negotiating and finalising the deal, an issue arose in respect of a lend-use permit that had to be obtained from the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry before mining could commence (“the Forestry Licence”). The plaintiff’s Indonesian counsel made it clear that the Forestry Licence was an essential prerequisite to the deal. The counterparty to the transaction, one Mr Dicky Tan, maintained that no licence was required and in fact that he was and had already been mining coal without such a licence. This came to a head at a meeting on 19 December 2008. Faced with an impasse, and the prospect of the deal being scuppered, Mr Dicky Tan orally undertook to obtain the Forestry Licence, if this should prove necessary.
3       It was undisputed that at the meeting on 19 December 2008, Mr Ashwin Devineni, the plaintiff’s main representative, was aware that his Indonesian counsel and business team had advised that a Forestry Licence would be necessary if the deal was to proceed. Shortly after the meeting, as Mr Rajaram testified, he reminded Mr Devineni that without the Forestry Licence, the plaintiff could not proceed with the deal. We are therefore satisfied that as matters stood, as far as the plaintiff was concerned, the deal could and would only go forward if the Forestry Licence was in fact procured. A few days later, on 23 December 2008, in correspondence exchanged between Mr Rajaram and Mr Dicky Tan’s lawyers, it was acknowledged in writing by the latter that Mr Dicky Tan was to apply for and obtain the Forestry Licence from the relevant government department in Indonesia, if this was found to be necessary.
4       As things transpired, the parties went forward with the transaction on that basis. Initial completion of the transaction took place on 22 and 28 January 2009. Pursuant to the terms in the initial completion documents, on 28 January 2009, the plaintiff released a loan of US$3m to Mr Dicky Tan. Indeed, before us, it is this payment of US$3m that lies at the heart of the plaintiff’s complaint.
5       Counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Francis Xavier, SC, contended that prior to the plaintiff proceeding with initial completion and committing further sums of money, Mr Rajaram ought to have properly advised Mr Devineni on certain specific matters arising directly out of the oral undertaking. Specifically, it was said that Mr Rajaram should have obtained advice from the Indonesian lawyers primarily on the question of whether and how it would be possible to take proceedings in Indonesia to enforce the oral undertaking.
6       Although the transaction was one that transcended borders, notably, those of Singapore and Indonesia, we are satisfied that Mr Rajaram was the solicitor with overall carriage and charge of the matter. We emphasise, however, that notwithstanding this observation, the precise duties that befall solicitors are always intensely fact sensitive. In this case, we accept in principle that a lead solicitor for a cross border commercial transaction in Mr Rajaram’s position may have a duty to consider issues such as whether the oral undertaking is enforceable or not, and how it would be enforced as a practical matter. Even if he was not in a position to personally give advice on Indonesian law, he may well be under a duty to ensure that his client has been properly advised by the foreign counsel working on the transaction.
7       Having said that, with great respect to the Judge, we cannot agree with the finding that Mr Rajaram had 
breached
 his duty to advise on the legal implications of proceeding with the transaction based on Mr Dicky Tan’s oral undertaking to obtain the Forestry Licence. We make a few observations in this regard.
8       First, to say that Mr Rajaram had breached his duty to advise on the legal implications of proceeding with the Transaction on the basis of the oral undertaking is in our judgment much too broad and general. Greater specificity as to what the Judge found Mr Rajaram 
should have advised on
 is needed. For instance, the evidence shows that Mr Rajaram had taken the step of having the oral undertaking recorded in writing. Therefore, one implication of proceeding on an oral undertaking, namely, that a dispute on its existence or terms might ensue, had been dealt with. Moreover, Mr Rajaram had told Mr Ashwin after the meeting that if the undertaking were not carried out, the transaction would fail. The short point we make here is that it was necessary to frame the precise duty that Mr Rajaram was said to be required to discharge before attention could be directed at whether he did or did not discharge such a duty. It was possible to frame the relevant duty in such specific terms, for instance, as we have done at [5] above; namely that in the present circumstances, Mr Rajaram should have obtained advice from the Indonesian lawyers primarily on the question of whether and how it would be possible to take proceedings in Indonesia to enforce the oral undertaking.
9       But this leads us to the second point. The case that was run by the plaintiff at the trial below was that no oral undertaking had been given at the meeting on 19 December 2008. We digress to observe that this seems odd to us because the substance of the oral undertaking was clearly mentioned in a document sent by Mr Rajaram’s firm to Mr Dicky Tan’s solicitors dated 23 December 2008 regarding the state of legal due diligence, and was confirmed by Mr Dicky Tan’s solicitor in the same document (see [3] above). But in any case, the Judge found against the plaintiff on this issue and the plaintiff now accepts that such an undertaking was given at the meeting.
10     However, because the heart of the battle on this issue in the court below centred on 
whether the undertaking had been given at all
, rather than on 
what specific steps Mr Rajaram ought to have taken when faced with such an undertaking
, the case that Mr Xavier put before us, namely that Mr Rajaram ought to have addressed his mind to and then advised Mr Devineni on the specific issues arising from the undertaking as we have articulated above, was not squarely put to Mr Rajaram in the proceedings below. This meant that the precise nature of the duty that Mr Rajaram was said to be under, and consequently, the precise communications that did or did not take place between Mr Rajaram and his Indonesian counterparts in discharging any such duty with respect of the oral undertaking, were not explored in any meaningful way at trial. In these circumstances, we consider that it would not have been open to the Judge, even if he had framed the duty more specifically, to make a finding that Mr Rajaram had breached his duty to advise on the oral undertaking in the manner and to the extent we have outlined above. Nor, obviously, is it open to us to do so. For these reasons, we allow the defendants’ appeal in CA 133/2015.
11     This is also sufficient to dispose of CA 129/2015, but we would make a further point. The claim being pursued today is for the recovery of the loan of US$3m that was released to Mr Dicky Tan on 28 January 2009 (see [4] above). This loan, however, was secured by a share pledge agreement which was entered into for the 
precise purpose
 of giving the plaintiff a pledge or charge over Mr Dicky Tan’s shares in the Indonesian company owning the mine. There is no suggestion before us that the plaintiff’s interests were not adequately looked after by the defendants in relation to the entering into the share pledge agreement. That was not the case the plaintiff ran either in the court below, or before us.
12     We agree with the Judge’s observation that at all material times, the plaintiff was keen to proceed with the deal. When it was time to make the payment of US$3m before the deal was finally completed, the plaintiff was willing to do so, on the basis of the security interest which it thought it had acquired under the share pledge agreement. In our judgment, this diminishes any causative force that any alleged breach of duty in relation to the oral undertaking might have had in relation to the plaintiff’s losses. Based on the evidence before us, we are satisfied that the plaintiff agreed to make the loan and to release the sum of US$3m because it considered that it had adequate security for that loan in the share pledge agreement.
13     For these reasons as well, we dismiss the plaintiff’s appeal in CA 129/2015. The defendants are to have one set of costs of the appeal to be taxed, if not agreed.",2016-02-22 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

 Lai Siu Chiu SJ:
1       This claim related to an accident that took place on 10 August 2013 (“the accident”) involving a public bus belonging to SBS Transit Ltd (“the second defendant”) that was driven by Yu Mau Hing (“the first defendant”) and a cyclist Lyu Yongqiang (“the plaintiff”).
2       The trial before this court was only to determine liability. At the conclusion of the trial, the plaintiff was awarded interlocutory judgment on the basis that the two defendants were 90% liable for the accident while the plaintiff was 10% liable. This court further directed that damages to be awarded to the plaintiff would be assessed by the Registrar on the basis of 90% liability on the part of the defendants, with interest on the damages assessed and the costs of this trial and of the assessment reserved to the Registrar.
3       The defendants are dissatisfied with this court’s decision and have appealed in Civil Appeal No. 113 of 2015. I now set out the grounds for the orders that were made.
The facts
4       According to the plaintiff, on the morning of 10 August 2013, at about 7.15am, he was riding his bicycle along Victoria Street heading in the direction of Hill Street. He was then in the extreme left lane of Victoria Street and was in front of Bugis Junction Shopping Centre (“Bugis Junction”) which was on his left side. Suddenly, SBS bus no. 8365X (“the Bus”) with the first defendant at the wheel came from behind the plaintiff and side-swiped his bicycle’s handle, causing the plaintiff to lose his balance and fall off his bicycle. The wheel of the Bus then ran over the plaintiff’s right leg causing a fracture of the ankle. The Bus did not stop until it reached the bus-stop ahead of Bugis Junction. An ambulance subsequently arrived and took the plaintiff to hospital.
5       Subsequently, by a letter dated 10 September 2013 from the Traffic Police department, the first defendant was notified he had committed the offence of inconsiderate driving under s 65(
b
) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the RTA”). The letter offered a fine of $200 to compound the offence, which offer the first defendant accepted. He paid the fine and received a penalty of nine demerit points.
6       The plaintiff is a mainland Chinese national who came to Singapore to work as a welder with a construction company. As a result of the accident, the plaintiff was unable to work and returned to China in January 2014.
7       The first defendant’s version of the accident (according to his affidavit of evidence-in chief (“AEIC”)) was that he had stopped the Bus near the Bugis MRT station for passengers to alight and to board. He then drove off, travelling in the extreme left lane (“the bus lane”) and proceeded straight along Victoria Street as the traffic lights at the junction of Rochor Road and Victoria Street (“the Junction”) were in his favour.
8       The first defendant first saw the plaintiff when the latter was cycling on the pedestrian crossing across Rochor Road. By the time the first defendant had driven the Bus into the Junction and the front of the Bus was about halfway through the Junction, the plaintiff had reached the Bugis Junction side of the Junction. The first defendant noticed that the plaintiff then started swerving his bicycle towards the right and was riding in the bus lane.
9       The first defendant was then driving the Bus in the bus lane and had caught up with the plaintiff. He decided to swerve the Bus to the right as well in order to give the plaintiff more room. However, the plaintiff continued to swerve his bicycle towards the right and the first defendant correspondingly also swerved the Bus to the right. Unfortunately, despite the first defendant’s evasive action, the left side of the Bus came into contact with the right side of the plaintiff’s bicycle. The plaintiff lost control of and fell off, his bicycle.
10     The first defendant immediately stopped the Bus after the collision and attended to the plaintiff who was subsequently conveyed by an ambulance to the Singapore General Hospital where he was warded for five days until 14 August 2013.
11     The first defendant disclaimed any fault for the accident, contending that the accident would not have occurred but for the negligence of the plaintiff in riding his bicycle. He asserted that had the plaintiff not swerved right and continued to do so in the bus lane where the Bus was then travelling, there would have been no contact between the Bus and the bicycle; the accident would not have happened.
12     The first defendant had filed a police report on the day of the accident. In his AEIC, he dissociated himself from the contents therein (at Agreed Bundle of Documents (“AB”) pp1–3) as:
(a)     he had spoken to the police officer in Mandarin and the latter had written the report for him in English;
(b)     while he was conversant in English, he may have signed the report too hastily at the time because he was still affected by the accident.
Having seen the video footage recorded by the closed circuit television camera (“CCTV”) installed in the Bus, the first defendant deposed that his police report did not correctly reflect how the accident happened as the CCTV footage had jogged his memory.
13     I should point out at this stage that the difference between the first defendant’s version of the accident as stated in his AEIC and in his police report related to 
where
 he first saw the plaintiff. In his police report, the first defendant said it was after the Bus had crossed the Junction that he first noticed the plaintiff turning left from Rochor Road into Victoria Street. In para 9 of his AEIC, the first defendant deposed that he was about to drive the Bus into the Junction when he first noticed the plaintiff riding a bicycle halfway across the Rochor Road pedestrian crossing. I am uncertain as to the significance of the discrepant versions. The defendants had relied heavily on the video footage from the CCTV of the Bus that was shown to the court, in particular, videos numbered 1, 2, 8, 3 and 5, to show what happened. I should add that no objections were raised by counsel for the plaintiff to the video recordings.
The pleadings
14     Nothing turns on the pleadings. The statement of claim contained the usual averments of negligence by a plaintiff against a defendant in an accident claim. I should point out however, that counsel for the defendants in his closing submissions took issue with the plaintiff’s plea that the Bus had encroached into the path of the plaintiff’s bicycle at the material time, submitting there was no evidence at the trial (which is correct) to support this allegation.
15     The (common) Defence filed by the two defendants denied liability for the accident – it was contended it was the plaintiff’s negligence that caused or contributed to the collision between the Bus and the bicycle. The defendants cited the plaintiff’s breach of Rules 29 and 34 of the Road Traffic Act’s Highway Code (Cap 276, R 11, 1990 Rev Ed) (“the Highway Code Rules”) and Rules 5, 8 and 10 of the Road Traffic (Bicycles) Rules (Cap 276, R 3, 1990 Rev Ed) (“the Road Traffic Rules for bicycles”) as particulars of such negligence. The defendants also alleged that the plaintiff was cycling at too fast a speed at the material time. (This allegation was not borne out by the evidence adduced at the trial).
The evidence 
16     The plaintiff was the only witness for his case. Similarly the first defendant was the only witness for the two defendants.
17     For his cross-examination of the plaintiff, counsel for the defendants relied wholly on the footage recorded by the CCTV in the Bus (see [13]).
Counsel sought to elicit the following facts from the plaintiff when he showed the video footage to the latter:
(a)     after the Bus had stopped at the bus-stop outside Raffles Hospital for passengers to alight and to board, the Bus had continued its journey travelling in the centre of the bus lane;
(b)     thereafter, when the plaintiff riding his bicycle came into view, the Bus moved to the right of the bus lane and then straddled the left and middle lanes to avoid the plaintiff, thus widening the gap between the Bus and the plaintiff’s bicycle; and
(c)     at one stage when the Bus was crossing the Junction near the plaintiff, a motorcyclist overtook the Bus on its right side.
18     Counsel’s purpose was to show that the first defendant while driving the Bus took all reasonable steps to avoid the plaintiff when he was cycling in the bus lane. Counsel asserted that it was the plaintiff who encroached into the path of the Bus by swerving to the right and thereby caused the accident.
19     The plaintiff not unexpectedly denied he was liable. He explained (as shown by the photographs at AB pp14-22) that on the day of the accident, there was ongoing construction work at the pedestrian crossing and at Victoria Street on the side of Bugis Junction next to the bus lane. There were construction barriers on the left side of the road next to the bus lane as well as hoarding that prevented pedestrians or cyclists from using the pavement on the left side of the road facing in the direction of Hill Street. The obstructions prevented the plaintiff from cycling closer to or on the pavement.
20     When the Bus overtook his bicycle, the plaintiff testified he felt a gust of wind (as if he was in a wind tunnel) and it was that sensation that caused him to lose his balance and the handle of his bicycle to swerve to the right into the path of the Bus.
21     As for the first defendant, he testified that he did not slow down when the Bus caught up with and overtook the plaintiff’s bicycle. He explained he did not give way to the plaintiff either when the Bus entered the Junction because the plaintiff was then steering to the left. The first defendant said he signalled and steered the Bus to the right towards the centre lane when he was overtaking.
22     During cross-examination, the first defendant denied he was too close to the plaintiff when overtaking him and that caused the latter to wobble and lose his balance on his bicycle. While he agreed with the suggestion of counsel for the plaintiff that he was heading for the bus-stop about 30m ahead, the first defendant denied he had cut back into the bus lane too quickly after overtaking the plaintiff and the Bus was too close to the plaintiff, thereby causing the accident.
The issue
23     The only issue the court had to determine was, who caused the accident? Was it the plaintiff or the first defendant or were both partly responsible?
The evidence 
24     I start by referring to the subsidiary legislation relied on by the defendants (at [15]), starting with Rules 29 and 34 of the Highway Code Rules under the section on Pedal Cyclists:
 
When Riding
 
 
29
.    Always ride on the left-hand edge on a dual carriageway but do not ride on a footpath. Allow other traffic to overtake you safely. Keep a straight course and avoid sudden swerves.
 
…
 
 
34
.    Always keep your head up.
25     Next, I set out the relevant Road Traffic Rules for bicycles:
 
Rider to give signals
 
 
5
.    The rider of a bicycle shall in order to inform traffic that he intends —
(a)    to ‘stop’ — hold out his right arm horizontally with the forearm vertical and with the palm of the hand to the front;
(b)    to ‘slow down’ — hold out his right arm horizontally with the palm of the hand downwards, and move the arm up and down several times;
(c)    to ‘proceed to the right’ — hold out his right arm horizontally with the palm to the front; and
(d)    to ‘proceed to the left’ — hold out his left arm horizontally with the palm of the hand to the front.
…
 
Bicycle to be ridden on left side of the road
 
 
8
.    Every bicycle shall be ridden close to the left hand edge of the roadway and in such a manner as not to obstruct vehicles moving at a faster speed.
…
 
Bicycle to be ridden in an orderly manner
 
 
10
.    No bicycle shall be ridden or propelled otherwise than in an orderly manner and with due regard for the safety of others.
26     On his part, counsel for the plaintiff had referred to a publication – The New Highway Code (Book 2), Final Theory of Driving – and in particular to the following extracts in Section 4 (Driving in Traffic) under the sub-heading on Cyclists to support the plaintiff’s case that the first defendant owed and had breached the duty of care to the plaintiff:
… Because they ride close to traffic, cyclists are vulnerable to injury in a collision. As a driver, it is your special responsibility to pay attention to them and to provide for their safety.1. When sharing the road with cyclists, expect sudden moves on their part at all times. A patch of oil, debris, a pothole, an opening door of a parked car and other hazards can force a cyclist to swerve suddenly into your path.2. When approaching or passing a cyclist, give him/her ample space and be extra alert. Be prepared to slow down or stop. When a cyclist glances back, it is an indication that he/she may change direction anytime.
…
6.    When overtaking, keep a safe gap between your vehicle and the cyclist. Don’t cut in sharply after overtaking the cyclist. This could result in your vehicle “side brushing” or hitting the cyclist.
…
27     I should make it clear at this juncture that while the video recordings taken by the Bus were helpful, they could not/did not capture the plaintiff’s movements as he cycled along Victoria Street. Despite the valiant efforts of counsel for the defendants, the video recordings of the Bus could not give any indication of how far apart the Bus was from the plaintiff (breadthwise), at and after the first defendant overtook the plaintiff’s bicycle at, the Junction.
28     If the Bus was too close to the plaintiff (as his counsel contended), then it was the first defendant who caused the plaintiff to lose his balance on the bicycle. On the other hand, if it was the plaintiff who was reckless in his manoeuvring of his bicycle and, instead of swerving left or riding straight, he swerved right instead into the path of the Bus (which was what counsel for the defendants alleged), then it was the plaintiff’s own negligence that caused the accident.
The decision
29     Having considered the evidence presented by the parties as well as the testimony of the two witnesses, I found that on a balance of probabilities, it was more likely than not that it was the first defendant who caused the accident.
30     Even taking into consideration the duties and responsibilities of a cyclist as set out in the subsidiary legislation, it did not appear to me that the plaintiff was negligent in the manner he rode or manoeuvred his bicycle on the day of the accident.
31     To elaborate, the subsidiary legislation relied on by the defendants specifically prohibited the plaintiff from:
(a)     riding on a footpath (Rule 29 of the Highway Code Rules); and
(b)     riding other than on the left hand edge of the roadway (Rule 8 of the Road Traffic Rules for bicycles).
Consequently, the plaintiff was not wrong to have ridden his bicycle in the bus lane of Victoria Street that morning. He was not allowed to ride on the pavement as that was meant for pedestrians nor was he allowed to cycle in the other two lanes of the road.
32     In my view, the first defendant:
(a)     should have overtaken the plaintiff’s bicycle at a lesser speed and not cut back to the bus lane immediately thereafter;
(b)     should have then increased the distance between the Bus and the bicycle; and/or
(c)     should have then continued driving the Bus in the centre lane until he was nearer to the bus stop ahead of Bugis Junction before switching back to the bus lane.
Taking any of the above measures would have prevented the accident. Unfortunately, the first defendant did not, resulting in the Bus running over the plaintiff’s right leg after the plaintiff lost his balance and fell off his bicycle.
33     I disagree with the submission of counsel for the defendants that all the above options were considered in retrospect. The first defendant as a prudent motorist should have given due consideration to such measures as he was driving a public bus 
vis-à-vis
 the plaintiff who was riding a bicycle. In all likelihood, the first defendant had breached Rule No 6 (at [26]) in cutting back to the bus lane immediately after overtaking the plaintiff with the resultant “side-brushing” of the plaintiff’s bicycle. The first defendant’s conduct fell short of the standard of care expected of a road-user.
34     It bears remembering that the first defendant had been fined $200 for the offence of inconsiderate driving under s 65(
b
) of the RTA (at [5]). In his AEIC, the first defendant did not refer to the fine or the offence. It was only during cross-examination (at notes of evidence on 28 April 2015 at p45) that the first defendant said he paid the fine of $200 “without giving it too much thought”. However, he disagreed with counsel for the plaintiff that he had “side-swiped with [the] plaintiff’s bicycle” as per the charge.
35     I therefore rejected the submission of counsel for the defendants that the plaintiff was the author of his own misfortune as the first defendant had done all he could and that both defendants were not liable. However, I took cognisance of the fact that the plaintiff could have/should have stopped cycling to allow the Bus to pass and travel some distance ahead before he resumed his journey. As he failed to do so, I apportioned 10% liability to the plaintiff for the accident.",2015-07-31 00:00:00,SG High Court

Introduction
1       I will use the same definitions as in my judgment dated 4 May 2015.
Reasons for suing Dr Yue and SGHPL
2       Andrew has given two reasons for suing both Dr Yue and SGHPL as follows:
(a)     judgment may not be satisfied; and
(b)     higher chance of negotiating a settlement.
3       The elaboration of the first reason was that Dr Yue’s insurers might have repudiated liability. Therefore, the fallback was on the hospital which would have a deeper pocket irrespective of whether the hospital was insured. However, this reason does not address the point that it would have sufficed for Andrew to continue with his claim against SGHPL only since SGHPL did not deny that it was vicariously liable for any negligence of Dr Yue.
4       The second reason was based on an observation in the English case of 
Wright v Cambridge Medical Group (a partnership)
 
[2012] 3 WLR 1124
. In that case, the claim was against a partnership of medical practitioners and the hospital was not joined as a party. Andrew submitted that Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury had suggested that the hospital should have been joined as a party in the proceedings as there was a risk of inconsistent findings if the defendants were to eventually make a claim for contribution against the hospital. Also, there might have been a better chance of a negotiated settlement (of the plaintiff’s claim) if the hospital had been joined as a party.
5       In my view, one must bear in mind that in that case, the medical practitioners were not the hospital’s employees. Indeed their defence was that it was the hospital’s subsequent treatment of the plaintiff that was negligent and that was causative of the plaintiff’s injury. That difference is important as that case does not suggest that action should be commenced against both a medical practitioner and a hospital when the hospital is accepting liability for the conduct of the medical practitioner.",2015-06-29 00:00:00,SG High Court

Motor Accident
15 January 2016
 District Judge Kenneth Choo:
Introduction
1       On 31 July 2011, the plaintiff, who was riding a motorcycle, was involved in a collision with a car driven by the defendant. As a result thereof, the plaintiff sustained physical injuries and her motorcycle was damaged. The plaintiff sought damages against the defendant for her personal injuries and consequential losses. At the end of trial, I gave judgment in her favour, finding the defendant wholly to blame for the accident. The defendant has now appealed.
2       The trial before me was on liability only. Hence, the issue to be determined is whether the plaintiff or the defendant was to blame for the accident. If both were negligent, then the subsidiary issue would be how liability between them is to be apportioned.
Factual background
3       The accident occurred on 31 July 2011 at about 10.30pm. It took place inside the traffic-light controlled cross-junction of Bedok South Avenue 1 and Upper East Coast Road (“the Junction”). The plaintiff was riding her motorcycle (FBD 7339H) (“the Motorcycle”) with Mr Danny bin Abdullah @ Shamsudin bin Sapari (“Danny”), her then boyfriend (now husband), riding pillion. The plaintiff was travelling along Bedok South Avenue 1 heading towards New Upper Changi Road and was proceeding straight across the Junction.
4       At the material time, the defendant was driving motor car (SBY 8081H) (“the Car”). He was travelling from the opposite direction along Bedok South Avenue 1 with the intention of making a right turn at the Junction into Upper East Coast Road in the direction of East Coast Road. The plaintiff’s then girlfriend (now wife), Ms Li Yu Xuan, Ting (“Li”), was the front-seat passenger in the Car.
5       The collision occurred inside the Junction while the Motorcycle was proceeding across it and the Car was making a right turn. The plaintiff and Danny were both flung off the Motorcycle and sustained injuries.
6       Entering the Junction from the East Coast Parkway (“ECP”) expressway in the direction that the plaintiff was riding, there were three lanes on Bedok South Avenue 1 towards New Upper Changi Road. The right-most lane was exclusively for vehicles turning right and the other two lanes were for vehicles proceeding straight only.
7       In the opposite direction and heading towards the ECP expressway, which was the direction the defendant had been travelling on prior to the turn at the Junction, there were also three lanes. Similarly, the right most lane was exclusively for vehicles turning right into Upper East Coast Road from Bedok South Avenue 1. There was a turning pocket along the right-most lane. The remaining two lanes were for vehicles proceeding straight only towards the ECP expressway. Both turning lanes from opposite directions face each other directly across the Junction.
[note: ]
8       It was common ground that, at the material time, the weather was clear, the road surface was dry, traffic volume was moderate and the traffic lights at the Junction were functioning normally.
9       After the Traffic Police conducted their investigations, there was no police action initiated against either the plaintiff or the defendant.
[note: i]
10     It was also not in dispute that Li’s mother was the owner of the Car. Further, due to an inadvertent lapse, there was unfortunately no third-party insurance coverage in relation to the use of the Car at the material time.
[note: ii]
11     As stated earlier, Danny was also injured in the accident. He instituted separate proceedings in DC 3892/2013 against the plaintiff, who subsequently brought in the defendant herein as a Third Party in those proceedings.
[note: iii]
 Notwithstanding these separate actions, the parties (including Danny) have appropriately agreed to be bound by the findings of fact made in these proceedings.
12     The main dispute between the parties is on the question of who had the right of way, i.e. in whose favour the traffic lights were at the material time.
The parties’ accounts
The plaintiff’s evidence
13     At the time of the accident, the plaintiff was a 23 year old staff nurse.
14     In her affidavit, the plaintiff stated that, on 31 July 2011 at about 10.30pm, she was riding the Motorcycle and travelling in the second lane of a three-lane carriageway being Bedok South Avenue 1, heading towards New Upper Changi Road. As she passed the Junction, the defendant’s Car, which was travelling from the opposite direction of Bedok South Avenue 1, made a sudden right turn at the Junction and collided into the right side of the Motorcycle, causing the plaintiff and Danny to fall off the Motorcycle. The plaintiff further affirmed that, at the material time, the traffic lights were showing green in her favour and she therefore proceeded to ride through the Junction as she had right of way.
[note: iv]
15     During cross-examination, the plaintiff gave further evidence as follows:
(a)     When the plaintiff approached the Junction, she was travelling in the centre of the second lane of Bedok South Avenue 1 heading towards New Upper Changi Road at a speed of about 40 km/h;
[note: v]
(b)     As she was approaching the Junction, she confirmed that there was a car travelling one car length in front of her. She could not recall seeing any cars on her right side. She could not see what was in front of the car ahead of her but she could see on the left and right of the said car.
[note: vi]
(c)     She was unable to confirm whether, due to the impact of the collision, Danny was flung off the Motorcycle over her as she claimed to be half awake and half drowsy due to the amount of blood she lost.
[note: vii]
(d)     As she entered the Junction, she saw the defendant’s car which was stationary in the turning pocket.
[note: viii]
 She also confirmed that the traffic lights were green in her favour.
[note: ix]
 The plaintiff maintained her speed at about 40 km/h when she was in the Junction just before impact.
[note: x]
(e)     As she was half-way through the Junction, the defendant’s Car travelling from the opposite direction from Bedok South Avenue 1 made a sudden right turn and collided into the right side of the Motorcycle. According to the plaintiff, the point of impact was at the middle right side of the Motorcycle where her right leg was positioned. She confirmed that most of the impact was absorbed by her right leg.
[note: xi]
Danny’s evidence
16     Danny gave evidence for the plaintiff at the trial. Danny in his affidavit gave an account largely similar to that given by the plaintiff in her affidavit. In particular, he confirmed that the traffic lights were in favour of the plaintiff.
[note: xii]
17     In court, Danny corroborated the plaintiff’s account and gave the following further evidence:
[note: xiii]
(a)     There were cars travelling in front of the Motorcycle although Danny was unable to see in front of those cars.
(b)     As Danny was riding pillion behind the plaintiff, he indicated that certain angles of his front view were blocked but he had a good view of the sides. He also stated that as he was a tall person, his view of the front was not entirely obstructed.
(c)     He stated that the traffic lights were green in the plaintiff’s favour and that the traffic lights were located at the left side of his view. Danny confirmed that the plaintiff was travelling at a speed of about 30 – 40 km/h along the second lane of the three-lane carriageway.
(d)     They were half-way through the Junction when the defendant’s Car collided into the Motorcycle. Danny lost consciousness after the collision and sustained injuries.
The defendant’s evidence
18     At the material time of the accident, the defendant and Li, both school teachers, were on their way home from Great World City.
19     The defendant made a traffic accident report on 2 August 2011, two days after the accident. His statement in the said report is reproduced in full below:
[note: xiv]
“On the above mentioned date and time I was driving along Bedok South Ave 1. I wanted to make a right turn to upper east coast road, my vehicle was in stationary position on the most outer lane, once the green arrow lit up, I checked and noticed that there’s no oncoming traffic and gradually increase my speed, whilst turning, a m/cycle suddenly dashed straight ahead and hit onto my front right bumper. Upon impact, both the rider and pillion were thrown off from their m/cycle. I completed my turn and stop at the side of the road to render assistance to the rider and pillion. Eye-witness called the ambulance. Ambulance soon arrived and both the rider and pillion was conveyed to the hospital. The traffic police arrived after the ambulance had left. That’s all.”
20     During cross-examination, the defendant testified that:
(a)     Although he was informed by the police after the accident that he was driving without insurance coverage, the defendant made his report two days after the accident as he was given a summons by the police to attend at the station. He also confirmed that he did not discuss the case with anyone else prior to making the report.
[note: xv]
(b)     Notwithstanding the fact that his affidavit did not explicitly state the words “green arrow”, the defendant testified that he made the right turn after the green filter arrow of the traffic lights lit up in his favour and the lights were red against traffic going straight in both directions. According to the defendant, there “was a car in the middle that stopped and the right most lane (from my angle/perspective) there was also a car stopped at the stop line”. The defendant also stated that he could not recall if there was any car turning from the opposite direction.
[note: xvi]
 For convenience, assuming we adopt the defendant’s perspective from the opposite side of the Junction, I shall refer to the lanes, counting from the right side of the opposite road as lane 1 being the right-most lane and lane 2 being the middle lane. The turning lane will be referred to as lane 3.
(c)     When he observed that it was safe to turn, the defendant “moved very slowly” for a “short distance” of 2 – 3 m when suddenly the Motorcycle dashed from behind the two stationary cars (i.e. in between the two cars at lanes 1 and 2 from the opposite direction) and crashed into the front right side of the Car. The defendant asserted that the speed that the plaintiff was travelling at was at least 70 km/h.
[note: xvii]
(d)     The defendant confirmed that the point of impact was more than half-way across the Junction, i.e. the plaintiff had travelled half-way across the Junction before the collision.
[note: xviii]
(e)     When questioned about the eye witness referred to in his statement, the defendant stated that there were at least two eye witnesses who approached him but he did not take down their contact numbers because he was emotionally traumatised. He also stated that one architect gave the defendant his name card but the architect’s wife took the name card back.
[note: xix]
Li’s evidence
21     Li gave evidence in support of the defendant at the trial. Her evidence was generally consistent with the defendant’s account save for certain discrepancies. I shall deal with and elaborate on these inconsistencies at [44] below.
Reasoning
The objective evidence supported the plaintiff’s account
22     The plaintiff has consistently maintained before and during trial (in her affidavit, in her traffic police report and at trial) that the front right bumper area of the Car collided into the right side of the Motorcycle.
[note: xx]
23     First, the plaintiff contended that the vehicle damage report of the plaintiff’s Motorcycle produced by the police
[note: xxi]
 show that apart from its front wheel (which was badly damaged), the damage to the Motorcycle was also mainly on its right side. There was damage to the fork (which was broken), the right hand mirror was cracked and there were scratches and dents to the right pedal and right exhaust. The vehicle damage report of the defendant’s Car
[note: xxii]
 show that the damage to the Car was to the front right bumper area which was crumpled. I therefore agreed with plaintiff’s submission that both damage reports are therefore consistent with the plaintiff’s version.
24     Second, I found the coloured photographs (showing both the damage to the vehicles and the accident scene) and the Traffic Police sketch plan to be pertinent evidence. My finding that the damage was more prevalent on the right side of the Motorcycle as opposed to its left side was supported by a visual inspection of the coloured photographs of the damaged Motorcycle.
[note: xxiii]
 For completeness, the coloured photographs also show that the license plate of the defendant’s Car was ripped off due to the collision.
[note: xxiv]
 More importantly, from the coloured photographs of the accident scene and the Traffic Police sketch plan, one would note that the final resting position of the Motorcycle was on its left side.
[note: xxv]
 Hence, it was unlikely that the damage to the right side of the Motorcycle was caused by contact against the road. Further, as may be gleaned from the same photographs and sketch plan, the final resting position of the plaintiff’s Motorcycle was situated along Upper East Coast Road towards Bedok Road (near the right turning pocket) and after the divider dividing traffic travelling in opposite directions, i.e. the Motorcycle ended up some two lanes to the left of the plaintiff’s intended path of travel. In my view, this was consistent with the plaintiff’s account of an impact coming from the right.
25     Third, the plaintiff’s own injuries were consistent with her version of events. As stated earlier, the plaintiff testified during trial that the point of impact between the Car and the Motorcycle was at the middle right side of the Motorcycle where her right leg was positioned and that most of the impact was absorbed by her right leg. I found her assertion credible given that she suffered multiple injuries on the right side of her body, in particular, on her right leg. An extract of the plaintiff’s medical report is reproduced below:
“According to our records, [the plaintiff] was admitted on 1/8/11 after a road traffic accident where she sustained a right knee laceration with extension into the knee joint, a right thigh laceration, right 2
nd
 toe distal phalanx amputation, right metatarsal shaft fracture and right 5
th
 metacarpal fracture.”
[note: xxvi]
The objective evidence did not support the defendant’s version
26     At trial, the defendant’s description of the accident was akin to a “head-on” collision in which he moved very slowly forward and only for a short distance of 2 – 3 m:
[note: xxvii]
Ct:
No car turning right from the opposite direction?
A:
That one I cannot recall. And I checked that the lights were red against them. And then the green arrow appeared. Before I made the right turn, I actually checked that there was no on-coming vehicle coming from the opposite direction. And I observed that it was safe to make a right turn. And 
I slowly moved my car forward
 and suddenly, a motorcycle dashed from behind the stationary cars from the opposite direction and it went between the cars in the first and second lanes and entered the cross road at a high speed. And then it crashed to the front right side of my car. The impact was so strong that the motorcyclist and pillion rider was thrown off the motorcycle. The pillion was thrown further away towards the island of the traffic lamp post. And the motorcyclist was just thrown to the side along Upper East Road.
…
Q:
So Mr Chia, when you accelerated to make your right turn – what speed were you going?
A:
 
Very slowly, just moved slightly forward.
 I can’t say how fast. Not sure about the number. Barely moved a short distance. About 2 – 3 metres. [Emphasis added]
27     First, the defendant’s account was inconsistent with the damage pattern inflicted on the Motorcycle (i.e. the damage to its right side) as well as the plaintiff’s injuries on her right leg. Second, the plaintiff, in her written submissions, raised the contention that, if the defendant’s version is to be believed in that he moved very slowly forward whilst turning and it was the plaintiff’s Motorcycle which crashed full force head on into the Car’s front right bumper, the final position of the Motorcycle would have been in the near vicinity of the impact point, i.e. within the path of travel in between lanes 1 and 2 and within the Junction.
[note: xxviii]
 I agreed with the plaintiff’s submission. From the coloured photographs of the accident scene and the Traffic Police sketch plan, the Motorcycle was situated post-accident near the right turning pocket along Upper East Coast Road towards Bedok Road which was some two lanes to the left of the plaintiff’s intended path of travel.
[note: xxix]
 Indeed, one of the coloured photographs actually show that the distance between the edge of lane 1 (the right-most lane) to the final position of the Motorcycle was approximately one car length.
[note: xxx]
 The aforesaid distance does not include the width of lane 1. I should also add that although the exact position where the plaintiff landed was not established in the course of trial, the defendant testified that the plaintiff was “just thrown to the side along Upper East Coast Road”.
[note: xxxi]
28     Although the photographs of the accident site
[note: xxxii]
 show a concentration of debris along lane 1 in the Junction, this does not weaken the inference that the collision occurred while the Motorcycle was in its intended path of travel along lane 2. After the accident, the traffic in the Junction along Bedok South Avenue 1 (i.e. in the same direction as the plaintiff) continued to move ahead despite the accident. The same photographs show vehicles proceeding across the Junction from lanes 1 and 2.
[note: xxxiii]
 These photographs were taken sometime after the accident. Any debris caused by the collision with the Car would undoubtedly have been disturbed by the incessant moving traffic. What debris that remained on the road after a while would have little probative value in determining the spot at which the plaintiff’s Motorcycle collided with the Car.
29     In the defendant’s Written Submissions
[note: xxxiv]
, the defendant argued that the fact that Danny was catapulted and landed at the island of the traffic lamp post proved that the plaintiff had rode at an excessive speed. In my view, this contention is at best speculative as there was no conclusive evidence to prove that the plaintiff was speeding at the material time. Further, I could not discount the possibility that Danny was in any event catapulted due to the impact of the collision whilst the plaintiff was riding at a speed of around 40km/h (in line with the plaintiff’s account). Hence, without the benefit of further/expert evidence, the Court should be slow to make such a finding as suggested by the defendant.
30     In any event, if the defendant’s version was correct, then Danny ought to, upon the head-on collision, have been catapulted straight along the path of travel (in between lanes 1 and 2) and ought not have landed at the island of the traffic lamp post which is to the left of the plaintiff’s intended path of travel.
The defendant’s version was improbable
31     To summarise, the defendant asserted that he slowly moved the Car forward when the green filter arrow of the traffic lights lit up in his favour and it was then that the plaintiff’s Motorcycle dashed from behind the stationary cars that stopped at the stop line from the opposite direction (i.e. the Motorcycle went in between the cars in lanes 1 and 2, i.e. the centre lane and right most lane respectively from the defendant’s perspective) at a speed of at least 70km/h. He stated that the Motorcycle thereafter entered the Junction and crashed into the front right side of the Car.
32     I should add that Li’s account in this regard was similar to the defendant’s save that she even added that “Definitely there were cars at the back of the front two cars at the stop line”
[note: xxxv]
. Hence, according to Li, the plaintiff actually squeezed in between 
two rows
 of stationary vehicles at 70km/h.
33     The space in between two cars in adjacent lanes would typically be narrow. This is illustrated in a coloured photograph tendered by the plaintiff (in the Plaintiff’s Supplementary Bundle of Documents Photographs at p 4) which shows random traffic stopping before the stop line at the Junction from the defendant’s perspective. The said photograph is particularly useful as it shows two cars at lanes 1 and 2 and a motorcycle behind them in between those two lanes. Given that the space in between two adjacent cars would be a narrow gap, motorcyclists would tend to go slowly in between two adjacent cars to avoid any mishap such as colliding into either car’s side or side view mirror. Squeezing through such a narrow gap (in between not one but two rows of cars) at a high speed of 70kmp/h would, in my view, be an extremely risky and difficult manoeuvre.
34     Moreover, the plaintiff was not riding a powerful motorcycle – the Motorcycle had an engine capacity of only 135cc. Bearing in mind that it was carrying both the plaintiff and Danny at the material time, it was unlikely that the plaintiff could have travelled at the high speed of 70kmp/h, overtaking and squeezing in between two rows of stationary cars.
35     In light of the above, I found the version given by the defendant and Li improbable and not believable.
Further observations on the evidence
36     I set out below my observations on 
inter alia
 the evidence given by the witnesses.
37     First, the plaintiff was a clear and calm witness. She did not contradict herself and was able to give a consistent and coherent account of what had happened. She responded to counsel’s questions without vacillation and did not attempt to finesse her answers. From what I have observed at trial, the plaintiff did not strike me as a reckless or careless rider. On the contrary, she seemed to me to be a rider who would not take any unnecessary risks on the road. Accordingly, I found the plaintiff to be a credible witness.
38     Second, I move on to the evidence given by the defendant. Counsel for the plaintiff did try to seize on some of the defendant’s answers during cross-examination such as the defendant only making his police report two days after the accident and his failure to mention the “green arrow” in pleadings filed in the separate proceedings DC 3892/2013 and in his affidavit.
[note: xxxvi]
 According to the defendant, he made his report two days after the accident because he was given a summons by the police to attend at the station. When questioned as to why he did not produce the summons as evidence, he stated that it did not cross his mind that it was an important document for the present case.
[note: xxxvii]
 In this regard, I gave the defendant the benefit of the doubt. I was also prepared to overlook his failure to mention the “green arrow” in certain pleadings and in his affidavit because the defendant did specifically mention the “green arrow” in his police report, which was a relatively contemporaneous document made two days after the accident. Further, it was specifically pleaded in the Defence that the plaintiff had crossed the stop line when the traffic lights were “red” against her.
[note: xxxviii]
 I accepted the defendant’s explanation during cross-examination for the omission of the words “green arrow” in his affidavit – he explained that his affidavit specifically mentioned that vehicles from the opposite direction had stopped at the stop line and that the traffic light was green for traffic turning right towards Upper East Coast Road. He stated that this was the only sequence possible.
[note: xxxix]
39     However, some of the defendant’s answers during cross-examination were telling and I reproduce the material parts below:
[note: xl]
Q:
PSBD-40 to 42: do you see the damage on your car? Are you telling us that kind of damage can be caused by a motorbike travelling at 30 – 40 kmph (this speed is according to the Pf and her witness) passing through a junction?
A:
When they said that there were travelling at 40 kmph, I disagree. Their speed must be much more than that. The reason I say this is because before I made the right turn, I checked that there were no on-coming vehicles but when I started to move just a short distance, the motorcycle appeared within a short period of time from behind the cars. The speed must be at least 70 kmph and came from behind and crashed into my car. I did not have time to react as it was so fast. 
If I may add, last night I surfed on youtube for accidents similar to ours, the damage is exactly what you see on my car if the motorcycle travelled at 70kmph or it could be even worse. That’s the reason I say it must be at least 70 kmph.
…
Q:
So Mr Chia, the Pf was already half-way across the road?
A:
 
That could also mean … its not significant. It can still be red light and they can still dash across. I read of an accident. Whereby the taxi hit the car in the middle of a junction
 …
Ct:
Mr Chia, you are called here today to be a factual witness. Please refrain from talking about your opinions. I let the youtube ramark [
sic
] pass by just now but please bear this in mind for future questions. Thank you.
[Emphasis added]
From the defendant’s answers at trial as highlighted above, it appeared to me that the defendant was over-compensating for something.
40     I also found it inconceivable that when questioned whether the defendant had discussed the accident with anyone prior to making his police report, he answered that he did not. I did not believe the defendant. Surely, he would have discussed it with Li who was with him during the accident. Even more so, he must have discussed it with Li’s mother who was the owner of the Car and who was the one who had failed to extend the third-party insurance coverage. Indeed, Li’s evidence, discussed below, shows that the defendant was not entirely truthful in this regard.
41     Third, I shall now consider the evidence given by Danny and Li. In assessing their evidence, I was mindful of the marital relationships between the plaintiff and Danny as well as that between the defendant and Li at the time of trial. Each couple are husband and wife and each couple have a common interest in the outcome of the present case. The evidence given by Danny and Li were generally consistent with the evidence given by their respective spouses. Moving forward, I had to decide which couple’s version ought to be preferred.
42     Counsel for the defendant argued that Danny completely lacked credibility due to his answers when posed questions regarding why he chose to sue the plaintiff only in DC 3892/2013 and his purportedly different position taken in that suit. In response to that line of questioning, Danny repeatedly stated that his lawyer had advised him to do so and that Counsel should ask his lawyer why this position was taken.
[note: xli]
 I accepted Danny’s explanation in this regard that his lawyer in the separate suit had advised him to take this course of action because the plaintiff (his wife) had insurance whilst the defendant did not have insurance coverage at the material time of the accident. The motivation behind such advice could very well be a strategic one after a consideration of the unique circumstances in the present case. Further, in such motor accident claims, it is quite common for the pillion to sue the rider first and for the insurers of the rider to initiate negotiations with the insurers of the driver of the other vehicle involved in the accident with a view to obtaining a contribution. If such negotiations fail, the insurers for the rider would eventually make the decision to commence third party proceedings against the said driver. As the insurers for the defendant was not involved in the present case, it was not surprising that the defendant was subsequently joined as a Third Party in DC 3892/2013.
43     I should stress that I am neither evaluating the merits of the advice given to Danny nor am I stating that I approved the course of action taken by Danny in DC 3892/2013. I am merely stating that based on his answers and from what I observed at trial, I believed Danny when he explained that he was advised by his lawyer to commence an action against the plaintiff in DC 3892/2013. In general, I found Danny to be a truthful witness. On the one occasion when Danny demonstrated his anger and a loss of control
[note: xlii]
, this was understandable given the ordeal that both the plaintiff and Danny had gone through.
44     I move on to my analysis of Li’s evidence. There were inconsistencies between Li’s evidence and that of the defendant. The defendant stated that the distance the Car moved before the impact was 2 – 3 m.
[note: xliii]
 At trial, Li testified that the said distance was 1 – 1.5 m only.
[note: xliv]
 I was prepared to overlook this minor inconsistency due to the small difference in estimations. There were however further discrepancies in Li’s evidence that I could not ignore. When questioned about the eye witness who had called the ambulance, the defendant answered that an architect did give him a name card but the architect’s wife took the name card back. Li however stated during cross-examination that the couple never spoke to the defendant.
[note: xlv]
 Li had one inconsistency within her own answers when she was asked whether she or the defendant had discussed the case with anyone else between the date of the accident (31 July 2011) and the day the defendant made the police report (2 August 2011). Li initially answered a definitive “not at all” but when I asked whether they discussed the accident with her mother, Li admitted that her “family was aware of the accident but it was not something which was pleasant to talk about”.
[note: xlvi]
45     In light of the foregoing, I found the evidence of the plaintiff and Danny to be more credible than that presented by the defendant and Li. I therefore preferred the plaintiff’s version of the accident over that given by the defendant.
46     After considering all the evidence in totality, I found, on a balance of probabilities, that the traffic lights were showing green in the plaintiff’s favour when she proceeded to ride into the Junction.
47     For completeness, I should add that the fact that there was no police action initiated against either the plaintiff or the defendant was, at best, a neutral point given the higher standard of proof required in criminal proceedings.
No contributory negligence on the plaintiff’s part
48     I accepted the plaintiff’s testimony on the witness stand that prior to entering the Junction, there was a car in front of the Motorcycle about one car length ahead. As she entered the Junction, she did notice the defendant’s Car waiting at the turning pocket from the opposite direction. The plaintiff nevertheless proceeded straight.
[note: xlvii]
 As she was half-way through the Junction, the Car made a sudden right turn into Upper East Coast Road in the direction of East Coast Road, and collided into the Motorcycle. It was more likely than not that the defendant made the sudden right turn immediately after the car in front of the plaintiff had passed the defendant’s Car and the defendant picked up speed and travelled faster than he would admit.
49     I therefore found that the plaintiff had no time to take any evasive measures and that she had not been negligent in maintaining her course despite being aware of the presence of the defendant’s Car in the turning pocket from the opposite direction.
Judgment
50     For the reasons given above, I found the defendant wholly liable for the accident and there will therefore be judgment for the plaintiff with damages to be assessed, with costs and interest reserved to the assessing Registrar.

Introduction
1       The appellant, Mohd Fauzi bin Mohamed Mydin (“the Appellant”) pleaded guilty in a District Court to a charge under s 8(
b
)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) for consuming morphine, a specified drug. His charge is also commonly known as a “Long Term-2” or “LT-2” charge because it attracts enhanced punishment under s 33A(2) of the MDA.
2       The Appellant was represented by Mr S K Kumar (“Mr Kumar”) when he pleaded guilty on 2 June 2015. He was sentenced to the mandatory minimum sentence of seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. At counsel’s request, the District Judge backdated the imprisonment sentence to 1 April 2014, which was the date of his first remand.
3       The Appellant subsequently filed a notice of appeal against his sentence. After hearing arguments from the Appellant and the Prosecution, I dismissed his appeal. For the purposes of this judgment, aside from explaining the reasons for my decision, I have also set out my views on s 384 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”), a provision which allows for the summary rejection of an appeal. I will discuss also how this provision could have applied to the present appeal, as well as similar appeals that may be filed in future.
Proceedings in the court below
4       I will first summarise the facts of the present case and what transpired in the court below.
Charges and the Statement of Facts
5       On 2 June 2015, the Appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of consuming morphine, a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA. In the charge sheet, it was indicated that before the commission of this offence, the Appellant had been convicted on 26 April 1999 in District Court 24 for a similar offence of consumption of morphine. For that earlier offence, by virtue of ss 8(
b
)(ii) and 33A(1) of the MDA, he was liable for a mandatory minimum enhanced long-term (“LT-1”) sentence. In the event, he was sentenced to five years and six months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane, which conviction and sentence have not been set aside. For the present charge, the Appellant was liable to an enhanced LT-2 punishment under s 33A(2) of the MDA. As indicated in the same charge sheet, this meant that the Appellant would be liable to a mandatory minimum sentence of seven years’ imprisonment with six strokes of the cane, up to a maximum sentence of 13 years’ imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane.
6       The exact circumstances of the Appellant’s offence are unremarkable. They were set out in a Statement of Facts (“SOF”) which he admitted to without qualification. In essence, the SOF showed that the Appellant was arrested on 24 March 2014 at about 4.10 p.m. on suspicion of having consumed a controlled drug. Thereafter, his urine samples were procured and they were then sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. The HSA analysts subsequently issued two certificates under s 16 of the MDA, which certified that the Appellant’s urine samples were found to contain morphine. Besides being a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA, morphine is a known metabolite of diamorphine. The Appellant also admitted that he had been consuming heroin (the street name for diamorphine) since November 2013. The presence of morphine in the Appellant’s urine samples was a result of his consumption of heroin.
7       The SOF also indicated that prior to the current offence, the Appellant had been convicted of an LT-1 charge in 1999 for consumption of morphine, and was sentenced to five years and six months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. Hence, for his latest LT-2 drug consumption offence, the Appellant was liable for enhanced punishment under s 33A(2) of the MDA. In addition to pleading guilty to the LT-2 charge, the Appellant also consented to having a similar LT-2 charge taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.
Antecedents, Mitigation and Prosecution’s position on sentence
8       Aside from the LT-1 conviction on 26 April 1999, the Appellant also had past convictions in 1986 for drug possession and in 1999 for failures to report for urine tests, as well as convictions for property offences. In addition, he was committed to a Drug Rehabilitation Centre (“DRC”) for drug consumption on three occasions in 1993, 1994, 1996, and placed under drug supervision for 24 months on four separate occasions.
9       In the court below, his counsel, Mr Kumar, had urged the court to impose the minimum sentence of seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane, and to backdate the imprisonment sentence to the date of the Accused’s first remand. In the mitigation plea, counsel highlighted that the Appellant was 47 years old and hence was still liable for caning.
10     The Prosecution did not object to the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence of seven years and six strokes of the cane, or for the imprisonment sentence to be backdated to the date of the Accused’s first remand.
The decision below
11     From the record of proceedings, the District Judge had reviewed the SOF, the Appellant's antecedents and his plea in mitigation, as well as the Prosecution’s position on sentencing. In his grounds of decision (published as 
Public Prosecutor v Mohd Fauzi bin Mohamed Mydin
 
[2015] SGDC 195
), the District Judge highlighted the following matters:
(a)     The Appellant was aware of, and had requested for, the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence. When the charge was read to the Appellant by the interpreter, the punishment provisions (on the charge sheet) were interpreted to him. In addition, pursuant to s 227(2)(
b
) of the CPC, counsel had confirmed that the Appellant understood the nature and consequences of his plea, and that he intended to admit the offence without qualification. In addition, the SOF set out the fact that because of the Appellant’s previous LT-1 conviction, he was liable for enhanced (LT-2) punishment under section 33A(2) of the MDA. Finally, counsel had specifically requested that the court impose the mandatory minimum sentence of seven years and six strokes, and had asked for the sentence to commence from 1 April 2014 (at [16]–[18]).
(b)     Aggravating features that could have justified a sentence higher than the mandatory minimum were present. The District Judge also noted several features in the Appellant’s case which could have warranted the imposition of a higher sentence, notably the fact that the Accused had consented to having another LT-2 drug consumption charge taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, the fact that his previous LT-1 consumption charge involved the same type of drugs (
ie
, morphine), as well as the Appellant’s numerous DRC admissions and drug supervision orders (at [21] and [23]–[24]).
(c)     While the District Judge opined that there were reasons to consider imposing a sentence above the mandatory minimum, he elected not to do so in the light of the Appellant’s plea of guilt, and the fact that the Prosecution had not objected to the request for the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence (at [26]–[28]). In his grounds of decision the District Judge noted that the sentence that he imposed was “
simply the minimum sentence that must be imposed by law
” (at [32]).
The Appeal
12     On 26 June 2015, the Appellant filed a notice of appeal against the mandatory minimum sentence imposed by the District Judge. In his petition of appeal filed on 23 July 2015, his ground of appeal was simply that the sentence imposed is “
manifestly excessive
”.
13     On 27 August 2015, the Appellant tendered skeletal arguments in support of his appeal. In his skeletal arguments, the Appellant, surprisingly, stated that “
I’m not appealling
 (
sic
) 
my LT-2 conviction
”. Instead, the Appellant indicated he was actually appealing against his earlier LT-1 conviction recorded on 26 April 1999. This was ostensibly because of the suggestion made by his counsel Mr Kumar, that the Appellant’s “
urine sample percentage
” was very low at the time, and that he was “
not eligable (sic) to be charge (sic) in court
” for the LT-1 charge as he was apparently informed by Mr Kumar that it was common practice then that such cases (with “
low percentage urine sample
”
)
 were not proceeded with in court. The Appellant also requested that the Prosecution provide the relevant documents relating to his earlier LT-1 conviction as those formed the crux of the Appellant's case.
14     In opposing the appeal, the Prosecution made the following arguments:
(a)     In his petition of appeal, the Appellant had merely stated that the sentence imposed is “
manifestly excessive
” without providing any further grounds. This failed to meet the requirement stipulated in s 378(2) of the CPC that sufficient particulars must be stated in a petition of appeal. Section 378(6) CPC further provides that an appellant shall not be permitted (without the leave of court) to rely on any ground of appeal other than those set out in the petition of appeal.
(b)     Moreover, in the light of the Appellant’s claim that his earlier LT-1 conviction was not made out, it “
thus appears that the Appellant's true intention is not to appeal against the sentence imposed for the LT2 charge (DAC-6807-2014), but instead to file an appeal out of time against the earlier LTI conviction (DAC-15020-1999) imposed by the court on 26
th
 April 1999
”
.
 The Prosecution argued that the Appellant had failed to satisfy the requirements set out in s 250 of the CPC then in force (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed), and in established case law, for leave to be granted to file an appeal out of time against the LT-1 conviction.
(c)     In addition, there was no basis for the Appellant to ask the High Court to exercise its revisionary powers to set aside his plea of guilt relating to the LT-1 conviction in 1999.
(d)     Furthermore, the Appellant had the opportunity to review his LT-1 conviction before he pleaded guilty on 2 June 2015 to the present LT-2 charge, as he was represented by Mr Kumar at the mention on that date. The District Judge had granted Mr Kumar a three-week adjournment to clarify matters pertaining to the proposed commencement date of the sentence, the validity of the Appellant's LT-1 charge, and also to prepare his mitigation plea. Moreover, before the Appellant’s actual plea of guilt was recorded, Mr Kumar had indicated that he had clarified matters with the Prosecution and confirmed that there was no issue with the Appellant’s previous conviction. He had also asked for the sentence to commence from the date that the Appellant was remanded, 
ie
, 1 April 2014.
(e)     Finally, as regards the punishment imposed for the current LT-2 charge, the mandatory minimum sentence is a punishment prescribed by the Legislature. As such, there is simply no basis for the court to impose a lower sentence in respect of this charge.
My decision
15     Notwithstanding that it was stated in the Appellant’s Petition of Appeal that he was appealing against the sentence imposed for his present LT-2 charge, when the Appellant appeared before me, he repeated his claim that his lawyer had told him to appeal against his 1999 (LT-1) conviction. The Appellant’s statement in court echoed the position that he had taken in his skeletal arguments that his quarrel was actually not with the present LT-2 conviction, but with the earlier LT-1 conviction instead.
16     I begin by turning to s 375 of the CPC, which provides that an accused person who has pleaded guilty has only a limited right of appeal. The section reads:
 
Limited right of appeal against plea of guilty
 
 
375.
 An accused who has pleaded guilty and has been convicted on that plea in accordance with this Code 
may appeal only against the extent or legality of the sentence
. [emphasis added]
17     I was unable to see how the present appeal fell within these parameters. The Appellant could not raise any issues about the length, nature or validity of his punishment (
ie
, “
the extent or legality of the sentence
”) for the present LT-2 charge. And indeed he did not do so since there was evidently nothing inherently objectionable or defective in relation to the extent or legality of his sentence on the face of the record; he had pleaded guilty voluntarily on the advice of counsel, proper procedural safeguards had been observed, and he had been sentenced to the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by law for the offence. The legality of the sentence could not be impugned; this was not a case where an unlawful sentence (
eg
, exceeding the District Court’s jurisdiction or the statutorily-prescribed maximum punishment) had been passed.
18     On a plain reading of s 375 of the CPC, given the background set out above, the Appellant had 
prima facie
 failed to establish that he had a right of appeal against the sentence. His appeal would have failed 
in limine.
 He was in effect attempting to use the appeal proceedings as a back-door to challenge his prior LT-1 conviction. But the appeal before me was one against the sentence for his LT-2 conviction and not against the validity of his prior LT-1 conviction. The validity of the LT-1 conviction could not be a subject matter of his appeal against his sentence for the LT-2 charge.
19     I agreed with the Prosecution that there was no basis for me to allow the Appellant to file an appeal out of time against the LT-1 conviction, in the light of his inordinate delay in pursuing an appeal against that conviction recorded in 1999, his lack of explanation for the delay, as well as the dismal prospects of success for such an appeal. I saw no cogent basis to exercise my revisionary power in his favour, whether in respect of his LT-1 conviction or the LT-2 conviction.
20     Further, it must also be said that whatever misgivings the Appellant may now harbour against his prior LT-1 conviction, no such misgivings were surfaced when he pleaded guilty to his LT-2 charge in the court below. Both he and his lawyer, Mr Kumar, had accepted the validity of his previous LT-1 conviction at that time. Yet, the Appellant now claims that it is the same lawyer who has urged him to appeal against his LT-1 conviction and if so this would appear 
prima facie
 to be an abuse of the court’s process.
Summary rejection of appeal: Section 384 CPC
21     This appeal was dealt with in the conventional way with a full hearing before me before I dismissed the appeal. However, I am of the view that this appeal could also have been disposed of in a more efficient but no less effective manner through a summary rejection of the appeal as provided for under s 384 of the CPC. I will now set out my views about the applicability of this provision.
Section 384 CPC
22     The provision reads:
 
Summary rejection of appeal
 
 
384.
—(1) Where the grounds of appeal do not raise any question of law and it appears to the appellate court that the evidence is sufficient to support the conviction and that there is no material in the circumstances of the case which could raise a reasonable doubt whether the conviction was right or lead the appellate court to consider that the sentence ought to be reduced, the appeal may, without being set down for hearing, be summarily rejected by an order under the hand of a Judge or a presiding Judge, as the case may be, certifying that the appellate court, having perused the record, is satisfied that the appeal has been brought without any sufficient ground of complaint.
(2) Where an appellate court comprises more than one Judge, the decision of the appellate court to reject the appeal summarily under subsection (1) can only be made by a unanimous decision of all the Judges or Judges of Appeal.
(3) Notice of the rejection must be served on the appellant.
(4) If, in any case rejected under subsection (1), the appellant gives, within 14 days of service of notice of the rejection on him, notice to the Registrar of the Supreme Court of an application for leave to amend his grounds of appeal so as to raise a question of law, accompanied by a certificate signed by an advocate specifying the question to be raised and undertaking to argue it, the Chief Justice (in the case where the appeal is made to the Court of Appeal) or any High Court Judge (in the case where the appeal is made to the High Court) may grant leave to amend the grounds of appeal accordingly and shall restore the appeal for hearing.
(5) For the purposes of subsection (4), the question whether a sentence ought to be reduced shall be deemed not to be a question of law.
23     The above provision was adapted from s 52 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed). In essence, after the preparation and/or filing of the notice of appeal, the record of proceedings, the grounds of decision and the petition of appeal in accordance with ss 377 and 378 of the CPC, s 384(1) of the CPC provides that the appeal can be summarily rejected, without being set down for hearing, if:
(a)     The grounds of appeal do not raise any question of law;
(b)     It appears to the appellate court that the evidence is sufficient to support the conviction; and
(c)     There is no material in the circumstances of the case which could raise a reasonable doubt whether the conviction was right or lead the appellate court to consider that the sentence ought to be reduced.
24     I would add that if the above conditions for the court to summarily reject the appeal are present, the appellant would invariably fail in his appeal even if the appeal proceeds for hearing. Thus, a summary rejection of such an appeal would clearly save not only judicial time, but also the resources of both the prosecution and the defence. Should the court summarily reject the appeal, s 384(4) of the CPC allows the appellant to seek leave to amend his grounds of appeal (in the petition) to include an appropriate question of law and have the hearing restored if leave is granted.
25     For completeness, it should be noted that for the purposes of the s 384(4) application, the question whether a sentence ought to be reduced shall be deemed not to be a question of law: see s 384(5) of the CPC.
Section 384 of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973
26     For purposes of comparison, s 384 of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (“the Indian CPC”) also provides for summary dismissal of appeals. The provision reads:
384. Summary dismissal of appeal.
(1) If upon examining the petition of appeal and copy of the judgment received under section 382 or section 383, the Appellate Court considers that there is no sufficient ground for interfering, it may dismiss the appeal summarily:
Provided that-
(a) no appeal presented under section 382 shall be dismissed unless the appellant or his pleader has had a reasonable opportunity of being heard in support of the same;
(b) no appeal presented under section 383 shall be dismissed except after giving the appellant a reasonable opportunity of being heard in support of the same, unless the Appellate Court considers that the appeal is frivolous or that the production of the accused in custody before the Court would involve such inconvenience as would be disproportionate in the circumstances of the case;
(c) no appeal presented under section 383 shall be dismissed summarily until the period allowed for preferring such appeal has expired.
(2) Before dismissing an appeal under this section, the Court may call for the record of the case.
(3) Where the Appellate Court dismissing an appeal under this section is a Court of Session or of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, it shall record its reasons for doing so.
(4) Where an appeal presented under section 383 has been dismissed summarily under this section and the Appellate Court finds that another petition of appeal duly presented under section 382 on behalf of the same appellant has not been considered by it, that Court may, notwithstanding anything contained in section 393, if satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of justice so to do, hear and dispose of such appeal in accordance with law.
27     In 
Ratanlal and Dhirajlal
’s 
The Code of Criminal Procedure
 (LexisNexis, 20th Ed, 2011), at p 846, the learned authors elaborated on how this provision of the Indian CPC has been interpreted and applied by their courts. Amongst other things, they stated that:
(a)     The word “summarily” means “in an informal manner and without the delay of formal proceeding”.
(b)     In rejecting the appeal under this section, the appellate court is not bound to give any reasons for the dismissal.
(c)     An appeal can be summarily dismissed if no arguable point is raised on behalf of the appellant. But if the appeal raises arguable and substantial points, the High Court should give reasons for dismissing the appeal summarily.
The s 384 CPC procedure applied to the present case
28     In the present case, it is clear from the record of proceedings that the sentence imposed by the District Judge was the minimum sentence that he was required by law to impose. The record also shows that the Appellant’s plea of guilt was validly recorded in accordance with the procedures set out in ss 227 and 228 of the CPC. In particular, they showed that the Appellant had been advised by his lawyer on the nature and consequences of his plea, in accordance with s 227(
b
) of the CPC, before his plea of guilt was recorded. He did not in any event suggest that he had misunderstood the nature and consequences of his plea or that his plea was qualified.
29     Thus, from the record of proceedings, as well as the grounds of decision of the District Judge and the Petition of Appeal by the Appellant, the three conditions for summary rejection of the appeal were satisfied, namely that they showed that:
(a)     The grounds of appeal do not raise any question of law;
(b)     It appears that the evidence is sufficient to support the conviction; and
(c)     There is no material in the circumstances of the case which could raise a reasonable doubt whether the conviction was right or lead the appellate court to consider that the sentence ought to be reduced.
30     Pursuant to s 384(1) of the CPC, and consonant with the practice in India (albeit under a differently worded provision), this case would have warranted a summary rejection of the appeal, without the necessity of written submissions from parties or a full hearing. In line with s 384(3) of the CPC and the practice adopted in India under the Indian CPC, a notice of rejection could have been issued before the matter was set down for hearing.
31     If an appellant should feel aggrieved by a summary rejection of the appeal, he can apply to restore his appeal for hearing, if he is able to comply with the conditions set out in s 384(4) of the CPC. But where the appellant’s real complaint is simply that the sentence is 
“manifestly excessive”
, being the sole ground of appeal set out in his Petition of Appeal in the instant case, there is no basis for the appeal to be restored, since it is explicitly stated in s 384(5) CPC that “
the question of whether a sentence ought to be reduced shall be deemed not to be a question of law
” and he cannot expect any reduction in his sentence in any case.
Conclusion
32     An appellate court is in no position to interfere with a mandatory minimum sentence lawfully imposed pursuant to a voluntary and unqualified plea of guilt – at any rate, it cannot be said to be a “manifestly excessive” sentence which might warrant reduction. Moreover, s 375 CPC expressly limits the right of appeal in cases involving guilty pleas, and it may be useful to consider whether clearer legislative provision ought to be made to preclude the filing of such appeals. If there is any quarrel with the legality or validity of the 
conviction
, that is a separate matter which can be appropriately addressed through other means. The proper course is not to file an appeal against sentence but a criminal revision setting out grounds for invoking the court’s revisionary jurisdiction to set aside the conviction.
33     Within the present legislative framework, it is evident from s 384 of the CPC that our criminal procedure rules do not contemplate encumbering the appellate courts with hearing of appeals against sentence where accused persons have been sentenced to mandatory minimum sentences after they have pleaded guilty. Hence where the conditions set out in s 384(1) CPC are satisfied, and where a perusal of the record demonstrates that the procedural safeguards set out in the CPC have been observed, I am of the view that the courts can and should consider summary rejection of such appeals in future. Employing the s 384(1) CPC procedure will ensure that the courts continue to strike an appropriate balance between safeguarding the rights of accused persons and ensuring that cases continue to be effectively dealt with without unnecessarily taxing valuable public resources and scarce judicial time.",2015-12-07 00:00:00,SG High Court

 – 
Whether custodial sentence warranted
3 November 2015
 See Kee Oon JC:
1       The material facts of this case are straightforward. The then 23-year-old appellant had rented a Ferrari 360 Modena F1 sports car (“the car”) from Ace Drive Car Rental for under a week. It carried the vehicle licence plate number SKD2284H. He chose to affix another vehicle’s licence plate number SQ1H onto the car instead, using 3M double-sided tape.
2       On 19 March 2013, the appellant was stopped at random by an enforcement officer from the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) while driving the car and investigations subsequently revealed that he had exhibited a false licence plate. The licence plate SQ1H belonged to another car, a Mercedes Benz E200. The appellant had picked it out from a website of “special” car plate numbers and he did not know the owner of the car.
3       The appellant was thus charged under s 129(2)(
d
) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), an offence punishable under s 129(2)(iii) of the Act. For convenient reference, I reproduce the relevant provision of the Act:
 
False statements, forging of licences, etc.
 
 
129.
—(2) If any person –
…
(
d
)    exhibits upon any vehicle or trailer any licence or identification mark, plate or document which has been forged, altered, defaced, mutilated or added to or any colourable imitation of a licence, mark, plate or document which is required under this Act to be carried on a vehicle or trailer; …
he shall, unless he establishes to the satisfaction of the court that he acted without intent to deceive, be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to be punished …
…
(iii) … with a fine not exceeding $5,000 or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or with both.
4       The appellant elected to plead guilty to the charge and he was sentenced by the court below to two weeks’ imprisonment. The District Judge in her grounds of decision (published as 
Public Prosecutor v Chong Jiajun Eugene
 
[2015] SGDC 142
) emphasised that a custodial sentence was necessary to deter such offences, citing the difficulty in detecting them and the heavy burden on the resources of enforcement agencies, as well as the potential inconvenience and harm that might be caused to other road users. She further noted that the appellant had given two different explanations for why he had decided to affix the false licence plate on the car.
5       Upon hearing the submissions of the respective parties on appeal, I allowed the appeal and set aside the sentence of imprisonment and substituted it with a fine of $5,000, in default two weeks’ imprisonment. I now set out my grounds for my decision.
The appellant’s contentions
6       On appeal, counsel for the appellant accepted that deception is inherent in such offences, and agreed that the District Judge was not wrong to have regard to the “not inconsiderable” potential harm that might be caused should traffic or other violations occur. Nevertheless, he submitted that an aggravating feature must exist to warrant a custodial term. This might take the form of evidence of some other circumstance or particular act or acts of deception, such as a collateral purpose in using the false licence plate, 
eg
, to evade Electronic Road Pricing (“ERP”) charges (as was the case in 
Public Prosecutor v Tan Wei Jin
 
[2010] SGDC 216
 (“
Tan Wei Jin
”)). Even then the High Court had found in dealing with the appeal in 
Public Prosecutor v Chua Chee Hou
 
[2012] SGDC 89
 (“
Chua Chee Hou
”) (Magistrate’s Appeal No 61 of 2012) that a fine would suffice on the facts, where the appellant affixed a false licence plate on the car in question so that he could reuse a season parking ticket and avoid payment of parking charges.
7       The key plank of counsel’s submission was that there was no discernible dishonesty or deception equivalent to that demonstrated in the cases cited before the District Judge. The appellant’s motive should have been accorded due consideration in determining the appropriate sentence, given that there was no evidence of any violation of other laws. The car was rented for less than a week, and all the appellant wanted to do was to “feel rich” in the car, and “look good” posing for a photo shoot with the false licence plate number SQ1H, which was a “golden number”. There was no other sinister motive and no basis to assume that he had some other nefarious or unlawful aims in mind. It was thus submitted that the District Judge had erred in summarily dismissing his reasons.
The prosecution’s submissions
8       In response to the appellant’s submission, the Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) countered that public policy considerations would require a deterrent sentence for such offences. Sentencing precedents show that the starting point would be a custodial sentence. There was potential harm in each offence, and innocent parties might be affected and resources would need to be expended to trace the actual offender if there were to be any traffic violations involving the car.
9       The DPP submitted that the very act of fixing a false number plate by itself involved deception. In response to the court’s query, the DPP clarified that the offence in question was detected at random and there was no evidence of any traffic or other violations committed by the appellant. Nonetheless, the DPP took issue with the appellant’s stated motives and submitted that his explanations of preparing for a photo shoot and wanting to “feel rich” by driving the car with the false licence plate were not consistent and thus did not merit consideration.
10     The DPP further submitted that offenders could easily come up with unsubstantiated justifications. Such offences were also very difficult to detect. She suggested that the appropriate sentence should be pegged to 
Tan Wei Jin
. In that case, the appellant chose to withdraw his appeal against a two-week jail term, and had offered an unsubstantiated motive for affixing the false licence plate, ostensibly to follow his father whom he suspected of having an affair. The District Judge in 
Tan Wei Jin
 had also agreed that there was evidence of premeditation to evade detection including for non-payment of the ERP charges.
11     As for 
Chua Chee Hou
, the DPP highlighted that he was caught evading parking charges by reusing a season parking ticket issued for another vehicle, and affixing the licence plate for that vehicle to the car in question. No grounds of judgment were issued by the High Court in allowing the appeal and substituting the jail term with a fine of $3,000. The DPP suggested that the High Court might have been influenced by the fact that the appellant was not driving on the road with the car, as the car was brought to the appellant’s workshop for long-term repairs.
My decision
The mischief targeted by the provision
12     What is the true mischief targeted by s 129(2)(
d
) of the Act in relation to such offending conduct involving affixing another licence plate number to a vehicle? As a starting point, there must of course be “intent to deceive” since s 129(2) states that if it can be shown to the court’s satisfaction that there was no such intent, no offence would be disclosed. The pivotal enquiry relates to the purpose for which this deception was being practised. In my view, this enquiry leads to the logical conclusion that the mischief of the provision would be to deal with cases where licence plates are fraudulently switched or attached in order to facilitate the commission of some other offence. The use of another licence plate is plainly motivated in such circumstances by the desire to avoid detection and thwart enforcement or investigation efforts. There was however no evidence whatsoever of any such motive in the present case.
13     I accept that deception is inherent in the offence, and such offences are indeed difficult to detect. I also agree entirely with the District Judge that there is “not inconsiderable” potential harm that might result. An obvious example will be if the driver is involved in some other traffic violation or a serious road accident. It may mean that innocent third parties become inconvenienced by the resulting investigations. They could be seriously prejudiced since third-party insurance claims could be frustrated, and the driver may well not even be insured. Moreover, enforcement actions, if any, can be hampered or slowed down by further checks and verification that would be required to ascertain the actual licence plate number. These are all relevant considerations. But there was once again plainly no evidence of any actual harm or inconvenience in the present case. More importantly, there was no evidence put forth of any intent to cause such potential harm or inconvenience.
The relevance of motive and the prosecution’s submission on sentence
14     I turn next to the different explanations the appellant appeared to have put forward before the District Judge for his conduct. She was not impressed by his explanations, which she found to be both “puzzling” and “unsubstantiated”, although it is not clear if she had rejected both explanations outright. Nevertheless even if his motives could be said to be inconsistent (and I do not necessarily agree they are), I did not think this would by itself tip the scales towards a custodial term when his motives appear to be quite innocent.
15     There was no basis in my view to conclude that these must be unsubstantiated and hence 
prima facie
 unacceptable motives when the prosecution had adduced no evidence to contradict his explanations. They appeared to be plausible reasons for such conduct. From his explanations, he acknowledged that he was an attention-seeking young man, whose age belies his immaturity and fatuousness. He was simply intent on showing off, driven by the desire to “feel rich” behind the wheel of a flashy rented sports car. He wanted to be seen in (or with) the car with a “golden number” rather than the uninspiring “plain vanilla” number that came with the car itself. That is not palpably inconsistent with the explanation he first gave to the District Judge that he rented the car to pose with it at a photo shoot that he was helping his friend with. They may be separate and even unrelated reasons. Some may even form the view that they are frivolous reasons, but they were not necessarily inconsistent or inherently incredible explanations.
16     With respect, the District Judge may have placed undue reliance on his differing reasons, almost as if his inability to keep to a consistent explanation had aggravated the offence. In any event, his explanations themselves were clearly not aggravating factors, despite a thinly-veiled attempt by the Prosecuting Officer to suggest this in the written submission tendered before the District Judge seeking a custodial sentence. At paragraph five of the prosecution’s submission on sentence marked as ‘P1’, it was contended that “[s]uch circumstances are further aggravated by the fact that the defendant, for such triviality as to “look good” for his photoshoot, by replacing the number plates with the forged ones, also avoidance [
sic
] in a form of receiving the parking summons, ERP detection or other road related offences”. I did not see the relevance of the perceived “triviality” of his stated reason – it may have been trivial or frivolous, but this was by itself no reason to suggest it was therefore patently and objectively unbelievable and had somehow made his offence more aggravated. As for the possible avoidance of detection, I reiterate that there was no evidence of any such motives in the present case.
17     It was also inappropriate for the prosecution to maintain that matters were “compounded” and enforcement officers would be further “inconvenienced”. With respect, this appears to overstate the position. These considerations had no application at all to the facts in the present case. There was certainly no evidence of such inconvenience in terms of detection in the present case. He was not caught for some other offence for which he was attempting to avoid detection; the facts show that the offence was detected at random when he was stopped by a LTA officer.
Calibration of the sentence
18      
Chua Chee Hou
 illustrates why the mischief targeted by the provision should be carefully examined to determine whether the factual scenario at hand falls squarely within it. Although there were no written grounds of judgment issued, it would appear that the offender’s primary motive was to “reuse” the season parking label which was issued for use on another car. He could perhaps still have driven the car in question although it was undergoing repairs. At any rate there was no evidence that the car would not or could not be driven. But nonetheless the High Court’s decision to set aside the imprisonment term and substitute it with a fine would demonstrate that even with a motive to avoid incurring additional season parking charges for the car, his culpability fell within the lower end of the spectrum. A high fine would thus be an adequate deterrent punishment.
19     In the present case, the offence was planned and premeditated. But it seems to me that every such offence of this nature would necessarily be so. As such, this is not an additional aggravating feature. It is implicit in the offence itself – I cannot see how someone could have chosen to affix a false number plate without conscious planning and deliberation. There was no evidence that the appellant had planned for long-term use of the number plate. After all, it was a rented car which he would use for less than a week.
20     More critically, there was no evidence of any other unlawful intent, 
eg
, avoidance of parking summons or parking charges, ERP or road-related offences. There was no other violation. There was, for instance, no evidence that he did not insert a cashcard into his in-vehicle unit or that he did not display parking coupons or that he did not provide the actual car number after being involved in a car accident. There was no evidence that he was not insured. I reiterate that he was simply stopped at random by an LTA enforcement officer. It would therefore not be appropriate to overstate the potential harm that might be occasioned in such circumstances, although I would readily accept that this is a relevant consideration even if it is necessarily also a somewhat speculative one.
21     It was of course entirely possible that in actual fact the appellant may have had various other reasons for affixing the licence plate number SQ1H onto the car. He was by his own admission a young man seeking to show off driving a rented sports car. It would not be implausible that he might have wanted to avoid detection should he be caught speeding or spotted driving recklessly or participating in an illegal road race. But to ascribe such a motive to him would be wholly speculative and unfair to him when no such evidence was before the court.
22     It would in fact be very likely that, in other cases, false number plates are affixed in order to facilitate the commission of other offences. I would emphasise that a custodial term is still warranted in such cases. Imprisonment of two weeks upwards should be expected even if they may be relatively minor offences such as evasion of ERP, and I would venture to suggest that a longer term in the range of four weeks would be appropriate where there is non-payment of road tax and/or insurance. There will also be aggravated offences for which more substantial sentences of imprisonment would be warranted, such as where false number plates are used on stolen cars or to facilitate the commission of more serious offences like drug trafficking, robbery, immigration or customs offences, to name just a few. In such cases, the intent to evade detection is manifestly clear and the starting point for the sentencing court would be to consider a sentence of three months’ imprisonment upwards.
23     I make one final brief observation: the prosecution included among its sentencing authorities a newspaper article from August 2010 reporting the case of 
Tan Wei Jin
. Newspaper reports are widely referred to by the general public as sources of news and information but they are hearsay and generally not reliable sources for the court to rely on.
Conclusion
24     I was of the view that a custodial sentence would not be warranted given the circumstances under which the offence was committed. In line with the High Court’s decision in 
Chua Chee Hou
, the maximum fine would be adequate punishment on the facts of this case. In my opinion, while a custodial sentence would ordinarily still be warranted, the factual circumstances in both cases were not such that they plainly fell within the mischief envisaged by the relevant provision of the Act. I therefore allowed the appeal and substituted the imprisonment term of two weeks with a fine of $5,000, in default two weeks’ imprisonment.",2015-11-03 00:00:00,SG High Court

 Kan Ting Chiu SJ:
Introduction
1       This is a joint trial of two accused persons (“the Accused Persons”), Muhammad bin Abdullah (“the 1st Accused”) and Yu Ching Thai (“the 2nd Accused”), for the offence of drug trafficking under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). The charge against the 1st Accused was that he
on the 24
th
 day of May 2012 at or about 7.15 p.m., at the third floor corridor near the lift lobby of Block 707 Woodlands Ave 4, Singapore, did traffic in a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Ed) (“MDA”), to wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking, four (04) packets containing 915.60 grams of granular/powdery substance which were analysed and found to contain not less than 19.84 grams of diamorphine, without authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(
a
) read with section 5(2) of the MDA and punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA, and further, upon your conviction under section 5(1)(
a
) read with section 5(2) of the MDA, you may alternatively be liable to be punished under section 33B of the MDA.
The 2nd Accused was charged that he
on the 24
th
 day of May 2012 at or about 6.17 pm, at the carpark of Block 315 Woodlands Street 31, Singapore, did traffic in a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA, to wit, by giving four (04) packets containing 915.60 grams of granular/powdery substance which were analysed and found to contain not less than 19.84 Grams of diamorphine, to one Muhammed bin Abdullah (NRIC: [xxx]), without authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(
a
) of the MDA punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA, and further, upon your conviction under section 5(1)(
a
) of the MDA, you may alternatively be liable to be punished under section 33B of the MDA.
The Arrests
2       The Accused Persons were arrested by officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau (“the CNB”) who were conducting an operation with respect to a suspected drug transaction. The officers observed a car bearing registration number SGQ 9129 K (“the car”) in the carpark between Blocks 316 and 317 Woodlands Street 31 (“the carpark”) with the 1st Accused in the driver’s seat. A motorcycle bearing registration number JNP 3997 (“the motorcycle”) subsequently arrived at the carpark and stopped near the car. The 2nd Accused dismounted from the motorcycle and entered the car. The 1st Accused then drove the car out of the carpark. A few minutes later, the 1st Accused drove the car back to the carpark. The 2nd Accused came out of the car and returned to the motorcycle, while the 1st Accused drove the car out of the carpark again. The 2nd Accused was arrested by the CNB officers before he could leave the carpark. A stack of cash amounting to S$9,800 was seized from him.
3       Other officers in the operation gave chase to the car, but lost sight of it. Subsequently, the car was found abandoned at the junction of Woodlands Avenue 4 and Avenue 7 where it had collided with a taxi. Although he ran off from the car, the 1st Accused did not evade arrest for long. He was spotted by CNB officers at the third floor common corridor of Block 707 Woodlands Avenue 4. The officers saw him throw a white plastic bag over the parapet wall of the corridor when they moved in to arrest him. The 1st Accused was arrested and a white plastic bag was recovered from the ground floor of the block as well as a red and black sling bag which was in a drain.
[note: 1]
4       The white plastic bag
[note: 2]
 held a purple plastic bag.
[note: 3]
 The purple bag in turn held four packets each wrapped in newspaper
[note: 4]
 (these packets were at times referred to as bundles). After the four packets were unwrapped, each packet was found to contain granular/powdery substance wrapped in clear plastic.
[note: 5]
 The four packets were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) where the granular/powdery substance contained in each packet was weighed and underwent qualitative and quantitative analysis. The results of the analysis were as follows:
 
 
Packet
 
 
 
 
Weight of granular/powdery substance

229.5 grams
 
 
5.73 grams
 
In total, the four packets contained 915.60 grams of granular/powdery substance which were found to contain not less than 19.84 grams of diamorphine.
5       The red and black sling bag
[note: 6]
 (which was also referred to as a pouch) was found to contain, 
inter alia
, a red foil packet which in turn held three small packets of granular/powdery substance which were also sent to HSA where they were weighed and analysed. The weight of the granular/powdery substance was 22.91 grams, and the diamorphine content weighed 0.70 grams.
[note: 7]
6       The drugs in the sling bag were not included in the charges against the Accused Persons. The 1st Accused admitted that the sling bag and its contents belonged to him, and that he had thrown it down the block together with the white plastic bag.
The 1st Accused’s statements
7       Following his arrest, and the recovery of the white plastic bag and the sling bag, the 1st Accused was questioned by Senior Station Inspector Tony Ng Tze Chiang (“SSI Ng”) at about 7.30pm while they were still at Block 707 Woodlands Avenue 4. SSI Ng showed him the white plastic bag, questioned him and recorded the questions and answers in his pocketbook:
[note: 8]
Q:
Do you understand English?
A:
Yes.
Q:
What was inside the bag?
A:
Peh Hoon.
Q:
Where did you throw this white plastic bag?
A:
From this block 707, third floor.
Q:
Where did you take this plastic bag that you say is “Peh Hoon” from and from where?
A:
A Malaysian Chinese at the carpark of somewhere near polyclinic Blk 317 Woodland.
Q:
How many heroin is inside this plastic bag that you throw and you say you collected from the Malaysian Chinese?
A:
4 pounds are inside this plastic bag.
8       Later on in the evening, SSI Ng recorded a signed statement from the 1st Accused:

Ans
Actually, the money that I pay for this plastic of heroin goes to a male Indian but not him and he only pass this plastic of heroin to me.
9       On 28 May 2012, four days after his arrest, a cautioned statement was recorded from the 1st Accused in answer to a charge of trafficking in 914.78 grams of diamorphine (the gross weight before analysis). His statement was:
I admit to all the drugs that were found at that Blk 707 and I admit to all charges. I plead for leniency for the mistake.
10     The cautioned statement was followed up by a series of investigation statements which began on 29 May 2012, the day after the recording of the cautioned statement. I shall set out the parts of the statements which presented the background to the 1st Accused’s involvement in drug trafficking and consumption, and the circumstances in which he was arrested. In his statement recorded on 29 May 2012 at 2.45pm, he revealed that:
4    I started as a middleman, meaning that when my drug customers look for me to buy drugs, I would act as the middleman and go and get the drug supply from my supplier. I would then in turn sell the drugs to my customers. This was because I did not have capital of my own. I only sell Heroin. I would sell in sets. One set is 10 packets of Heroin of about 8 grams each. My cost price for one set of Heroin is about $1100 and I would sell them at $1400. As time goes by, I accumulated my own capital. About one month ago, I then contacted my Malaysian friends to get Heroin directly from them. I started with one pound of Heroin. The drugs would be brought in by a Malaysian. One pound of Heroin would cost me $4900. I would usually break half a pound into smaller portions for sales in sets and sell the other half pound directly to one of my customers. I have been doing this about once every two or three days for the past month. I would only order two pounds of Heroin at most each time. From the two pounds of Heroin, I can earn a profit of about one thousand plus.
5    My wife is aware that I am on the run and she has always been encouraging me to go surrender myself. However, I would always tell her that I would do so when I think the time is ripe. I do not smoke Heroin in front of my wife and my family. I usually smoke Heroin outside at places such as hotels, friends’ houses or secluded areas. My wife is not aware of my drug activities except that I have a pending case and that I am also on the run. Last Thursday which was the 24.05.2012, I was at my Tampines home the whole day. The address is Blk 299B Tampines St 22 on the 10th floor but I cannot remember the unit number now. I left house at around 4 plus in the afternoon. I also told my wife to follow me along. My actual intention was to collect some money back from my runners and also to wait for my order of two pounds of Heroin to come in. I did not tell my wife anything about all these. I did not manage to collect any money from my runners yet as the Malaysian “horse” arrived earlier than expected. “Horse” is the term used for the person who delivers the drugs. My wife told me that she wanted to go somewhere on that day but I cannot remember now where she wanted to go. I intended to send her to wherever she wanted to go after I am done with the drugs.
6    I made order for these two pounds of Heroin one day before the day I was arrested. I called a Malaysian Indian called “Makel” to place order for two pounds of Heroin. He then told me that I can collect the two pounds of Heroin in the following day. On Thursday (24.05.2012), the “horse” called me at around 4 plus 5 in the evening. The “horse” that I am referring to is “Ah Meng” “Makel” told me that the name of this person is “Ah Meng”. “Ah Meng” was also arrested together with me. “Ah Meng” told me over the phone that he has finished work already and told me to go down to Woodlands Blk 300 something near the polyclinic where he will pass me the Heroin. If I remember correctly, I have met up with “Ah Meng” about three times previously to collect Heroin. On previous occasions, “Ah Meng” delivered to me only one pound of Heroin. I remember so because it was only recently that I started to order two pounds of Heroin. Other than “Ah Meng”, there were other horses of “Makel” whom I have met before to collect drugs from them. They are mostly of the Indian race who came in motorbikes.
7    On the day that I was arrested, I remember that I reached the arranged transaction place at about 5 pm plus. I just told my wife that I need to go somewhere and follow me along for a while. When I reached there “Ah Meng” was already there. Usually I would get out of the car to collect Heroin from him, but this time round, I asked him to come into my car instead, reason being that I saw one car which had two people seated in it nearby my car and I sensed that they could be CNB officers. I preferred not to get out of my car so I signalled “Ah Meng” to come into my car. I felt safer this way. “Ah Meng” came in and sat at the back passenger seat. After “Ah Meng” was in my car, I drove one round out of the carpark and back into the carpark again. Along the way, I took over the drugs from “Ah Meng” and I also passed him $9800 for these two pounds of Heroin. Usually, the money for the drugs would not be handed over to the horse directly except for this time round. I would think that it is because “Makel” trust “Ah Meng” enough for him to collect the money on his behalf. The usual practice is to hand over the money for payment for the drugs to somebody else. I heard from “Makel” that there were past cases whereby the horses ran away with the money. When I reached back at the carpark after one round I saw the car which I suspected to be CNB officers right behind me. I immediately confirmed that they are CNB officers. I quickly told “Ah Meng” to leave but I did not tell him that I suspected there are CNB officers around.
8    I drove out of the carpark immediately and speed up. My wife asked me why I was driving so fast and I told her to keep quiet. She did not ask further. I tried to drive as fast as possible to brush off the car following me. At Woodlands Ave 7, I checked again and realized that there seemed to be no one following me anymore. I could not stop in time for a red light ahead and I collided into a taxi. I then left the car and told my wife to run somewhere else. I told her to go to my uncle’s house at Blk 986 Buangkok Crescent somewhere on the 4
th
 and 5
th
 floor which I cannot remember exactly now. My wife has been there with me a few times before. The reason why I ask her to go there is because my uncle is my closest relative to me and she would be able to get help from him as I know that this time round if I am arrested, I may go into Prison for a very long time. My uncle’s name is “Saiful” but I do not know his full name. As I was running away, I called my wife and I told her to take care.
9    I brought along with me the two pounds of Heroin together with a black colour pouch and my sling bag. I ran towards Blk 707 Woodlands and went up to the third floor. I changed into a shirt that I took from outside a house which was left to dry and I threw away the original shirt which I was wearing also on the same floor. I then saw the CNB officers coming towards me and I threw down the plastic bag containing the two pounds of Heroin and the black pouch from the third floor. I was then placed under arrest by the CNB officers shortly after.
On 30 May he added that:
11    After I was arrested, I was brought down to the first floor of the block. The officers asked me whether I threw down the plastic bag and I admitted that I had thrown the plastic down from the third floor. An officer then recorded a statement from me in a notebook and I told that the plastic bag and the stuff inside belong to me and I also admitted that the contents are Heroin. I told him that there are four packets inside the plastic bag. I was escorted to a carpark where my car was parked. The officers conducted a search on the car but nothing else was found. Next I was escorted to Woodlands Checkpoint where my car was checked by the Police dog and was also subjected to x-ray scan as informed by the officers.
…
14    I am shown a photograph showing a white plastic bag with marking A1 and a purple plastic bag with marking A1A. The white plastic bag belongs to me and I had placed it on the floorboard in front of me when I drove the car. The purple plastic bag with marking A1A was the one that “Ah Meng” passed to me. This white plastic bag contained a black pouch in it as well. I am shown a black and red colour pouch with marking A2 and I can recognise it as the pouch that I had put inside the white plastic bag with marking A1. After I took over the purple plastic bag from “Ah Meng”, I put it inside the white plastic bag together with the black and red colour pouch.
15    After taking over the purple plastic bag from “Ah Meng”, I did not open up the bag to take a look at the contents inside. I felt the contents physically and could tell that there were four packets inside and I put it straight into the white plastic bag. I am shown a photograph showing four newspaper bundles with markings A1A1A, A1A1B, A1A1C and A1A1D. I can identify them as the four packets that were taken out from the purple plastic bag during the photography. These four packets are Heroin which I had ordered from “Makel” I had ordered from “Makel” two “stones” of Heroin, which stands for two pounds of Heroin. I am shown a photograph with four packets of brown granular substances with markings A1A1A1, A1A1B1, A1A1C1 and A1A1D1. The newspapers were unwrapped in my presence and these are the four packets of Heroin and were wrapped beneath the newspapers. I did not write the alphabet “C” on them. I do not know what does it stands for.
16    I am shown a photo of a red packet with marking A2A and three packets of brown granular substances with marking A2A1. These were found from the black and red colour pouch with marking A2. The three packets of brown granular substances are Heroin which I had repacked into packets of 7.8 grams each. They are meant for my own consumption but if close friends ask from me I would sell at about $100 per packet. If nobody ask from me, I will smoke them on my own.
11     The 1st Accused’s use of the terms ‘packets’ and ‘pounds’ needs to be clarified. He referred to the four half-pound packets wrapped in newspaper recovered from the white plastic bag as ‘packets’. These four half-pound packets made up the two pounds of heroin that he had ordered. He would divide a half-pound packet into smaller packets for the purpose of consumption and sale. His use of the the terms “packets” and “pounds” were not references to measurements of weight, but were the units by which the heroin was ordered and sold. The 1st Accused confirmed that a small packet weighed about 7.5 grams
[note: 11]
 and his counsel and the prosecution put the weight of a small packet at 7.5 grams in their submissions as well.
[note: 12]
 For the avoidance of confusion, the half-pound newspaper-wrapped packets will be referred to as ‘packets’ and the smaller 7.5 grams packets will be referred to as ‘small packets’.
The 1st Accused’s defence
12     The 1st Accused admitted that he had been buying heroin from a Malaysian Indian known to him as ‘Makel’ who resided in Johore, and that the heroin would be delivered to him in Singapore by the 2nd Accused. He agreed with the prosecution that between 9 May 2012 and 24 May 2012, the 2nd Accused had made four deliveries of heroin to him
[note: 13]
 and that the deliveries were for two, three, four and four packets successively.
[note: 14]
13     He admitted that he had trafficked diamorphine, but not in the amount stated in the charge. This was because one of the four packets he received was meant for his personal consumption. On that basis, his defence was that the 5.73 grams weight of the heaviest packet (
ie
, packet 4) should be deducted from the total weight of 19.84 grams of the four packets, leaving 14.11 grams. The effect of the reduction was that he would not face the death penalty on conviction.
14     Unfortunately, the 1st Accused was inconsistent about the amount of heroin he consumed. In his investigation statement of 31 May 2012, he said “I smoke about one packet of Heroin each day”
[note: 15]
 and when he was interviewed by psychiatrist Dr Winslow Rasaiah Munidasa on 3 February 2014, he told Dr Winslow the same thing. However, when he was interviewed by psychiatrist Dr Ung Eng Khean on 20 January 2015 and 5 March 2015 in the presence of his counsel, he stated that he consumed “between three quarters to two packet [
sic
] of heroin daily (average of one packet a day)”.
[note: 16]
 During the trial, he said 30 small packets would last him for “1 week plus to 2 weeks”.
[note: 17]
 That worked out to 4.3 packets a day for a one-week period and 2.1 packets a day for a two-week period.
15     Similarly, the 1st Accused’s account as to the amount of heroin that he would keep for his own consumption was inconsistent. In his investigation statement of 31 May 2012, he stated that:
28    … Normally, I will keep ten packets of Heroin with me and I will not sell them. The reason is because there may be times whereby Heroin supply does not come into Singapore from my supplier. I would need these ten packets for my own consumption.
29    For those two pounds of Heroin that I am arrested with, I already have orders placed with me for one and a half pound of heroin. The remaining half pound is for my own consumption which I will pack into smaller packs and keep with me. …
The 1st Accused confirmed during the trial that half a pound of heroin could be divided into 30 small packets.
[note: 18]
 The 1st Accused also clarified that that was the first time he had intended to keep 30 small packets for his own consumption, although he had kept 20 small packets previously.
[note: 19]
16     However, in the psychiatric report prepared by Dr Winslow, it was recorded that 1st Accused had “always kept about ~5 packets as a reserve for his own consumption which he carried with him all the time”.
[note: 20]
 This was not denied by the 1st Accused.
17     The prosecution did not dispute that the 1st Accused consumed heroin, and accepted that he would have kept some of it for his own consumption, but it disputed his claim that he would have kept one of the four packets for his own consumption. It argued that he had not proved that he had the financial means to keep 30 small packets for himself, that he had the physical means to store 30 small packets, that it was his practice to keep 30 small packets for himself, or that there was a need for him to keep 30 small packets.
[note: 21]
 It took the position that he would have kept no more than ten small packets, or one-third of a packet, for his own consumption. By its calculation, ten small packets would contain 1.91 grams of diamorphine (on the basis that a packet contained 5.73 grams of diamorphine), and deducting that from the total of 19.84 grams, he was trafficking 17.93 grams of diamorphine.
[note: 22]
 In those circumstances, the prosecution ought to amend the charge to reflect that, but that was not done.
Review of the 1st Accused’s defence
18     The essential question before the court was how much of the 19.84 grams of diamorphine which the 1st Accused collected from the 2nd Accused was intended to be kept for his own consumption?
19     It is evident that the 1st Accused was unable to maintain a consistent position (see above at [14]–[16]). He told Dr Winslow that he had always kept about five small packets for his own consumption. He stated in his investigation statement that he normally kept ten small packets for his consumption, but with the four packets he was arrested for, he would have re-packed and kept 30 small packets for himself, something he had not done before. It should be borne in mind that he was referring to heroin to be kept 
for his personal consumption
. There was no suggestion that his heroin appetite was given to sharp fluctuations. If his practice was to always keep five packets for that purpose (as he told Dr Winslow) or that he normally kept 10 packets (based on his investigation statement of 31 May), there would be no cause for him to keep 30 small packets out of the four packets he was arrested for unless he intended to go on an unbridled binge. By his own admission, his sole source of income was from the re-sale of the heroin. Why would he disappoint his customers and deprive himself of the profits by holding on to so much stock? It is also pertinent that the 2nd Accused had given evidence that in the third delivery, about one week before 24 May 2012, he had delivered four packets to the 1st Accused. This was not disputed by the 1st Accused. However, on 24 May 2012, the 1st Accused only had three small packets left in his sling bag where he stored his heroin reserve.
[note: 23]
 There was no reason for him to keep so much more from the fourth delivery as compared to the third delivery. His professed anxiety over getting supplies was unfounded – the evidence was that he had regular and liberal supplies from Makel from whom he received four deliveries of a total of 13 packets between 9 or 10 May 2012 and 24 May 2012. I found his claim that he intended to keep 30 small packets unworthy of belief, and that he was more likely to keep five or ten small packets. I was prepared to give him the benefit and accept the higher figure of ten small packets.
20     I found that the prosecution and the 1st Accused were incorrect in the way they worked out the amount of diamorphine that was intended for trafficking (
ie
, after deducting the diamorphine reserved for his own use). Both of them used a packet as a unit for the calculation, and they took the weight of a packet to be 5.73 grams – the weight of the heaviest packet. However, there was no basis for that as the 1st Accused had not seen the four packets when he was arrested, and was never in a position to choose the one to keep. Since no selection had been made, there was no reason to use the weight of the heaviest packet in the computation. There was another basis to work out the figure without resorting to arbitrariness. There was agreement on the weight of one small packet, and the total weight of the four packets was known. The question was simply whether ten or 30 small packets were intended to be kept for personal use. Since that had been determined to be ten small packets, the amount of diamorphine he was trafficking could be derived by deducting the diamorphine content of ten small packets (which can be worked out) from the diamorphine content of the four packages (which is known).
21     I amended the charge to take out the ten small packets intended for self-consumption. The quantity of diamorphine which he trafficked was calculated as follows –
(a)     Total weight of drugs in the 4 packets received – 915.6 grams
(b)     Total weight of drugs in 10 small packets – (10 x 7.5 grams) – 75 grams
(c)     Weight of drugs for trafficking – (a - b) – 840.6 grams
(d)     Diamorphine content in 915.6 gm of drugs – 19.84 grams
(e)     Diamorphine content in 840.6 grams of drugs --
(c) ÷ (a) x (d), or
840.6 grams ÷ 915.6 grams x 19.84 grams = 18.21 grams
The amended charge read:
You, Muhammed bin Abdullah on the 24
th
 day of May 2012 at about 7.15 pm, at the third floor corridor near the lift lobby of Block 707 Woodlands Drive 40, Singapore, did traffic in a Class A controlled drug listed in the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), to wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking 840.6 grams of granular/powdery substance containing not less than 18.21 grams of diamorphine, without authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(a) read with section 33(1) of the MDA, and further, upon your conviction under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the MDA, you may alternatively be liable to be punished under section 33B of the MDA.
I note that there was a typographical error in the amended charge – “Woodlands Drive 40” should read “Woodlands Drive 4”.
22     The 1st Accused claimed trial to the amended charged. The 1st Accused, the prosecutor and the 2nd Accused declined to recall any witness for further examination.
23     After calling for written submissions and giving them careful consideration, I found the 1st Accused guilty on the amended charge and convicted him. The prosecutor submitted that he was not a courier whose involvement was restricted to the activities set out in s 33B(2)(
a
) of the MDA, and when his counsel accepted that, I imposed the death penalty on the 1st Accused.
The 2nd Accused’s statements
24     The 2nd Accused made a cautioned statement on 28 May 2012 in response to a charge of trafficking in 914.78 grams of diamorphine on 24 May 2012. The statement read:
I did not know that there were so much things. I knew that they were drugs but I did not know that it was death penalty. If I knew it was death penalty, I would not have done it.
25     He also made investigation statements, the first of which was recorded on 29 May 2012. In that statement he revealed that he resided in Johor Bahru and commuted to Singapore daily on his motorcycle for work in installing aluminium window grills, and that he consumed heroin. I set out the relevant extracts from his statement:
5    I have been getting my Heroin supply from one “Ah Zhor” in Johor Bahru for the past four years plus. He is my main Heroin supplier. I would only get from other suppliers if “Ah Zhor” runs out of stock. “Ah Zhor” also sells Heroin at a cheaper price. For example, “Ah Zhor” sells a packet of about 6.5 grams of Heroin at RM$240 while other suppliers would charge about RM$260 or RM$270 for the same amount of Heroin. “Ah Zhor” is an Indian man who is around my age. I do not know where he stays. Usually “Ah Zhor” does not come personally to sell drugs to me. His runners would come to sell the drugs to me. I only seen “Ah Zhor” face-to-face more often in the past and I rarely see him face to face these days. I also know his runners well as I am their regular customer.
6    About two weeks ago, I asked one of Ah Zhor’s runners whether there is any drug-related job that I can do in Singapore. With this, I am referring to whether I can do the job of delivering drugs for them to people in Singapore. I think that it is risky for me to smuggle drugs into Singapore due to the immigration checks. I know that “Ah Zhor” does send drugs Singapore and I am thinking whether I can earn extra money if I can help them to deliver drugs inland in Singapore, which I think is less risky. I needed extra money because I am heavily addicted to Heroin and I needed money for my Heroin supply. I was also thinking that I can save up a sum of money which would allow me to take a long leave and go back Malaysia to quit the drug habit. The S$2000 income I earn every month is not enough to cover my drug expenses. Ah Zhor’s runner then told me that he will ask Ah Zhor and get back to me. A few days later, this runner gave me a call and asked me the typical timings that I arrive in Singapore. I then told him that I would usually report to my Boss at Blk 429 Woodlands at about 6.30am every morning. The runner then told me that if there is a drug delivery job to do, “Ah Zhor” will call me.
7    A few days later at night, “Ah Zhor” called me when I was back in Johor Bahru to tell me that there is drug delivery job for me to do. He asked me where would be convenient for me to meet the person who would pass me the drugs. I told him at the car park around Blk 428 and 429 Woodlands St 41 as I need to report to my Boss there for work. He told me ok and that on the following day, someone would meet me at the car park near Blk 428 and 429 Woodlands St 41 to pass drugs to me. I told him to arrange the meet up at 6.00am. “Ah Zhor” knows my motorbike number as he has seen it before. The following day when I reach the car park, there was a male Indian there and I took over a plastic bag containing two bundles of Heroin wrapped in newspaper.
In a further statement recorded on 30 May 2012 he added:
9    After I took over the two bundles of Heroin inside the plastic bag from the Indian man, I kept the plastic bag in the basket (Recorder’s note: The accused refers to a storage compartment at the front of his bike) at the front of my motorbike which was parked at the carpark at Blk 428 and 429 Woodlands. I knew that the bundles contain Heroin because “Ah Zhor” had told me so. I then left for work with my Boss. Around evening time after I knock off from work, I made arrangement with the person whom I am supposed to hand over the Heroin to. “Ah Zhor” has already informed me previously the number of this person so I just called him directly. I arranged to meet him at the 4
th
 storey of the muti-storey car park and to pass the Heroin to him. The person who came is a male Malay. I do not know his name, but he address me as “Ah Meng” as he had asked for my name earlier in the phone conversation. That was the first time I pass drugs to him. This male Malay is the same person who was arrested together with me. I am shown a photo of a male Malay (Recorder’s note: The accused is shown a photo of one Muhammad Bin Abdullah, NRIC: [xxx]) and I can positively identify him as the person whom I have handed over Heroin to.
10.    Other than the first time, I also passed Heroin to this male Malay on two other occasions. I remember for the first time I passed heroin to this male Malay, it was two bundles of Heroin. For the second time, it was three bundles of Heroin and for the third time, it was four bundles of Heroin. For the fourth time, which is also the time when I am arrested, there were also four bundles of Heroin. I remember that for the second, third and fourth time that I met this male Malay, I had arranged it at the Blk 315 Woodlands carpark. “Ah Zhor” and I agreed on a payment of RM$500 per bundle of Heroin. “Ah Zhor” did not tell me the weight of each bundle of Heroin. “Ah Zhor” also told me that he would not let me do something that would let me face the death penalty. “Ah Zhor” mentioned that at most I would go into prison for about 6 or 7 years if I am caught. After I handed over the Heroin to the male Malay, I would also collect money from him for the payment of the Heroin which I would go back to Johor Bahru to give to “Ah Zhor”. If I could not get “Ah Zhor” I would contact his runners and hand over the money to them instead. It is also during the time when I meet up with “Ah Zhor” or his runners that I would be paid for the job done.
11    On last Wednesday (23.05.2012) around 8pm plus, I was at my room in Johor Bahru when “Ah Zhor” called. “Ah Zhor” told me that there is a job for me to do the following day. “Ah Zhor” told me that there will be four bundles of Heroin and I would be paid RM$2000. The person to hand it over to is also the same male Malay. “Ah Zhor” also told me to collect S$9800 from the male Malay as payment for the Heroin. The time and place to collect the Heroin is the same, which is at the carpark of Blk 428 and 429 Woodlands at about 6am. On that morning, I left Johor Bahru at around 4 plus in the morning and after clearing the immigration, I went to the coffeeshop at Blk 305 Woodlands to smoke Heroin in the toilet first. After I was done with smoking Heroin, I headed to the multi-storey car park near Blk 428 Woodlands and reached there at about 6am. A male Indian handed over to me a plastic bag which contained the 4 bundles of Heroin. I did not open up the plastic bag to check the contents but I knew that there are four bundles inside based on physically feeling the contents in the plastic bag. I then kept the plastic bag containing the four bundles of Heroin at the basket in front of my motorbike. I then reported to my Boss and left for work as usual. I knocked off on that day at about 4pm. I then made a call to the male Malay and told him that I had knocked off from work and I could pass him the Heroin. The place to meet is the same at Blk 315 Woodlands. The male Malay told me that he may be late and he would call me when he arrived. Since I have some time left before meeting with the male Malay, I went to Kranji to look for a fellow Malaysian friend who works at a factory but he had already left and I just hanged around to wait for the call from the male Malay.
12    At around 6pm, the male Malay called and told me that he has already reached the car park at Blk 315 Woodlands. I told him to wait for me as I needed some time to get to there from Kranji. The male Malay drives a car but I cannot remember the exact model of the car now. I looked around the carpark and managed to identify the male Malay who was inside the car. I went into his car and sat at the back passenger seat and handed over the plastic bag containing the four bundles of Heroin to him. I remembered that the male Malay drove one round around the car park. He also handed me S$9800 as payment for the four bundles of Heroin. While in the car, I counted the money to ensure that the total amount is correct. I remember that there was also a female Malay who was seated at the front passenger seat at that time. She was playing with a laptop. She did not talk at all and I do not know who she is. She could be the wife or girlfriend of the male Malay.
13    After ensuring that the sum of $9800 is correct. I got out of the car and walked back towards my motorbike which was parked nearby. The male Malay also left in his car. Shortly after, a few men came towards me and handcuffed me. At that moment I realized that I had been arrested by law enforcement officers. They conducted a search on me and found the $9800 in my jean pocket and I also told them I have one straw of Heroin in my wallet. I told them that the straw of Heroin is meant for me to smoke on my own. One of the officers then recorded a statement from me. I was then escorted to Woodlands Checkpoint where the Police brought a dog to check my motorbike. A vehicle also came in to check my motorbike and I was told that it was scanning of my motorbike.
In his statement of 31 May 2012, he explained how the drugs were kept and transported:
18    After I took over the purple plastic bag which contained the four bundles of Heroin from the Indian man, I placed it in the basket that is attached to the front of my motorbike. I then used a rain coat to cover the purple plastic bag to conceal it. I then put my motorbike helmet on top of the rain coat. The basket has no cover and as such it cannot be locked. I am not afraid that the Heroin would be stolen or go missing because nobody knows about it and I do not think anyone would take the items away. On previous occasions, I have forgotten to take out the motorbike key and left it on the bike after parking it and left for work. I had not met with any issues of theft of my motorbike or missing items from the motorbike while I am in Singapore. On previous three occasions, I also put the Heroin in the basket in front of my motorbike as well.
19    To ensure that the contents in the plastic bag are still intact, I would check by opening up the plastic bag to see before I hand it over to the recipient. For this time round, I opened up the purple plastic bag to check the contents inside it once I reached back at my motorbike which was parked at deck 4A of the multi-storey carpark at Blk 428 and 429 Woodlands. I opened up the plastic bag and saw that there were still four newspaper bundles inside and I knew that all the four bundles of Heroin were still there.
The 2nd Accused’s defence
26     The 2nd Accused did not deny that he was trafficking diamorphine. His defence to the charge against him was that he did not know that the quantity of diamorphine he trafficked would attract the death penalty, and he did not intend to traffic that quantity of diamorphine.
[note: 24]
27     When he made his defence during the trial, he admitted that he had not been truthful about the manner in which he delivered heroin to the 1st Accused. He admitted that the practice was that he would receive the packets of heroin in Johore and conceal them in his motorcycle. He would then bring the heroin packets into Singapore and deliver them to the 1st Accused. He had lied that the packets were delivered to him in Woodlands because after he was arrested, he was told that he could face the death penalty. He added that sometime in late April 2012, two weeks before his arrest, he had asked ‘Ah Zhor’ about bringing drugs into Singapore.
[note: 25]
 Subsequently they met, and Ah Zhor handed to him two bundles and told him that he would be paid RM$500 for delivering each packet. Ah Zhor also told him that the penalty for delivering them would not be the death penalty, but eight to ten years imprisonment.
[note: 26]
 He trusted Ah Zhor and made the first delivery of two packets on 9 or 10 May 2012. He did not know at that time whether trafficking was punishable by death in Singapore
[note: 27]
 (he only came to know about it on 28 May 2012 when his cautioned statement was recorded).
28     The second delivery involved three packets which were handed to him by Ah Zhor’s runner. The second delivery took place four to five days after the first delivery. Four packets were delivered on the third delivery about a week before the fourth delivery on 24 May 2012 when he was arrested.
[note: 28]
 All the deliveries were made to the 1st Accused. The packets delivered in the first three deliveries were similar to the packets seized from the fourth delivery. He did not examine or weigh any of the packets he delivered. Under cross-examination he agreed with the prosecutor that there was no real agreement between him and Ah Zhor that he would only be required to deliver amounts of heroin which did not attract the death penalty.
[note: 29]
 With respect to the fourth delivery, Ah Zhor called him on 23 May 2012 and told him that the delivery was to be made to the recipient of the third delivery. The four packets were handed to him in the purple plastic bag and he provided the white plastic bag that was seized.
29     During his examination-in-chief, his counsel referred him to para 10 of his investigation statement of 30 May 2012 where it stated that Ah Zhor told him that at most he would go to prison for six or seven years if he was caught, rather than the eight to ten years he had mentioned in court. He explained that there was this discrepancy because he had given the wrong information during the recording of the statement.
[note: 30]
 However, when it was pointed out that it had been put to the recording officer ASP Eugene Tan that the 2nd Accused had actually said eight to ten years imprisonment,
[note: 31]
 the 2nd Accused admitted that he could not recall whether he had given the wrong information or he was misunderstood.
[note: 32]
Review of the 2nd Accused’s defence
30     The 2nd Accused’s twofold defence was detailed in his closing submissions at para 10:
10.1  He did not know that the quantity of the diamorphine which he had in fact trafficked would attract the death penalty in Singapore. If he had known, he would not have done so and therefore could not have intended to traffic the quantity of diamorphine that he was charged with
10.2  Further and/or in the alternative, even if the Court finds that [he] knew that the penalty for trafficking morphine above a certain amount is death, [he] had only intended to traffic a non-capital amount of diamorphine (even though he did not know the exact weight that would attract capital punishment). Hence, he did not know, or could not have reasonably suspected, any excess diamorphine which he was in fact carrying at the time of his arrest.
31     The 2nd Accused had made it very clear that he did not know about the death penalty when he delivered the heroin to the 1st Accused. His counsel had asked him:
[note: 33]
Q
…You were aware at that time there is a punishment of death penalty in Singapore for drug trafficking and trafficking in heroin without authorisation. Correct?
A
I did not know.
Counsel appeared to be taken by surprise and asked again:
Q
No, Mr Yu, listen to my question carefully. Did know [
sic
] there was a punishment of death penalty in Singapore in 2012? That do you know of this in 2012?
A
I did not know.
Counsel then asked a third time:
Q
You did not know in Singapore that if you are caught for drug trafficking, you can actually in some situation be in s---be liable to suffer a death penalty?
A
I did not know.
The prosecutor also went through this with him in cross-examination:
[note: 34]
Q
Okay, so up to the 24th of May 2012, Mr Yu, you confirm that you did not know importing or trafficking in heroin could carry the death penalty?
A
Yes.
32     He made his position clear beyond doubt that he did not know about the death penalty until he was informed about it on 28 May 2012 when his cautioned statement was recorded. Ah Zhor’s assurance, that if he was caught he would not face the death penalty but would be imprisoned, must be taken in the context that it was made in relation to the first delivery of two packets on 9 or 10 May 2012. The 2nd Accused did not ask Ah Zhor if the assurance applied to deliveries of greater numbers of packets.
33     The conclusion to be drawn was that when he delivered the four packets on 24 May 2012, he simply did not know that drug trafficking is punishable with death. He was not mistaken or misled into thinking that the death penalty did not apply – he simply did not know about the death penalty. Since he did not know about the death penalty, the quantity of diamorphine would be of no significance to him because he believed that he would not be punished with death regardless of the amount of diamorphine he delivered. That disposed of the first limb of his defence.
34     The alternate line of defence was raised against the contingency that the court found that the 2nd Accused knew about the death penalty. On the evidence referred to at [31] above, there was no basis for finding that he only intended to traffic a non-capital amount of diamorphine. The simple truth was that he did not say that he knew about the death penalty and thought that it would not apply. In all his evidence, he had not said that he was told by Ah Zhor that delivering four packets would not set off the death penalty. He had not done anything to ensure that he was ‘safe’ with four packets. This militated against his argument that his intention was to only traffic an amount of drugs which fell below the critical threshold.
35     In the circumstances, I found the 2nd Accused guilty on the charge he faced and convicted him thereon. On the issue of sentencing, the prosecution accepted that he was a courier, but the Public Prosecutor was not issuing a certificate under s 33B(2)(
b
) of the MDA because he had not rendered substantive assistance to the CNB. His counsel accepted that decision. In the circumstances, I imposed the death penalty on the 2nd Accused.

Judgment reserved.
 Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the court):
1       This appeal raises the question as to who was responsible for a motor accident involving Gajentheran Marimuthu (“Gajentheran”), who was riding a motorcycle and T Johaselvan (“Johaselvan”), who was driving a lorry and, if it was Johaselvan who was responsible, whether there was contributory negligence on the part of Gajentheran. Gajentheran is the plaintiff in the action and the first respondent in this appeal. Johaselvan is the second defendant in the action and his employer, the first defendant. The first and the second defendants are the appellants in this appeal.
2       As a result of the accident, Gajentheran was seriously injured. The collision took place between 5.10pm and 5.20pm on 1 February 2013 at the junction of Tuas West Road and Tuas Link 4. Gajentheran was riding his motorcycle along Tuas West Road in the direction of Tuas Checkpoint. Following behind him, on a second motorcycle, was Mohd Rosli Wadi bin Mat Nor (“Rosli”), and a pillion rider, Mohd Daud bin Mat Nor (“Daud”). And following behind them, on a third motorcycle, was Mohd Paqmi bin Md Arifin (“Paqmi”). Paqmi and Rosli were joined as third parties in the action and are, respectively, the second and third respondents in this appeal. We should mention that all the three motor-cyclists and the pillion rider were, at the time, colleagues working for the same employer.
3       When the motor-cyclists were about to proceed into the junction, the lorry driven by Johaselvan made a right turn into Tuas Link 4 from the opposite direction. The lorry cut into the path of the motor-cyclists. Gajentheran, riding on the first motorcycle, collided with the middle part of the left side of the lorry and skidded underneath the lorry. Rosli and Daud, riding on the second motorcycle, collided with the front part (also on the left side) of the lorry.
[note: 1]
 Paqmi, riding on the third motorcycle, claimed to have swerved right and thus avoided the lorry entirely. The trial judge accepted Paqmi’s evidence. However, the appellants maintain that Paqmi collided with the lorry as well. We will return to this dispute later.
4       In any event, all three motor-cyclists and the pillion rider sustained injuries and damages to their motorcycles. Four actions were instituted by them – these proceedings, which concern only the claims of Gajentheran, and three other proceedings in the State Courts which concern the claims of Rosli, Daud and Paqmi. Notwithstanding these separate actions, the parties have appropriately agreed to be bound by the findings of fact made in these proceedings.
[note: 2]
5       It is common ground that there are three straight-going lanes on Tuas West Road in the direction the motor-cyclists were travelling. Nearer to the junction itself, there is an additional lane for vehicles which wish to turn right. For convenience, we shall refer to the lanes, counting from the left side of the road (taking bearing from the direction the motor-cyclists were travelling) as lanes 1, 2 and 3. The turning lane will be referred to as lane 4. It is also common ground that at the relevant time, traffic was heavy. According to Gajentheran, Rosli, Paqmi and Daud, there was a traffic jam on lanes 2 and 3.
[note: 3]
6       The circumstances giving rise to the accident is disputed. The main dispute is on the question of in whose favour the traffic lights were at the material time. Johaselvan says that he made the right turn when the green turning arrow of the traffic lights lit up in his favour and the lights were red against traffic going straight in both directions. He says that the vehicles at lanes 1, 2 and 3 on the opposite side had already stopped and were not proceeding into the junction. Thus he made the turn. He says that Gajentheran and the other two motor-cyclists beat the red traffic lights which were against them when they crossed into the junction. However, Gajentheran, Rosli and Paqmi give a different story; they say that the traffic lights were still green in their favour. They accept that Johaselvan also faced green traffic lights, which meant that he could make a right turn across the junction if it was safe to do so.
7       So the first issue we have to determine is whether the green arrow for turning was in fact lit up in favour of Johaselvan when he made the right turn. The trial judge found against Johaselvan. But counsel for the appellants sought to argue that as the vehicles from the opposite side had come to a halt at the stop line, that necessarily suggested that the red lights had appeared and that the green arrow had also appeared allowing Johaselvan to make the right turn. She emphasised, in particular, that there is no yellow box at the junction so motorists were not required to stop before the junction even if there was a jam ahead. She said it was unlikely that motorists would be so considerate as not to proceed into the junction on their own volition so as not to block it.
8       The other evidence relevant to this dispute is: (a) Johaselvan’s affidavit evidence that he sighted “a few other motor cycles which rode past the front and rear of the lorry” after he alighted from the lorry following Gajentheran’s motorcycle’s collision with the lorry,
[note: 4]
 (b) Johaselvan’s admission during his cross-examination that the traffic lights were green “for the motorcyclists” at the point of collision;
[note: 5]
 and (c) Johaselvan’s retraction of that admission and his further explanation during re-examination that the traffic lights merely “changed to green” after the collision.
[note: 6]
 In their written submissions, the appellants acknowledge that the presence of oncoming traffic would mean that the traffic lights were green for the motor-cyclists, but argue that the traffic lights had changed from red to green between the time of the accident and Johaselvan’s observation of the oncoming traffic.
[note: 7]
 The appellants rely on Johaselvan’s statement during re-examination that the traffic lights “changed to green”, which they say is the “truthful statement”.
[note: 8]
 The respondents reject this argument. Counsel for Rosli and Paqmi point out that at least 25s must have elapsed from the point when the steady green arrow appeared to the moment when the traffic lights changed to green for the vehicles coming from the same direction as the motor-cyclists. Essentially, the counterargument is that the accident could not have occurred when the green turning arrow lit up because Johaselvan would not have taken 25s to make the right turn, apply the emergency brakes, check the left wing mirror, and pull up the handbrake before making the crucial observation of the oncoming traffic as he walked to the right rear of the lorry.
[note: 9]
9       In our view, this contention is at best speculative as there is hardly any objective evidence to indicate whether 25s would have passed while these events took place. Estimates as to time of this nature can be most unreliable.
10     But what remains unexplained is Johaselvan’s admission at one point of the cross-examination that the traffic lights were green “for the motorcyclists”. That line of cross-examination began with a reading of a Johaselvan’s affidavit. Johaselvan’s attention was drawn to his own evidence that a few other motorcycles rode past the front and the rear of the lorry to avoid it. Johaselvan then agreed with counsel for Rosli and Paqmi that 
at the point of collision and in the seconds after the collision, the lights were showing green
.
[note: 10]
 To our minds, this is cogent evidence of the traffic lights at the material time.
11     As earlier mentioned, the appellants’ explanation for that condition is that the traffic lights were already red against the motor-cyclists and those vehicles coming from the same direction. Thus they stopped. In support of this claim, they point to the evidence from the three motor-cyclists and Daud that vehicles on the lanes to their right (
ie
, lanes 2 and 3) had stopped.
[note: 11]
 The other explanation, advanced by the respondents, is that there was a build-up of traffic or a “traffic jam at the front”
[note: 12]
 which discouraged vehicles from entering into the junction, even though there is no yellow box at the junction to prohibit vehicles from remaining stationary within the junction. Both explanations are possible. But when the evidence of the vehicles having stopped is weighed together with Johaselvan’s momentary admission that the traffic lights were green “for the motorcyclists” as well as the improbability of the three motor-cyclists beating the red lights sequentially, we think that the respondents’ explanation is likelier. On a balance of probabilities, we find that the traffic lights were green when the three motor-cyclists proceeded into the junction. In any event, we do not find that the weight of the evidence is so compelling as to require us to hold that the finding of the trial judge was necessarily wrong.
12     The second point of dispute is whether the three motor-cyclists were riding on the road shoulder or on lane 1. This issue is closely intertwined with the aftermath of the accident, which we will now briefly describe. The final resting position of the lorry was just immediately before the pedestrian crossing at Tuas Link 4; the front wheels of the lorry were just inches away from the dotted pedestrian crossing line.
[note: 13]
 From the measurements taken of the lorry and the junction,
[note: 14]
 and the images of the junction,
[note: 15]
 we have observed that the front of the lorry was in line with the grass verge and the back of it was in line with the road shoulder. No part of the lorry protruded into the area in front of lane 1.
13     The appellants advance the argument that the final resting position of the lorry and the two spots on the left side of the lorry, where Gajentheran’s and Rosli’s motorcycles collided with it, indicate where both of them were travelling from before their respective collisions with the lorry. They rely on Johaselvan’s evidence that the latter “immediately stopped”
[note: 16]
 upon feeling an impact on the left side of the lorry. Since the lorry stopped in front of the road shoulder, and no part of the lorry protruded into the area in front of lane 1, they say that all the three motor-cyclists must have been riding along the road shoulder before Gajentheran and Rosli collided with the lorry.
14     We find this argument to be improbable in relation to Gajentheran. There would have been a time lapse between experiencing the impact and the lorry actually stopping. The normal reaction time for surprised drivers is between 1.41s and 1.84s.
[note: 17]
 Johaselvan was a surprised driver. On Johaselvan’s own account, he did not see the traffic on his left as he made the right turn.
[note: 18]
 He reacted to stop only when he felt a collision. At a speed of 10km/h to 15 km/h, the expert, Dr Shane Richardson (“Dr Richardson”), stated that the distance travelled during the reaction time would have been 3.9m to 7.7m. He also stated that upon applying the emergency brakes, the lorry could have travelled a further distance of 0.8m to 1.8m before coming to a complete halt. In total, the point of the collision is probably 4.5m to 9.4m away from the rest position.
[note: 19]
 That seems correct to us.
15     The significance of Dr Richardson’s report is that it explains how the lorry could have been in front of lane 1 when Gajentheran collided with it. It supports Gajentheran’s case that he came into the junction from lane 1 and collided with the lorry that was in front of lane 1.
16     Although the photographs of the site of the accident show a concentration of debris in front of the grass verge and the road shoulder, this does not weaken our inference that Gajentheran’s collision occurred while the lorry was still in the position in front of lane 1. First, it is common ground that there were at least two collisions. Assuming that the debris resulted from a collision, there is no evidence that the debris came from Gajentheran’s motorcycle. Second, after the accident, the traffic from Tuas West Road (
ie
, from the same direction as the motorcyclists) continued to move ahead despite the accident. The same photographs show vehicles proceeding across the junction from lane 1. These photographs were taken sometime after the accident – between the time of the arrival of the first ambulance and the second ambulance.
[note: 20]
 Any debris in front of lane 1 caused by Gajentheran’s collision with the lorry would undoubtedly have been disturbed by the incessant moving traffic. What debris that remained on the road after a while would have little probative value in determining the spot at which Gajentheran’s motorcycle collided with the lorry.
17     A corollary of our finding that Gajentheran’s collision occurred in front of lane 1 is that he and his motorcycle must have been dragged forward by the momentum of the lorry to its final resting position. We recognise the lack of evidence, such as blood streaks or gorge marks, to show that Gajentheran and his motorcycle were so dragged. However, the alternative would be to hold that Gajentheran and his motorcycle were not dragged at all because the lorry came to an instantaneous stop. In our view, that could not have been the case because it would mean that there was no need for any reaction time, which is physically impossible.
18     As for Rosli and Paqmi, their positions are different. We find that they were riding on their motorcycle on the road shoulder just before Rosli’s collision or Paqmi’s swerve to the right. We rely on Rosli’s oral evidence that his motorcycle hit the front part of the lorry.
[note: 21]
 As we have mentioned earlier, when the lorry came to a complete halt, the front of the lorry was in line with the grass verge. We also rely on the fact that the lorry was likely to be close to its final resting position by the time of Rosli’s collision. Very shortly after Gajentheran’s motorcycle collided with the lorry, Johaselvan applied emergency brakes. This could be just before or after Rosli’s collision with the lorry. But, once the emergency brakes were applied, the evidence from Dr Richardson establishes that the lorry would have moved only minimally.
19     Taking all these circumstances into account, we find that the part of the lorry which Rosli collided with was in line with the road shoulder. Consequently, Rosli could not have been riding on lane 1; if he was riding on lane 1, he would not have collided with the lorry; this is because the lorry would not have been in his way.
20     The same position applies to the third motor-cyclist, Paqmi. By the time Paqmi entered into the junction, the lorry would have been even closer to its final resting position, if it had not already stopped. Therefore, if Paqmi was riding on lane 1, the lorry would not have been in his way and he need not have swerved right to avoid colliding with the lorry. The trial judge found that he had so swerved. The damage to his motorcycle is slight.
[note: 22]
 That is consistent with his claim that the damage was sustained from a fall onto the road. Accordingly, we find that Paqmi was also riding on the road shoulder immediately before he entered the road junction and therefore had to swerve right to avoid a collision with the lorry.
21     The third point of dispute concerns the possible aggravation of Gajentheran’s injuries by Rosli and Paqmi. The appellants argue that Rosli and Paqmi should be responsible for some of Gajentheran’s injuries because they were caused by the further impacts from Rosli’s and Paqmi’s collisions with the lorry. The scope of this argument is necessarily constrained by our earlier findings. Paqmi must be immediately ruled out as having caused any aggravation of Gajentheran’s injuries since he did not collide with the lorry.
22     This leaves Rosli to be considered. Johaselvan presents an account of how he saw that one of the wheels of Rosli’s motorcycle hit Gajentheran’s midriff as a result of Rosli’s collision with the lorry. Johaselvan also says that the wheel of Rosli’s motorcycle was pushed further underneath the lorry and on top of Gajentheran by the impact from Paqmi’s motorcycle.
[note: 23]
 However, we have difficulties with this account. First, Paqmi did not collide with the lorry. Second, Rosli could not have collided with Gajentheran who was underneath the lorry, if the position of Gajentheran was near the letters “CO” of the phrase “JOO YONG CO., (PTE) LTD” painted on the side of the lorry carriage,
[note: 24]
 and the point of Rosli’s collision with the lorry was to the left of the first letter “J”.
[note: 25]
 Third, Johaselvan did not see Rosli’s collision. This must be pitted against Rosli’s evidence that his motorcycle hit neither Gajentheran nor Gajentheran’s motorcycle.
[note: 26]
 In the circumstances, given the irreconcilable testimonial evidence and the limited physical evidence available, it is far too speculative for us to hold that Rosli aggravated Gajentheran’s injuries.
23     We now turn to the second main issue – the question of contributory negligence on the part of Gajentheran. We find that he, as well as Rosli and Paqmi, were travelling at an excessive speed. The undisputed fact is that traffic was heavy at the time of the accident. Even though the three motor-cyclists were travelling within the speed limit, they were not travelling at a safe speed in the given conditions. Gajentheran’s own evidence is that he was riding at 80 km/h. Rosli and Paqmi said their speed then was 60km/h to 70km/h.
[note: 27]
 We think it more likely than not that they were travelling at 70 km/h, trying to keep up with Gajentheran who was riding at 80 km/h. They were obviously anxious to get to their homes in Johor as soon as possible.
24     Speeding is specifically pleaded by the appellants. We find in favour of the appellants that the three motor-cyclists were negligent in approaching the junction in a heavy traffic situation at that kind of speed, especially Gajentheran who was going at 80 km/h. If they had ridden at a lower speed, they might well have avoided the collision. Paqmi’s near-miss illustrates the point.
25     It follows from our finding of contributory negligence on the part of Gajentheran that he may not recover his damages entirely from the appellants. But Rosli’s and Paqmi’s negligence had no bearing on the damages sustained by Gajentheran. Naturally, they should not have to contribute to the damages Gajentheran claims against the appellants.
26     In the result, we reduce the appellants’ liability to Gajentheran by 15% to take into account the latter’s contributory negligence. We allow the appeal in part to this extent.
27     Finally, on the question of costs, parties are requested to let us have their submissions on it within two weeks.

Judgment reserved.
 Choo Han Teck J:
1       The plaintiff was knocked down by a lorry on 21 August 2009 and was injured. He was then 29 years old and was a doctor. He obtained interlocutory judgment on 4 February 2013 at 75% liability against the defendants. The assessment of damages was heard in August 2014 before the learned Assistant Registrar Wong Baochen (“the learned AR”). On 6 March 2015, the learned AR awarded the plaintiff $39,384.24 (at 75%) plus interests and costs against the defendants.
2       The plaintiff appealed before me against the learned AR’s dismissal of his claim for loss of earning capacity, as well as her award of a nominal sum of $1,000 for loss of future earnings.
3       There was no dispute as to the injuries suffered by the plaintiff. The most serious one was a fracture of the right acetabulum (the right hip bone). The plaintiff had two surgical operations to insert pins for stabilising the hip region. He was discharged from hospital on 23 September 2009 and within three months thereafter he was walking again.
4       The learned AR awarded the plaintiff $22,000 as general damages for the fractured hip. The plaintiff also claimed costs of future hip replacement but the learned AR found on the evidence that there was no sufficient likelihood that the plaintiff would require a total hip replacement in the future. Against this finding the plaintiff did not appeal.
5       He appealed only against the dismissal of his claim for loss of earning capacity and the award of a nominal sum for his claim for loss of future earnings. These two heads of claim cover different types of loss. An award for loss of future earnings is an award to make good any real assessable loss of income as a result of the accident. This is income that the plaintiff would have earned if not for the accident. For example, a man earning $1,000 a month after the accident instead of $2,000 a month before the accident, would be compensated with an amount based on that difference in income. A claim for loss of future earnings is a claim for specific damages, and must be pleaded as such. An award for loss of earning capacity on the other hand is an award for the loss of the plaintiff’s competitive position in the job market as a result of his injuries and is awarded as part of general damages.
6       The plaintiff was already a doctor working at the National University Hospital when he was injured in the accident with the lorry. That was August 2009. In 2011 he applied for a Residency Programme under SingHealth with a view of qualifying as an orthopaedic specialist. It is a seven year programme. When the assessment took place before the learned AR the plaintiff was 34 years old and in the third year of the Residency Programme.
7       It was not disputed that this is a prestigious programme and the plaintiff was the only one in his cohort admitted to it. There is no dispute that if the plaintiff completes the programme he will be a qualified orthopaedic surgeon. The dispute is over the amount of income he would receive. The plaintiff’s claim for loss of future earnings and loss of earning capacity was made in the alternative, but is based on his claim that as a result of his injury, he would not earn as much as a surgeon than he would have had he not been injured.
8       The plaintiff claims that an orthopaedic surgeon in the public sector would earn about $24,000 a month from surgery work. He claims that based on a 10% loss over 12 years, the loss of future earnings by reason of the accident would be $345,600. He also claims that a round figure of $200,000 would be the fair amount for his loss of earning capacity. There is, however, absolutely no evidence that he cannot earn what an orthopaedic surgeon would earn. Eventually, he might earn a few thousand dollars less or a few thousand dollars more, but too many factors would have played a part in that. Those factors may have nothing to do with a hip fractured years before.
9       Since a claim for loss of future earnings is a claim for special damages, it must be proved, not only as to the probability of the income but also the loss. The court must be satisfied that the loss was reasonable and probable. Having been admitted into the Residency Programme in spite of his declared injuries, the plaintiff has not adduced any evidence that he would probably be earning less. His claim would be as speculative as a claim that he would be brilliant enough to invent a new surgical technique and earn ten times more than his peers. What is reasonable and probable is that he will be an orthopaedic surgeon, perhaps one with an early onset of osteoarthritis – but that will not stop him working as an orthopaedic surgeon. He might need to find a couple of Panadol from time to time as suggested by Dr Lee Soon Tai, the defendant’s expert, but he will manage. There was no evidence given by any of his supervisors in his department to show that as a result of his injury which has completely healed, he would be unable to carry out the duties required of him as a surgeon, and that in turn, would lead to him earning a lower income. In fact, it seems that his department was fully aware of his hip injury at the time when they accepted him into the Residency Programme and must have found him fit to qualify as an orthopaedic surgeon and perform well in the profession. Consequently, I am of the view that the learned AR’s award of $1,000 as a nominal sum is correct.
10     I also agree with the finding by the learned AR that the alternative claim for loss of earning capacity must clearly fail. There is no evidence that the plaintiff would lose his job. The evidence is to the contrary – that he would eventually improve his position. The claim for a loss of earning capacity was rightfully dismissed.",2015-05-08 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judgment reserved.
 Choo Han Teck J:
1       The plaintiff is 51 years old and is a British citizen. She has been married to Andrew Mykytowych (“Mr Mykytowych”) since 2008. She was working as a healthcare consultant in a company called “Care and Performance Ltd” (“CPL”) which is wholly owned by her. Mr Mykytowych was posted to India and Singapore for work and so the plaintiff gave up her own job to be with him in Asia.
2       On 6 May 2011 they arrived in Singapore and stayed at the V I P Hotel (“the defendant”). On the morning of 7 May 2011, the plaintiff slipped and fell at the lobby of the defendant hotel. The plaintiff sued the defendant for damages in negligence and obtained interlocutory judgment against the defendant on the basis of 50% liability with damages to be assessed. Initially the suit was commenced in the State Courts about five months after the accident. The action was transferred to the High Court on 23 August 2012.
3       The assessment of damages proceedings was heard before me from 11 February to 13 February 2015. The general damages for the physical injury itself are not difficult to assess. The difficult issues concern, first, the plaintiff’s claim that she suffered from “Complex Regional Pain Syndrome” (“CRPS”), and secondly, the amount representing her loss of future earnings which is being claimed as loss on the sale of her company.
4       The plaintiff’s claims for the injuries suffered are as follows:
 
a.    Pain and suffering for fracture of knee (left patella)
 
 
$50,000.00
 
 
b.    Pain and suffering for abrasion to the left knee
 
 
$500.00
 
 
c.    Pain and suffering for strained left ankle
 
 
$5,000.00
 
 
d.    Pain and suffering for back pains
 
 
$50,000.00
 
 
e.    Pain and suffering arising from CRPS with secondary fibromyalgia
 
 
$65,000.00
 
 
f.    Pre-trial loss of earnings (less S$5,330 for part-time work)
 
 
£323,406.22
 
 
g.    Loss of future earnings (being £6,510.57 a month x 18 years)
 
 
£1,438,315.12
 
 
h.    Pre-trial medical expenses
 
 
$15,629.35
 
 
i.    Loss of future expenses
 
 
$746,622.00
 
 
j.    Loss of amenities
 
 
$150,000.00
 
 
k.    Loss in respect of inability to profit from the sale of the plaintiff’s company, CPL
 
 
£312,305.00
 
 
l.    Costs of engaging a domestic help (being £2,880 a month x 18 years)
 
 
£622,080.00
 
 
m.    Costs of medical equipment
 
 
$1,360.43
 
 
n.    Costs of transportation
 
 
$5,628.86
 
 
o.    Costs of renovation of house
 
 
$359.20
 
 
p.    Difference between business and economy class air tickets
 
 
$8,945.60
 
 
q.    Husband’s loss of income
 
 
£21,600.00
 
The total claimed against the defendant at 50% liability is thus $549,522.72 and £1,358,853.17 (being 50% of $1,099,045.44 and £2,717.706.34). I have used the plaintiff’s individual amounts claimed to calculate the total and note that there are some inaccuracies in the plaintiff’s calculation of the total amount. For ease of reference and for calculation purposes only, I will refer to the plaintiff’s overall claim against the defendant as $3,267,229.06 being the total amount claimed with £1,358,853.17 converted to Singapore dollars at the rate of $2 to £1.
5       The injuries to the plaintiff namely, the fractured patella, the strained ankle and abrasion to the knee (leaving aside the claim regarding the back for the time being) are all closely connected and there would be a fair amount of overlap in the pain and suffering in such cases. Furthermore, the range of general damages for pain and suffering for such cases would normally be between $8,000 to $12,000. Since the total sum of $3,267,229.06 claimed by the plaintiff would probably make this the most expensive knee injury ever claimed, it is best to proceed by first setting out the basis of the plaintiff’s case upon which the big amounts are claimed – which largely relate to her career record and social activities.
6       The plaintiff graduated from the University of Birmingham in 1985 with a Bachelor in Social Sciences degree in social administration and social work. She has a certificate from the Inns of Court School of Law to be an Expert Witness in the field of adult social care. She also has a “Certificate in Management” from the University of Brighton after completing her master’s degree in business administration.
7       She set up CPL in 2004. From her position as the company’s managing director, she had been commissioned to “work in senior posts typically in a ‘trouble-shooting’ type capacity”, and “[had] been routinely commissioned to lead and assist local authorities and health agencies after serious failings in services such as the London Borough of Sutton”. She also claimed to be involved in the managements of budgets of up to £180m. She said that she would have continued working at an Assistant Director level in such agencies until about 2011 or 2012 whereupon she “would consider that [she] would have had sufficient experience to begin operating at interim Director level”. She then foresaw herself in about 2016 or 2017 having enough experience to be able to operate at interim Chief Executive Officer level for the remainder of her working life.
8       The plaintiff also claimed that prior to the accident, she was an active person who enjoyed driving cars at car rallies. She is a “qualified racing driver” and has also written about her motor sporting activities in various magazines.
9       The plaintiff claimed that as a result of the accident, she was unable to lead the kind of lifestyle described above. She tried to mitigate her loss by applying for a part-time job as a social worker but did not receive any reply to her applications. She concluded that she was unsuccessful because she was not a registered social worker in Singapore. She claimed that she had applied to IKEA to work as a cashier but when the human resource manager “observed that I had a disability, she declined even to interview me”. She found this “an extremely upsetting and humiliating experience” and decided to avoid subjecting herself to further similar experiences. She thus ceased looking for part-time work. She claims that she has “been unable to return to the UK to continue working there as [she is] not able to travel without assistance and [she has] no one to look after [her] there”. Finally, she managed to get a part-time job at the Management Development Institute of Singapore (“MDIS”) teaching English. For conducting classes in a three-week long English Summer Camp from 18 June to 6 July 2012, and for conducting two public seminars on business English in the period between 10 July and 17 July 2012, she received $5,330.
10     Assuming for the moment, that what she claims is true and proven, the next question is, how did a knee injury cost her so much loss in income? I will now consider this aspect of her injury before returning to the probability and reasonableness of her claims for pain and suffering in relation to her alleged loss of income. The plaintiff’s only serious injury was the fracture of the knee cap on 7 May 2011. The medical evidence from Dr Ganesan Naidu (“Dr Ganesan”) testified that he had advised her to try walking with support in order to stimulate the formation of new bone. He was of the view that the plaintiff’s fracture was a “minimally displaced fracture” and that the “soft tissue of the patella was intact, meaning there was some stability already”. He therefore wanted the plaintiff to move the limb. He confirmed that by February 2012 the fracture had completely healed. In fact, the knee had recovered sufficiently by 14 June 2011 for Dr Ganesan to refer the plaintiff for physiotherapy.
11     Dr Ganesan was the principal doctor looking after the plaintiff’s principal injury. From his medical reports and testimony at trial, it is clear and obvious that the plaintiff’s principal injury, the fractured patella, had completely healed. But the plaintiff insisted that the injury continued to cause her pain. Dr Ganesan, having made sure that there was nothing more that he could do for her, sent her to “pain management specialists”. The plaintiff was subsequently attended to by Dr Nicholas Chua (“Dr Chua”) and Dr Vincent Yeo (“Dr Yeo”), both of whom are anaesthetists. The plaintiff was referred to them on account of their claims to be pain specialists. Dr Chua diagnosed the plaintiff to be suffering from CRPS. He sent the plaintiff to Dr Yeo for confirmation. Dr Yeo, in turn sent the plaintiff for a psychiatric evaluation. Two psychiatrists, Dr Habeebul Rahman and Dr Yang Su-Yin testified that the plaintiff was not suffering from any “identified psychosomatic cause” for her condition. This condition they referred to was the CRPS that Dr Chua had diagnosed. Dr Chua was optimistic that patients with CRPS can recover with “cognitive behaviour therapy” (“CBT”). He diagnosed the plaintiff’s CRPS as the “sympathetic[ally] non-mediated” type for which a lumbar sympathetic block procedure might work to diagnose and eventually stop the pain. He testified under cross-examination that though the other type – “sympathetic[ally] mediated CRPS” – might respond better to a lumbar sympathetic block procedure, there was still a 50% chance that this procedure would help patients with the “sympathetic[ally] non-mediated type”, like the plaintiff. Such a diagnostic procedure would enable the doctors to be able to tell whether the plaintiff had a good chance of further improvement or treatment. If the procedure were to show that the nerves are involved in the CRPS, the plaintiff could then consider going for a lumbar sympathectomy to ablate the nerves straightaway. It was not disputed that the plaintiff did not opt for a lumbar sympathetic block procedure even though she understood the benefits of it, citing a “fear of needles”.
12     The plaintiff was subsequently examined by Dr Bernard Lee (“Dr Lee”) on 23 July 2013. Dr Lee produced a medical report on 16 September 2013, and testified on the plaintiff’s behalf. Dr Lee is a qualified anaesthesiologist and was described as a “pain specialist” by Mr Salem, counsel of the plaintiff. Dr Lee practises in his clinic known as “Singapore Pain Centre”. He also diagnosed the plaintiff to be suffering from CRPS from the “seemingly mild trauma” of the fractured patella. He found that she had all the “signs and symptoms of a sympathetic[ally] mediated pain” including “automatic dysfunction and dystrophy of her skin, nails and surrounding soft tissue of her leg and foot”. This diagnosis differed from that of Dr Chua who found that the plaintiff’s CRPS was of the sympathetically non-mediated version. Dr Lee acknowledged that there are two versions but asserted under cross-examination that the plaintiff was suffering from the sympathetically mediated version.
13     In her affidavit of evidence-in-chief, the plaintiff claimed that she was in constant and severe pain and therefore had to stop the work she used to do in CPL. She also claimed that she could no longer enjoy driving cars in rallies as she had done in the past because she could no longer use her left knee to depress the clutch of the car. She is even unable to walk much. In court, she appeared at all times in a wheelchair.
14     The defendant disputes the diagnosis of CRPS. Its case is that there was no medical justification for that diagnosis. Secondly, the defendant avers that the plaintiff, despite her claims and diagnosis, is not truthful. The defendant relies on surveillance and other evidence to show that the plaintiff’s claims regarding her pain and disability are false. But before I consider the defendant’s evidence, it will be helpful to consider the nature and effect of the plaintiff’s medical evidence.
15     The first and undisputed evidence is that the fracture of the patella has completely healed. To this end, I find the evidence of Dr Ganesan to be forthright, reliable and illuminating. From his evidence I am able to conclude with certainty that the plaintiff’s knee injury was not an unusual one and physically, the plaintiff had made full recovery. What is disputed is whether the plaintiff suffers from CRPS and, if so, the effect that has on her work and private life. If the plaintiff does not have CRPS and has completely healed from her injury, then the only conclusion I can come to is that she is malingering and has grossly exaggerated her claim for damages.
16     It is incontrovertible that for the sympathetically non-mediated form of CRPS which the plaintiff was first diagnosed with, apart from tenderness, there are no specific symptoms or tests that can verify the diagnosis. Though the sympathetically mediated type of CRPS should display redness and hotness, which was what the plaintiff was later diagnosed with, I note that such symptoms were not observed on her by Dr Chua. A diagnosis of CRPS is thus largely based on a claim to pain by the patient. Hence, Dr Yeo sent the plaintiff for psychological and psychiatric examinations to rule out any psychiatric conditions. At this juncture, the medical evidence trails off.
17     Neither side produced sufficient evidence regarding CRPS generally and specifically in relation to this plaintiff. Mr Salem offered Dr Lee as his expert on CRPS but Dr Lee is an anaesthesiologist by training who now specialises in pain management. That does not necessarily make him an expert in CRPS. In fact, Mr Salem had not adhered to the requirements of experts’ evidence in the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) which state that the expert evidence must be contained in a report and signed and exhibited in an affidavit. The report should further begin with the expert’s qualifications and cite authorities or material relied on for the report. This was not the manner in which Dr Lee’s evidence was presented to the court, but rather as a doctor who had examined the plaintiff and diagnosed her to be suffering from CRPS. He did not provide the court with crucial evidence on the chances of recovery for the plaintiff specifically and for CRPS patients generally, or how to reconcile the two differing diagnoses of the type of CRPS the plaintiff had. I am therefore unable and reluctant to make a finding as to whether the plaintiff is indeed a true case of CRPS. I will proceed on the basis that on the face of the professional, but not expert, medical evidence from Dr Chua and Dr Lee, the plaintiff is suffering from CRPS. I have no evidence to assess whether she will remain so for a few months more or for life.
18     The plaintiff has the evidence of Dr Chua and Dr Lee (and to a lesser extent, Dr Yeo) to support her claim that she had CRPS. But there was no medical evidence from a doctor nominated by the defendant to the contrary. That is as wanting as the failure to produce a medical expert on CRPS. In such circumstances, the finding of the existence of CRPS must be in the plaintiff’s favour albeit without expert evidence.
19     I go on to examine the consequences that CRPS has had on the plaintiff’s private life and work. In this case, the manner in which the plaintiff testified and the evidence of the nature and history of her work, as well as the events after her fall led me to examine the evidence several times. I have considered the evidence from her point of view and compared it with the possibility of an exaggerated claim; bearing in mind that the importance of the evidence is that it has serious implications beyond the parties’ interests alone. If the plaintiff’s claim regarding the consequences of her CRPS is genuine, she must be properly compensated. If it is not, the injustice is not only that she would have made an unmeritorious gain and the defendant (or its insurers) would have suffered an unmeritorious loss. More than that, such insurance claims will drive premiums higher and other policy holders will bear the costs of increases in insurance premiums.
20     The defendant produced surveillance evidence of the plaintiff. The photographic and video evidence show that the plaintiff was ambulant with the use of a cane. There were pictures of her using a wheelchair but they were mainly from her trips to the hospital. The plaintiff also used the wheelchair when she appeared at trial. The video evidence shows that contrary to her much emphasised pain and how it prevents her from walking long distances to the extent that she is unable to work, she went on a long nature walk in July 2012. During the walk, the plaintiff also encountered some uneven terrain, including but not limited to sandy beaches and grassy areas. The surveillance also captured her climbing up and down the embankment at Pasir Ris beach. This was not done without any difficulty, but her ability to traverse such a walk is inconsistent with her claims that her condition had been steadily deteriorating since November 2011. Mr Salem argues that the private investigator, Mr Abdul Hadi bin Mohamed Salleh (“Mr Abdul Hadi”), measured the distance wrongly and that the plaintiff did not walk the 7.2km. Further, counsel submitted that the plaintiff had to take breaks in between.
21     There is no definitive measurement of the route taken by the plaintiff and her husband but the distance on the map and the evidence of the investigator Mr Abdul Hadi indicate that it would be about 5km at the very least. It may be that the plaintiff had stopped and rested along the way but she did not seem to stop because of pain. Even regular trekkers would stop to admire the scenery or just to rest. If the plaintiff had stopped because of pain, she would have stopped and then returned home; but she completed the walk.
22     Another significant evidence was the evidence of Dr Ganesan, corroborated by his medical notes that the plaintiff reported to him that she was pleased that she could drive a manual car and she could use the clutch whilst in the UK. Realising that this evidence was inconsistent with her claim, she denied that she told Dr Ganesan all that. Mr Salem then produced evidence to show that it was the plaintiff’s husband who had hired the car when they were in the UK. That does not prove that the plaintiff did not drive at all.
23     The plaintiff did not deny that she had travelled to the UK, Spain, Doha, Hong Kong and Malaysia on holiday since her accident. She also took a few trips with her husband to accompany him for work, to places such as Vietnam and Taiwan. Though she claims that she had to follow her husband because she “couldn’t be really left behind” on her own, there is evidence to show that since the accident she had also made a few solo trips. These evidence must be assessed by a comparison of what the plaintiff says in her affidavits and in court. They are not consistent with the impression that she so fervently wanted to present to the court at trial – namely, that since the fracture of her left patella she was in such great and constant pain that she could not walk and could not work. She had to stop work and no longer enjoyed the life that she used to enjoy including driving cars in car rallies and going on holidays.
24     Upon considering the evidence presented by the plaintiff to show that she could not contemplate even part-time work, I find the evidence of the circumstances surrounding her work in MDIS troubling. The plaintiff claims that as a result of the “adverse impact on [her] health” she concluded her temporary freelance work with MDIS in July 2012. But if she was already in constant pain in July 2012 to the extent that she had to terminate her work with MDIS, why did she then sign and MDIS offer, another contract with MDIS on 3 January 2013 to teach further classes in business English? She was also listed as a trainer in the Corporate Training Calendar of MDIS for the year 2013. The plaintiff only addressed this contract signed with MDIS in 2013 in her closing submissions, but merely stated that she “was optimistic about her recovery” when she entered into the contract on 3 January 2013. This contradicted all previous evidence which was that by mid-2012, the plaintiff’s condition had worsened to the extent that she could no longer work, and was steadily deteriorating.
25     I examined the overall evidence over and over to see if I could justify a finding in her favour, after all, she did fall and she did fracture a knee bone but I am of the view that the evidence shows that her claim to be grossly exaggerated so far as the effect of her CRPS was concerned.
26     Finally, I also find that her claims regarding the loss to CPL are unjustified. She claimed that she could no longer perform the work she used to do for CPL. First, although there are financial records as to the annual earnings of CPL, there is no clear evidence as to what the plaintiff’s work for CPL entailed. On the one hand she says that she could work remotely using her laptop, but on the other she claims that her physical presence with the clients of CPL are vital. If that were so, she had to give them up to join her husband when his job brought him to Asia. When she disconnected from those clients, she was clearly prepared to give up that occupation. She made no attempt to continue her work with CPL after she left the UK to join her husband in Asia.
27     I therefore find that her claims as to her disability and loss of income to be untrue. I further dismiss the plaintiff’s claim relating to pain and suffering for back pains as there is no evidence of a back injury which was caused by the accident. I find that the diagnosis of secondary Fibromyalgia cannot stand for the reasons above and because I note that Dr Lee has not examined the plaintiff for a sufficiently sustained period of time to be able to make such a diagnosis. Dr Lee had admitted under cross-examination that for a diagnosis of Fibromyalgia to be made, it has to be ascertained that such widespread pain occurred over a period of time, for example, over a period of three months. Dr Lee admitted that he simply based his diagnosis on the history the plaintiff gave, and not on any clinical examination of the plaintiff over a prolonged period of time. In fact, he had merely examined her once, on 23 July 2013 and based his diagnosis only on this examination. The plaintiff has also not been clinically diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis which would require her to choose to take business class over economy class for her flights, and has not been advised to engage a full-time domestic helper or purchase a TENS machine. I also find that her transport expenses were incurred whilst her husband was still working for his previous company, and that these expenses were paid by his company. I thus make the award of damages as follows:
 
a.    Pain and suffering for fracture of knee, abrasion to the left knee, and strained ankle
 
 
$12,000.00
 
 
b.    Pre-trial medical expenses (up to but not including February 2012)
 
 
$4,374.55
 
 
c.    Costs of transportation
 
 
$1,635.68
 
The total award of damages for the plaintiff’s claims is $18,010.23. The final sum that the defendant is to pay to the plaintiff is half the amount, at $9,005.115. I will hear the parties on costs at a later date if they are unable to agree.",2015-05-19 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judgment reserved.
 Choo Han Teck J:
1       A lit cigarette fell from the upper floors of Block 2019 at Bukit Batok Street 23 on 26 January 2010. It landed on pallets of polystyrene foam packing material. These materials were stacked outside a warehouse. Perhaps they should not have been left there. The cigarette ignited the flammable materials and started a fire. That was about 10am. The fire raged for hours before it was put out.
2       A worker from the warehouse noticed the fire and raised the alarm. He and various others tried to put out the fire. The fire, fed by the stacks of polystyrene material and strong winds, very quickly spread into #01-260 (“the plaintiffs’ premises”) occupied by Union Concept Manufacturers Pte Ltd (“the first plaintiff”), damaging the property therein. The premises were shared by P & K Services Pte Ltd (“the second plaintiff”).
3       The defendant, Rhythme Technology Pte Ltd, is a company engaged by the Housing Development Board (“HDB”) to service and maintain the fire protection and mechanical ventilation systems at the said block. Maintaining the fire hose reel system at the plaintiffs’ premises was part of that job.
4       The plaintiffs are now claiming damages amounting to $1,383,673.05 of alleged losses caused or contributed by the defendant’s negligence to service and maintain the fire hose reel system. The thrust of their claim is that the defendant breached their duty of care to the plaintiffs by failing to ensure that there was any water, or sufficient water, in the fire hose reel nearest to the plaintiffs’ premises. In addition, this breach prevented them from using the fire hose to stop the fire and salvage their property on the premises.
5       The defendant argues that their contract is with HDB, and they do not owe a duty of care to the plaintiffs. I am of the view that the defendant does owe a duty of care to the plaintiffs as users of the fire hose reel which they service and maintain. But the question is, what is the extent of this duty of care? As set out in the defendant’s contract with HDB, the duties of the defendant include conducting regular maintenance and servicing of the fire hose reels in the said block to ensure that the fire hose reel is in good condition and that all couplings are watertight. They are also to report their findings to HDB, which would include possible findings of a lack of water pressure or damaged components present in the fire protection system.
6       On the evidence, I am satisfied that the defendant’s employees carried out a physical test on the fire hose reel nearest to the plaintiffs’ premises on 17 September 2009. They recorded their findings on a check list which indicated that the various components which made up the fire protection system were not damaged – neither faulty nor jammed, and that the water pressure was not low. The only damage they recorded was that of the cabinet containing the fire hose reel.
7       The plaintiffs argue that the defendant had breached his duty of care as there was no water in the fire hose, and further, that the non-return valve was installed in the reverse, which the defendant had failed to notice and which would affect the flow of water in the fire hose. But the plaintiffs’ key witnesses who were present on the day of the incident and had attempted to use the fire hose did not appear in court to give evidence. Without their evidence, it is extremely difficult for the plaintiff to prove that at the time the fire hose was used, there was practically no water in the hose reel, and that this was a result of the defendant’s breach of duty. All we can rely on are their contemporaneous statements taken by Crawford & Company International Pte Ltd and JT Megan & Partners Pte Ltd in their course of investigating the cause of the fire, but which have not been subject to cross-examination. In fact, the picture that emerges upon perusing the fire investigation reports is that the fire hose reel was pulled out by the workers, but was subsequently discarded because the direction of the wind was blowing towards those attempting to put out the fire with the fire hose. As such, the workers had to run to the adjacent unit to retrieve another fire hose.
8       The evidence given by Mr Kua, the managing director of the plaintiff under cross-examination shows that he reached the scene less than a minute after he was notified of the fire, but by then the fire had spread so rapidly that he decided not to use the fire extinguisher that he was carrying. He claims that he picked up the fire hose nearest to the unit, but there was no water in the fire hose. However, on the balance of probabilities, I am unable to accept his evidence. Mr Kua arrived on the scene sometime after the other employees of the warehouse had attempted to fight the fire with the fire hose. If it had been too hot for the other employees to stand in the same position and fight the fire, which was spreading rapidly, it seems highly improbable that Mr Kua was able to do so at a time when the fire was even more uncontrollable. It is striking that his observation of the fire hose being faulty was not included in his contemporaneous statement taken immediately after the incident. The failure to mention such a crucial fact, coupled with the improbability of his assertions, has caused me to be sceptical about the plaintiff’s claims.
9       Further, I note that the plaintiffs’ expert did not have an opportunity to examine the non-return check valve at the location in this case. The defendant’s contract with HDB to service the hose reels located outside of the plaintiffs’ premises also does not involve servicing the check valve. In any event, even if the non-return check valve was inserted wrongly, it did not definitively mean that no water could flow through. On the expert evidence given, we can conclude that if the circular disc in the non-return valve was disengaged, the water can flow in both directions, and would result in water flow even if the non-return valve was inserted in the opposite direction. Even if we were to accept Mr Kua’s allegation – that there was no water in the fire hose, there are also other reasons why the water may not come out immediately from the fire hose, and/or may not be of sufficient pressure. For example, if either the hose reel was not properly disentangled, or the tap was not turned on properly, the water would take a longer time to come out, and/or the water pressure may be affected. These are all factors that fall outside of the defendant’s duty of care. I thus find that the defendant has not breached his duty of care to the plaintiffs.
10     In any event, even if the defendant had breached his duty of care, the plaintiffs’ claim against the defendants would also fail on the issue of causation. The incontrovertible fact is that the plaintiffs had stacked large amounts of highly combustible packing material outside their warehouse which posed a high fire risk. On that day, a lit cigarette ignited the fire and strong winds and the combustible material led to the rapid spread of the fire. The spread of the fire was so rapid that it soon became clear to those present on the day, like the employees of the warehouse, passers-by and even employees of neighbouring units who were spraying water onto the flames, that human efforts were futile and were unable to quench the raging fire. The winds were also blowing towards the plaintiffs’ premises, which caused the fire to spread laterally into the said unit. It seems clear to me that the mere usage of one or two fire hose reels, even if fully functioning, would have been insufficient to contain the spread of the fire that was already out of control when the said hoses were drawn to range. This is supported by eyewitness accounts which state that by the time the employees pulled the hose reel out to the front of the unit, they were faced with a large fire as the fire had spread to the nearby pallets of packing material. As winds blew smoke, heat and the flames towards their direction, the workers discarded the hose reel and rushed to retrieve another from a neighbouring unit. I am thus not satisfied that the water in the hose reels would have made a difference to the spread of the fire. Even the firemen subsequently took three hours to bring the fire under control, and five hours to completely extinguish the fire. I thus find that even if the defendant had breached his duty, that breach did not cause or contribute to the plaintiffs’ loss and damage.
11     For the reasons above, the plaintiff’s claim is dismissed. I will hear parties on costs at a later date.",2015-05-04 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judgment reserved.
 Choo Han Teck J:
1       This case is a claim by an injured motorcyclist for damages for personal injuries and damage to his motorcycle. He alleges that the second defendant, the lorry driver, caused the injuries. The second defendant denies any liability and blames the first and second third parties for causing or contributing to the accident.
2       The accident took place on 1 February 2013 between 5.10pm and 5.20pm at the junction of Tuas West Road and Tuas Link 4. The second defendant was driving a lorry (number YN 2294K). The first defendant is his employer.
3       The plaintiff was riding his motorcycle (number JNV 6426). The first and second third parties were riding motorcycles JMQ 4180 and JLX 642 respectively. The plaintiff and the third parties claim that they were travelling straight on lane 3 (erroneously described in the expert report as lane 1) along Tuas West Road. The second defendant was travelling in lane 1 from the opposite direction.
4       The accident occurred when the second defendant turned right at the junction into Tuas Link 4. He says that the traffic light was in his favour because the ‘green arrow’ indicator was on. There is no dispute that if the ‘green arrow’ was on, the traffic light against the plaintiff and the third parties must be red against them. The plaintiff’s case was that the traffic light was green in his favour and that means that the light was also green for vehicles in the opposite direction. However, if those vehicles are turning right before the ‘green arrow’ appears, they will have to be sure that the traffic is clear.
5       The plaintiff stated that his motorcycle had slid under the lorry as the lorry turned right, in the face of oncoming traffic. The plaintiff is not sure whether his motorcycle collided against the lorry but his police report and evidence show that he was surprised by the sudden appearance of the lorry in front of him. There is further no evidence to show that the plaintiff was speeding at the material time. There seems to be nothing the plaintiff could have done to avoid sliding under the lorry. Seconds later, the second third party’s motorcycle crashed into the lorry and after that, the first third party had to swerve round the lorry to avoid crashing into it. The first third party was able to avoid hitting the lorry but was unable to prevent his motorcycle from skidding. He thus fell with his motorcycle behind the lorry. The photographs show the lorry to have stopped just before the pedestrian crossing lines across Tuas Link 4. The lorry was in the junction in front of lane 3 of Tuas West Road and the road shoulder.
6       One of the plaintiff’s witnesses was Daud. He was riding pillion on the second third party’s motorcycle. He testified that the plaintiff was about five metres ahead of the second third party’s motorcycle. The first third party testified that he was about five to ten metres behind the second third party and confirmed that the second third party was behind the plaintiff. The three motorcyclists dispute the second defendant’s claim that they were riding on the road shoulder. They were on lane 3.
7       Although the three motorcyclists and the pillion are friends working in the same factory, I do not think that they gave a similar account of the accident just to help each other. The incontrovertible fact is that if the ‘green arrow’ was in the second defendant’s favour, it must mean that all three motorcyclists beat the red light one after the other.
8       Furthermore, the first third party’s motorcycle ended behind the lorry and is an objective corroboration of his account of the accident. The second defendant claimed that the plaintiff’s motorcycle did not go under the lorry on impact but was pushed under by the motorcycle of the second third party. This account was disputed by the plaintiff and the second third party and I am unable to be persuaded that a motorcycle pushed the other under the lorry. I am of the view that the plaintiff’s motorcycle most probably skidded under on impact with the lorry.
9       I am also not inclined to believe the second defendant’s claim that the motorcyclists were riding on the road shoulder. There was no evidence to support that allegation other than the fact that there was a shoulder. The plaintiff’s evidence, which I accept, is that he was not only on the third lane but on the far side from the shoulder. The two other motorcyclists who were behind him corroborated this – that is, the impact and positions of their motorcycles indicate their versions to be more credible. Mrs Hendrick, counsel for the defendants’ main argument was that the lorry’s position was beyond the third lane and in front of the shoulder. This would be a strong argument but for the fact that it relies on the second defendant’s evidence that he stopped immediately after the accident. “Immediately” is relative. It is not likely, in my view, that the lorry stopped dead in its track upon the collision by the plaintiff’s motorcycle. The lorry is more likely to have moved a little before stopping. That would be sufficient to bring it to where it was. As such, I am not inclined to accept his evidence against that of the three motorcyclists and the pillion.
10     In any event, I agree with counsel for the third parties’ submission that the road shoulder was a ‘red herring’. It would at most indicate that the motorcyclists infringed a traffic regulation but that would only be a factor in contribution. It does not detract from the fact that the light was green in their favour. Moreover, the preponderance of evidence indicates that the motorcyclists were not on the road shoulder. It is a fact that must be proved since the alternative (riding on the road) is to be presumed unless there are reasons or evidence to the contrary. The evidence here leans in favour of the plaintiff.
11     Finally, if the mental element is of any relevance, it seems to me that it was the second defendant who was the one in a hurry. There is clear evidence that even when the medical rescuers arrived, the second defendant was asking for permission to deliver the goods that he was carrying. This is a small point but completes the overall picture of how and why the accident had probably occurred. Given the mental state of its driver at the relevant time, the second defendant’s lorry would have appeared in front of the motorcyclists without giving them (with the exception of the first third party) any chance to take evasive action.
12     For the reasons above, I find in favour of the plaintiff and find no reason to apportion contribution to him or the third parties. The defendants’ claim against the third parties is dismissed. There will be interlocutory judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant with damages to be assessed.
13     The usual consequential orders follow.",2015-01-19 00:00:00,SG High Court

3 February 2015
 Choo Han Teck J:
1       The two accused persons were separately charged for trafficking in diamorphine on 28 October 2011 but with committing their respective offences in furtherance of the common intention of both. The first accused is a 30-year old Malaysian. The second accused is a 46-year old Singaporean. The drugs were packed in ten packets and the total weight was 4497.7g and the contents were analysed and found to be diamorphine weighing not less than 28.5g.
2       The two accused were charged under s 5(1)(
a
) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), and punishable under s 33 and s 33B of the Act. Section 5(1)(
a
) provides as follows –
Except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence for a person, on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, whether or not that other person is in Singapore – (a) to traffic in a controlled drug…
Section 33 provides that any person convicted of an offence of trafficking in a controlled drug shall be punished according to the relevant provision in the Second Schedule. Diamorphine is a Class “A” controlled drug as defined in s 2 of the Act, (under “Specified Drug”). The Second Schedule provides that for offences involving more than 15g of diamorphine, the punishment is death – unless s 33B applies. Section 33B provides that the court may impose a sentence other than death in certain circumstances. On conviction, both accused persons would thus face the death penalty unless s 33B applies to them.
3       On 28 October 2011, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) saw the second accused carrying a haversack to a bus stop outside the Haw Par Villa at about 11.25am. About five minutes later, the first accused drove a car (a Perodua “Kenari”) with the number plate JLT 8467, to the bus stop and the second accused got into the car.
4       The first accused then drove along Pasir Panjang Road, making several turns on the way before arriving at a hilltop car park at the National University of Singapore. The car stopped there for about five minutes before going back onto Pasir Panjang Road from South Buona Vista Road. The Kenari was then seen going into an Esso petrol station along Pasir Panjang Road.
5       The car was parked near the air pumps in the petrol station. CNB officers observing the car reported that a man came out of the car and walked into the convenience store. Inspector Sea Hoon Cheng testified that it was the second accused who went into the convenience store. The car left the petrol station about 12.12pm and drove along Pasir Panjang Road and the West Coast Highway. It stopped finally at a car park at Block 405, Pandan Gardens.
6       The second accused was seen leaving the car and walking to Block 405. He was carrying a black plastic bag with a golden logo. CNB officers moved in and arrested both accused persons. The first accused was arrested in the car. The haversack carried by the second accused when he first entered the Kenari along Pasir Panjang Road was found on the floor mat of the front passenger seat. Three black plastic bundles were found in the haversack. Two black plastic bags were also found in it as well as one newspaper wrapped bundle. The black plastic bundles and the newspaper wrapped bundles were found to contain granular substances analysed to be diamorphine.
7       The second accused was arrested outside his mother’s flat, unit #13-34 of Block 405 Pandan Gardens. The officers searched the Block for the black plastic bag that the second accused was carrying when he went to Block 405, and eventually found it among some flower pots on the staircase landing between the seventh and eighth floors. It was searched and found to contain three newspaper wrapped bundles containing granular substances. In total, the ten drug exhibits were analysed and found to contain not less than 28.5g of diamorphine.
8       The forensic evidence from Dr Alaric Koh of the Health Sciences Authority showed that the newspaper wrapping found in the haversack could have been from the same set of newspapers as those used to wrap the diamorphine found in the black plastic bag on the staircase landing. The observations and conclusion are found in paragraph 6 of the report marked as P83. The observations of Dr Alaric Koh were based on a “comparison of characteristics, manufacturing cut edges and possible ink transfers”. Forensic evidence also showed that the clear plastic bags containing the ten packets of diamorphine were manufactured by the same machine. The heat seals on the clear plastic bags were also from the same sealing machine.
9       The DNA of the first accused was found on both sides of the tapes used to bundle one of the black plastic bundles in the haversack. His DNA was also found on the interior surface of the black plastic bag of one of the three black plastic bundles in the haversack. In his statements to the police, he admitted helping to put the black plastic bundles into the haversack. However, he denied that he knew what were in those bundles. He also referred to the person with the haversack who got into his car, and whom he helped, as “Ah Boy”. The second accused testified that he got into the car driven by an Indian man at the date and time stipulated in the charge. He admitted that he was given a black plastic bag by that Indian man and told to put it along the staircase of the 6
th
 or 7
th
 storey of Block 405. He opened the black plastic bag and saw three bundles wrapped in newspapers. He denied knowing what were in the three bundles and stated that he did not ask the Indian man what they contained.
10     On the evidence adduced above, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case against both accused as charged. The identity of the two persons in the Kenari car were not disputed and I thus find that the prosecution had proven the fact that the diamorphine were in the possession of both accused when they were in the car and that they transported the diamorphine from the Esso Station to Pandan Gardens with the common intention of trafficking in the drugs. I thus called upon both accused to enter upon their defence. They elected to testify.
11     The first accused raised the defence of ignorance. He claimed that he did not know that the plastic bags contained drugs and that he had no common intention of trafficking drugs with the second accused. His case was that the drug trafficking transaction that day was carried out by the second accused and coordinated by one Puni. The first accused admitted in his statements to the CNB that he knew Puni but asserted his association with Puni as innocuous. He accepted Puni’s offer to deliver the car to his (Puni’s) friend, “relax for about an hour and I could drive the car back to Malaysia after his friend returned it”. He claimed that Puni told him that his friend needed the car to deliver some personal documents. The first accused was suspicious and asked Puni what sort of documents they were. According to the first accused, Puni pulled out a bunch of documents which seemed like documents relating to property transactions and showed them to him.
12     The first accused stated that on the material day, 28 October 2011, Puni showed him the documents and said that they were illegal and that was why the transaction had to be hidden behind the speakers in the car. He told the first accused that his job was to drive the car from Malaysia to Singapore and pass the car to “Ah Boy” and wait for “Ah Boy” to return the car to him, after which, he was to drive it back to Malaysia. At trial, the first accused identified the second accused as “Ah Boy”. He picked up the second accused at Pasir Panjang Road and drove him around until they arrived at the Esso Station where he got out. He went into the convenience store to buy drinks. He testified that when he returned to the car, he saw that the boot was open and he asked the second accused what he was doing. The second accused told him that he was pumping air into the tyres. The first accused then got back into the car where he saw “some black coloured bundles on the front passenger seat”. He testified that he put the black bundles into the haversack for the second accused because he was asked to help. The second accused then asked him to drive to Block 405 which he did. There, the second accused took some bundles from the haversack and left but told the first accused to wait for him.
13     The second accused similarly raised the defence of ignorance. He had taken a ride from the Indian man driving the Kenari and when he arrived at Block 405, the Indian man took out a black plastic bag from the rear passenger seat and gave it to him. He was instructed to leave it at the staircase of the 6
th
 or 7
th
 floor of Block 405. He testified that he met the Indian man, who he now identified as the first accused, on 28 October 2011 with the view of having lunch with him. He then testified that after getting into the Kenari, the first accused drove him along various roads, finally ending at the Esso Station where he got out and went into the convenience store to buy a drink. When he returned to the car he saw that the boot was open but there was nothing suspicious about it. There was no cogent reason why he agreed to meet the first accused that day. He had only met the first accused once before and had no business with him. The only connection was the vague, almost implied, belief that the first accused was going to help him find work.
14     For the accused persons to rebut the presumption of trafficking in the drugs found in their possession their explanations must be cogent and consistent. I am not satisfied that they were. By the second accused’s account, the first accused agreed to meet the second accused on that day for the purpose of lunching with him. Their conduct – driving around and making stops in a car park and a petrol station – was not convincing. They spent all the time driving aimlessly and making the two stops and then decided that that they no longer had time for lunch.
15     The second accused testified that when he returned from the convenience store to the Kenari car and saw the black bundles in the passenger seat he “was shocked”. Even without any explanation acceptable to him, he helped put those bundles into his haversack. Then he said, astonishingly, that he was late for his Friday prayers near his mother’s home. The first accused took him there and asked that he drop a few bundles off at the 6
th
 floor staircase. There is no doubt in my mind that the second accused person’s story that he was meeting the first accused for lunch, and the first accused person’s story that he met the second accused on 28 October 2011 only because their common friend Puni told him that the second accused wanted to meet him, are inherently contradictory.
16     Evidence that is required to corroborate testimony will sometimes contain conflicting aspects, but they may not be rejected as untruthful if there are reasons for the discrepancies that the finder of fact accepts. Some of the strangest stories ever told have turned out to be true; and some of the vilest lies have been sold through the mouths of straight faces. Fact-finding is a practised art, and it is probably impossible to discuss that subject comprehensively in this judgment. It is also not necessary to do so here because there is a crucial lie that further unravelled the defences of both the accused persons. Inspector Sea of the CNB testified that he saw the second accused walk into the Cheers convenience store after the Kenari stopped at the Esso Station. Neither accused denied that they went to the Esso Station, but both claimed to be the one who went into the convenience store. The reason for that claim was evident as they both knew that the black plastic bundles appeared on the passenger seat while the person in the driver’s seat was alone in the car. Both accused tried to disassociate themselves from the appearance of the drugs.
17     Taking into account the evidence of Inspector Sea, I am inclined to believe that it was the second accused who went into the convenience store. So it was likely that the second accused was telling the truth on this point and the first accused had told the lie. Further, the second accused testified that he saw the first accused closing the boot of the car. This was, in an unintended way, corroboration of the first accused’s evidence that Puni had previously hidden documents in the speakers in the boot. On this occasion, the first accused denied checking the boot because that would directly implicate him.
18     Although the second accused was likely to be telling the truth in saying that he and not the first accused went into the convenience store, his evidence thereafter raised questions that were not answered. He said that he returned to the car and saw black bundles that shocked him, but he did not protest when the first accused told him that he needed to put some of the bundles inside his (the second accused) haversack. He said that he merely unzipped the haversack and the first accused put some of the black bundles into it. This part of his evidence was to explain the bundles found in his haversack. Instead of protesting, the second accused said that he was already late and needed to go for his Friday prayers. When they arrived at Pandan Gardens the first accused reached over the passenger seat and took a black plastic bundle which he handed to the second accused and told him to place on the flower pots between the 6
th
 and 7
th
 floor staircase landing. The second accused did just that and then went up to his mother’s flat where he was arrested.
19     I do not believe that the first accused would have so readily dropped off the black plastic bag (with the drugs) at the staircase landing in Pandan Gardens, a place that, from the evidence, was determined by chance for that was where the second accused told him he was headed. The second accused repeated that he was late for his prayers at least twice but his general evidence suggested otherwise, not least because he did not say what exactly at what time he needed to be at the mosque and why that time could not be changed or his prayers delayed, but also because he went for what appeared to be a pointless car ride and stopover. He hardly knew the first accused; he had no specific reason to meet the first accused on that day other than for a lunch date which he did not seem to care much about and which was cancelled because he was late for his prayers.
20     The absence of a common purpose of the meeting between the two accused persons is a strong indictment in itself in the circumstances, but their respective versions, already weakened by their mutual contradictions, do not make sense even on their own. I am thus satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that both accused knew that the black plastic bags contained diamorphine and they acted with the common intention of trafficking in them in the manner of the second accused dropping part of them off at Block 405 Pandan Gardens. I do not think that their testimonies raised any reasonable doubt as to whether they had the diamorphine for the purposes of trafficking. I thus found them guilty and convicted them as charged.
21     The facts as I have found also suggest that the involvement of the two accused were probably restricted to the acts described in s 33B(2)(
a
)(i) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), namely, the mere transporting and delivering of the drugs. By virtue of s 33B(1) the mandatory death penalty will not apply if the accused satisfies the condition in s 33B(2)(a)(i) - as the two accused before me have – and the Public Prosecutor certifies that he has also substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities (s 33B(2)(
b
)). In this case, the Public Prosecutor did not object to the submissions of the accused that they had satisfied s 33B(2)(
a
), but he will not grant the certificate to the second accused under s 33B(2)(
b
). That being the case, my finding under s 33B(2)(
a
)(i) will not save the second accused from the death penalty.
22     However, by the statutory amendments that brought in ss 33B(1) and (2), there is one further chance for an accused person to escape the death penalty. Under s 33B(1)(
b
) and s 33B(3), the accused person who has satisfied s 33B(2) but fails to obtain the PP’s certificate of substantial assistance may be spared the death penalty if he proves that “he was suffering from such abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in relation to the offence”. The two accused applied for psychiatric assessment at the adjourned hearing in which the parties made their submissions on sentence.
23     Deputy Public Prosecutor, Mr Terence Chua, did not object to the application of the first accused because he accepted that a year ago his counsel had asked for a copy of the prosecution’s psychiatric report although the Public Prosecutor (“PP”) has no record of receiving the request. However, Mr Chua objected to the application by the second accused on the ground that it was only made after conviction. The last avenue of hope rests on the fact of a mental condition which has to be supported by medical evidence. The court cannot determine that state without medical evidence and it is not right that on a matter of life and death, the issue is determined on the basis of an untested procedure. I therefore granted leave to both accused to obtain psychiatric evidence.
24     The accused persons were brought before me again on 29 January 2015. Mr Nedumaran, counsel for the first accused, submitted that his client was only a courier and Mr Chua stated that he will not challenge that submission and that the prosecutor has granted the first accused a certificate of substantive assistance. I find no reason from the evidence to find otherwise. I therefore sentenced the first accused to the mandatory life imprisonment with effect from 12 December 2011 and to 15 strokes of the cane under s 33B of the Act.
25     Mr Johan submitted that the second accused was also a courier. Mr Chua does not dispute this but says that the PP will not be issuing a certificate of substantive assistance to the second accused. The second accused also did not produce psychiatric evidence to establish that he was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time of the offence. In the circumstances, I have no discretion but to sentence the second accused to suffer death.",2015-02-03 00:00:00,SG High Court

Introduction
1       The plaintiff was riding his motorcycle no. JNU9053 along Admiralty Road West towards Woodlands on 29 September 2012. The defendant was driving taxi no. SH8107G along the same road but from the opposite direction. Admiralty Road West forms a T-junction with Woodlands Ave 8, at the point where one end of Woodlands Ave 8 intersects with Admiralty Road West. The T-junction is traffic light-controlled. The defendant was turning right from Admiralty Road West into Woodlands Ave 8 at the T-junction. It was about 3.30pm. Whilst the defendant was turning at the junction, a collision occurred between the Plaintiff’s motorcycle and the Defendant’s taxi. The Plaintiff’s was travelling along Admiralty Road West and straight across the junction. The plaintiff was injured. He claims against the defendant for the injuries suffered.
2       The plaintiff says the defendant is liable for causing the collision. The plaintiff’s case is that the traffic lights were green in his favour as he rode into the junction. He proceeded straight across the junction. The defendant’s taxi suddenly made a right turn in front of his motorcycle. The plaintiff did not expect the taxi to make the turn without giving way to him. He collided into the front left portion of the taxi.
[note: 1]
3       The defendant denies liability. He says that when he approached the junction the traffic lights were green in his favour. He slowed down to almost a halt. He was on the second lane from the right. Next to him on the first lane from the right was a van waiting to make a U-turn. Almost immediately after reaching the white stop line, the green turning arrow came on. The van proceeded to make the U-turn. The defendant checked for on–coming traffic and there was none. He turned right, across the junction. Whilst he was making the right turn the plaintiff collided into the left front of his taxi.
[note: 2]
Issue
4       There is only one issue in this case. It is a factual issue. What was the state of the traffic lights at the time of the accident? The plaintiff says it was green for him. The defendant states that it was green turning arrow in his favour. These are mutually exclusive positions. If it was green light for the plaintiff, the green turning arrow would not have appeared for the defendant. If the green arrow came on for the defendant, the traffic light for the plaintiff would not have been green for the Plaintiff. It would have turned red.
Analysis and findings
5       The plaintiff and the defendant were the only witnesses at the trial. This is a case of one person’s word against another. In such cases, the court relies heavily on the objective evidence. Unfortunately, the usual objective evidence in a motor accident case does not assist in this case. The damage pattern is consistent with either version of the accident. There is no evidence of the resting positions of the vehicles. I suspect even if there were, it would also be consistent with either version. This is because whichever the state of the lights, the collision would be the same in the present case. In other words, the manner of the collision would be the same on either version of the accident. Police investigations in this case were inconclusive.
6       The only objective evidence left to be considered is the contemporaneous documentation making reference to the accident. These would include the accident reports, the police reports and the medical reports. To these I turn.
7       The plaintiff lodged a police report on 22 Oct 2012 (“first report”), about 3 weeks after the accident.
[note: 3]
 In this report, the location of the accident was stated wrongly by the plaintiff. The name of the road where the accident took place was also stated wrongly (erroneously stated to be Senoko Avenue). The plaintiff stated in this report that he was on his way back to his work place (the name of his company was given in full in describing his workplace). This would mean that he would have been on the opposite side of the road.
8       When cross-examined in court, he said that the report was written by the police officer. All he did was to give his work permit to the police officer. He also told the officer the light was green in his favour.
[note: 4]
 The plaintiff said that the police officer then wrote the report. This implies that the police officer had the information on the accident. I considered whether it was such a case, where the plaintiff after tendering his work permit when making the report, he was not required to give a narration of the accident as the accident was already in the police records. On further reflection however, it would mean that the police record of the accident contained material errors. The location of the accident was wrong. The name of the road where the accident took place was also wrong. It was also stated that the plaintiff was on his way back to his work place and that would mean that the plaintiff would have been on the wrong side of the road. These are very basic information about the accident and important information for police investigations; as they indicate where the accident took place. Without any evidence that the police records indeed contained these errors, I find it difficult to accept that the police have made these mistakes. As there is also no evidence that the report was in fact written based on information in the possession of the police, the only finding I can make is that the report was written based on information given by the plaintiff.
9       The plaintiff confirmed in court that the first report was wrong.
[note: 5]
 He made a second police report on 29 Oct 2012 (“second report”). The plaintiff said he wanted to make the second report because he realised the first report was in error.
[note: 6]
 He brought a colleague to act as translator with him. In this report he stated he was travelling on Admiralty Road West going towards a hardware shop when the accident happened. He stated that the report was “
on the best of my knowledge
” and he was yet to confirm what happened. He also stated in the second report that he could not recall what actually happened during the collision. When he was cross-examined on the second report, he seemed uncertain about the content as he agreed with counsel that this report was wrong as well.
[note: 7]
10     The third document connected with the plaintiff’s version of the accident is the Motor Vehicle Claim Form filed by the plaintiff with his insurers Pacific & Orient Insurance Co Berhad (“claim form”). This was filed on or about 16 November 2012, after the second report.
[note: 8]
 In the claim form, the plaintiff stated he was going to work when the accident happened. This was in line with the first report, but not exactly so. It was stated in the first report that he was going 
back
 to his workplace, suggesting he had gone out from his workplace and was returning when the accident happened. Both of these versions were of course wrong. As noted above, it would mean the plaintiff was travelling on the opposite side of the road (same side as the defendant). The place of accident stated in the claim form was as in the first report (Senoko Avenue), which was also erroneous. The description of the accident was also as in the first report.
11     When crossed examined by counsel on the claim form, his response was that it was filled in for him. Counsel for the plaintiff suggests in his closing submissions (paragraph 13(f)) that the plaintiff’s insurers reproduced the first accident report in the claim form because the administrative staff at the insurers’ office filled the form based on the first report available to them. Reference was made by the plaintiff’s counsel to the transcript of the re-examination of the plaintiff.
[note: 9]
 A perusal of the portion of the transcript referred to shows that this was not so. In fact, the transcript shows that when the plaintiff was asked in re-examination by his counsel whether his insurers were given anything in order to fill the claim form, the plaintiff replied that “
I do not need to give them anything.
”
12     The fourth document that referred to the plaintiff’s version of the accident is a medical report dated 2 December 2012 (“medical report”).
[note: 10]
 The medical report was attached to the plaintiff’s statement of claim. It was stated in the medical report that, “
Patient was a motorcyclist who was hit from behind by a vehicle and landed on the windshield of the car.
” This version of the accident is of course very different from the versions in the other documents considered above. The description of the accident must have originated from the plaintiff. The medical report indicated that the plaintiff was alert when he was seen by the doctor at the hospital. The plaintiff did not suggest that someone else had described how the accident happened to the doctor. The author of the medical report was not called by the plaintiff to explain the description of the accident therein.
13     The fact of the different versions above is suggestive that the plaintiff did not know for sure how the accident happened. However, the plaintiff insists that whilst he could not recollect what happened after the collision, he was clear about how the accident happened.
[note: 11]
 This was emphasised in the plaintiff’s closing submissions.
[note: 12]
 He also reiterated it in his AEIC.
[note: 13]
 However, when he was cross-examined on the description of the accident in his AEIC, and it was suggested to him that his affidavit was wrong, he agreed that “
it’s wrong
”.
[note: 14]
14     In contrast, the defendant has stated a consistent version of the accident in all three different documents produced by him. These are his accident statement, his police report and his AEIC. He also gave a consistent version in court. The plaintiff’s counsel could only point out that the defendant’s sketch of Admiralty Road West shows a 3-lane road when it was in fact a 4 lane road. Even then, the defendant explained that the 3 lanes filtered out into 4 lanes at the turning point. As to whether the road became 4 lanes after the junction, the defendant said he was not travelling that way.
[note: 15]
 He had turned right before that, and the accident happened after he had turned right.
15     The defendant was questioned in court as to why he did not see the plaintiff’s motorcycle if he had looked for on-coming traffic just before he made the right turn. The defendant’s evidence was that it took about 3 seconds for him to move off from the turning pocket where he had stopped to the point the collision took place. He checked for on-coming traffic after the green arrow had appeared, looking out at least 10m to 20m ahead.
[note: 16]
 After that, he moved off to make the turn. He did not look again in the direction of the on-coming traffic as he was looking at the direction he was driving towards.
[note: 17]
 The plaintiff had said that he was travelling at 60km/h to 70km/h as he approached the junction. Looking at the junction in the photograph at PB11, the distance from the junction to the point where the line of sight ends is about 50 to 60 m. The road bends away beyond that. In other words, anyone travelling along Admiralty Road West towards the junction would not be seen from the junction until he is 50 to 60 m from the junction. This distance is corroborated by the evidence of the plaintiff who said that when he could see the traffic lights at the junction he would be at the point where the arrows are on the road (see PB 11). Going by the plaintiff’s stated speed of travel of 60km/h to 70km/h, in the 3 seconds that the defendant said he took to move from the turning pocket to the point of collision, the plaintiff would have covered at least 50m (16.7m to 19.4m per second). Therefore, it was conceivable that the plaintiff was not in the defendant’s line of sight when he checked for on-coming traffic before he turned. He then looked in the direction he was travelling as he made the turned. The traffic light was showing the green arrow in his favour and the defendant had done all that he could and should do in the circumstances.
Conclusion
16     As mentioned above, this is a case of one person’s word against another. I only have the documents making reference to the accident to differentiate the two versions. In view of my analysis of the documents above, I prefer the defendant’s case over the plaintiff’s case. All in all, the defendant has given a more consistent version of the accident. The question raised on behalf of the plaintiff as to why the defendant did not see the plaintiff’s motorcycle prior to the collision has been adequately answered by the defendant. There is also no evidence pointing to what more the defendant could have done to prevent the collision.
17     In the circumstances, I find that the plaintiff has failed to prove his case on a balance of probability. I therefore dismiss the plaintiff’s claim. I will hear parties on costs.

Judgment Reserved.
 Choo Han Teck J:
1       Not that very long ago, it was considered rude not to take one’s sunglasses off when talking to another person. Not long ago, pedestrians were taught to “look left, look right, and then left again” before crossing the road. Nowadays, people do not remove their sunglasses in conversation, and pedestrians often cross the road diagonally with their backs to oncoming vehicular traffic, or with heads down, looking at electronic devices of one kind or other. Times and practices have changed, but road etiquette is not mere social etiquette. Proper observance of safety precautions can be a difference between safety and injury, or even life and death. Such is the issue before me in this trial.
2       The plaintiff was 21 years old and was in full time National Service in June 2011. On 2 June 2011 about 10pm, he was crossing Bukit Batok West Avenue 5 at a pedestrian crossing with the crossing lights in his favour. He was walking from right to left in front of traffic going in the direction of Brickland Road when he was knocked down by a taxi driven by the defendant. Bukit Batok West Avenue 5 was a two way road with dual lanes on each side and a road-divider with low metal fence separating the two sides. It is a well-lit road. The pedestrian crossing in question was a break in the road-divider. The plaintiff was hit after he had crossed the two lanes of traffic going in the opposite direction (coming from the direction of Brickland Road).
3       He was about two or three steps into the right lane (as one faces Brickland Road) when he was knocked down and suffered injuries to his head and hips, including fractures in those areas. The impact of the collision was caused by the front right side of the taxi. The defendant driver pleaded guilty to a charge under s 64(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) for dangerous driving. Under s 45A of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), the defendant’s conviction in admissible in evidence to prove that she knocked the plaintiff down with her taxi. In any case, none of the facts were in dispute. The defendant’s counsel, Mr Anthony Wee, conceded that the only issue concerning liability was whether the plaintiff was liable for contributory negligence. Mr Eric Liew, counsel for the plaintiff submitted that there should be no finding of any contributory negligence.
4       Mr Wee attempted to elicit from the plaintiff in cross-examination that the plaintiff might be wearing clothing that made him (the plaintiff) poorly visible. The plaintiff was unable to recall what he wore. Even if the plaintiff did not wear high visibility clothing, contributory negligence is not made out. Wearing high visibility clothing may be ideal. Rule 8 of the Highway Code (Cap 276, R 11, 1990 Rev Ed) goes as far as to suggest that pedestrians should wear white, or at the very least, carry items (such as newspapers and handkerchiefs) that would make them more visible in unlighted roads at night. However, to insist that he has to wear high visibility clothing is not the law (
Powell v Phillips
 [1972] 3 All ER 864; 
Probert v Moore
 [2012] EWHC 2324), nor does it accord with common sense – the courts cannot direct what pedestrians must wear.
5       Although Mr Wee submitted that the plaintiff ought to look left and right before crossing, I find that there was no evidence whether the plaintiff or did not do so. In any event, it is more important to note that in this case, the plaintiff was hit after he had crossed more than half the breadth of the road with the pedestrian controlled traffic lights in his favour. There are two important implications arising from this situation. First, the pedestrian can hardly be blamed for assuming that the vehicular traffic had already stopped, and those that have not would surely have done so. The second implication is that since the traffic light had been red against the defendant for such a long time, the defendant had no excuse for not having enough time to react.
6       The defendant was either deliberately running the red light, or was so oblivious of the light for so long that in either case it afforded her no excuse whatsoever. Under these circumstances, there can be no doubt that the defendant was negligent and through her negligence she had caused injury to the plaintiff for which she must be held liable. The only issue is whether the plaintiff had contributed to the accident. I am of the view that in the circumstances of this case, the plaintiff had not contributed to the accident. This is not a case in which the plaintiff pedestrian was jaywalking or crossing at a place in which he ought to have a heightened sense of caution. If that were the case, the plaintiff may be said to have contributed to the accident.
7       I note that the defendant’s lawyers submitted a report by an expert. This report states that: (1) the defendant’s view of incoming pedestrians is blocked by the railings on the road divider; and (2) the curve of Bukit Batok West Avenue 5 created a “stroboscopic effect” on the defendant’s vision at the time of the incident. Even if these were true, they are red herrings. The defendant should have stopped as the lights were against her favour for a long time. She cannot beat the red light even if no pedestrian was crossing.
8       Parties in road accidents are increasingly reliant on ‘reconstruction experts’. That may be on the advice of lawyers. However, when using such experts, the lawyers must appreciate the kind of evidence and advice the experts provide so that the costs of engaging them can properly be reduced or saved. First, photographs and sketch plans of the scene of the accident are relevant but these can be obtained from the traffic police. If a party disputes the photographs or plan he is entitled to adduce evidence of his version. This kind of evidence is evidence of fact and may not require an expensive ‘reconstructionist’ expert to produce. The second type of evidence is the opinion of the ‘expert’ witness as to how, in his view, the accident occurred and who was at fault. With respect, this is precisely the issue for the court to determine, and unlike specialist medical cases, the court in traffic accident cases will be relying on the same evidence the expert relies on in determining how the accident occurred.
9       Finally, the defendant here was a taxi driver and like drivers of commercial vehicles, especially heavy vehicles, a taxi driver is a professional driver. She drives for a living. I think that it is not requiring much for professional drivers such as the defendant to lead the way in safe and courteous driving. There is no reason why they cannot be the role models for other drivers to follow.
10     For the reasons above, I find that the accident was caused solely by the negligence of the defendant. I will hear parties as to costs if they are unable to agree costs.",2014-10-08 00:00:00,SG High Court

Adducing fresh evidence
27 January 2014
 Lee Seiu Kin J:
1       This was an appeal by the appellant against his conviction in the District Court of two charges, using criminal force with intent to outrage modesty under s 345A(2)(b) and rape under s 376(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). Both offences were committed on 28 December 2006. At the time of the incidents, the complainant was 13 years old and the appellant, 21 years old. For the charge of outraging modesty, with the additional element of voluntarily causing wrongful restraint to a person under 14 years of age, he was sentenced to 4 years’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane. For the charge of rape, he was sentenced to 7 years’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane. The sentences were ordered to run consecutively, which meant that the total sentence was 11 years’ imprisonment and 8 strokes of the cane.
2       The appellant appealed against conviction and sentence. In relation to the appeal against conviction he applied, in Criminal Motion 38 of 2012, to adduce fresh evidence. This pertained to medical evidence to show that the appellant suffered from “poor quality erections for penetrative sex”. I allowed the application and heard the evidence myself rather than direct that it be taken by the trial judge. The evidence came from a number of medical practitioners by way of affidavit and they were cross-examined in court. Having heard the evidence and studied the record of proceedings at the trial below, I dismissed the appeal. In view of the severity of the sanction and the vigour with which the appellant pursued his appeal, I set out now the detailed grounds for my decision.
Background facts
3       The complainant is the youngest of three children. She has an older brother and an older sister. Her parents are divorced. But in the first half of 2005, at least, the entire family of five was still living together in a flat. This domestic arrangement changed at some point in July or August 2005, when the appellant, who was then the boyfriend of the complainant’s sister, moved into the flat. The complainant’s brother moved out within a few months. The appellant broke up with the complainant’s sister sometime in 2006 but continued residing in the flat until 28 December 2006, the date of the incident.
4       The appellant’s behaviour during the period of his residence with the complainant’s family was the subject of conflicting testimony. On one side, the complainant, her sister and her mother all testified at the trial below that, towards the end of 2005 or in early 2006, the appellant began abusing them physically and verbally. By her own account, the complainant was abused by the appellant about once a week. This abuse consisted of being shouted at, hit or slapped, or being hit with a belt or clothes hanger. The complainant’s mother testified that she was abused a few times a week; she was shouted at, punched or kicked, or hit with a belt, and once, was hit on the head with a cooking pot. The complainant’s sister testified that she endured raps to the head with the appellant’s knuckles, being hit by a wet towel, and once, being kicked in the stomach and punched in the face. Yet he was not evicted from the flat because he would express remorse and seek forgiveness after the incidents of abuse. This caused them – or at least the complainant’s mother – to feel sorry enough for him that they did not make a police report or otherwise compel him to leave. The complainant further testified that the appellant started to take a romantic interest in her after he broke up with her sister. The complainant said that he touched her, tried to kiss her on the lips, tried to smell her body, and told her that it was God’s will that she become his wife. According to the complainant’s mother, the appellant would put his head on the complainant’s lap and would also kiss the complainant. The complainant’s sister told the Court that she heard him saying indecent and suggestive things to the complainant over the phone.
5       On the other side, the appellant categorically denied that any of these instances of abuse or inappropriate touching ever occurred. He added that the complainant’s mother had on one occasion made an unwelcome sexual overture to him in rather forthright fashion; he was ready to quit the flat at this point but was persuaded to stay when told that his departure would be devastating for the complainant’s sister, not least because she would discover her mother’s indiscretion. The trial judge did not believe the appellant’s version of events. He accepted instead the version put forward by the complainant and her family members.
Events of 28 December 2006
6       The complainant testified in the trial that, around 2.00pm on 28 December 2006, she was sitting in one of the flat’s three bedrooms reading a book, when the appellant went in and put his head on her groin in spite of her attempts to push him away. He then sent her mother out of the house, returned and locked the bedroom door, and proceeded to pull the complainant’s pants and panties off. He shoved a part of the bed sheet into her mouth, held her down, and pushed her shirt and bra up, whereupon he sucked, licked and kissed her nipples. That was as far as he went before he permitted her to put her clothes back on. He forced her to swear on the Bible that she would marry him. Once he left the bedroom, she locked herself in the adjacent bedroom and called her sister, who had been out of the house since the morning. Without revealing what had just transpired, she asked her sister to come back home quickly, only to be informed that her sister was unable to do so.
7       The complainant’s mother arrived back at the flat later that afternoon. The complainant testified that she did not have an opportunity to tell her mother what had happened until the appellant left for work at around 6.00pm. About an hour later, the appellant called, asking to speak to the complainant. She told him that she did not like him and had no intention of fulfilling her promise to marry him, which made him angry. Shortly after this call, the complainant joined her mother as the latter went about her part-time job of conducting door-to-door surveys in the neighbourhood. She had done this for about an hour before the appellant called again, this time to say that he was on his way home from work in a taxi. He picked up the complainant and her mother along the way and the taxi conveyed the three of them to their block.
8       The complainant testified that the appellant locked her mother out of the flat. He then pushed the complainant into the same bedroom in which he touched her that afternoon and locked the door. He pointed a Swiss Army knife at her and demanded that she take off her clothes. When she did not comply he came over and removed her clothes himself and then removed his own clothes. He pushed her onto the bed and went on top of her. He touched her genitals and inserted a finger into her vagina. He proceeded to penetrate her vagina with his penis repeatedly. He was interrupted while doing so by knocking on the bedroom door. It was the complainant’s sister; she had just got back and managed to gain entry to the flat because she had a set of keys to the front gate. The appellant shouted at the complainant’s sister to go away, which she did. The appellant resumed penetrating the complainant’s vagina with his penis. He eventually stopped and went out of the bedroom, to where the complainant’s mother and sister waited. He told them that the complainant was now his wife. An argument ensued because the complainant’s mother wanted to have the complainant undergo a medical examination but the appellant did not want that. The appellant finally agreed that they could go to the hospital, provided that he accompanied them there and that the complainant did not take a “virginity test”. The four of them took a taxi to KK Women’s & Children’s Hospital. There the complainant and her mother managed to separate themselves from the appellant. They told the doctors that the appellant had raped the complainant. The police were called and the appellant was taken in for questioning. The complainant’s version of the events of 28 December 2006 was broadly corroborated by the testimonies of her mother and sister.
9       The appellant’s version of events at the trial was as follows. He returned to the flat on the morning of 28 December 2006 after having done an overnight shift as a part-time security guard on Pulau Ubin. He had a running nose and a headache, and so he took some medicine and went to bed immediately. He slept until 3.30pm or 4.00pm, and got up to get ready to leave for another overnight shift in Pulau Ubin. The complainant’s mother prepared some food for him and he left the flat no later than 5.00pm. Already feeling ill when he left, he vomited while at work. When the complainant’s mother called him shortly after this he apprised her of his intention to go home. He obtained his employer’s permission to leave and made his way back to the flat. There was no one at home when he got there around 9.45pm. He called the complainant’s mother for reasons he could not recall, then took some more medicine and slept. Sometime later, the complainant’s mother woke him up. She told him that the complainant was not feeling well and requested him to follow the three of them to the hospital. He was tired and declined to do so, but when she persisted he agreed to go along. He stayed outside the Accident & Emergency registration room because it was cold inside, but when he later attempted to join the others in the room, he was prevented from doing so by the security guards. The trial judge accepted the version of events put forward by the complainant, and on that basis he convicted the appellant on the charges.
Fresh medical evidence
10     The fresh medical evidence which the appellant sought to adduce in support of his appeal was to show that he had difficulty achieving an erection. He conceded that he was not wholly incapable of penetrative sexual intercourse, but his case was that his erection was of such poor quality that he could not have used his penis to penetrate the vagina of the complainant in the circumstances described by her. On her evidence, throughout his penetration of her, he was holding her arms down as she struggled to break free from under him, and in addition he was grasping the Swiss Army knife in his hand. He would therefore not have been able to use his hands to guide his penis into her vagina. The appellant contended that, given further that the complainant’s vagina would be more difficult to penetrate since she was a virgin, penetration without use of his hand would only be possible with an erection of good quality which he could not attain, or at least could not sustain for any substantial duration.
11     In order to make sense of the medical evidence, it is necessary first to understand the physiological process by which a penis becomes erect. The explanation I attempt here is a simplification of the evidence given by the medical experts in court in this appeal. Upon sexual stimulation, the arteries supplying blood to the penis dilate, increasing the blood flow to the organ. This causes the spongy tissue within the penis to fill up with blood. This engorgement stretches a semi-elastic membrane that surrounds the spongy tissue, which in turn leads to compression of the veins through which blood flows out of the penis. The compression of the veins reduces the flow of blood out of the penis, causing more blood to collect in the spongy tissue, leading to further engorgement. This results in an increase in the length and girth of the penis. When the stretching limit of the semi-elastic membrane is reached, the penis no longer increases in length and girth. Instead, the blood flowing into the penis goes towards increasing the rigidity or hardness of the penis.
12     The appellant submitted that the medical evidence, consisting of the results of and observations from three medical tests performed on him, showed that he suffered from what the experts termed a “venous leak”. This was inadequate compression of the veins carrying blood away from the penis, leading to decreased retention of blood in the penis as compared to the situation where there was no venous leak. This would prevent the appellant from attaining or sustaining an erection rigid enough to enable him to penetrate a woman’s vagina without the need to use his hand to aid insertion.
Approach taken in evaluating the evidence
13     The prosecution submitted that, by reason of section 105 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), the appellant bore the burden of proving “that he was unable to commit the 
actus reus
 of the offence at the material time” because it was he who instituted the appeal. I rejected this submission without hesitation. It is always the prosecution’s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an accused person committed the offence with which he is charged. If there is a reasonable doubt, an acquittal must follow. This is so on appeal just as it is at trial. Even if the convicted person adduces fresh evidence on appeal, as in the present case, it remains the prosecution’s burden to persuade the appellant court that, notwithstanding the fresh evidence, there exists no reasonable doubt as to the correctness of the conviction.
14     The fresh evidence in the present case was somewhat involved, in that it necessitated grappling with the mechanics of the medical tests conducted on the appellant and conflicting interpretations of the data and observations from those tests. As such it was not difficult to become so enmeshed in the intricacies of the science as to lose sight of the primary question in these legal proceedings, which was whether the appellant’s conviction should be affirmed or set aside. Therefore I was mindful that, while I should be cognisant of the technical details and nuances of the fresh medical evidence, I could not consider that evidence in isolation but had to do so together with the evidence adduced at the trial below, in order to determine whether, on an evaluation of the totality of the evidence, there was a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt.
Evaluation of the fresh medical evidence
15     As I have mentioned, the fresh medical evidence revolved around three medical tests conducted on the appellant. The first was a Doppler ultrasound test conducted on 10 December 2011. The second was also a Doppler ultrasound test, conducted on 10 September 2012. The third was a cavernosography conducted on 17 December 2012. These tests began with an injection of a drug called Caverject into the appellant’s penis. Caverject causes dilation of the arteries supplying blood to the penis and thus induces an erection. In the Doppler ultrasound tests, measurements of the velocity of blood flow in the blood vessels in the penis are taken. The existence of a venous leak could be inferred if the velocity of blood exceeds a certain threshold. In the cavernosography, a contrast fluid or dye is injected into the penis ten minutes after the Caverject injection, and X-ray scans of the penis taken to visually track the flow of the contrast fluid. The existence of a venous leak would be indicated by contrast fluid escaping the spongy tissue of the penis and entering the veins.
16     The first Doppler ultrasound test produced a reading suggesting that no venous leak existed, whereas the second produced a reading suggesting that there was a venous leak on the left side of his penis. The cavernosography confirmed that the appellant did indeed suffer from a venous leak, albeit a “mild” one, on the left side of his penis. This much was not controversial. However, the experts disagreed about the extent of such venous leak. This disagreement was possible despite the characterisation of the leak as “mild” in the cavernosography results because the amounts of Caverject administered in the three tests were not uniform. In the first Doppler ultrasound test and the cavernosography the dose was 20 micrograms, but in the second Doppler ultrasound test the dose was 10 micrograms. The appellant’s main expert, Dr Peter Lim (“Dr Lim”), opined that a 20-microgram dose was unusually high and might “mask” the venous leak, 
ie
, cause it to appear less severe than it was, and perhaps even to the extent of causing it not to show up at all. The prosecution’s main expert, Dr Ng Kok Kit, maintained that a 20-microgram dose was within the normal range and that the appellant’s venous leak was, at most, merely “mild”.
17     For reasons which should become apparent later I did not think that I was able or needed to arrive at a firm conclusion as to how probable it was that the appellant suffered from venous leak at the time of the alleged offences, or to ascertain the extent of the venous leak which might have afflicted him then. But I was satisfied that, by 10 September 2012, the date of the second Doppler ultrasound test, the appellant was suffering from venous leak. More to the point, it meant that in a clinical environment he could not sustain an erection hard enough for penetrative sex for more than several minutes. Separately, it appeared to me pertinent that the tests showed that even when the appellant’s penis was at its maximum erection, that is, at maximum girth and length and maximum hardness, it was pointing downwards, at an angle of 10 degrees below the horizontal. Dr Lim said that this would have made it even more difficult for the appellant to penetrate the complainant’s vagina while she was lying on her back and he was on top of her, which I accepted.
18     However, in my judgment, the nature of the fresh medical evidence was such as to limit substantially its probative value in relation to the primary question of the appellant’s guilt. First, the evidence was obtained in a sterile clinical laboratory environment. The prosecution’s medical experts stated that the effect of the drug on the appellant’s penis in a clinical setting may well differ greatly from the situation when he is sexually aroused. Secondly and more importantly, the medical evidence was based on tests conducted some five to six years after the incident. The quality of the appellant’s erection when the medical tests were conducted on him may not necessarily reflect the quality of his erection at the time of the alleged offences. Dr Lim testified that the venous leak had to be congenital, either in the sense of its having existed since birth, or in the sense of the tendency to develop it having been there since birth, and this was not seriously challenged by the other experts. But even if it could be said unequivocally that the appellant had venous leak by the time of the alleged offences, it could not be known how serious the leak was at that time. Dr Lim said that based on how “hopeless” the appellant’s erection was when he examined it following the medical test, the appellant’s venous leak must already have been severe in 2006.
19     However, given that the first Doppler ultrasound test conducted on 10 December 2011 returned readings suggesting that the appellant did not suffer from venous leak, it appeared to me possible that venous leak was a relatively recent development in the appellant’s health history, manifesting only after this first test was conducted on him. As I have said Dr Lim’s response was that the 20-microgram dose of Caverject administered during this test might have “masked” the venous leak, but the medical literature placed before me did not assert that a 20-microgram dose was outside the acceptable range for diagnostic purposes. I did not think it possible to tell whether a 10-microgram or 20-microgram dose more closely approximated the appellant’s physiological functions in ordinary life. In any event, I also considered it possible that the appellant did have venous leak at the time of this first test, except that the Doppler ultrasound test failed to disclose it because that test, unlike the cavernosography, cannot furnish direct visual evidence of a leak. Given these uncertainties, I could not make any definitive findings on the question of how the quality of the appellant’s erection might have changed over time.
20     It bears reiterating that the appellant’s case was not that he was physically incapable of using his penis to penetrate the complainant’s vagina. Rather, it was that he could not have penetrated her in the manner in which she described, 
viz
, without using his hands to guide his penis into her vagina. Thus his case depended on the premise that the complainant’s testimony was that he did not use his hands for assistance when penetrating her. However, a close scrutiny of the Notes of Evidence did not support this contention. The complainant did say in her testimony that the appellant held his Swiss Army knife in his hand for the entire duration of the alleged rape. She also said that she struggled throughout the alleged rape, and that he held her down by holding her arms. But the complainant had also stated that, prior to penetrating her, the appellant “touched [her] private area” and “inserted a finger inside slightly”. This was explicit testimony from the complainant of a moment when the appellant’s hand or hands were not holding her down. From this it was clear that the complainant’s narrative contemplated that his hands were not restraining her all the time. The counter-argument which the appellant might have advanced was that the complainant could well have intended to draw a distinction between the circumstances during the alleged rape and the circumstances preceding it. For example, the complainant’s testimony that the appellant held her arms while holding the Swiss Army knife appeared on its face to be limited to the duration of his alleged penetration of her with his penis, and not to extend to the events prior to it, 
ie
, his using his mouth on her breasts and his digital penetration of her. But that was because the examination-in-chief and cross-examination which elicited this testimony was exclusively directed towards what happened during the alleged rape. At no time was the complainant asked whether the appellant was using both hands to restrain her throughout the incident. It would be reasonable to infer that the appellant had to subdue the complainant from the time he began to touch her against her will, and not merely while he was using his penis to penetrate her. On that supposition, if the appellant was able to use his hand to touch her private area and penetrate her with his finger, it would seem entirely possible that he was free to use at least one hand for assistance when penetrating her with his penis. In short, I considered that the complainant’s testimony, addressed as it was to targeted, focussed questions in examination-in-chief and cross-examination, should not be construed narrowly as necessarily implying that the appellant did not use his hands while penetrating her vagina with his penis. On the contrary I thought that her evidence was entirely equivocal on that point.
21     In my judgment, therefore, the appellant’s case in relation to the fresh medical evidence was built on a shaky premise. For that reason the degree to which the evidence would be probative of the appellant’s guilt was limited. I thought that the evidence remained a relevant factor to be taken into account when assessing the case as a whole, since erectile difficulties on the appellant’s part at the time of the alleged offence would have made it more difficult for him to penetrate the complainant with his penis in the context of a struggle. This would diminish, at least marginally, the credibility of the complainant’s testimony. However, the fresh medical evidence was far from the decisive source of reasonable doubt that the appellant portrayed it to be.
Evaluation of all the evidence
22     And so I turned to the evidence that was adduced at the trial below. The testimony of the complainant was key, providing as it did the only direct evidence that the appellant committed the offences as charged, since the offences were alleged to have taken place in private behind a locked door. In cases of this nature the appellate court generally places substantial weight on the trial judge’s assessment of the complainant’s testimony, on the basis that the trial judge had the advantage of observing her demeanour as she gave evidence in court. This approach is wholly sensible, but of course it is accompanied by a consciousness that the appellate court cannot abdicate its duty to examine the evidence with care. In the present case this consciousness was especially at the forefront because I was privy to evidence that the trial judge had not heard, which evidence might have had an influence on his decision. Accordingly, notwithstanding the finding of the trial judge below that the complainant’s evidence was “unusually convincing”, I subjected her testimony to rigorous study.
23     My conclusion was that the complainant’s account of events, albeit available to me only in cold print, appeared to come from someone who had lived through the events described. Her recollection was clear, and her answers to questions asked in clarification or amplification were consistent and had a flow to it that could not have been possible had it been entirely invented, as would be the case if the appellant’s version were the truth. From the Notes of Evidence it was not possible to discern her hesitations, her tone of voice and her body language, all of which the trial judge would have had regard to; but I could see that long pauses of at least nine seconds and “sniffing” were recorded as she testified about the alleged rape and the immediate aftermath of it. These were consistent with an emotional state triggered by recollection of a traumatic event, although the possibility of nervousness on her part could also be a factor.
24     Next I considered whether and to what extent the other evidence corroborated the complainant’s testimony. Her mother and sister testified that the appellant and the complainant were together in the locked bedroom on the night of 28 December 2006, and that when they emerged the complainant was distraught. This furnished significant support to the complainant’s account, but because the appellant alleged that the complainant and her mother and sister were in a conspiracy to implicate him falsely, I left aside the testimonies of the mother and sister from my consideration for the time being, and had regard instead to the testimonies of independent parties against whom no plausible accusation of conspiracy could be levelled.
25     What cannot be doubted is that in the early morning of 28 December 2006 the appellant, the complainant, her mother and her sister went to KK Hospital, where they alleged that the appellant had raped the complainant. Two medical examinations were conducted on the complainant within a fairly short time, between six and 11 hours after the alleged rape. The doctor who conducted the later examination recorded a number of hymen tears as well as superficial abrasions on the muscle slightly below the hymen. The hymen tears appeared fresh based on the colour of the blood, which meant that the tears had probably been made within 24 hours of the examination; the doctor opined that the tears could not have been more than two days old. These injuries were consistent with a sexual assault involving penetration. A few months later the complainant underwent a psychiatric examination in which she narrated a version of the events of 28 December 2006 that was identical in material respects to that which she gave in court. She informed the psychiatrist that she had insomnia, nightmares and poor appetite, and was easily startled when touched.
26     The complainant’s uncle, her mother’s brother, testified that prior to the incident, the complainant had told him that she had been physically abused by the appellant. The pastor of the church attended by the complainant’s family testified that the complainant earlier told him that the appellant had “touched” her, and that her mother had earlier confided that the appellant physically abused the female members of the family. The evidence of these two witnesses, while in my view reliable, was not directly probative of the appellant’s guilt, since even an established pattern of physical abuse and inappropriate touching would not necessarily mean that the appellant was likely to have committed the offences, and moreover, they were in no position to verify the truth of what they were told by the complainant and/or her mother. Nonetheless, I thought that this was relevant evidence. If what the complainant told her uncle and the church pastor were true, it would undermine the credibility of the appellant, who maintained that he did not at any point abuse the complainant or her family. If it were claimed that what she told them was false, it would mean that she had begun telling lies about the appellant in a sustained campaign that finally culminated in baseless accusations of sexual assault on 28 December 2006; this would be less probable than a claim that she lied only about the events of 28 December 2006, and in this way the testimonies of the uncle and the church pastor made it less likely that the complainant was untruthful.
27     In my opinion, the present case could ultimately be reduced to two stark possibilities. Either the appellant committed the offences, or the complainant framed him for something he did not do, with the complicity or acquiescence of her mother and sister. Having evaluated the evidence I formed the view that the latter possibility was highly improbable. I found that the testimonies of the complainant and her sister and mother were generally consistent with one another. Some inconsistencies might be identified, but they were all minor and appeared to be of little significance, as should be evident from the few examples I shall cite. First, the complainant testified that, after she, her mother and the appellant alighted from the taxi prior to the rape, her mother and the appellant argued all the way up to the house, whereas her mother testified that she stayed behind to pay the taxi fare. Second, the complainant testified that, after she emerged from the bedroom following the alleged rape, she told her mother that her private parts were painful, whereas her mother testified that she could not talk and simply gestured to her private parts, and her sister testified that she neither said a word nor gestured but simply stood there crying. Third, the complainant testified that when her sister knocked on the bedroom door during the alleged rape, the appellant shouted at her to go away, whereas the sister testified that when she knocked the complainant said in Tamil “You go first I’m okay”. These inconsistencies seemed to me simply to be lapses of memory in relation to trifling details, and not tell-tale signs of mendacity.
28     The appellant suggested a number of possible reasons why the complainant and/or her mother and sister would wish to implicate him falsely. These reasons were rather speculative, but I appreciated that if he were truly innocent he might be completely in the dark as to why they would seek to frame him. Nevertheless, despite giving him the benefit of the doubt in that regard, I could not see any plausible reason for their wanting to frame him. The appellant also argued that there were parts of the complainant’s story that did not make sense. First, he argued that it was unbelievable that the complainant would not have gone to the police if it were true that he abused and touched her prior to the alleged rape. However, I did not think it unbelievable given her young age and the fact that she did tell other people about it. Second, the appellant argued that, on the night of the alleged rape, it was unbelievable that the complainant and her mother would have been willing to get into the taxi with him given what had allegedly transpired in the afternoon, ie, his molesting the complainant. But again I did not think this unbelievable because it could simply be that the complainant and her mother did not expect that the appellant would go further and commit rape, and furthermore there was evidence that the complainant’s mother was accustomed to obey the appellant from a mix of fear and low self-esteem.
29     Finally, there was the medical evidence to contend with. If the complainant lied that the appellant penetrated her, it would have to mean either that someone else penetrated her around the same time, a fact which she then swiftly exploited to frame the appellant, or that she somehow inflicted the hymen tears and muscle abrasions on herself in order to buttress her lie. I considered those alternatives to be most improbable.
Conclusion
30     For all these reasons, even taking into account the fresh medical evidence adduced on appeal, I did not think it at all probable that the complainant was untruthful in making her allegations against the appellant. I was therefore satisfied that there was no reasonable doubt that on 28 December 2006 the appellant committed the offences against her with which he was charged. I therefore dismissed the appeal against conviction. I likewise dismissed the appeal against sentence. I did not think that the individual sentences imposed in respect of each of the two charges was manifestly excessive; and I did not think that the judge below erred in ordering that the sentences run consecutively rather than concurrently as the total punishment of 11 years’ imprisonment and 8 strokes of the cane was clearly not manifestly excessive.",2014-01-27 00:00:00,SG High Court

Introduction
1       This case involved a most unfortunate incident which took place on Sunday, 10 August 2008, the day after National Day. On that fateful day, there was a downpour and rain flowed into an eight-storey commercial cum residential building (with a basement) known as The Luxe (“the Luxe Building”) located at No 6 Handy Road (“the Luxe site”). The Luxe Building is owned by JBE Properties Pte Ltd (“the first plaintiff”), and the main contractor for its construction was Gammon Pte Ltd (“Gammon”). The event on 10 August 2008 will hereinafter be referred to as “the flooding incident”.
2       At the material time, construction was going on at a site adjoining the Luxe Building, at No 20 Handy Road (“the Nomu site”), of a twelve-storey mixed development project called The Nomu (“the Nomu Building”) which is owned by Handy Investments Pte Ltd (“the first defendant”). The first defendant had engaged Seng Systems Engineering Pte Ltd (“the second defendant”) as the main contractor for the construction of the Nomu Building (“the works”).
3       The managing-director of the first plaintiff is Patrick Lam Kong Yin (“Patrick Lam”), while his wife Christina Sui Fong Fong (“the second plaintiff”) is the sole-proprietor of Yisulang Art Gallery which is in the business of selling handicrafts, collectibles and gifts. The first defendant’s general manager (and its witness) is Ow Peng Seang (“Ow”), while the second defendant’s director who testified on its behalf is Ke Koon Seng (“Ke”). The other witnesses in the trial that was spread out over four tranches will be identified later.
4       The Luxe Building sits at the front and bottom of the steep slope that is behind Handy Road (“the slope”). Indeed, the level of the roads behind the Luxe Building and Handy Road, 
viz
, Mount Sophia Road and Adis Road (“Mount Sophia/Adis Road”) is about 12m higher than the 3
rd
 storey of the Luxe Building. The Nomu Building on the other hand is built from the road level of Handy Road into the slope such that its floors rise up to almost the level of Mount Sophia/Adis Road. There is a boundary wall built alongside the Nomu Building (“the Nomu boundary wall”) that separates the Nomu site from part of the Luxe site. There is one point along the boundary line where the Nomu boundary wall meets the Luxe Building’s curved retaining wall (“Luxe wall”) that the first plaintiff had constructed. The point of contact forms a triangular-shaped area near where the Luxe sump (see [10] below) is located.
5       There is a gap between the Nomu boundary wall and the Luxe side of the slope which is shotcreted and filled with concrete. The plaintiffs referred to this gap as “the Luxe gully” in their submissions. Immediately below the Luxe gully is an area which the plaintiffs in their submissions called the “Workspace”, and is shown in the photograph at p 1041 of the agreed bundle of documents (“AB”). The plaintiffs alleged that it was the defendants who had backfilled the Workspace (“the backfilled area”). Beside the backfilled area, Gammon’s landscaping subcontractor Tropical Environment Pte Ltd (“Tropical”) had covered an area of the Luxe side of the slope with wire mesh materials called “geotextile” and/or “geogrid” to prevent and arrest soil erosion. Tropical then planted that area with a plant known as Wedelia Trilobata (“Wedelia”). Gammon had in fact installed geogrid at this area even before the adjoining Workspace had been backfilled.
6       A large part of the slope belongs to the Cathay Organisation, which owns and operates the Cathay chain of cinemas in Singapore. The Nomu site was previously a car park for the use of Cathay cinema patrons before the first defendant purchased it and developed the Nomu Building.
7       Construction of the Luxe Building (“the Luxe project”) started in April 2006 and it was completed in the first quarter of 2008 with the Temporary Occupation Permit (“TOP”) being issued on 30 April 2008. The construction of the Nomu Building (“the Nomu project”) began around January 2007 and its TOP was issued on 16 March 2009.
8       A part of the rain and surface run-off from Mount Sophia/Adis Road flows into a storm drain in existence before the construction of either the Luxe or Nomu Buildings. This storm drain runs alongside the road and, from there, the run-off goes through a culvert pipe underneath Mount Sophia Road, enters a cascading drain (“the cascade drain”) that runs down the slope, and then goes into a pre-existing sump (“the Nomu sump”, also referred to by the defendants as “the Nomu shallow sump”) situated within and partly outside the boundary line of the Nomu site near the top of the slope. Neither the cascade drain nor the Nomu sump was constructed by the defendants.
9       From the Nomu sump at the upper level, water would be carried down to Handy Road by an open drain inside the boundary of the Nomu site. The open drain was removed in the course of construction of the Nomu Building and replaced by an internal drainage system constructed by the first defendant within the Nomu site. Rainwater is now discharged from the Nomu sump via a 300mm conduit pipe to a newly constructed deep sump (“the Nomu deep sump”) built within the Nomu site, and in turn the Nomu deep sump discharges the water through the new drainage system down the slope to Handy Road.
10     On the Luxe site, there is an internal drain at the rear of the Luxe Building to cater for the rain and surface run-off from the slope (“the Luxe drain”). The Luxe drain discharges into an internal sump (“the Luxe sump”) that is located next to and at the bottom of the Luxe wall. For ease of reference, Annexure A to this judgment is a plan showing the locations of the three sumps referred to earlier, the planted area, the backfilled area, as well as the Luxe wall and the Nomu boundary wall.
11     On that pluvious Sunday, moderate rain (about 23.4mm) fell between 12.00 noon and 1.00pm. According to the plaintiffs, the volume of rain resulted in an accumulation of sand, silt and mud that first flowed into the Nomu sump and, when that sump could not cope, overflowed and entered the Luxe sump, causing the Luxe sump to choke. Consequently, sand, silt and mud outflowed from the Luxe sump and entered the Luxe Building through an exhaust pipe outlet and a mechanical ventilation opening (“the MV opening”) (collectively referred to hereinafter as “the Openings”) which were located at the rear of the Luxe wall, near the Luxe drain and the Luxe sump. (The Openings were relocated after the flooding incident – the exhaust pipe outlet now sits on top of the Luxe wall which height is about 2m, while the MV opening is now inside the Luxe Building.)
12     It was unfortunate that the second plaintiff had arranged to hold an exhibition of contemporary Chinese ink paintings (“the exhibition”) between 7 August and 7 September 2008 in the halls on the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 storeys of the Luxe Building. To that end and purpose, the second plaintiff had engaged a third party graphic designer to design and print banners, posters, brochures and other promotional materials, and had also advertised the exhibition in magazines and periodicals. The second plaintiff had hosted a party for invited guests at the exhibition’s opening on 6 August 2008.
13     The water ingress into the Luxe Building flooded the halls on the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 storeys, resulting in fixtures and contents therein being partially submerged and damaged by muddy water. Even after the subsequent clean-up, the false ceiling, walls and flooring of the halls were covered with unsightly yellowish-brown stains. After discussions with the first plaintiff, the second plaintiff decided to and did cancel the exhibition.
14     Not surprisingly, the plaintiffs held the defendants responsible for the damage caused to the Luxe Building arising out of the flooding incident and commenced these proceedings in January 2011.
The pleadings
15     In their statement of claim, the plaintiffs alleged, 
inter alia
, that the two defendants owed them a duty to exercise reasonable care in carrying out the construction of the Nomu Building such that the works did not cause damage to the adjoining properties, especially the Luxe Building. In the alternative, it was alleged that the first defendant owed the plaintiffs a duty to use reasonable skill and/or care in carrying out the works as the nature of the works involved a special danger to others including the plaintiffs.
16     The plaintiffs alleged that the flooding incident was caused by the defendants’ negligence or breach of duty which they particularised, 
inter alia
, as follows:
(a)     causing to be disposed in the Luxe sump materials which included construction debris, leaves and plastic sheets, resulting in the Luxe sump being blocked or choked so that it could not function or function at its optimum capacity;
(b)     failing to exercise reasonable or any care in maintaining the tidiness and/or cleanliness at the Nomu site and/or the Nomu sump;
(c)     failing to erect or build any temporary or permanent barrier between the Luxe Building and the Nomu site; and
(d)     failing to prevent materials including construction debris, leaves and plastic sheets from being disposed in the Luxe sump.
17     In the alternative, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had caused a nuisance by allowing rainwater and surface run-off to escape from the Nomu site and be discharged into the Luxe site.
18     In the further alternative, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had failed to comply with cll 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 of the Code of Practice on Surface Water Drainage issued by the Public Utilities Board (“the PUB Code”).
19     The plaintiffs’ final claim was based on the doctrine of 
res ipsa loquitur
.
20     The common defence filed by the defendants essentially denied liability for the damage resulting from the flooding incident. The defendants contended that the alleged flooding and loss was not caused by the second defendant’s construction activities on behalf of the first defendant, nor did any accumulation of debris and/or planks (if any) around the Nomu sump cause or contribute to the flooding incident. The defendants contended that the sump and drains in the Nomu site were functioning properly, and that any planks and/or scaffolding erected by the second defendant at the first defendant’s premises did not cause or contribute to the alleged flooding of the Luxe Building. The defendants added that the run-off from the Nomu site did not cause or contribute to the flooding incident.
21     The defendants averred that the alleged flooding was caused by the overflow of water from the open drain (measuring 300mm) from Mount Sophia/Adis Road and/or the area above the Luxe site.
22     In the alternative, the defendants contended that the alleged flooding was not caused by the works, but was instead caused by, resulted from and/or contributed to by the first plaintiff’s earthworks, slope works, planting and gardening works at the slope of the Luxe site and/or by the design of the Luxe Building.
23     In the further alternative, the defendants contended that if the works caused or resulted in the alleged flooding (which was denied), the same was caused or contributed to by: (a) the failure of the first plaintiff to maintain its drains and/or the Luxe sump in proper working order; and/or (b) the erection and/or building of the Openings too close to the drains and/or the Luxe sump.
24     Although neither the cascade drain nor the Nomu sump were constructed by or belonged to the first defendant, the first defendant accepted that as the owner and occupier of the Nomu site, it was responsible for the maintenance of the Nomu sump which it contended operated normally on the day of the flooding incident.
25     I should point out at this juncture that the defendants’ complaint (in its closing submissions at paras 10 and 11) of difficulty in understanding and meeting the plaintiffs’ allegedly ambiguous case is without merit. The plaintiffs’ pleadings were clear and precise enough for the defendants to meet the case.
26     As for the Reply, in essence the plaintiffs averred that between the dates of the TOP of the Luxe Building and the flooding incident, no works including earth or slope works were carried out by the first plaintiff at the Luxe site or the slope. The plaintiffs contended that the height of the MV opening was adequate while the Luxe sump as well as the Luxe drain were suitable for surface run-off from the Luxe side of the slope.
27     The first plaintiff also denied that it had allowed or caused any construction (or other) debris to accumulate in the Luxe drain or the Luxe sump. If the Luxe drain and/or the Luxe sump were either not functioning or not functioning at their optimum capacity, it was due to or contributed to by the construction (and other) debris that overflowed from the Nomu site.
The issues
28     The factual and legal issues the court must determine are:
(a)     Did the construction (or other) debris that flowed into the Nomu sump and the Nomu deep sump come from the Nomu site or from somewhere else?
(b)     Would the Luxe sump have been able to cope with the volume of rainfall on 10 August 2008 had there been no construction (or other) debris flowing into the Nomu sump and the Nomu deep sump?
(c)     Was it the rain on 10 August 2008 that washed the construction (or other) debris down the slope or was it some other cause?
(d)     Were the exhaust pipe outlet and the MV opening of the Luxe Building too low or incorrectly located, which caused the water inflow into the Luxe Building from the Luxe sump?
(e)     Can the plaintiffs rely on the doctrine of 
res ipsa loquitur
 to hold the defendants liable?
The evidence
29     The plaintiffs and the defendants called 14 and eight witnesses respectively for the 18 days’ trial which was only to determine liability. Depending on the findings of this court, the issue of assessing damages for the plaintiffs’ loss would be dealt with at a later stage by the Registrar of the Supreme Court. The plaintiffs had two experts while the defendants had three, not including an engineer, Stephanie Chew, who was subpoenaed from the PUB by the defendants to rebut the plaintiffs’ allegation in [18] above – that the defendants had breached the PUB Code by failing to provide proper or adequate drainage facilities for the Nomu site.
30     At the behest of the parties and accompanied by the representatives from both parties, their counsel as well as their experts, the court made a site visit on 25 September 2012 to the Nomu Building as well as the premises of the former Methodist Girls’ School (“MGS”) at Mount Sophia/Adis Road, for the purpose of ascertaining the path of the run-off that flowed from the slope and the two roads. The site visit established that Mount Sophia/Adis Road, MGS and other buildings in the locality have their own drainage system down to Handy Road. Save for a plot of land approximating 2,093m², rain and run-off from that high area does not enter the cascade drain or the Nomu sump. Some rain from a separate (and smaller) plot of land (164m²) also flows into the Nomu sump.
31     I should also add that amongst the exhibits tendered in court (see N/E 414–415) were: (a) ten soil samples taken from different locations on the Luxe side of the slope; (b) the same soil samples after they had been washed; (c) samples of concreting and plastering sand; and (d) the same concreting and plastering samples after they had been washed. Samples of wire mesh materials used by the first plaintiffs (as well as other commercial alternatives like “geocell”) to prevent soil erosion on the slope were also exhibited in court, of which more will be said later. Two of the many volumes of agreed bundles of documents in court (
ie
, vols 5 and 6) comprised photographs of the Nomu and Luxe sites taken at various times before and after the flooding incident.
The plaintiffs’ case 
32     The plaintiffs asserted that the rainfall on 10 August 2008 was moderate and unremarkable. Because of conditions around the Nomu sump, however, that sump was not able to fully discharge the rain that entered the same. Consequently, water from the top of the slope (Mount Sophia/Adis Road) which was supposed to be discharged into the (lower) Nomu deep sump overflowed into the Luxe sump. The sudden rush of water from the Nomu site caused construction debris, sand, silt and/or other materials to be washed into the Luxe sump. The materials ended up choking the Luxe sump such that it could no longer discharge or cope with the already large volume of rain overflow; the subsequent water ingress into the Openings culminated in the flooding incident. Consequently, the proximate cause of the flooding was the surge of water which overflowed from the Nomu site.
33     In support of its case, the plaintiffs called the following factual witnesses:
(a)
Patrick Lam;
(b)
Naim Bin Kamis, a general worker employed by the first plaintiff who works at the Luxe Building;
(c)
Lim Kok Kim (“KK Lim”), an engineer from TY Lin International Pte Ltd who were the structural engineers for the Luxe Building;
(d)
Ho Wan Fong (“HWF”), an engineer and Qualified Person (“QP”) from J Roger Preston (S) Pte Ltd (“J Roger Preston”) who were the appointed mechanical and electrical (“M&E”) consultants for the Luxe Building in 2005;
(e)
Gan Chee Keong (“GCK”), a project manager from Gammon;
(f)
Kerk Yau Lan (“Kerk”), the site foreman of the second defendant in 2008;
(g)
Seow Seng Cheong (“Seow”), the project manager of the second defendant in 2008;
(h)
Tan Beng Cheng (“TBC”), a structural engineer from CS Consulting Engineers Pte Ltd (“CS Consulting”) who were the structural engineers for the Nomu Building;
(i)
Ng Kok Yang (“Ng”), an architect from SCDA Architects Pte Ltd (“SCDA”) who designed the Luxe Building;
(j)
Muthukumaraswamy Ramamurthy (“Rama”), a senior engineer from Gammon who was in charge of the Luxe project from April 2006 to October 2007; and
(k)
Manimaran (“Mani”), a senior project engineer from Tropical.
By consent of the parties, the second plaintiff did not have to testify even though she had filed her affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”).
34     The plaintiffs had two expert witnesses in:
(a)
Teh Eng Aun (“Teh”), a mechanical engineer who is the principal partner of Megatrend Consulting Engineers, which is involved in mechanical and electrical engineering; and
(b)
Kenneth James Patterson-Kane (“Patterson-Kane”), who is a chief civil engineer from SKM (Singapore) Pte Ltd, a company engaged in civil and structural engineering works.
The plaintiffs’ third expert Kenneth Hugh Jones, a surveyor, did not take the stand as his evidence pertained to damages which issue was not for this court’s determination.
35     Needless to say, the plaintiffs’ witnesses (both factual and expert) came in for heavy criticism from the defendants. In their closing submissions, the plaintiffs (at para 88) described the criticisms as “outrageously unfair, unreasonable and unsubstantiated”.
36     I turn now to review in brief the evidence that was adduced from the plaintiffs’ factual witnesses. As Patrick Lam’s testimony touched on the flooding incident itself, it is not necessary to consider his evidence. The focus of the dispute essentially concerned technical issues as to whether the construction activities at the Nomu site caused the flooding incident or whether it was the inadequacies associated with the earlier construction of the Luxe Building that was the cause, or a combination of both and/or other factors.
37     It would be more appropriate to start my review of the evidence of the plaintiffs’ witnesses with that of Ng. Ng was not the person from SCDA who designed the Luxe Building but he assisted the designing architect. Ng testified that he had intended the rain and run-off from the Luxe site that was not discharged into the Luxe drain or Luxe sump to go into what he thought was the “common drain” on the Nomu site (notwithstanding that the drain was inside the Nomu site’s boundary). This “common drain” is the open drain referred to at [9] above. Ng had assumed that the “common drain” was a public drain and part of a drainage reserve. This assumption was wrong. If indeed the “common drain” was part of a drainage reserve, the PUB would not have allowed the first defendant to remove the same and replace it with the first defendant’s own drainage system.
38     Ng testified that the issue of erosion on the slope was resolved by planting works carried out by Gammon’s subcontractor, Tropical. This aspect of the evidence will be dealt with in greater detail below as the question of soil erosion emerged as an important issue in the course of the trial.
39     Ng also addressed the platform and crest levels of the Luxe Building in conjunction with the height of the Openings (in the light of the alternative defence pleaded at [23] above).
40     In his AEIC, Ng deposed that the platform and crest levels of the Luxe Building complied with the PUB Code. Based on cl 2.1.1(a) of the PUB Code, the minimum platform level of a development should not be lower than the adjacent road or ground level or other levels as may be specified by the PUB. Ng deposed that the minimum platform level for the Luxe Building was FFL 106.6m.
41     The minimum crest level is defined under cl 2.2 of the PUB Code as that required for an entrance, exit or opening to a basement or underground structure (basement, tunnel, underground facility, 
etc
). For basements, underpasses and sunken or underground facilities, the minimum crest level is to be at least 150mm above the minimum platform level.
42     Ng claimed that the height of the Openings complied with the PUB Code. He pointed out that the ground level adjacent to the Openings was at least 450mm lower than the MV opening. Therefore, the MV opening must have been at least 150mm above the adjacent ground level, in compliance with cl 2.2 of the PUB Code. The bottom level of the MV opening was also higher than the platform level of FFL 106.6m for the Luxe Building. In his AEIC, Ng deposed that the placement of the Openings was decided after discussion and close co-ordination between SCDA, the structural engineer KK Lim and J Roger Preston, the engineering consultants. (In this regard, the defendants’ claim at para 51(a)(iii) of their closing submissions that they remain in the dark as to who had approved the Openings is unwarranted since Ng had testified that he designed the aluminium louvered grille over the MV opening.) Ng alleged that the ground level adjacent to the Openings subsequently became higher due to backfilling, when the Nomu boundary wall was constructed.
43     It may briefly be observed here that Stephanie Chew, the PUB engineer, gave independent evidence that the PUB Code would apply to the location of the Openings, if connected to an underground facility (N/E pp 1015–1016 and 1029). However, the PUB only required that the minimum crest level be at least 150mm above the minimum platform level, 
regardless
 of the surrounding terrain of the land (N/E pp 1000–1001). The PUB would not itself impose a higher figure than that stated in the PUB Code, 
viz
, 150mm.
44     I move on to consider the testimony of the plaintiffs’ witnesses who had previously worked or are currently working for the first plaintiff. The first of these three witnesses was GCK who used to be a project manager with Gammon. After the Luxe Building was completed, GCK, a civil engineer, took many photographs of the Nomu site on the day of, as well as after, the flooding incident and even at the time of the trial. During cross-examination, GCK was questioned extensively on the photographs he had taken as well as on his AEIC. The defendants contended that GCK’s testimony should be disregarded as it was unreliable and biased because he was employed by the first plaintiff as a project manager in September 2008 after he left Gammon’s service.
45     KK Lim was the civil and structural engineer for the Luxe Building. He was criticised by the defendants for being unaware (until he was cross-examined) that the open drain mentioned at [9] above which he referred to in his AEIC (and which he recalled from memory) had been removed by the first defendant and replaced with a new drainage system. Worse, portions of KK Lim’s AEIC were premised on the open drain still being in existence (he wrongly assumed that the open drain was obscured from sight by scaffolding and construction work on the Nomu site) and he made the further assumption that the choked Luxe sump he saw on the afternoon of 10 August 2008 was due to mud that had flowed (seen in his photographs taken on 11 August 2008) from the Nomu site and the Nomu shallow sump. The defendants said KK Lim’s assumption was incorrect as the photographs showed mud flowing downwards 
to
, not from, the Nomu shallow sump. The defendants’ case was that the terrain also slopes from the Luxe site towards the Nomu site. In other words, the defendants alleged that rain and surface run-off would be washed down the slope diagonally from the Luxe site to the Nomu site, in support of their contention that they were not responsible for the flooding incident.
46     Another witness of the plaintiffs criticised by the defendants was HWF, an engineer and QP for the Luxe Building. HWF had designed and prepared the drawings for the MV opening of the Luxe Building without doing a site inspection either at the time he prepared the design or when the Openings were built. HWF said he did not know who had approved the Openings.
47     The defendants noted that HWF’s measurements of the distances between the Openings corresponded exactly with those taken by the plaintiffs’ M&E engineering expert, Teh. Further, like Teh, HWF said the Openings were above when in reality they were below the Luxe sump. The defendants suspected that the two witnesses had acted in concert in the preparation of their respective AEICs, as seen from them having the same measurements and making the same mistake.
48     It was HWF’s view that the PUB Code did not apply to stipulate the minimum height above ground required of either of the Openings. In cross-examination (at N/E 271), however, he conceded that the PUB Code did apply. HWF claimed in his AEIC to be familiar with the platform and crest levels of the Luxe Building but this was proved to be untrue during his cross-examination. It was obvious from HWF’s testimony that he had paid no regard to the platform or crest levels when he prepared the drawings of the Openings based purely on specifications given to him, which he did not question.
49     As Teh was one of the plaintiffs’ two experts, his evidence will be reviewed when the court deals with the expert testimony of both parties later.
50     Another witness called by the plaintiffs was Kerk, the second defendant’s former construction foreman. Kerk deposed in his AEIC that in the course of constructing a wall at the back of the Nomu Building (very near the Nomu deep sump) in late July to early August 2008, the second defendant’s workers poured concrete into a timber formwork. In the process however the timber formwork gave way, causing the concrete poured inside to leak and flow into the Nomu deep sump. On the instructions of Seow (the second defendant’s project manager), the second defendant’s workers cleaned up the leaked concrete.
51     Kerk testified that he had visited the site on 11 August 2008 after the flooding incident. Some days later, he and Seow found that a pipe (at the 2
nd
 storey of the Nomu Building) that was part of the new internal drainage system on the Nomu site discharging water from the Nomu deep sump, contained hardened concrete which filled about a third of the pipe. When he poured water into that pipe, water was discharged therefrom very slowly. Kerk said he had to remove the hardened concrete by a mechanical breaker, an operation which took five days.
52     Kerk agreed with counsel during cross-examination (at N/E 713) that the debris found in the Nomu deep sump after the flooding incident was probably washed down from the cascade drain. Kerk said that when he saw that sump on the 11 August 2008, there was very little water inside. He explained that a plastic sheet found inside was used to prevent leaves from entering the Nomu deep sump and opined that the force of the water probably washed the plastic sheet, which was initially outside, into the Nomu deep sump.
53     Another former employee of the second defendant who testified for the plaintiffs was Seow, who said that when the Nomu boundary wall was built, a gap (
ie
, the Luxe gully) was created where the second defendant excavated the land to erect the wall. He said the second defendant subsequently backfilled the gap.
54     The defendants however disputed Seow’s evidence, alleging that the space at the Luxe gully was created by Gammon when the latter raised the level of the slope for planting purposes. The defendants contended (to which Seow agreed) that the slope near the Luxe gully was shored up by Gammon using a sandbag wall situated some distance away from the Nomu boundary wall (as seen in a number of photographs tendered in court such as AB983); therefore they said that the Luxe gully had nothing to do with any excavation work carried out by the second defendant which was in any case not in that area.
55     During cross-examination, it was established that Seow had no personal knowledge of the alleged excavation or backfilling works carried out by the defendants; such work was done in October 2007, whereas Seow only joined the second defendant’s employment in February 2008. Seow had relied on photographs of the Nomu site that were shown to him.
56     However, I believed Seow’s evidence on an important point. This was in relation to the construction of the wall at the back of the Nomu Building (see [50] above). In his AEIC (para 16) and in court (N/E 737 and 774–776), Seow said that he had monitored casting of that wall, which started in late July or early August 2008. Construction material like pipes, concrete, timber pieces and scaffolding would therefore have surrounded the area where the Nomu deep sump was located at the time of the flooding incident. In the course of his cross-examination (at N/E 775-776), it was apparent that Seow had made a mistake – he called the wall he was monitoring a retaining wall, when in reality it was part of the Nomu Building (and therefore could not have been a retaining wall). However, Seow’s mistake does not detract from the fact that he did monitor the second defendant’s construction of a wall and he photographed scaffolding and formwork on the Nomu site. Indeed, a photograph (AB1269) taken a few weeks 
after
 the flooding incident showed that the wall at the back of the Nomu Building was 
still
 being constructed.
57     Turning to TBC’s evidence next, the responsibility of TBC as the first defendant’s structural engineer was to supervise the construction of the Nomu boundary wall. Like Seow, TBC maintained that the Luxe gully next to the Nomu boundary wall was created by the second defendant in the course of erecting the wall, near the Luxe sump. Contrary to the evidence of the defendants’ witness Soo Chee Sern (see [61(d)] below), TBC disagreed that the Luxe gully was concreted even though there were photographs (such as AB1026) clearly showing the concrete.
58     An additional witness, Mani from Tropical, was called by the plaintiffs when it became apparent that it was important to ascertain how the landscaping works on the Luxe side of the slope had been carried out. I turn then to consider his evidence. Mani testified that a strip of land at the slope was planted with 30m² of Wedelia by Tropical in or around October and November 2007, after Gammon had backfilled the strip of land. In his AEIC, Mani deposed that Wedelia does not require much top soil, and so that strip of land on the slope was filled with around 150–200mm deep of top soil. Wedelia was chosen because the plant is commonly used to prevent soil erosion and it does not require much maintenance or frequent trimming.
59     To allow the planted Wedelia to take root and to reduce soil erosion, Tropical installed geogrid (
ie
, black wire mesh) above the layer of top soil; the material was then pegged and secured to the slope using steel rods. Small slits of 50–80mm were then made in the geogrid in order to plant the pre-rooted Wedelia. Mani added that this method of landscaping was not uncommon in Singapore and had been carried out on slopes steeper than the slope at places like Resorts World Sentosa and the Singapore Botanic Gardens. (Mani estimated the gradient of the slope to be around 60°.) Besides geogrid, Tropical had also used geotextile (in particular, a variety called “Tensar”) in planting the Wedelia. In this regard, the parties and their experts did produce in court samples of different types of wire mesh material available in the market to prevent soil erosion (for example, the defendants’ expert Chew showed the court a sample of another type of wire mesh used for soil erosion called geocell). For ease of reference, a plan of the Luxe site showing the part of the slope that was planted with Wedelia and covered with geogrid and geotextile, as well as the locations of the Nomu and the Luxe sumps is attached to this judgment as Annexure B.
60     The evidence of Patterson-Kane, the plaintiffs’ second expert, will be dealt with later (see [81] below) when I review the expert testimony of both parties.
The defendants’ case
61     The defendants’ factual witnesses were:
(a)
Ow;
(b)
Ke;
(c)
Loke Kong Fai (“Loke”), the clerk of works of the second defendant; and
(d)
Soo Chee Sern (“Soo”), the managing director of CS Consulting and the professional engineer (“PE”) for the Nomu Building;
as well as the following experts:
(e)
Dr Liu Bai Lin (“Liu”), a director of Associated Geotechnical Services Pte Ltd who was the defendants’ soil expert;
(f)     Ng Yan Heng (“NYH”), a PE who filed a total of six AEICs; and
(g)
Dr Chew Soon Hoe (“Chew”), an engineer who is a specialist in geotechnical engineering from the National University of Singapore’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.
Not surprisingly, the plaintiffs had nothing good to say of the two main factual witnesses of the defendants, namely, the first defendants’ general manager Ow and the second defendant’s director Ke, both of whom were accused of being untruthful in their testimony. The wholly unflattering comments on Ow and Ke were set out extensively in the plaintiffs’ closing submissions. (Both Ow and Ke were recalled to the stand at the defendants’ behest after Rama from Gammon had testified.)
62     It was the plaintiffs’ case (which the defendants vigorously denied) that the second defendant had carried out backfilling at the Luxe gully and the Workspace and its negligence in so doing caused the flooding incident.
63     In this regard, Ow was accused by the plaintiffs of misrepresenting the facts and overstepping his role as a factual witness by putting forward a (flawed) theoretical hypothesis. The plaintiffs also made much of the fact that Ow’s AEIC exhibited photographs (taken by Loke) purportedly showing conditions on the Nomu site after the flooding incident. It was subsequently ascertained that those photographs were actually taken two days later on 13 August 2008. Ow had deposed that Loke’s photographs were taken on 11 August 2008 and that they showed workers clearing and putting sand and silt into bags from the area around and from inside the Luxe sump at the lowest corner of the Luxe wall, and that the sand and silt extended some distance up the slope along the Luxe wall but away from the Nomu boundary wall.
64     Ow’s AEIC further stated that after the flooding incident there was no sand or silt or residue or any semblance of the same at the concrete screed area, whether next to the Nomu boundary wall or the Nomu deep sump or on the slope next to the Nomu boundary wall. He claimed he checked and found that the concrete screed on the slope was intact and there was no evidence of erosion or landslip on the slope behind and above the Nomu site. He then reviewed the situation with Loke and the second defendant’s staff and they unanimously agreed that the sand and silt came from the planting done on the slope just behind the Luxe wall; there had been erosion and the soil completely filled the Luxe sump. Ow claimed that there were no signs that the leaves and debris around the Nomu sump were brought down by the water to the Luxe sump. He added that the concrete screed area adjacent to the Nomu boundary wall formed a gully that directed the water flow, if any, down the slope alongside the Nomu boundary wall.
65     For added measure, Ow’s AEIC referred to the first plaintiff’s planting works in January 2008 on the slope behind the Luxe wall. He opined that because there was no slope reinforcement work carried out, such as the planting of cells and stepped retaining walls (there was only a thin plastic sheet covering the planting area), it was most likely that the sand and soil that was washed down the slope towards the Luxe sump came from this area. He added that erosion must have taken place over a period of time resulting in an accumulation of large quantities of sand and silt at the Luxe sump, which caused the chokage and resulted in the flooding incident.
66     Ow went further in his AEIC to give his (unnecessary and irrelevant) views on the suitability of the location (and height) of the Openings and opined that they did not conform to the PUB Code. He concluded that this was the second main factor that caused the flooding incident.
67     I accept the plaintiffs’ submission that Ow in his AEIC clearly overstepped the boundaries of a factual witness; I am therefore not prepared to accept his hypothesis of how the flooding incident occurred. I should add that it was because of Ow’s hypothesis and Ke’s testimony that representatives from Gammon (Rama) and Tropical (Mani) needed to testify.
68     As for Ke, he was not spared from the plaintiffs’ criticism. Indeed, the plaintiffs considered Ke to be as equally unreliable a witness as Ow and urged this court not to accept his testimony.
69     In his AEIC, Ke deposed that before commencement of the works, the second defendant had laid the rear slope of the Nomu site completely with concrete screed in 2007 to prevent soil erosion. The second defendant also provided a concrete screed of 1–2m wide immediately adjacent to the Nomu boundary wall on the Luxe side of the slope. In order to construct the Nomu boundary wall, the second defendant had to provide wooden formworks to hold both the steel and the concrete. These items were removed in early 2008 after the wall was completed leaving behind a small gully (the Luxe gully) between the Nomu boundary wall and the Luxe side of the slope. Ke’s AEIC mirrored Ow’s in his observations after the flooding incident, stating to the effect that he noticed neither sand nor silt at or near the Nomu deep sump. I should point out that Ke was extremely coy in his AEIC and oral testimony – he never gave a precise date as to when construction of the Nomu boundary wall was completed (for reasons that will become apparent later). Ke only gave a vague estimate of early January 2008 as the completion date both in his AEIC and supplemental AEIC. However, as stated earlier (see [31] above), the plaintiffs had two volumes of photographs taken at various stages of the construction work on the Nomu site. It was clear from the photographs that the Nomu boundary wall could not possibly have been completed in early 2008 (see AB1032, 1034). It was not fully completed as at August 2008.
70     Ow and Ke were recalled to the witness stand on 12 July 2012 and 10 October 2012 respectively. Ow’s supplemental AEIC (“Reply AEIC”) focussed on the testimony of TBC and Seow as well as the planting works carried out by Tropical for the first plaintiff, whilst Ke’s fresh evidence dealt with the planting works as well as the issue of backfilling carried out just below the Luxe gully area; both Ow and Ke repeatedly denied that the backfilling work was done by the second defendant. Indeed, in the defendants’ closing submissions, they contended that workers shown in photographs of the backfilled area were not the second defendant’s but either those of Gammon or Gammon’s subcontractors, based on the colour of the safety vests worn by the workers. I note that counsel for the plaintiffs did raise, in the course of Ke’s cross-examination, the possibility that the second defendant’s workers were made to wear Gammon’s safety vests when they crossed over to the Luxe site to do work in the course of constructing the Nomu boundary wall. The evidence in this regard is inconclusive.
71     Rama was in charge of slope stability work for Gammon for the Luxe project until mid-October 2007. He explained that in October 2007 Gammon’s works on the Luxe side of the slope ended 2–3m away from the Nomu boundary wall, and sandbags had been placed where Gammon had stopped work (see AB983 and AB990). This unworked space on the Luxe site was intended for use by the second defendant to continue its construction of the Nomu boundary wall, which had not been completed then by the defendants. However, there was no formal arrangement between Gammon and the second defendant on the latter’s use of the Luxe site. Gammon had in March 2007 requested of the second defendant (who failed to provide) the structural construction programme of the Nomu Building so as to co-ordinate both parties’ site activities. After the Nomu boundary wall was constructed, the second defendant “returned” the unworked part of the Luxe site area to Gammon, again without any formal documentation.
72     The defendants’ rebuttal of Rama’s testimony came from Ke. In his second AEIC, Ke deposed that sometime in 2007, Gammon had requested permission from the second defendant to use part of the Nomu site to construct the Luxe wall. Gammon subsequently reciprocated the second defendant’s gesture by allowing the second defendant access to the Luxe site in January 2008 to construct the Nomu boundary wall.
73     There were photographs (such as AB1003) taken in or about October and November 2007 of the area just below the Luxe gully which showed that backfilling had been done. Ow and Ke were also referred to a photograph (at AB1027) taken on 27 January 2008 which showed, on one side, the fully planted Wedelia, while the other side (the backfilled area) still had wooden scaffolding with construction debris and timber pieces, 
etc
. Ke denied that the second defendant had backfilled the area in order to level the ground so as to be able to erect a platform to build the Nomu boundary wall. For example, he pointed out that the second defendant used red bin chutes to transport concrete and sand (see AB1007), whereas a photograph taken in October 2007 of the backfilling process showed open metal sheets being used to transport sand from the upper parts of the slope. Ke therefore said that it was Gammon, and not the second defendant, who had carried out the backfilling in the Workspace. This contention was in my view improbable. First, Ke did not give a straight answer as to why it was 
Seow
 (the second defendant’s project manager at the time) who had photographed the backfilling process, if indeed the second defendant had not done the work. All Ke could say was that Seow must have taken the photographs for their records (N/E 2481), but Seow himself said that it was the second defendant who presumably had used the open metal sheets. Seow went so far as to say that Gammon, being a reputable company, would not use metal sheets to transport backfill material (N/E 759–760). Second, there was Rama’s evidence that Gammon actually used a crane at the time for transporting earth for backfilling (N/E 2385); Gammon would 
not
 have had to use open metal sheets to transport backfill material. Third, a photograph (see AB1007) which the defendants said showed 
their own
 backfill work on the Nomu site (N/E 770) revealed that 
both
 red bin chutes and open metal sheets were used to transport backfill material. There was no suggestion at all that Gammon ever did any backfilling work on the Nomu site. Given this evidence, it seemed more likely than not that the second defendant had utilised both red bin chutes as well as open metal sheets to transport materials such as concrete and sand down the slope to the backfilled area after they were delivered to the site via Mount Sophia/Adis Road.
74     Counsel for the plaintiffs also drew Ke’s attention to a photograph (AB1041) taken in April 2008 of planting works carried out by Tropical and compared it with another photograph (at AB1042) of the backfilled area taken in May 2008 showing haphazard planting works, and suggested that the latter works were carried out not by Tropical but by the second defendant, who was not a planting specialist. Ke said that the second defendant did not do the haphazard planting.
75     Ow had obtained leave from the court to file the Reply AEIC before he was recalled to the stand. His Reply AEIC sought to rebut (more by arguments than facts) the testimony of TBC and Seow. During his further cross-examination, Ow was also shown a photograph (at AB1032) taken on 13 February 2008 which revealed that the Luxe gully had been backfilled. Ow (like Ke) denied that the second defendant did the backfilling – he contended that the second defendant had merely screeded the slope along the Nomu boundary wall where it met the Luxe wall.
76     In the Reply AEIC, Ow (at para 40) addressed the issue of blockage by concrete in the piping from the Nomu deep sump that Kerk had alluded to in his AEIC (see [51] above) as follows:
Some concrete was found in the tunnel pipe on the 2
nd
 storey covering approximately one third of the pipe. It should be noted that when one test [
sic
] a semi choked sump with some water, the discharge would be slow because you have to first get over the one third level before the water starts flowing out. The discharge would therefore be slower because of this.
Ow deposed that water from the Nomu deep sump (on the 4
th
 and 5
th
 storeys of the Nomu Building) flows through a series of sumps from the 5
th
 storey to the 3
rd
 storey and from there to the blocked pipe on the 2
nd
 storey, and then to the 1
st
 storey where it flows out of the Nomu Building.
77     Ow then stated (in para 42 of the Reply AEIC) the following:
I would point out that the sump covers were not yet installed. I have confirmed with the 2
nd
 Defendant that the sump covers were ordered in September 2008 and was covered only by pieces of wood. Furthermore, there is an open drain on the 4
th
 floor carpark connected to the sump by a 300mm pipe. Water backing up would have overflowed at this point into the 4
th
 storey carpark. Hence even if the Tunnel Pipe was fully choked, the water from the Deep Sump would have flowed out of all or any of these openings. Consequently, no water would have back [
sic
] up to the 5
th
 Storey sumps. It would not have any consequence on the flow of water through the Deep Sump in the first place contrary to the conclusion the Plaintiffs are trying to draw from this.
From the two extracts above it is clear that Ow implicitly acknowledged the blockage in the pipe. In the defendants’ closing submissions, there was also no denial of the blockage, and no arguments were raised on this. In fact the blockage was not addressed at all. However, during Seow’s cross-examination (at N/E 784), counsel for the defendants did contend that the one-third blockage was “no issue” because the pipe’s remaining capacity (400mm of 600mm) was enough to carry all the water that came from the 300mm pipe connecting the Nomu shallow sump to the Nomu deep sump. Ow himself repeated this contention in his further cross-examination (at N/E p 1260).
78     In Ow’s cross-examination, contrary to his and Ke’s testimony (that no construction debris from the Nomu site flowed onto the Luxe site), Ow was shown a photograph taken on 10 August 2008 (see AB1118) which clearly showed broken concrete pieces and other construction debris in the Luxe gully, which counsel for the plaintiffs contended had been washed down by the rain.
79     While Ow and Ke insisted that the Nomu sump and the Nomu deep sump’s interiors were clear of debris (although they did say that there were leaves and debris around the two sumps), they failed to explain why the photographs at AB1104, AB1108–1109, AB1181 and AB1188 showed that the Nomu shallow sump was filled with construction debris and other materials (including the controversial plastic sheet), while AB24 showed the untidy condition of the Luxe gully, also covered in construction debris, in the aftermath of the flooding incident. The proverbial saying that a picture speaks a thousand words could not be more apt. Conversely, the photographs at AB1019–1020 showed how well the planted Wedelia had grown by December 2007. Indeed, by April 2008 (see AB1039) the Wedelia was a lush vegetation, and it survived intact after the flooding incident (at AB1073). However, the plants at the Luxe gully and/or the Workspace appeared to have been buried by sand after the flooding incident (see AB1074–1075). Where could the sand have come from if not from the backfill?
The expert testimony 
80     The defendants’ three experts were not spared from the plaintiffs’ criticism. As indicated earlier (at [60] above), the expert testimony of both parties will be dealt with separately which I do now. The plaintiffs argued that the testimony of the defendants’ three experts should not be accepted by the court as they were neither objective nor reliable. A similar submission was made by the defendants of the plaintiffs’ experts and of Patterson-Kane in particular.
81     I start my review with the evidence of Patterson-Kane. His brief from the plaintiffs (according to his first report dated 16 November 2011) was to:
(a)     determine whether the design of the drainage system at the rear of the Luxe site was adequate to accept the run-off from rain which could reasonably be expected to fall on the catchment area, which comprised the slope;
(b)     do a qualitative comparison between the rainwater volume for the slope catchment at the rear of the Luxe site and that of the Nomu sump;
(c)     determine whether there was any slope failure or significant scouring of soil from the slope of the rear of the Luxe site during the flooding incident; and
(d)     determine the probable source of the material which blocked the Luxe sump and resulted in the ingress of water into the Luxe Building.
82     Patterson-Kane arrived at the conclusions in his first report after visiting the Luxe site on 21 October 2011. He visited the site again on 21 December 2011 after Liu (the defendants’ soil expert) had taken soil samples from the slope. Patterson-Kane’s first report stated that:
(a)     Unless there was obstruction by foreign material, the drainage system at the rear of the Luxe site had adequate capacity to accept the rainfall on 10 August 2008.
(b)     He had calculated the flow rate for the catchment at the rear of the Luxe site during the heaviest rainfall on 10 August 2008 to be only 7.4 litres per second (which was less than a typical domestic plastic bucket per second). Such a small flow distributed over the slope would not have caused any significant scouring of soil.
(c)     Any small amount of soil carried by such small flows from the Luxe catchment area would be flushed through the drainage system of the Luxe site and would not block it.
83     In arriving at his above findings, Patterson-Kane made a number of assumptions, including that the catchment area for rain was bounded by the rear wall of the Luxe site, the Nomu boundary wall and the Luxe wall. Patterson-Kane included in the catchment an area beyond the road reserve line of Mount Sophia/Adis Road. He also made certain assumptions to calculate the volume of rainfall of various durations on 10 August 2008. Even so, Patterson-Kane was unable to calculate the flow volumes of the cascade drain at the rear of the Nomu site that led to Handy Road. He had seen videos taken by Patrick Lam during rainstorms after the flooding incident and opined that those flows had considerable velocity and energy by the time they reached the Nomu sump.
84     Patterson-Kane’s subsequent three reports (with an amended second report) in his later affidavits were, according to the plaintiffs, necessitated by the AEICs of the defendants’ experts. Patterson-Kane’s second AEIC/report was his response to the first AEIC (and report) of NYH. Patterson-Kane took issue with, 
inter alia
, NYH’s calculations of the volume and flow rate of rainwater run-off from the Nomu rear boundary into the cascade drain, as well as the flow rates into the Nomu sump.
85     Patterson-Kane’s third affidavit/report commented mainly on photographs that he had seen after the completion of his second report. The photographs are those found in vols 5 and 6 of the AB. Patterson-Kane also had sight of drawings, survey plans, as well as the AEICs of Seow and TBC. His fourth affidavit/report was to comment on the report of Chew, the defendants’ third expert.
86     Patterson-Kane opined that Chew’s report did not address the issue of whether the Wedelia plants would still remain on the slope if erosion had taken place. Patterson-Kane also observed that neither Chew nor he could answer the question “what was [the] layer of [soil in between the geogrid and geotextile where the Wedelia grew] and whether this layer of soil was still intact after the flood took place” because they did not have any reliable information on the thickness and distribution of the soil layer, either as originally placed or immediately after the flooding incident (although Liu’s report did state that the soil in between the geogrid or geotextile where the Wedelia grew was silty with a small amount of clay). Patterson-Kane further noted that Chew had inspected the site almost four years after the flooding incident, so that the latter’s observations of the condition of the geotextile and planted soil could not be representative of conditions immediately after the flooding incident. Patterson-Kane made numerous other adverse comments on Chew’s report. He rejected Chew’s conclusions as lacking any sound basis.
87     It would not be a fruitful exercise for this court to dwell on Patterson-Kane’s criticisms. Suffice it to say, the reports of all the experts of both parties (including Patterson-Kane) contained shortcomings which will be addressed later.
88     The defendants not surprisingly criticised Patterson-Kane heavily. They pointed out that he had changed his positions, citing as an instance how he had stated that the Luxe gully was not concreted in his first report but then changed his opinion in his third report. Further, Patterson-Kane had initially opined that the backfill from the Luxe gully was the source of the material that choked the Luxe sump. In his third report, however, Patterson-Kane stated that the soil deposited into the Luxe sump comprised predominantly/entirely of material scoured from an area close to the Luxe gully.
89     The defendants even questioned Patterson-Kane’s site inspections, saying that these inspections were limited because Patterson-Kane had only observed from the 3
rd
 and 4
th
 storeys of the Luxe Building and from Mount Sophia/Adis Road (unlike NYH who had personally gone onto the slope to take measurements).
90     The defendants also complained that Patterson-Kane’s evidence was unreasonable. Patterson-Kane refused to calculate the flow volume of the cascade drain leading to the Nomu shallow sump without which (it was contended by the defendants) he could not actually say how much rainwater overflowed from the Nomu shallow sump. Yet, he calculated the capacity of the Luxe sump on a maximum basis (based on rainfall intensity, the size of the catchment area, and the run-off co-efficient) to support his view that the Luxe sump would have had more than adequate capacity to discharge the ordinary volume of water flowing down from the slope and draining into the Luxe sump.
91     Patterson-Kane was therefore accused by the defendants of being selective in his estimates. They said he chose to make estimates where or when it suited his purpose but not otherwise. The example cited was Patterson-Kane’s choice of adopting 15 minutes’ duration of rainfall at 18mm on 10 August 2008 based on maximum rainfall recorded on 24 August 2008 of 19mm, when the actual rainfall recorded on 10 August 2008 between 12.00 noon and 1.00pm was 23.4mm.
92     I would add that there was a wide discrepancy between Patterson-Kane’s estimate of the catchment area (7,760m²) and NYH’s estimate (revised upwards from 1,800m² to 2.200m
2
 after a site visit). The defendants submitted that Patterson-Kane’s figure was unreliable as he had obtained it from a satellite image of the catchment area and not by measurements. I should point out however that after the site visit mentioned in [30] above, Patterson-Kane said that he estimated the catchment area to be “much less than 7,760m²” (N/E 1576). Although he was pressed by the court for a number (after being directed to revisit the site to check), Patterson-Kane did not subsequently revise his estimate of the catchment area.
93     Consequently, the defendants contended that Patterson-Kane was not an objective witness; he was only interested in advancing the plaintiffs’ case and he relied on far-fetched theories and assumptions to reach his conclusions.
94     Leaving aside the defendants’ criticisms, there was one aspect of Patterson-Kane’s testimony (in his third report at para 5.3) that I consider to be completely irrelevant; this was his reference to a phenomenon called a hydraulic jump, using as an illustration the St Anthony Falls in the upper reaches of the Mississippi River. Patterson-Kane theorised that the flow of water down the steep slope on the Luxe site would be shallow but it would have had a very high velocity when it reached the bottom; this was known as supercritical flow. Although he said that it was not possible to accurately calculate the flow velocities, this being a complex process requiring knowledge of the flow rate and other parameters, Patterson-Kane nevertheless proceeded to do so based on certain assumptions – that the total height of the slope was 6m, that the flow had zero velocity where it overflowed the Nomu site, and that the friction between the flow and the slope was negligible (less than 5%).
95     According to Patterson-Kane, when supercritical flow is obstructed (as theorised in this case) by a sudden reduction in the slope of the base of the flow channel, the flow changes suddenly to a slower velocity, or subcritical flow. Because of the slower velocity, a greater depth of water is required to accommodate the flow volume. The change in velocity and water depth over a very short distance results in a hydraulic jump phenomenon where the water is very turbulent and any scoured soil carried by the flow may be deposited over a significant area. Patterson-Kane opined that the overflow from the Nomu sump into the Luxe site would have had similar characteristics.
96     I accept the defendants’ submission in this regard (at para 171 of their closing submissions) that the hydraulic jump theory is fanciful. There is some credence in the defendants’ argument that Patterson-Kane needed the theory of a hydraulic jump in order to explain how material was scoured and deposited by the large volume of water flowing down from the Nomu sump on 10 August 2008. I am not persuaded that the hydraulic jump theory pertaining to rivers such as the Mississippi apply to run-off on a slope, albeit a steep one.
97     Teh’s testimony did not fare any better than Patterson-Kane’s with the defendants. First, as alluded to at [47] above, the defendants said it was highly suspect that in his first report, Teh’s measurements of the Openings coincided with those of HWF (the QP from J Roger Preston) and he was mistaken as to their locations, just as HWF was. I should add that in his first report (at para 39), Teh said the heights of the Openings were “immaterial”.
98     Teh expressed serious doubts on the measurements taken by NYH but he then incorporated the measurements of HWF into his report without disclosing the source. Far worse, Teh not only used Patterson-Kane’s measurements (see para 44 of his first report) but lifted (almost verbatim) and adopted entire extracts from the latter’s first report. When cross-examined (at N/E 1439), Teh professed that he could not remember if he had copied from Patterson-Kane’s report, but admitted that he had had a discussion with Patterson-Kane.
99     The defendants complained that in his haste to disagree, Teh misread NYH’s report but would not admit to it. Teh said in his third report that NYH had relied on an “as built” drawing when the latter had only referred to a construction drawing. Teh refused to concede his error. Then, in another part of his cross-examination, Teh said the PUB Code applied “indirectly”, ignoring the fact that the code was issued under s 32 of the Sewerage and Drainage Act (Cap 294, 2001 Rev Ed), which Act clearly applied.
100    The defendants (quite rightly I would add) criticised Teh’s conduct as unprofessional and lacking integrity. In view of his failure or inability to explain why he had obviously and blatantly copied entire passages from Patterson-Kane’s report, I accept the defendants’ submission that Teh’s AEICs and his three appended reports should be disregarded – he lost all credibility as an expert witness. In this regard it is noteworthy that the plaintiffs’ submissions made no attempt to salvage Teh’s credibility.
101    I move next to the defendants’ experts who unsurprisingly were criticised in equal measure by the plaintiffs, starting with Liu.
102    Liu had taken the various soil samples exhibited in court (see [31] above). Some of these samples, which were taken from the planted Wedelia area, resembled the light colour of the mud which had collected around the Luxe sump on the day of the flooding incident. However, the plaintiffs pointed out that when Liu tested the collected samples, he had, according to his first report, first washed the top soil samples for two hours with a solution of sodium hexametaphosphate; this gave the light colour shown in Liu’s report which differed from the samples’ actual colour. Therefore the light colour had been artificially induced by washing away the dark colour of the original soil samples taken from the slope.
103    Moreover, Liu revealed during cross-examination (at N/E 1489) that while sodium hexametaphosphate breaks down the binding effect of clay particles and separates them from the rest of the soil samples, that chemical compound is 
not found naturally in rainwater
. Consequently, Liu’s tests did not simulate the conditions of the rainfall on 10 August 2008 and were unhelpful to the court. I therefore disregarded them.
104    As stated earlier (see [61] above), NYH filed six AEICs. He was tasked by the defendants with establishing the probable cause(s) of the flooding incident. To that end and purpose, NYH made several site visits with the first being on 10 May 2011 and the last on 25 September 2012. NYH’s second affidavit contained his critical comments on the AEICs of the plaintiffs’ witnesses, including Teh and Patterson-Kane. In his sixth affidavit, NYH criticised Patterson-Kane’s use of the St Anthony Falls as an illustration of a hydraulic jump and opined that it had no application (like critical flow) to the slope. In his other affidavits, NYH amended his initial report as he had revised his calculations on the capacities of the Mount Sophia/Adis Road culvert pipe, the cascade drain, the Nomu sump and the Luxe sump.
105    The plaintiffs were highly critical of NYH and his reports, which they described as unintelligible and confusing. They contended there were no discernible bases for NYH’s opinions. NYH had used ratios of 1:400 and 1:200 respectively for the gradients of the Mount Sophia/Adis Road culvert pipe and the cascade drain. Those ratios it was contended was for slopes far gentler than the slope, something which NYH himself acknowledged during cross-examination. Patterson-Kane on the other hand had estimated the ratio of the Mount Sophia/Adis Road culvert pipe to have a steeper gradient of 1:55. The plaintiffs pointed out that NYH could easily have obtained the correct gradients from the topographical survey map found in the AEIC of the plaintiffs’ surveyor Lau Hua Peng (who did not testify).
106    NYH was further criticised for using the Manning formula to calculate the discharge of the cascade drain because the Manning formula is only suitable for non-cascading drains. Nor could the plaintiffs accept NYH’s calculations of the height of the water level on the slope on the day of the flooding incident, as the slope had an irregular terrain. To have assumed a level ground for his calculations was simply wrong. The plaintiffs then referred to an exchange between the court and NYH (at N/E 1921–1922) where the court inquired of NYH (without success) for the bases of his many assumptions in his report and calculations. The plaintiffs submitted that the court should accord little weight to NYH’s evidence as his conclusions were baseless.
107    The last expert called by the defendants was Chew, whose testimony was described as being slapdash and sloppy by the plaintiffs. Chew fared poorly in the eyes of the plaintiffs because sometimes his facts and/or information were wrong. For example, his report contained incorrect timeframes for the placing of top soil on the geogrid and when the planting works were actually completed by Gammon/Tropical. Chew had also over-estimated the planted Wedelia area on the slope as well as the thickness and depth of the top soil and soil used for the planting.
108    Chew selected six rainfall events between April and August 2008 to calculate the soil loss from the planted area of the slope. However, he had only visited the site in 2012. To do his calculations, Chew applied the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation method. To do so, Chew needed to establish these key parameters:
(a)     the C factor – the cover management factor, 
ie
, the degree of protection afforded on the ground;
(b)     the LS factor – the topographic factor which depends on the slope’s length and steepness; and
(c)     the volume of run-off.
109    The plaintiffs criticised Chew for using too high a C factor as he had failed to take into account that the planted Wedelia was fully grown and would have reduced the volume of run-off.
110    Chew’s gradient for the LS factor was also too high and inappropriate, as the slope was not a constant or regular slope. Chew should have, but failed to, split the slope into (three) segments and apply a different LS factor to each segment.
111    The plaintiffs also took issue with Chew’s comment (based on a selection of photographs he had produced) that there was no soil on various parts of the slope, pointing out that Liu managed to obtain 9kg of soil as samples for testing from the lower, middle and upper parts of the slope.
112    The plaintiffs then challenged Chew’s assertion in his report that there had been significant soil erosion from the planted area prior to 10 August 2008. According to the plaintiffs, it was inconceivable that significant soil erosion could have occurred after the Wedelia had taken root. Prior to the plants taking root, the geotextile and geogrid placed on the ground would have been effective in preventing any soil erosion.
113    Following their scathing comments on his evidence, the plaintiffs alleged that Chew’s testimony was replete with grossly estimated numbers and superlatives to support his theory that a large amount of the top soil initially placed on the planted area had been eroded. They therefore contended that his evidence should be discounted.
114    If nothing else, I concur with the plaintiffs on one aspect of Chew’s testimony (at N/E 2070) that water from the weep-holes in the shotcrete wall could move the soil in the backfill. I reject that possibility altogether; there was no evidence to support his theory bearing in mind that a sandbag wall was built at that location by Gammon and it was wrapped in geotextile (see AB1010) to prevent soil erosion before the Wedelia took root. Even if the weep-holes were a source of erosion, Chew himself acknowledged that it would be minimal. Nor could the water from the weep holes (if any) have had the velocity to sweep any debris down the slope towards the Luxe sump on 10 August 2008.
115    In view of the divergence of views between the experts and by consent of the parties, a “hot-tubbing” session was held with Patterson-Kane and Chew in the fourth tranche of the trial in an attempt to reach consensus on various issues. The two experts disagreed on how geogrid should be laid on a slope, whether horizontally or transversely, to prevent soil erosion. While Patterson-Kane opined that it did not matter how the material was laid so long as it was laid in a continuous strip, Chew insisted that it should be laid horizontally (whereas the geogrid on the slope had been laid transversely). Patterson-Kane opined that the geogrid would absorb the impact of rain falling on the slope. Chew thought that geocell (see exhibit D16) being a thicker material would have been better to prevent soil erosion than the porous geotextile (exhibit P6) that Tropical laid.
116    Both experts agreed that the geogrid used was a short-term erosion prevention measure until the Wedelia that was planted could take root and grow. However, Chew opined that geogrid was not the appropriate material as the slits cut to accommodate the Wedelia would expose the soil and subject it to erosion. It was difficult to see his point here since he actually conceded that the geogrid did not fail. The experts accepted that if the Wedelia had been newly planted before 10 August 2008 (which was not the case), then it would likely have been eroded away by the rain that day. Both experts also agreed that the backfilled area was the source of the material carried down by the rain on 10 August 2008 to the Luxe sump. They further agreed that the Nomu boundary wall slopes downwards from the Luxe gully towards the Luxe sump.
The findings
117    Although each and every one of the experts deposed in their AEICs that their duty was to the court and they had complied with that duty, they merely paid lip service to O 40A r 2 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed), which states:
 
Expert’s duty to the Court (O. 40A, r. 2)
 
 
2.
—(1) It is the duty of an expert to assist the Court on the matters within his expertise.
(2) This duty overrides any obligation to the person from whom he has received instructions or by whom he is paid.
118    I am of the view that none of the five experts who testified were objective or unbiased. It was clear from their testimonies that they were beholden to the party who had engaged and paid for their services. On this observation alone I would have hesitated greatly to accept the testimony of all the experts. However, a far more serious shortcoming of the experts’ testimony was the fact that none of their reports was based on concrete or reliable data. There were too many assumptions or unknown parameters in the experts’ reports rendering it unsafe for the court to accept many of the conclusions proffered in those reports. I should add that while the defendants’ experts (NYH and Chew) were quick to make assumptions (of any manner), the plaintiffs’ expert Patterson-Kane was reluctant to do so or to offer alternatives when he criticised the defendants’ experts on their assumptions or findings; this can be seen from the comparative table in exhibit D-11 of the calculations made by NYH and Patterson-Kane of the volume of rain that reached the cascade drain on 10 August 2008 from Mount Sophia/Adis Road. Unlike NYH, Patterson-Kane had no calculations for the volume of water that could enter the 600mm culvert pipe, the percentage of water flowing to the cascade drain and the capacities of the Nomu and Luxe sumps. Patterson-Kane’s testimony was not very helpful.
119    In fairness to the experts, the issues in this case were not easy to resolve. Calculations had to be made by the experts using formulae and technical jargon which the average layman would find very difficult to comprehend. At best, I found the experts’ reports inconclusive, and at worst they were unhelpful to the court’s difficult task of arriving at its findings.
The findings
120    It is settled law that the issue of causation in negligence is to be determined through a two-stage inquiry:
(a)     whether there was causation in fact, using the “but for” test;
(b)     whether there was causation at law, 
ie
, whether the defendants’ acts or omissions were the proximate cause of the loss suffered by the plaintiffs.
121    It cannot be disputed that the defendants owed the plaintiffs a duty of care at law to ensure that their construction activities and the works did not cause loss and damage to the Luxe site. To succeed in their claim, the plaintiffs must prove on a balance of probabilities that: (a) but for the overflow of water from the Nomu site, water would not have entered the Luxe Building on 10 August 2008; (b) it was the defendants’ acts or omissions which were the proximate cause of the water ingress to the Luxe site and into the Luxe Building; and (c) the first plaintiff’s location of the Openings was not the intervening act that broke the chain of causation.
122    I start with my assessment of the evidence. The factual witnesses who were most credible in my view were Mani from Tropical and Rama from Gammon. I gave greater credence to the testimonies of these independent witnesses as compared with the evidence of the other witnesses. Contrary to the defendants’ submissions, I am of the view that both Patrick Lam and Ng were truthful in their testimony. While the other witnesses called by the plaintiffs had their shortcomings, I generally preferred their testimony (save for Teh) to that of the defendants’ witnesses, Ow and Ke.
Soil erosion 
123    It would be appropriate to first deal with the lesser issue of soil erosion before going on to address the main issue of the cause of the flooding incident.
124    I do not find it useful in this regard to determine whose expert testimony is right on the amount of top soil that was laid before the planting of the Wedelia. I accept Mani’s evidence (see [58] above) that the planted area of the slope was filled with 150–200mm depth of topsoil as this was reflected in Tropical’s “as built” drawing (at AB2190) pursuant to which Tropical was paid for its landscaping work 
after
 certification by SCDA. It was Mani’s evidence (at N/E 2440), which I accept, that the Wedelia was planted in a zigzag fashion 300mm apart, that the plants took root in 1–2 weeks, and that it was fully grown in 2–3 months. Certainly on the issue of soil erosion I have no hesitation in accepting Mani’s testimony that there could not have been any marked soil erosion to the extent that the soil filled the Luxe sump on 10 August 2008.
125    It was Rama’s evidence that holes were drilled by Gammon’s other subcontractor into the shotcrete; angled bars were then driven into the holes to secure the geogrid to prevent it from sliding. The manner of planting carried out by Mani and the preventive measures for erosion taken by Rama, coupled with the evidence that the Wedelia plants were intact but buried under sand (see [79] above) after the flooding incident, rebutted Chew’s contention that the geogrid/geotextile should not have been laid horizontally. Consequently, I do not accept Chew’s testimony that the top soil would have been “lost” after April 2008. The top soil would not have been “lost” as the geogrid/geotextile was secured to the ground by pegs/bars. Annexure A shows where the planted area of the slope had both geogrid and geotextile installed to prevent soil erosion. Against such evidence, the defendants only had speculative hypotheses from Ow.
126    I find the testimony of Mani and Rama to be more credible than that of Ow, Ke and Chew. Mani however was incorrect in thinking that it was Gammon who did the backfilling in the Luxe gully area. He would not have known of the arrangements made between Gammon and the second defendant. But this error does not detract from the overall credibility of Mani’s testimony.
What was the cause of the rain overflow from the Nomu site to the Luxe site?
127    What then caused rain to overflow from the Nomu site and the Nomu sump into the Luxe site and the Luxe sump on the day of the flooding incident?
128    In my view, it does not take rocket science to know that rain/run-off falling on the (steep) slope at Mount Sophia/Adis Road will make its way down to Handy Road by taking the path of least resistance where channels for its discharge are inadequate, as was the case of the Nomu sump and the Nomu deep sump which were both choked on the day of the flooding incident. Where there were obstructions, the rainwater made its way around those obstacles to accumulate around the Luxe gully space, and the level rapidly rose when the Nomu deep sump could not discharge the water fast enough into the public drain at Handy Road, due to blockage by hardened cement inside the 2
nd
 storey pipe of the Nomu site’s internal drainage system. Water in the Luxe sump then overflowed and entered the Luxe Building through the Openings.
129    The laws of physics dictate that if rain or run-off has debris in its path on its way down the slope, such debris would be carried down with the rain or run-off. This was exactly what happened that Sunday. Even if the slope itself was in the direction of the Nomu site from the Luxe site (as the defendants contended), the rain would still flow downwards albeit in a diagonal fashion. I note however that in the hot-tubbing session the two experts agreed that the Nomu boundary wall slopes downwards from the Luxe gully towards the Luxe sump, where the water accumulated and then overflowed into the Luxe Building.
130    As I had observed earlier (at [118] above), the experts’ testimony is of limited help in this regard. Taking a broad overview of the evidence and looking at the photographs contained in the agreed bundles, it seems to be quite clear that a main cause of the flooding incident was poor housekeeping on the Nomu site by the second defendant’s workers. I have already mentioned Seow’s and Kerk’s evidence that construction of a wall at the back of the Nomu Building was taking place at or just prior to the time of the flooding incident (see [50] and [56] above). As seen from the photograph at AB1269, construction material would have been placed very close to the location of the Nomu deep sump. This was very likely one of the sources of material which clogged the Nomu deep sump on the day of the flooding incident.
131    Even if this court were to accept the claim by Ow and Ke (which I do not) that the interior of the Nomu sump and the Nomu deep sump were in pristine condition when checked on 11 August 2008, and Loke’s evidence that the Nomu sump was last cleaned on 8 August 2008, the fact that was completely overlooked by all three witnesses was that the Nomu site itself was untidy – it contained all manner of construction debris, including sizeable concrete and pipe pieces, which was washed down in the flooding incident. The rain on 10 August 2008 swept the debris into the Nomu sump and the Nomu deep sump, causing them to choke. In addition, the Nomu site’s internal drainage system could not discharge water to its full capacity due to the blocked 300mm tunnel pipe. This caused the water to overflow into the Luxe gully and the Workspace, where material from the backfilled area was swept into the Luxe sump. The Luxe sump could not discharge this overflow of water, soil, sand, silt and mud, resulting in the overflow entering the Openings and into the Luxe Building.
132    Despite Ke’s denial, I have no reason to doubt that it was the second defendant who did the backfilling at the Luxe gully area and the Workspace after it had built the Nomu boundary wall and before it handed back that area to Gammon. That was why the ground level around the Luxe sump was raised. In this regard I note that, in their closing submissions (at para 12), the plaintiffs contended that the original locations of the Openings were in compliance with the PUB Code and reasonably adequate, adding also that “the heights of the Openings are immaterial as the [flooding incident] would have happened regardless of which part of the Luxe Wall the Openings were located”. I accept this submission. The first plaintiff would not have raised the ground level at the Luxe gully knowing full well the requirements under the PUB Code for the minimum crest, platform and ground levels. My view is reinforced by the photograph at AB1042 showing the haphazard planting works (likely to have been carried out by the second defendant) at the Luxe gully area which were in marked contrast to the planting works done by Gammon/Tropical at the sandbagged area (see AB1010). In this connection, it was absurd of Ow and Ke to say in their respective AEICs that the second defendant was never in control of the Luxe site. There was no question of control as Gammon, in reciprocating the defendants’ gesture in previously allowing Gammon access to the Nomu site to build the Luxe wall, similarly granted the second defendant access to the Luxe site to build the Nomu boundary wall subsequently.
133    Both Ow and Ke deliberately misstated the TOP inspection for the Luxe Building as having taken place in April 2008 – TOP was 
obtained
 by the Luxe Building in April 2008 (see [7] above). The TOP inspection took place on 21 February 2008, as reflected in a letter (at AB2176) dated 14 February 2008 from the Building and Construction Authority to SCDA. Ow and Ke’s misstatement was intended to give the (wrong) impression that Gammon were still doing construction work on the Luxe site in early to mid-2008. Then, as mentioned (at [72] above), Ke had said that the second defendant was granted permission by Gammon to use a small strip of land on the Luxe site to build the Nomu boundary wall sometime around January 2008. Since Rama had left the Luxe site in October 2007, that meant he could not dispute what Ke claimed. Ow and Ke had to say that the second defendant “returned” the Luxe site to Gammon in January 2008 because they claimed that the Nomu boundary wall was already completed in early 2008.
134    I note that Ke’s first AEIC (at para 6) stated that the wooden frames set up to hold the steel and concrete of the Nomu boundary wall were removed when construction of that wall was completed in early 2008. I had earlier found (see [69] above) that Ke’s estimate of the timeframe was completely off the mark. It reinforces my finding that construction debris was still present on the Nomu site on 10 August 2008 because the Nomu boundary wall was not yet fully completed then. Hence, wooden planks (used in formwork for concreting or in platforms for scaffolds to reach higher parts of the Nomu boundary wall) were part of the debris found in the Nomu sump.
135    Earlier, I had referred to Ow’s testimony (see [76]–[77] above) where he admitted that the pipe in the Nomu site’s internal drainage system was partially blocked by hardened concrete inside, thereby accepting Seow’s testimony as correct. Granted, the blockage was only one-third of the interior of the pipe, but coupled with construction debris at the Nomu sump and the Nomu deep sump at the upper level, the discharge of water by the Nomu site’s internal drainage system would have been severely impeded. It was more likely than not that this drainage system could not have coped that Sunday with the rain coming down the slope from Mount Sophia/Adis Road via the cascade drain, or which fell on the slope itself. Ultimately, I find that the raised level of the slope where the backfill had been carried out by the second defendant, coupled with the aforementioned blocked pipe and construction debris, caused water to enter the Openings and the Luxe Building when the Luxe sump could not cope with the volume.
136    Consequently, on the issues set out at [28] above, this court finds that:
(a)     it was the rain that washed the construction (or other) debris down the slope;
(b)     the construction (or other) debris that was washed into the Nomu sump and the Nomu deep sump undoubtedly came from the Nomu site;
(c)     if not for the construction (and other) debris that flowed into and clogged the Nomu sump and the Nomu deep sump, the Luxe sump’s capacity would have been able to cope with the volume of rain that fell on 10 August 2008;
(d)     the location of the Openings was not incorrect or too low at the material time; and
(e)     the doctrine of 
res ipsa loquitur
 does not apply to hold the defendants liable. In any case this issue is academic in view of my finding in (b) above.
137    Concurrent with my findings, I am of the view that neither defendant has made out any of the pleaded defences including that of contributory negligence on the part of the first plaintiff. There were no construction activities on the Luxe site on 10 August 2008, there was no soil erosion on the Luxe side of the slope, and the location of the Openings and the Luxe sump did not cause or contribute to the flooding incident.
138    Consequently, I award interlocutory judgment to the plaintiffs on their claim with damages to be assessed by the Registrar, with interest (if any) on the damages and costs of the assessment reserved to the Registrar. The plaintiffs shall have their costs for the trial which are to be taxed unless otherwise agreed.

 Choo Han Teck J:
1       The only issue in these two appeals was whether a custodial sentence was warranted. If it were, there was little room to argue that the 8 and 9 weeks respectively were manifestly excessive.
2       There were some mitigating factors that were personal to each of the appellants but in my view, the courts below had already taken those factors into account and that was why their sentences were among the lowest in the group of charges that involved the prostitute who went by the professional name of “Chantelle”.
3       There were three factors that might have an impact on the decision to be made regarding the appropriateness of custodial sentence for these two appellants. First, the prostitute concerned was almost of full age; secondly there was some degree of misrepresentation by her of her age; and thirdly, that the seriousness of the offence had not been made sufficiently explicit to the public generally and to the appellants in particular. That was the initial weakness of Mr Kannan’s argument – that people who skate on thin ice cannot complain should they fall through the ice. The problem was the absence of a danger sign then. However, the prospect of this case becoming the danger sign that was hitherto missing vanished against the stream of new cases.
4       The factors I mentioned had elicited some sympathy from this court. However, after adjourning to consider the oral submissions of the appellants’ counsel and perusing the 156 pages of technical arguments of Ng’s counsel, the warmth of sympathy had turned cold. It turned cold as a result of the many new offences committed after the appellants’ cases. This court cannot ignore the continued flow of such cases. It shows that any danger sign would have been of marginal utility.
5       The circumstances require a strong general deterrence. For such deterrence to achieve its purpose these appellants cannot be exceptions. They must be part of the deterrence. For these reasons the appeals are dismissed.",2013-09-20 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judgment reserved
 Choo Han Teck J:
1       The three appellants were charged with offences under s 136(3)(a), s 136(2)(b) and s 136(3A) of the Copyright Act (Cap 63, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). Alterm Consortech Pte Ltd (“the first appellant”) is a company carrying on the business of pest control generally and in particular, the control of termites. Chew Choon Ling Michael (“the second appellant”) was the managing director of the first appellant. He died before the appeal could be heard but I granted leave for the personal representative of his estate to continue the appeal in his name. Teng Siew Chin (“the third appellant”) was an employee of the first appellant. The three charges were brought by way of private summonses of the complainant Cheng Wai Meng (“CWM”) who was the managing director of a rival termite control company called Termi-mesh Singapore Pte Ltd (“TSPL”).
2       The first appellant was convicted of five charges and fined a total of $32,000. The second appellant was also convicted of five charges and fined a total of $21,000. The third appellant was convicted of two charges and fined a total of $8,000. The schedule of charges and convictions are set out in pages 401 to 404 of the Record of Proceedings Volume 1.
3       The subject matter of the copyright infringement was “the Termi-mesh specification and markings on construction drawings for the proposed installation of the Termi-mesh Barrier System”. The system was a physical barrier created by TSPL to prevent termites from passing through. The complainant claimed that he was the creator of the above described copyright protected specifications and drawings. The court below found that the complainant came to know of the alleged breaches sometime in 2006 when he compared a drawing admitted as “P7” with the specifications of TSPL, admitted as “P4”. The complainant testified that specifications provided by him to an architect company called DP Architects were later found in the first appellant’s possession. The complainant also claimed that TSPL’s markings were found on the drawings given by the first appellant to a contractor known as Kajima. He claimed that there were substantial similarities between the first appellant’s drawings and the construction drawings submitted by TSPL for a project known as “The St Regis Project”. It appears that TSPL, who submitted their specification and construction drawings to the main contractor and architect, was not eventually appointed to provide the anti-termite barrier system. That job was given to the first appellant.
4       The appellants’ defences were, first, that there was no basis for TSPL to claim copyright in the specifications and drawings. In particular, the drawings were mere tracings by TSPL of the original drawings given to TSPL by the main contractor. Secondly, the appellants did not know that TSPL were the owners of the copyright. Thirdly, they claim that their specifications were not distributed to the recipients as alleged by the complainant.
5       Mr Vignesh Vaerhn, counsel for the three appellants, based his appeal on the same defences that the appellants relied on at trial. Mr Vaerhn in his oral and written submissions, however, raised some distinguishing matters that were not, in counsel’s views, submitted to or considered by the court below. Counsel submitted that the appellants obtained what was alleged to be the copyright protected documents of TSPL from the architects, namely, DP Architects and RSP Architects. They could naturally and rightly assume that the architects had the copyright, not TSPL. Further, in respect of the drawing admitted as P14(6), the Takenaka Corporation, who gave the alleged infringing documents to the appellants, wanted the appellants to follow the specifications there as specified by the architect, and it did so without telling the appellants that the copyright in the specifications belonged to someone else and in particular, to TSPL.
6       Counsel also submitted that at the time of the offences in respect of the first and third amended charges, “none of the specifications that the appellants were ever in possession” of bore the names of TSPL or the complainant. There was no indication that copyright in them was being asserted by anyone at the time. More crucially, the specifications were fundamentally different. TSPL uses a ‘stainless steel mesh’ whereas the first appellant’s specifications related to a ‘marine grade aluminium Series 5005 anti-termite barrier system’. The evidence of the prosecution was based mainly on the oral assertions of the complainant that were not supported by the documentary evidence.
7       There were two types of documents involved in the 12 charges against the appellants. They were the specifications (referred to above at [6]) and the drawings claimed to be the original works of the complainant, but the documents specific to each of the charges were not set out in the charges or in any annexure to the charges. In this regard, the charges were defective because important particulars of the charges were missing. The specifications that were alleged to be the subject of infringement must be set out in the charge and correspond to the evidence at trial. In this instance, the problem was not that the defence did not know what specifications and drawings were referred to, but, in one set of charges, the specification admitted as P4 was admitted to prove the two offences that were meant to have been committed in 2003 but P4 itself was a 2004 document. That being the case, what was the article that the appellants infringed in 2003? At the very least, in spite of Mr Tan’s contention for the prosecution that P4 originated earlier (the evidence does not show that), the benefit of doubt should be given to the appellants.
8       In respect of the charges that relate to the drawings, examining the three drawings tendered in evidence, it was obvious that they were construction plans that were drawn up by the architects whose name appeared on the drawings. The name of Kajima was also imprinted to show that that might be a copy in Kajima’s possession. Nothing on the drawings indicated that the appellants who had been given the drawings by Kajima knew that the drawings were subject to copyright protection of the complainant or TSPL. Furthermore, the complaint of infringement, from the evidence, was that the appellants had traced over the border that the complainant or TSPL had drawn over the architect’s original copy. The complainant claimed that his and TSPL’s tracing of the border amounted to an artistic work that merited protection. The fact here was that the appellants had merely traced over the tracing of an unknown copier. To regard that as an infringement of an artistic work would not be right. The first appellant was doing exactly what the complainant and TSPL themselves were doing. The learned judge below was right in law in saying that drawings can have artistic value and that there was no need to mark © on a document to lay claim to copyright protection. However, it appears that she was swayed by the prosecuting counsel into accepting that a commercial value of the drawings is equivalent to artistic value that attracts copyright protection. However, counsel for the prosecution did not appreciate that a document with commercial value is not the same as a document with artistic value in the copyright sense. It is a fundamental principle of copyright law that no claim for copyright may be made in respect of ideas and information. All that the said specifications (P4) and the drawings amounted to were mere information at best. Perusing the record, I agree with Mr Vaerhn that the distribution of the first appellant’s specifications to the alleged recipients was not adequately proved and the benefit of doubt may be given to the appellants on this issue although for the reasons above, distribution would not have been relevant if the documents of the complainant and TPSL were not infringed.
9       There is also another ground so far as the third appellant is concerned. She was merely an employee who happened to be in the office of the first appellant when the complainant raided it and seized the documents used to found the charges. There was no evidence that she was either a principal or an agent to the alleged offences. There was no evidence as to how she had abetted the offences. The documents in question were not proved to be in her personal possession. On that ground alone the convictions against her ought to be set aside.
10     I agree with Mr Vaerhn that there was no evidence sufficient to show any act of connivance. The mere fact that the second appellant was a director was not enough. A company might have several directors, and none of them would be guilty under a charge of connivance unless the connivance is proved.
11     For the reasons above, the charges against all three appellants were flawed and the convictions cannot stand. The appeals must be allowed and the convictions hereby dismissed. The fines are to be refunded.",2013-09-27 00:00:00,SG High Court

 Chan Seng Onn J:
Introduction
1       This was an appeal by the Prosecution against the sentence of three months’ imprisonment and a fine of $80,000 (in default, 12 weeks’ imprisonment) imposed on the Respondent for each of the two charges (“DAC 40848/2012” and “DAC 40849/2012”) of carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending under the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“the MLA”).
2       At the conclusion of the hearing, I allowed the Prosecution’s appeal and increased the Respondent’s imprisonment term to nine months for each of the above two charges (collectively, “the ULM Charges”). The fine for each charge was not disturbed. I now give my reasons.
The charges
3       The Respondent pleaded guilty to the following charges in the District Court:
(a)     the ULM Charges of carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending in contravention of s 5(1) of the MLA, punishable under s 14(1)(
b
)(i) read with s 14(1A)(
a
), with two other similar charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing;
(b)     seven charges of granting an unsecured loan exceeding $3,000 to a Singapore borrower with an annual income below $20,000, in contravention of r 19(1) of the Moneylenders Rules 2009 (S 72/2009) (“the Rules”) and punishable under r 19(3)(
a
) of the Rules, with 15 other similar charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing;
(c)     three charges of granting an unsecured loan exceeding four months’ income to a Singapore borrower with an annual income of at least $30,000, in contravention of r 20(1)(
a
) of the Rules and punishable under r 20(4)(
a
) of the Rules, with four other similar charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing;
(d)     four charges of granting an unsecured loan exceeding two months’ income to a Singapore borrower with an annual income of between $20,000 and $30,000, in contravention of r 20(1)(
b
) of the Rules and punishable under r 20(4)(
a
) of the Rules, with seven other similar charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing; and
(e)     16 charges of recklessly furnishing false or misleading information to the Registrar of Moneylenders in contravention of s 24(7) of the MLA, with 34 other similar charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.
The facts
4       The following facts are taken from the Statement of Facts, which the Respondent admitted to without qualification.
Background
5       The Respondent, a 44-year-old male, was a director of James Lee Realty Pte Ltd (“JLR”), an estate agency firm. Between 1 July 2009 and 30 June 2010, he was granted a licence to carry on a moneylending business under the name and style of James Lee Credit. During this period, he committed the various offences listed above at [3]. The present appeal concerns only the two offences which were the subject matter of the ULM Charges (
ie
, the offences listed at [3(a)] above).
6       On 30 June 2010, the Respondent’s moneylending licence expired and was not renewed. New rules to prohibit estate agents from carrying out moneylending activities were also impending. Consequently, the Respondent shut down James Lee Credit.
7       Sometime in mid-2011, an office worker at JLR, one Yan Hwee Onn (“Yan”), came up with the idea of issuing loans to potential sellers of Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) flats who requested for loans upfront before the sale of their flats and suggested that the Respondent venture into this business. Yan told the Respondent that he (Yan) would act as the middleman between the Respondent and the sellers. He would seek out the sellers, offer and issue them loans and cash out the repayments, while the Respondent would provide the funds necessary to issue the loans. Yan further suggested that they charge a monthly interest rate of 10% on the loans, with the interest to be split 90:10 in the Respondent’s favour. The Respondent agreed to Yan’s proposal, but told Yan specifically that he would only be responsible for coming up with the funds while Yan would be the one to liaise with the sellers.
8       The arrangement was that Yan would assess the amount of loan to be issued to a seller after the valuation of the seller’s flat. After the seller granted to one of JLR’s property agents the exclusive right to sell his flat, Yan would issue the seller a small loan first. Once a buyer was secured for the flat, Yan would issue the seller a bigger loan based on his assessment of the seller’s creditworthiness and the amount of money the seller would obtain from the sale of the flat. Before issuing any loans, Yan would brief the Respondent on the details of the seller and seek his approval. Yan would also arrange for the loan documentation to be signed at a law firm. Once the seller’s flat was sold, the loan amount and interest would be deducted from the sale proceeds and given to Yan by way of a cheque issued to him. Yan would then deposit the cheque, withdraw the money and hand the Respondent the loan amount and his 90% share of the interest.
The facts pertaining to DAC 40848/2012
9       Sometime in mid-2011, one Ho Boon Siong (“Ho”) met with financial difficulties and decided to sell his flat. He met with a property agent at JLR, Patrick Tan (“Tan”), to discuss the sale of his flat. Yan attended the meeting and heard Ho saying that he was in need of money upfront before the sale of his flat. Yan then introduced himself as an agent in the moneylending business, explained the loan conditions to Ho and offered him a loan. Ho agreed to take up the loan.
10     Prior to issuing the loans to Ho, Yan consulted the Respondent and obtained his approval to issue the loans. The Respondent handed Yan the loan amounts in cash on each occasion. Yan issued several loans to Ho between October and December 2011, amounting to a total of $28,500 charged at a 10% monthly interest rate. Each time, Ho would meet Yan at a law firm and would be asked to sign the loan documentation evidencing the loans before the loans were given to him in cash. Ho was given only 90% of the agreed loan amount each time as 10% was deducted upfront as the interest payment for the first month. On 29 December 2011, upon completion of the sale of his flat, Ho repaid Yan a sum of $30,500, which was the total loan amount plus interest. The total amount of interest earned by Yan and the Respondent was $4,850, of which the Respondent’s share was $4,365.
The facts pertaining to DAC 40849/2012
11     The borrower, one Sim Boo Kwee (“Sim”), contacted Tan and appointed him as the agent for selling his flat. Sim told Tan that he needed some cash upfront before he sold his flat. Yan overheard the Respondent and Tan discussing Sim’s case. Yan then looked for Sim’s contact information in the company records, contacted Sim and offered him a loan. Thereafter, the modus operandi was the same as that in Ho’s case.
12     Between September and November 2011, Yan issued loans totalling $15,000 to Sim, charged at a 10% monthly interest rate. On 16 November 2011, upon completion of the sale of Sim’s flat, Sim repaid Yan a sum of $20,700, which was the total loan amount plus interest. The total amount of interest earned by Yan and the Respondent was $4,770, of which the Respondent took $4,293.
The decision below
13     The district judge noted the Respondent’s early plea of guilt, his co-operation with the police and his remorse (see 
Public Prosecutor v Lee Pit Chin
 
[2013] SGDC 188
). She was of the view that this was not a typical loan shark case as there was no harassment of the borrowers, no unscrupulous acts on the Respondent’s part and no exorbitant interest rates charged. She also gave weight to the fact that it was Yan who played the active role in the moneylending scheme, with the Respondent’s role being limited to providing funds and approving loans which had already been assessed and recommended by Yan. Taking into account these considerations, the district judge considered that applying the “clang of the prison gates” principle would be sufficient deterrence and punishment for the Respondent. She therefore sentenced the Respondent as follows:
(a)     three months’ imprisonment and a fine of $80,000 (12 weeks’ imprisonment in default) for each of the ULM Charges;
(b)     a fine of $3,000 (one week’s imprisonment in default) for each of the charges under r 19(1) of the Rules;
(c)     a fine of $3,000 (one week’s imprisonment in default) for each of the charges under r 20(1)(
a
) of the Rules;
(d)     a fine of $3,000 (one week’s imprisonment in default) for each of the charges under r 20(1)(
b
) of the Rules; and
(e)     a fine of $17,000 (two weeks’ imprisonment in default) for each of the charges under s 24(7) of the MLA.
14     The district judge ordered the imprisonment terms with respect to the ULM Charges to run concurrently. The Respondent’s total sentence was therefore three months’ imprisonment and a fine of $474,000 (70 weeks’ imprisonment in default).
15     As for Yan, he pleaded guilty to two parallel charges of assisting the Respondent in carrying on his unlicensed moneylending business. The district judge sentenced him to three months’ imprisonment and a fine of $40,000 (six weeks’ imprisonment in default) for each charge, with the imprisonment terms to run concurrently. The Prosecution did not appeal against Yan’s sentence.
The Prosecution’s case
16     The Prosecution submitted that the sentence imposed on the Respondent for the ULM Charges was manifestly inadequate for the following reasons:
(a)     The district judge failed to give sufficient weight to the need for general deterrence in respect of offences involving estate agencies issuing loans to HDB flat sellers.
(b)     The district judge failed to accord sufficient weight to the following aggravating factors:
(i)       the Respondent made profits at the expense of vulnerable homeowners who were in desperate need of cash and had resorted to selling their flats to raise funds;
(ii)       the Respondent had exploited the professional relationship between a property agent and his client;
(iii)       the acts of the Respondent brought disrepute to the real estate industry; and
(iv)       the Respondent had knowingly carried on the business of unlicensed moneylending in blatant disregard of the law.
(c)     The district judge erred in according undue weight to the following factors:
(i)       the Respondent had not committed any acts of harassment against the borrowers;
(ii)       the interest rates charged by the Respondent were not exorbitant;
(iii)       there was no indication that any of the borrowers had complained that they felt exploited;
(iv)       the Respondent had only given loans to four borrowers; and
(v)       the Respondent had made meagre profits.
(d)     The district judge further erred in:
(i)       imposing on the Respondent an imprisonment term of a similar length to that of Yan when the latter was convicted of 
assisting
 the Respondent in carrying on an unlicensed moneylending business, which is generally considered a less serious offence than actually carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending;
(ii)       unjustifiably departing from the sentencing precedents for similar offences; and
(iii)       applying the “clang of the prison gates” principle when it was inapplicable to the Respondent.
17     Consequently, the Prosecution submitted that the imprisonment term imposed on the Respondent should be enhanced. It did not recommend a specific length of imprisonment, but left it to the court.
The Respondent’s case
18     Counsel for the Respondent highlighted the following mitigating factors:
(a)     it was Yan who hatched the scheme of issuing loans to property sellers;
(b)     the Respondent did not possess any dishonest intent and did not set out to defraud or deceive the borrowers;
(c)     the Respondent did not harass the borrowers or carry out any of the unscrupulous acts typical of loan sharks;
(d)     the 10% monthly interest rate charged by the Respondent was not exorbitant compared to the 20% interest rate typically charged by loan sharks;
(e)     the profits made by the Respondent (totalling $8,658 in respect of the ULM Charges) were meagre; and
(f)     no borrowers or any other person had complained that the Respondent had exploited them.

The sentencing precedents
20     The Prosecution cited three cases to demonstrate that the benchmark imprisonment sentence for a moneylender who did not commit any act of harassment was nine to 12 months’ imprisonment for each charge of unlicensed moneylending.
21     In 
PP v Koh Suat Lay
 
[2012] SGDC 398
, the accused, with the assistance of her Filipina domestic worker, extended loans ranging from $300 to $500 to other Filipina domestic workers at interest rates of between 10% and 60% per month. She was convicted after claiming trial to seven charges of unlicensed moneylending, with four charges coming under the MLA and three charges coming under older versions of the MLA. The district judge took into account the fact that although the Prosecution had only proceeded on seven charges involving five borrowers, the evidence showed that there were ten to 15 borrowers and that the accused’s operation was a large-scale one lasting nearly three years. The accused had also exploited vulnerable victims by charging them exorbitant interest rates and had manipulated her domestic helper into helping her with the illegal moneylending business. In the light of these aggravating factors, the district judge sentenced the accused to 12 months’ imprisonment and a fine of $40,000 (two months’ imprisonment in default) for each charge under the MLA, and nine months’ imprisonment for each charge under the older versions of the MLA, with three of the imprisonment terms to run consecutively. The accused’s cumulative sentence was 33 months’ imprisonment and a fine of $160,000 (eight months’ imprisonment in default). The sentence was upheld by the High Court on appeal.
22     In 
PP v Tan Meng Teck
 (DAC 28754/2012 and others), the accused pleaded guilty to four charges of unlicensed moneylending by issuing loans ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 to various persons whom he had gotten to know at coffee shops and hawker centres which he frequented. He charged a monthly interest rate of 20%. He was sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment and a fine of $40,000 (ten weeks’ imprisonment in default) per charge, with two of the imprisonment terms to run consecutively. His total sentence was thus 18 months’ imprisonment and a fine of $160,000 (40 weeks’ imprisonment in default).
23     In 
PP v Leaw Kim Onn
 (DAC 9198/2012 and others), the accused pleaded guilty to three charges of unlicensed moneylending and one charge under the Passports Act (Cap 220, 2008 Rev Ed) for retaining a debtor’s passport as security. The accused had given loans ranging from $80 to $500 to various persons, and had charged an interest rate of between 20% and 25% for every ten days or per month. He was sentenced to ten months’ imprisonment and a fine of $30,000 (two months’ imprisonment in default) for each moneylending charge, and nine months’ imprisonment for the charge under the Passports Act. Two of the imprisonment terms for the moneylending charges were ordered to run consecutively. His total sentence was thus 20 months’ imprisonment and a fine of $90,000 (six months’ imprisonment in default).
My decision
24     Having regard to the sentencing precedents, the Respondent’s imprisonment term of three months for each of the ULM Charges was a clear departure from the norm. The question was whether the alleged mitigating factors justified such a departure. I was of the view that they did not.
25     First, although the Respondent’s monthly interest rate of 10% was lower than the interest rates charged in the cases cited by the Prosecution, it does not mean that such an interest rate was not exorbitant. The moneylending regulations provide a useful reference point in this regard. Under s 23(1) of the MLA, the court shall re-open a loan transaction and take an account between the moneylender and the debtor if it is satisfied that the interest charged is excessive and that the transaction is unconscionable or substantially unfair. Section 23(6) creates a presumption that the interest charged is excessive and the transaction is unconscionable or substantially unfair where the interest rate exceeds the maximum rate of interest prescribed. The maximum rate of interest is prescribed in r 11(2) of the Rules as follows:
 
Interest
 
 
11.
— …
(2)    The maximum rate of interest referred to in section 23(6) of the [MLA] shall be —
(
a
)    in the case of a secured loan granted to an individual whose annual income on the date of the grant for the loan is less than $30,000, the effective interest rate of 13% per annum; and
(
b
)    in the case of an unsecured loan granted to an individual whose annual income on the date of the grant for the loan is less than $30,000, the effective interest rate of 20% per annum.
…
Given that the maximum interest rate prescribed under the MLA read with r 11(2) of the Rules for unsecured loans (to individuals with an annual income below $30,000) is 20% 
per annum
, the Respondent’s interest rate of 10% 
per month
 – effectively 120% 
per annum
 – cannot be described as anything but exorbitant. This was especially so considering that the loans were granted to individuals who were selling their flats and would soon receive the sale proceeds: the likelihood of their not repaying their loans was quite low. This was unlike the cases cited above, where there was a greater risk that the borrowers would default. The Respondent ensured that the loan documentation signed at the lawyer’s office provided that the amount due to the Respondent would be paid out of the sale proceeds first before the balance of the proceeds was paid out to the borrower. In the case of secured loans, I noted that the maximum interest rate prescribed under the MLA read with r 11(2) of the Rules (to individuals with an annual income below $30,000) was even lower at 13% per annum, or 1.08% per month. Therefore, the fact that the Respondent had charged an interest rate of “only” 10% 
per month
 was more an aggravating factor rather than one which had mitigating value.
26     Second, no mitigating weight should be attributed to the fact that the Respondent did not commit any acts of harassment. This is because such acts of harassment are separate offences under s 28 of the MLA carrying harsh penalties of their own:
 
Harassing borrower, besetting his residence, etc.
 
 
28.
—(1) Subject to subsection (3), where an unlicensed moneylender —
(
a
)    displays or uses any threatening, abusive or insulting words, behaviour, writing, sign or visible representation; or
(
b
)    commits any act likely to cause alarm or annoyance to his borrower or surety, any member of the family of the borrower or surety, or any other person,
in connection with the loan to the borrower, whether or not the unlicensed moneylender does the act personally or by any person acting on his behalf, the unlicensed moneylender shall be guilty of an offence and —
(i)    in the case where the unlicensed moneylender is a body corporate, shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000; or
(ii)   in any other case —
(A)    shall on conviction be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years and shall also be liable to a fine of not less than $5,000 and not more than $50,000; and
(B)    in the case of a second or subsequent offence, shall on conviction be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 2 years and not more than 9 years and shall also be liable to a fine of not less than $6,000 and not more than $60,000.
…
Thus, the fact that the Respondent did not harass his borrowers is already reflected in the absence of any charge under s 28 against him. It should not be taken as a mitigating factor in deciding the appropriate punishment for the ULM Charges. Furthermore, since there is no evidence that the moneylenders in the cases cited by the Prosecution had committed any acts of harassment, the Respondent’s lack of harassment cannot be a reason for departing from those sentencing precedents.
27     Third, although Yan was the one who proposed the illegal moneylending scheme and did all of the legwork, the fact remains that it was 
the Respondent
 who provided all the funds and reaped the lion’s share (90%) of the profits. He also reviewed and approved each loan before it was issued by Yan. In my view, this was not a case where Yan was the criminal mastermind and the Respondent, a naïve follower. In fact, having previously owned and operated a licensed moneylending business, the Respondent was well aware that he was committing an offence by agreeing to Yan’s scheme, and he sought to insulate himself by specifying that he would have no direct contact with the borrowers (see [7] above). There can no mitigating value in the fact that an unlicensed moneylender made or allowed an employee to do the dirty work for him while he sat back and enjoyed the profits from his illegal enterprise. On the contrary, it was clear to me that the Respondent was more culpable than Yan and should receive a heavier sentence.
28     Finally, the Respondent was not a small-time moneylender, but ran a sophisticated operation that granted loans of large amounts. He found customers through his estate agency firm and enlisted the help of law firms to document the loans, thereby giving his loans a facade of legality and respectability while ensuring, at the same time, that he had sufficient safeguards against any default in repayment of his exploitatively high interest rate loans to borrowers who were desperately in need of money. The loans disbursed by the Respondent – $28,500 and $15,000 in DAC 40848/2012 and DAC 40849/2012 respectively – were also far larger than those given by the moneylenders in the three cases cited by the Prosecution. Where the loan amounts are large, the imposition of an exorbitant interest rate would be all the more financially crippling for the borrower should the duration of the loan be stretched due to any unforeseen circumstances. These were aggravating factors that the district judge did not appear to have taken into account when sentencing the Respondent.
29     For these reasons, I found that the sentence imposed on the Respondent was manifestly inadequate. Taking into account his early plea of guilt, his lack of antecedents and the heavy fines already imposed on him, I considered it appropriate to enhance the Respondent’s sentence to nine months’ imprisonment for each of the ULM Charges, with the terms to run concurrently. The fine of $80,000 (12 weeks’ imprisonment in default) for each charge remains. The Respondent’s total sentence for the ULM Charges was therefore nine months’ imprisonment and a fine of $160,000 (24 weeks’ imprisonment in default).",2013-08-20 00:00:00,SG High Court

 Choo Han Teck J:
1       The traffic police served a request for the personal particulars on two parties, namely one Ong Pang Aik (“Ong”) and Scorpio East Entertainment Pte Ltd (“Scorpio”) in relation to parking offences committed on 12 August 2009 along Simon Road. The traffic police received replies indicating that the identities of the drivers involved were Salami bin Badrus and Rosniwati bte Jumani. However, they were not the real offenders but persons engaged by one Mohamad Azmi Bin Abdul Wahab (“Mohamad Azmi”) to take the place of the real offenders Ong and Ho Ah Huat (“Ho”), the latter was the owner of Scorpio at the material time. Mohamad Azmi was the personal driver of the appellant and his evidence was crucial in the trial in which the appellant was convicted of two charges (DAC No 35949 and 35950 of 2011) of abetting Mohamad Azmi to pervert the course of justice by engaging two persons to assume the criminal liability of Ong and Ho, an offence under s 204A read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal Code”). The appellant claimed trial but was convicted and sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment for each charge. The two sentences of imprisonment were ordered to run concurrently. The appellant appealed against conviction and sentence before me.
2       On appeal, counsel for the appellant, Mr Davinder Singh SC, argued that the convictions were wrong and ought to be set aside. Mr Singh submitted that the trial judge had wrongly taken into consideration a statement made by the appellant to principal special investigator Terence Gue of the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“the CPIB”). The statement was recorded on 4 May 2010. The statement, referred to as “D1” in the court below, was tendered by the appellant in a redacted version, and was admitted into evidence by the trial judge. The appellant’s case on this point was that incriminatory parts of a statement recorded from the appellant by special investigator Michael Oh of the CPIB on 11 May 2010, referred to as “P7” in the court below, had been copied verbatim from D1 and incorporated into P7. Mr Singh submitted that D1 was a statement recorded after s 27 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, Rev Ed 1993) (“the PCA”), a notice to provide information to an officer of the CPIB, had been read to the appellant, whereas P7 was a statement recorded in the course of a police investigation into an offence under the Penal Code, and was governed by the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (Act 15 of 2010) (“the CPC 2010”). Since the CPC 2010 provides a protection against self-incrimination per s 22(2), Mr Singh’s point was that unprotected and incriminatory information from D1, was thus grafted by a “copy and paste job” onto P7. This, he argued, rendered P7 akin to unlawfully obtained evidence and the trial judge was thus wrong to have given full weight to P7.
3       It seems to me that some portions in P7 were identical to D1 and the coincidences concerning typographical errors were too great such that I am led to conclude that there was a “copy and paste” exercise carried out by Michael Oh, the CPIB officer who recorded P7. However, I am of the view that this did not render P7 flawed to the extent that the trial judge ought not to have admitted it into evidence. A mere copying from D1 to P7 was not sufficient reason to render P7 unlawful evidence. First, modern technology enables expediency with the aid of “copy and paste” applications. It will be a backward step to insist that recording officers are not permitted to use such applications. Secondly, and more importantly, what is relevant is that the person signing the completed s 22 statement recognises and understands it as his statement. Once he has acknowledged it, as the appellant had done in this case with P7, the statement, whether it was cut and pasted or recorded afresh, will be his statement. That statement is admissible unless it is proven to be given under a threat, inducement or promise. In this case, Mr Naidu, counsel for the appellant at the trial, accepted that P7 was voluntarily given. On appeal, Mr  Singh submitted that while this was so, P7 was not read and translated to the appellant before he signed it which would affect the weight accorded to it by the trial judge. This same issue was also raised at trial in Michael Oh and the appellant’s testimonies. In my review of the evidence and in spite of Mr  Singh’s forceful arguments, I am of the opinion that P7 was properly admitted by the trial judge.
4       Furthermore, the material parts, that is to say the parts that incriminated the appellant, were not substantively identical to the portions in D1 and were thus obviously not the parts that were copied and pasted into P7. Also, there was information in P7 that was not present in D1. When the appellant was cross-examined at trial as to why he had signed P7 if it had not been read back to him, his answer to that and the subsequent questions did not impress the trial judge. I am thus of the view that the “copy and paste” objection to P7 is unsustainable and that there was no error on the part of the trial judge in admitting P7 and consequently relying on it.
5       I have considered Mr  Singh’s submission that the trial judge convicted the appellant on insufficient evidence and am of the view that the trial judge had ample evidence to find as he did. Counsel’s arguments as to the implausibility of the facts constituting the offence therefore failed to persuade me. The appeal against conviction is therefore dismissed.
6       I shall now consider the appeal against sentence. S 204A of the Penal Code provides that:
Whoever intentionally obstructs, prevents, perverts or defeats the course of justice shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, or with fine, or with both.
Section 109 of the Penal Code provides that:
Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this codes for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence.
The words “obstructs, prevents, perverts or defeats” of s 204A convey the legislative intention of casting slightly different shades of the same meaning. Each word is sufficient to constitute an offence under s 204A although this offence is popularly referred to by lawyers as the offence of “perverting the course of justice”. There is no need to add fresh words to these four simple words as their meanings are clear. In this case, two men parked illegally along a road. They were duly booked and subjected to a fine of up to $120 each and three demerit points against their licences. Justice requires that the right offender is punished. Hence, when a person intervenes to have someone else other than the real offenders pay the fines and suffer the demerit points, justice is perverted.
7       On the facts of the present case, every one of the persons involved contributed to the offence of perverting the course of justice They were: the two men, Ong (who drove a Maserati Gran Turino) and Ho (who drove a Porsche 911 Turbo); the two persons who took their places; Mohamad Azmi who procured their services; and the appellant who instructed Mohamad Azmi Whether they would be prosecuted is entirely a matter of the Public Prosecutor’s discretion. How each individual would differ in the extent of culpability depend on the facts and circumstances of the individual offender and also a matter of the discretion of the sentencing court. Hence, on appeal, unless there are reasons to hold that the sentence was manifestly excessive, the appellate court would not disturb the sentence imposed. Antecedent cases show varying sentences according to the offence and the circumstances, an example of which is the set of cases reported as 
Public Prosecutor v Leung Man Kwan
 
[2009] SGDC 458
 and 
Public Prosecutor v Tay Su Ann Evangeline
 
[2011] SGDC 57
. Tay was arrested for driving without a licence and failing to stop at a traffic light. She paid $1,000 to Leung to accept criminal liability on her behalf. Tay was convicted under a s 204A charge and fined $2,000. Leung was convicted under the same charge, and sentenced to three months’ imprisonment. There seemed to be strong mitigating factors in favour of Tay, including her youth (she was 19 at the time of the offence) and her clinically diagnosed depression at the time of the offence. On the other hand, Leung’s sentence of three months’ imprisonment seemed to be a reflection of the court’s view that the offences committed by the principal (Tay) were serious traffic violations.
8       The predicate offence in the present case was similar to what Leung did in the abovementioned case. Both cases concerned a third party assuming liability for traffic violations resulting in the culprit escaping punishment. The only material difference was that in the present case, the traffic offences in question were illegal parking by a public road. The offences here were less serious than the offences committed by Leung’s principal, Tay. In Tay’s case, driving without a licence and beating a red light at a traffic junction were serious offences with the former potentially attracting a custodial sentence. Thus, in determining the extent of wrongdoing, the nature of the principal’s offence is relevant. The more serious it is, the more serious the act of perverting the course of justice will be in relation to it. In the present case, the summonses in respect of the offences of Ong and Ho carried three demerit points and a fine of $120 each.
9       The appellant claimed that he merely asked his personal driver Mohamad Azmi to “take care of it”, meaning that Azmi was to only pay the composition fine from the petty cash that Azmi was entrusted with. The trial judge disbelieved this defence and I see no reason to upset his findings and conviction of the appellant. However, in view of the fact that the offences committed by Ong and Ho were parking offences, I am of the view that it would be too harsh to place them at the same level of culpability as people who had committed much more serious traffic offences. In this case, I am of the view that six weeks’ imprisonment is excessive. In other similar cases where there might be more persuasive mitigation, a fine might even suffice. In the circumstances of the present case, I see no such mitigation other than the general good conduct of the appellant. Furthermore, it was obvious from the facts that the appellant and his sports car riding friends were wealthy offenders in which a fine would be of little deterrence. What would deter them were demerit points – and a short custodial sentence. For these reasons, I am of the view that the term of imprisonment be varied from six weeks to one week.",2013-07-19 00:00:00,SG High Court

Introduction
1       This case involved an accident between a motorcycle and a taxi. At around 4am on 11 Aug 2011, the plaintiff was riding his motorcycle along Bencoolen Street (a one-way street) in the direction of Fort Canning Road when he was collided into by a taxi driven by the defendant which was travelling across the said street from the right to the left at an angle.
2       The plaintiff suffered severe injuries as a result of the accident. Among other injuries, his right foot was badly mangled and his right leg had to be amputated below the knee.
3       The defendant did not deny that he was negligent. The only issue at trial was the extent of his liability and the corresponding contributory negligence of the plaintiff. The only two witnesses at trial were the plaintiff and the defendant.
The plaintiff’s case
4       The plaintiff testified in English. At the time of the accident, the plaintiff was 20 years old and serving national service in Clementi Camp. On the day in question, he was sending his friend home after they had a meal. His friend was living at Selegie Road. After his friend alighted from the plaintiff’s motorcycle, the plaintiff travelled along Short Street into McNally Street, then into Prinsep Street and Middle Road. He made a right turn from Middle Road into Bencoolen Street. The plaintiff was heading for his home in Telok Blangah Drive, after which he intended to return to camp by 7.30am.
5       Bencoolen Street is a one-way street with 4 lanes. The plaintiff claimed that he was riding in the third lane from the right (“lane three”). In the statement of claim filed on 21 August 2012, it was originally averred that he was riding in the extreme left lane (“lane four”) of the four lanes. Three days before the trial, the plaintiff took out an application to amend the statement of claim in respect of two matters. The first was to change the above averment to state that he was travelling in lane three instead of lane four. The second was to include the fact that the defendant had been charged and convicted on his plea of guilt on the offence of inconsiderate driving under s 65(
b
) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed). The defendant was fined $800, given nine demerit points and disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for slightly longer than four months. Just before the trial commenced, I allowed the plaintiff’s application to amend although it was objected to by the defendant, with the plaintiff to bear his own costs for the amendment. There could be no prejudice to the defendant as he could cross-examine the plaintiff on his change of position relating to the lane his motorcycle was travelling on. The criminal proceedings were an admitted fact and were relevant for the trial here.
6       Likewise, the defendant made an oral application to amend his Defence at paragraphs 2(e) and (f) (which set out the particulars of the alleged contributory negligence of the plaintiff) on the ground that they were typographical errors. The plaintiff argued that they were not such errors as they reflected what the defendant said in his police report. I allowed the amendments with the defendant to bear his own costs for the amendment. Similarly, there could be no prejudice to the plaintiff as the defendant could be cross-examined on his change of averment. The said paragraph 2(e) averred that the plaintiff failed “to slow down while filtering to lane 2” while paragraph 2(f) averred that he failed “to pay any or any sufficient heed to the presence of the said motor taxi No. SHC 2398D which was filtering to lane 2”. With the amendments, “lane 2” in each case was changed to “lane 3”.
7       There were vehicles parked along Bencoolen Street in lane four. The plaintiff recalled seeing a taxi in the extreme right lane (“lane one”) picking up passengers. As he rode on, the taxi sped across the road from lane one into lane three at an angle. He sounded the horn on his motorcycle but could not swerve to the left to avoid the taxi as there were vehicles parked along lane four. The taxi collided into the right side of the motorcycle and hit the plaintiff’s right leg. The collision occurred near the 24-hour coffee shops and the Bayview Hotel on the left side of the road. In front of the said hotel, there was an extra lane (“lane five”) for vehicles to turn left into Lorong Payah, a side road next to the hotel. There was also a taxi stand in lane five in front of the hotel.
8       The force of the impact caused the plaintiff to be flung off his motorcycle. He landed several metres away. He was conscious at that time but suffered excruciating pain at his upper and lower extremities. A Malay man went to help him. A little later, an ambulance arrived to bring the plaintiff to the Singapore General Hospital.
9       The plaintiff was warded in the hospital where he received treatment. Although he was advised to have his right leg amputated, he did not agree to it. When his mangled right foot continued to show signs of necrosis, amputation became unavoidable and that was done on 17 August 2011. He was discharged on 1 September 2011.
10     A sketch plan done by the traffic police showed the taxi resting on the dotted line dividing lanes three and four, with the length of the taxi almost parallel to the road and the front of the taxi pointing in the direction of the traffic flow. The location of the accident was near the Bayview Hotel. The sketch plan also indicated the motorcycle lying just inside lane five. There was blood stain further up the road.
11     The vehicle damage report prepared by the traffic police showed the left of the taxi’s front bumper to be scratched. It also showed that the motorcycle had scratches on both sides and some dents at the front and at the right rear section.
12     In the plaintiff’s police report lodged on 1 September 2011, after his discharge from hospital and three weeks after the accident, he stated that he was travelling along lane five when he saw the taxi picking up two passengers along lane one. That was obviously an error as there were only 4 lanes along Bencoolen Street until one reaches the front of Bayview Hotel. No sketch plan was provided by the plaintiff in his police report. In the box marked “Type of Collision”, the plaintiff indicated that it was “between moving vehicles – head to side”.
13     In cross-examination, the plaintiff stated that he was presently unemployed. He obtained his motorcycle licence in September 2010, less than a year before the accident. He admitted that he was involved in an earlier accident with a van on 14 June 2011.
14     On the evening before the accident, he had booked out of camp and reached his home at around 6pm. He slept until past midnight when his friend called him for supper. He went to meet his friend at about 1am. They went to have some food and did not consume alcohol. After the meal, they went to a shop to play computer games.
15     Along Bencoolen Street, there were vehicles parked along lane four. The plaintiff’s motorcycle and the defendant’s taxi were the only vehicles that were moving. Visibility was good as the street was well lit.
16     After his discharge from the hospital, the plaintiff went to take a look at the scene of the accident. He then went to lodge a Singapore Accident Statement with the General Insurance Association of Singapore on 6 October 2011. The details about the accident were taken word for word from his police report. However, the plaintiff drew a sketch plan of the accident in this statement. In this sketch plan, he drew the taxi moving at a sharp angle from lane two to lane three while the motorcycle was travelling straight in lane three. He also indicated that lane four was a bus lane.
17     The plaintiff said he was travelling at around 50kmph. He was taking his time as the traffic lights at the intersection ahead were showing red. The taxi, which was at the taxi stand on the right side of the street in lane one, a short distance from Bayview Hotel, moved suddenly to its left at an angle towards him. He could not swerve away to the left because of the vehicles parked along lane four. There was no time to stop although he tried to apply the motorcycle’s brakes. He then tried to speed up to avoid the taxi but it was too late. The collision occurred in lane three, near the taxi stand in front of Bayview Hotel. He disagreed with counsel for the defendant that there were no vehicles parked along lane four. He denied that he was travelling along lane four and went suddenly into lane three because of a stationary vehicle further up along lane four at the time that the taxi was filtering left from lane one. He also disagreed that the accident was a “side-swipe”. He was wearing slippers then and his right foot came into contact with the taxi’s front left bumper and not its number plate as suggested by counsel for the defendant. To the suggestion that the defendant did not hear any horn being sounded before the collision, the plaintiff testified that his motorcycle had four air horns which were extremely loud so the defendant must have heard his horn just before the collision.
18     The plaintiff also informed the court that he was educated up to secondary 3 in English. He was in the normal technical stream.
The defendant’s case
19     The defendant, a taxi driver, was 55 years old at the time of the accident. He testified that he was going to drive his two passengers, a male and a female, to Geylang from Bencoolen Street. After they boarded his taxi at the taxi stand on lane one, he “slowly filtered to the left (
i.e.
 lane 2) after switching on the left indicator lights”. While the taxi was filtering to lane three, the plaintiff’s motorcycle “suddenly filtered to lane 3 as well” from lane four. The collision therefore took place.
20     The defendant got out of his taxi to check on the plaintiff who had been flung off his motorcycle onto the road. The defendant then called the police. Shortly thereafter, the police and an ambulance arrived and the plaintiff was brought away.
21     The defendant lodged his police report and a Singapore Accident Statement to the General Insurance Association of Singapore later that day. In his police report, he stated:
With the information stated above, I was travelling along Bencoolen Street on the first lane of a four lanes road, while filtering into the second lane, a motorcycle suddenly speed up fourth lane into my lane. Which resulted the motorist to the front left side of my vehicle and fell onto the ground. After the collision, I called for the ambulance and moments later, the police arrived at scene and the motorist was conveyed to the hospital upon ambulance arrival. I have one witness for this accident. That’s all.
No sketch plan was drawn by the defendant. In the box marked “Type of Collision”, he stated that it was “between moving vehicles – side swipe – same direction”.
22     The defendant’s statement to the General Insurance Association of Singapore indicated that his taxi was a Hyundai Sonata 2.0(A). Under “Describe Circumstances of the Accident”, a note referred to his police report. The sketch plan provided by the defendant showed his taxi moving at an angle from lane one to lane two, with the collision taking place just when the left side of the taxi moved into lane three. The motorcycle was shown lying in lane three.
23     On 8 August 2012, the defendant pleaded guilty to a charge of inconsiderate driving. He was fined $800, given nine demerit points and was disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles from 4 July 2012 to 7 November 2012. He decided to plead guilty as he did not have the financial means to engage a lawyer.
24     The defendant added that he did check “all blind spots prior to filtering to lane 3”. He believed the plaintiff must have been speeding and did not keep a proper lookout. He recalled seeing an “L” plate on the motorcycle. In oral evidence, he clarified that he meant a yellow plate with a triangle when he referred to the “L” plate in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief.
25     In cross-examination, the defendant (who testified in English) said that he intended to filter to the left so that he could turn left at the junction with Bras Basah Road to proceed to Geylang, the intended destination of his two passengers. However, the passengers wanted him to stop by the 7-11 provisions store which was on the left side of the street, located between the Bayview Hotel and the said junction, some 20 to 30 metres away from the taxi stand where he had picked up the passengers. The defendant said he “had to cut across four lanes” to stop in front of the 7-11 store, switching from lane one to lane four.
26     The defendant looked at his rear view mirror and saw that lanes one and two were clear of traffic. He did not see the plaintiff’s motorcycle. His taxi then started to cut across the street. The collision did not take place in lane two, despite what he had suggested in his police report. It was when the taxi was almost in lane three that the defendant saw the motorcycle on his left, more than 10 metres away. He could hear the sound of the motorcycle’s engine. It was travelling very fast and the rider did not sound his horn.
27     The defendant said one of his passengers was helping him to look out for traffic while the taxi was moving from lane one to lane two as his side view was restricted. However, he was able to see whether there was traffic while he was proceeding from lane two to lane three. When the taxi was going into lane three, the defendant noticed the motorcycle coming in a straight path along lane four. The motorcycle then swerved into lane three. The defendant tried to brake but could not react in time to avoid the collision. He did not sound the taxi’s horn. He merely slowed down and the next moment, the motorcycle crashed into his taxi which was then about halfway into lane three.
28     The defendant admitted that he shifted his taxi after the accident by straightening it slightly to align with the lanes. He did this so as not to obstruct traffic. He agreed that the collision took place at the left portion of the taxi’s front bumper because his taxi was travelling diagonally across the street while the motorcycle was travelling straight. However, the defendant insisted that the motorcycle was travelling straight along lane four and not lane three. He said there were no vehicles parked along lane four at the material time. He only recalled one vehicle (a taxi) parked in lane five in front of Bayview Hotel. The collision took place along lane three, right in front of the said hotel. The motorcycle then fell on its side towards the left. It was five to seven metres away from the point of impact and ahead of the stationary vehicle in lane five. He drew on the traffic police sketch plan of the accident indicating that the motorcycle was lying somewhere in the centre of lane four and not in lane five as drawn by the traffic police. He believed that the traffic police had drawn the resting position of the motorcycle after the collision in the wrong lane.
29     The defendant said he knew which part of his taxi collided into the plaintiff because, at the workshop the next day, he noticed some blood and dried skin on the taxi’s broken front number plate. There were no scratch marks on the left side of the taxi. The plaintiff said he heard the very loud sound coming from the motorcycle just before the collision but was not able to tell its approximate speed. He disagreed that he did not see the motorcycle because he was not keeping a proper lookout while changing lanes.
30     The defendant did not call either of his passengers to testify on his behalf.
The decision of the Court
31     From the evidence adduced, it was clear to me that the taxi had taken a sharp and sudden left turn across several lanes of Bencoolen Street that fateful day after picking up the two passengers. In all probability, the defendant was trying to cross over to lane five or that part of lane four after Bayview Hotel in order to stop by the roadside to allow his passengers to alight to buy whatever they wanted in the 7-11 store. The fact that he did not notice the plaintiff’s motorcycle or hear its engine until just before the collision showed that he was not paying attention to the left of the street as he thought there was no traffic at that time. The motorcycle turned in from Middle Road when the taxi was already picking up the passengers. In his eagerness to get his taxi to the 7-11 store located a short distance away diagonally across the street, the defendant must have accelerated rapidly and failed to keep a lookout for traffic that might be coming from his left, probably lulled into thinking that there could be no traffic at that particular hour. The collision probably took place somewhere near the dividing line between lanes three and four.
32     It was obvious that the taxi was going across the street at a very sharp angle. The only parts of the taxi that bore any signs of contact with the motorcycle and the plaintiff were the front number plate and the left portion of the front bumper. There were no impact marks at all along the left side of the taxi or even the left front corner. On the other hand, the plaintiff’s right leg was badly injured because the taxi went directly at it at great speed, leaving the plaintiff absolutely no time to avoid it. The motorcycle never hit the taxi. It was the taxi’s front which collided into the side of the motorcycle, causing the plaintiff to be flung off his motorcycle. If the defendant had not shifted the position of the taxi before the traffic police arrived, it would in all probability have been resting at a much sharper angle to the street than it appeared on the sketch plan.
33     I rejected the defendant’s evidence that the motorcycle swerved into the path of the taxi. There was no reason for the plaintiff to swerve suddenly to his right when the street was clear in front of him. Whether the motorcycle was travelling on lane three or just into lane four, the accident would not have happened if the taxi had not cut across from lane one to lane four suddenly and at a sharp angle.
34     After an accident has already taken place, it is often easy after the event to allege that the victim should have taken some evasive action. What the court should consider is the reality of the situation in the split second before impact. When a person is placed in the position that the plaintiff found himself in without any fault of his, he should not be penalised in contributory negligence even if he were to panic and fail to take such action that another person, in the calmness of hindsight and with the knowledge that an accident would be taking place, might consider to be prudent.
35     Similarly, the plaintiff could not be faulted for not recalling accurately the lane that he had been travelling in just before the accident. He had met with a life-changing incident. He was hospitalised for three weeks and, when lodging his police report, was trying his best to piece together the events that had taken place three weeks earlier. It should be noted that the defendant was equally unsure about the lane that the motorcycle was travelling in and about where the collision took place, although he suffered no injuries.
36     In this case, I found that the plaintiff could not be faulted in any way. There was no allegation that the motorcycle was travelling at a high speed. The defendant alluded to this possibility when he claimed that he heard the very loud sound of the motorcycle’s engine one or two seconds before impact. However, he declined to say anything about the speed of the motorcycle. In any case, if the motorcycle had been speeding when it turned into Bencoolen Street, it would be strange that the defendant could not hear its engine until just before the collision. The truth was that the defendant did not notice the motorcycle at all until the collision because he was not paying attention to traffic coming from behind him on the left. As I have mentioned, there was no reason for the motorcycle to swerve suddenly to the right when a taxi was coming into its path from the right. On the other hand, the defendant had a reason to swerve his taxi suddenly and sharply to the left side of the street.
37     There was also no assertion that the motorcycle’s headlight was not switched on. Therefore, if the defendant had bothered to look carefully to his left before driving his taxi sharply across the several lanes of Bencoolen Street, he would definitely have noticed the motorcycle coming along the left side of the street and the accident would have been averted. The plaintiff could not have done anything to avoid the collision or to lessen its impact. There was simply no time for him to take any evasive action.
38     On the facts here, I found the defendant to be the sole cause of the accident. I therefore gave judgment for the plaintiff, with damages to be assessed by the registrar at 100% liability on the part of the defendant. The defendant was also ordered to pay the plaintiff the costs of the trial on liability. The costs of the assessment of damages would be decided by the registrar.",2013-07-15 00:00:00,SG High Court

 Choo Han Teck J:
1       The accused, Tan Jun Hui, pleaded guilty to three charges of offences committed against the complainant, a 21 year old prisons officer at the material time. The offences took place on the same day and time, namely 3.16am on 16 November 2010 at Choa Chu Kang Street 51. The accused was then aged 27 years and unemployed. It was not disputed that the three offences took place in a span at about five minutes. It was also not disputed that the offences were committed by the accused wielding a knife with a 13cm (almost six inches) blade, and that the complainant was thus put in fear of hurt.
2       The first charge (“C1”) was for armed robbery by night in which he robbed the complainant of two cell phones and cash of $200. The cell phones were valued at $400 and $300 respectively. This offence is punishable under s 392 read with s 397 of the Penal Code, (Cap 224. 2008 Rev Ed) (the “Penal Code”). The second charge (“C2”) which the accused pleaded guilty to was for an aggravated attempt to sexually penetrate the complainant’s mouth with his penis. This was an offence under s 376(1)(a) and punishable under s 376(4)(a)(ii) read with s 511 of the Penal Code. Lastly, the accused pleaded guilty to a charge of rape (“C3”), an offence under s 375(1)(a) and punishable under s 375(3)(a)(ii) of the Penal Code.
3       The complainant submitted a victim impact statement stating that she was disturbed by the events till this day. The medical reports showed that she suffered from a post traumatic stress disorder but after the third appointment on 24 January 2011 at Changi General Hospital, she did not attend subsequent appointments.
4       The prescribed punishment for C1 is an imprisonment of not less than three years and not more than 14 years and with caning of not less than 12 strokes. The prescribed punishment for C2 is imprisonment for eight years and not more than twenty years with not less than 12 strokes of the cane. However, as this was a charge for an attempt, under s 511 of the Penal Code, the longest term of imprisonment may not be more than half that of the longest term prescribed. Hence, the longest term of imprisonment for this charge may not exceed ten years with a minimum of eight years as prescribed under s 376(4)(a)(ii). The prescribed punishment for C3 is imprisonment for a term not less than eight years and not more than 20 years with not less than 12 strokes of the cane.
5       The offence of aggravated sexual assault covers a range of conduct, including oral sex without consent and in this case, the facts showed that the act was attempted but not performed. I also note Mr Mahtani’s plea in mitigation on behalf of the accused that the offence took place in under five minutes. I am of the view that short duration in either robbery or sexual offences hardly make for mitigation but on the other hand, if the victim was put to the stress of a long and traumatic experience the sentence would be heavier. Mr Mahtani submitted that the amount involved in the robbery charge was only $900. While that can be taken into consideration, it would have been more relevant if the accused had made restitution. C1 in the present case would merit about four to six years imprisonment. Taking the case in entirety, I decided to grant him the leniency of the lower term of four years imprisonment for that charge. On the facts and circumstances of this case, I am of the view that the totality of the prison sentences should be within the range of 13 to 15 years. There would also be the mandatory sentences of caning, subject to the maximum of 24 strokes.
6       I therefore sentence the accused in respect of the charge marked C1 to four years imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane; in respect of the offence in charge marked C2 to a term of imprisonment of ten years and 12 strokes of the cane; and in respect of the charge marked C3 to a term of imprisonment of ten years and 12 strokes of the cane. The terms of imprisonment under C2 and C3 shall run concurrently with effect from 28 November 2010, and to run consecutively from the term of imprisonment under C1.
7       The total terms of imprisonment is therefore 14 years with effect from 28 November 2010 and the total number of strokes of the cane shall be 24.",2013-04-30 00:00:00,SG High Court

 Choo Han Teck J:
1       The accused was 21 years old when he committed the three offences for which he was charged. The three offences included two offences of making two minors, both aged nine, commit acts of fellatio on him (on separate occasions) and one offence of inserting his finger into the vagina of an eight-year old girl. The accused pleaded guilty to the three charges under s 376(1)(b) and s 376(2)(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). Two other charges, one under s 354(1) and one under s 354(2), were taken into account for the purposes of sentencing. For convenience, the three charges admitted as the first, second and third charges respectively are set out as follows –

2       The facts were admitted by the accused without qualification. He met the first victim through the victim’s classmate. The accused enticed the victim to join a club for computer games with promises of monetary rewards and access to his favourite games. On the pretext that a medical examination was necessary for membership into the club, the accused committed the offence under the first charge in the course of performing the medical examination on the first victim. Similar ploys were used by the accused on the second and third victims.
3       The accused was given a psychiatric examination by Dr Chan Lai Gwen (“Dr Chan”) on 11 February 2011 and 18 February 2011. Dr Chan issued a medical report on 21 February 2011 in which she concluded that “[the accused] has Pedophilia (DSM IV 302.2)”. She noted that it was the accused person’s first encounter with the law. She also noted that no force had been used on the complainants. He had no history of drug or substance abuse, and was amenable to treatment (for his psychiatric condition). Dr Chan concluded her report with the opinion that —
... a considerable risk of reoffending is present. I would recommend that his access to potential victims be removed while he undergoes treatment, until his risk is reassessed and judged to be low.
In her assessment of the risk of reoffending, Dr Chan made the following statements:
22.
In assessing the risk of reoffending, I have considered that this is Mr Loh’s first contact with the legal system, and that there was apparently no force used on the victims, nor was there penetrative intercourse. There is no history of drug and alcohol abuse, no prior history of treatment failure, and he is now amenable to treatment.
23.
I have also considered that the victims were many, predominantly male, and were merely acquaintances. There is also a paucity of age-appropriate sexual and non-sexual relationships, as well as evidence of socio-occupational dysfunction. Also, there was self-report of escalating urges resulting in the progression of sexual acts from touching to performing fellatio on 6 victims within 3 months.
4       Addressing me on sentence, the learned DPP submitted that the classical principles of sentencing may be divided into four broad categories: deterrence, retribution, prevention and rehabilitation: 
R v James Henry Sargeant
 (1974) 60 Cr App R 74 (“
R v Sargeant
”), a case in which the appellant was sentenced to 2 years’ imprisonment for an affray. In the present case before me, the DPP submitted that the sentencing principles of deterrence (both general and specific), prevention and retribution ought to figure prominently and unmistakably in the sentencing equation in order to appropriately reflect the gravity of the offences perpetuated. Before me, the DPP submitted:
... the principle of deterrence dictates that the length of the custodial sentence imposed cannot be an insubstantial one in order to drive home the message to other like-minded persons that sexual offences perpetrated on young, vulnerable victims will not be tolerated and will be perennially viewed with grave and unrelenting disapprobation.
Again, after citing Lawton LJ in 
R v Sargeant
, the learned DPP then referred to retributive justice and submitted that:
... the sentencing principle of retribution implores this Honourable Court to impose on the Accused a significant custodial term commensurate with the gravity of the offences in question, taking into account the aggravating features.
5       That case did not support any contention that deterrent principles and retributive principles can be applied at once in the same case. This was what Lawton LJ actually held at 77:
What ought the proper penalty to be? We have thought it necessary not only to analyse the facts, but to apply to those facts the classical principles of sentencing. Those classical principles are summed up in four words: retribution, deterrence, prevention and rehabilitation. Any judge who comes to sentence ought always to have those four classical principles in mind and to apply them to the facts of the case to see which of them has the greatest importance in the case with which he is dealing.
Reading Lawton LJ’s judgment, it is obvious that he regarded retributive principles and deterrent principles separately. The learned Lord Justice did not hold that the court could or ought to mix deterrent and retributive principles into a potpourri, send the offender into prison and throw the key away. Indeed, Lawton LJ dealt with deterrent principles and retributive principles separately. He first considered the retributive principle and a lengthy custodial sentence based on that principle, and held (at 77) that “although society expects the courts to impose punishment for violence which really hurts, it does not expect the courts to go on hurting for a long time.” He then went on to consider the deterrent principle and he was of the view (at 77) that the trial judge had “probably passed this sentence as a deterrent one.” The learned appeal judge then considered the two aspects of deterrence – “deterrence of the offender and the deterrence of likely offenders” (at 77). The result of that appeal and the facts of that case are not relevant here, but this was what Lawton LJ had to say about deterrent sentences at 77:
Experience has shown over the years that deterrence of the offender is not a very useful approach, because those who have their wits about them usually find the closing of the prison gates an experience which they do not want again. If they do not learn that lesson, there is likely to be a high degree of recidivism anyway. So far as deterrence of others is concerned, it is the experience of the courts that deterrent sentences are of little value in respect of offences which are committed on the spur of the moment, either in hot blood or in drink or both. Deterrent sentences may very well be of considerable value where crime is premeditated. Burglars, robbers, and users of firearms and weapons may very well be put off by deterrent sentences. We think it unlikely that deterrence would be of any value in this case.
6       I need only add a brief point regarding the difference between retributive and deterrent principles in sentencing. Retributive justice is based on the principle that the punishment must fit the crime. That principle requires, among other things, that the correct accused has been charged for the correct offence before the court would begin to determine what punishment is just. It follows that in such a case, the seriousness of the offence and the mitigating factors are important and must be considered in order to determine the appropriate punishment. Hence, an offender who convinces the court that he is repentant and unlikely to reoffend will deserve a lighter sentence than one who is unrepentant and likely to reoffend. A deterrent sentence is thus inappropriate to do justice in the former. A deterrent sentence might coincide with a lengthy sentence based on retributive principles in the latter but the reasoning and basis are not the same. More explicitly, the court may impose a deterrent sentence on an accused who falls into the former category (and thus on the merits of his case, deserves a lower sentence) yet impose a lengthy deterrent sentence in the hope that it will discourage likely offenders.
7       The management of sexual offences and offenders is an extremely complex matter. No one judgment can adequately discuss the myriad issues of such a wide-ranging matter. Not every sexual offence has the same aetiology and not every offender, and even the victim of the offence, can be similarly compared. In some cases, the offender might have been affected by a psychological problem. In some of those cases, the psychological problem can be corrected. In this case, Dr Chan was of the view that the accused does suffer from a psychological problem which could be treated. However, she was of the view that until it is treated, there is a risk of offending. There is no report as to how such offenders would be given medical and psychological treatment, or what treatment is proposed, and how long such treatment would take. All these are important factors because the courts are very much concerned about sex offenders reoffending when they are released. It is preferable to have a shorter sentence if there is a strong likelihood of a successful treatment so that the offender can re-integrate into society. A sex offender who is not cured and not re-integrated poses a high risk of reoffending.
8       In the present case, the accused is very young and thus, without treatment, the only way to ensure that society is safe is to keep him in prison until he is old and grey, but that is hardly a just punishment. The courts have consistently meted out sentences of between eight to 12 years for the offences for which this accused was charged. I thus sentenced the accused to 10 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane in respect of the first charge, and nine years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane each in respect of the second and third charges. Given the requirement by law that where an accused has been convicted of three similar offences in the same proceedings two of the sentences must be concurrent, the total length of imprisonment was 19 years because I ordered the sentences of imprisonment for the first and second charges to run concurrently and that of the third charge to run consecutively to that of the first and second charges. The maximum number of strokes of the cane is, by law, 24. Had I been satisfied that the danger of reoffending was low in this case, that is, there was a strong treatment regime and sound re-integration protocol, an overall sentence of about eight years might have been an appropriate and sufficient sentence.",2013-01-18 00:00:00,SG High Court

At the material time, Shaik Abu Bakar Bin Abdul Sukok (“the plaintiff”) was employed by the first defendant as a derrick builder. On 4 February 2008, the plaintiff suffered injury in an accident while working at the Worksite and in this suit, claimed against the second defendant for damages in negligence and breach of statutory duty.
2       The first defendant was contracted to install the derrick, a structure forming a part of an oil rig being constructed at the Worksite. On the day in question, the plaintiff reported for work at the Worksite. He claimed that, although he had worked at various jobs involving oil rig construction, that day was the first time he had worked on a derrick. Counsel for the second defendant objected to this bit of evidence which was not pleaded nor stated in the plaintiff’s affidavit. However given the finding I eventually made, this point is not material. In the event, the plaintiff reported to his supervisor, Mr Chong Chun Voon (“Voon”) and, along with the four other members of his team, they proceeded to the derrick. They were issued with harnesses and ropes, helmets, safety goggles, but not walkie talkies as the batteries were flat. The plaintiff said that he did not have gloves that day. He asked Voon for a spare pair, but the latter did not have any. Voon told him to proceed without gloves as the job was required to be completed urgently.
3       The plaintiff was tasked to climb to the top of the derrick which was the height of a 12-storey building. The team was to hoist counterweights – blocks of steel – to the top of the derrick using an electrical winch. The motor was located at the bottom of the derrick and a steel cable ran from it to a pulley at the top of the derrick. As the winch coiled in the cable, the load would be lifted up. As there were no walkie talkies, the team communicated by hand signals.
4       The accident occurred during the first lifting operation. As the load was being hoisted up, the team members could see that some scaffolding that was installed around parts of the derrick was obstructing the path of the load, and so they stopped the lifting just before the load reached the scaffolding. The plaintiff looked down from his position atop the derrick. He saw Voon indicating to him to shake the cable to try to steer the counterweight into a position that would enable it to avoid the scaffolding. The plaintiff did as he was told. He could also see Voon shaking from his position below. When Voon stopped shaking the cable, the plaintiff looked down but his left hand was still holding the cable. That was when the winch motor was started, the cable moved up with the plaintiff’s hand holding it and his fingers were caught between the sheave and the wire of the pulley. The plaintiff suffered injuries requiring the amputation of his left index and middle fingers.
5       The second defendant called its safety supervisor, Bernard Tang Kwok Loong (“Tang”) to give evidence. As safety supervisor, Tang’s task was to inspect the Worksite to look out for unsafe work conditions and to advise management and supervisors of the requirements of the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Cap 354A, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) and the regulations made thereunder. Tang said that every morning, before 9am, a meeting of the Vessel Safety Coordination Committee (“VSCC”) was held, at which all jobs for the day were highlighted for coordination. Before a job was started, a safety personnel went to the worksite to ensure that it was safe to proceed with the work. Tang gave evidence that the second defendant was supposed to continually check the safety environment. If any worker did not comply with safety measures, he would be advised. But if the advice was not heeded, the second defendant would impose a penalty. For example if a worker refused to wear a safety helmet even when he was advised to do so, Tang would bring in the supervisor, evict the worker from worksite and impose a penalty. For hot work, a permit was required; the safety officer would go to the site to evaluate the conditions there and issue permit only if it was safe for such works to be carried out. Tang said that for lifting works, a permit was required.
6       Tang testified that on 4 February 2008, the day of the accident, he was at work. He said that he was aware a team was to work at the derrick and that the supervisor had informed those present at the VSCC meeting that lifting work would be carried out on that day. Tang was in charge of investigating the accident after it happened. However he did not take any photographs of the site of the accident shortly after the event and the only available evidence before me of the circumstances of the accident site are eye witness accounts from Tang and the plaintiff.
7       Tang said that one of his colleagues had inspected the site prior to the lifting, probably a few days earlier. He said that such inspection was needed because lifting involved works at a height and there was a need to ensure that the area was barricaded to ensure that unauthorised persons did not enter the area of lifting. Tang agreed that the scaffolding was a danger to the lifting works. He could not remember if the scaffolding was removed after the accident to facilitate the lifting works.
8       Tang said that the report showed that there was scaffolding just below the crown block of the derrick and that while lifting was in progress, part of the load would be impeded by the scaffolding. Tang said that had he been there on that day and saw the scaffolding obstruct the lifting works, he would have stopped it. He said that he would not have agreed to the load being lifted by pushing against the cable to steer the load away from the scaffolding.
My decision
9       The Worksite was a “workplace” under the Act, a term defined in s 5(1) as “any premises where a person is at work or is to work ... and includes a factory”. It is also a factory, defined in s 5(2)(
a
)(iii) as “any premises within which persons are employed in ... the repair, construction or manufacturing of any vessel or vehicle”. The Act imposes certain duties on the occupier of a workplace. This is spelt out in s 11 which provides as follows:
 
11
.  It shall be the duty of every occupier of any workplace to take, so far as is reasonably practicable, such measures to ensure that —
(
a
)    the workplace;
(
b
)    all means of access to or egress from the workplace; and
(
c
)    any machinery, equipment, plant, article or substance kept on the workplace,
are safe and without risks to health to every person within those premises, whether or not the person is at work or is an employee of the occupier.
10     The facts showed that the second defendant is clearly in breach of his statutory duty under s 11 of the Act. However this provision was not pleaded in the statement of claim. The plaintiff’s counsel applied to amend the statement of claim on 8 May 2012 when counsel appeared before me to make oral submissions after the trial. This was opposed by counsel for the second defendant on the ground that the 3-year limitation period for personal injury had passed. I therefore disallowed the application to amend. As the breach of statutory duty must be specifically pleaded, this ground could not aid the plaintiff’s case against the second defendant. The plaintiff’s pleaded ground against the second defendant was in respect of s 12(1) of the Act. However s 12(1) pertains to an employer-employee relationship and as the second defendant was not the plaintiff’s employer, this pleaded ground was not relevant 
vis-à-vis
 the second defendant.
11     Nonetheless, the facts of this case clearly supported a finding of negligence against the second defendant in my view. The second defendant was the occupier of the Worksite, in which many subcontractors operate to build a complex multi-million dollar oil rig within a tight timeframe. There were many possible dangerous situations in such circumstances; indeed the second defendant had dedicated a team of safety officers to ensure that the place was safe for all to work. In the circumstances, the second defendant owed a duty of care to all persons who worked at the Worksite. The evidence of Tang showed that the second defendant had anticipated the inherent dangers from certain types of works such as hot work and lifting works. The second defendant had in fact required such works to be inspected beforehand and certified safe to be proceeded with. The dangers were not only foreseeable but actually foreseen. There was no doubt that, on the day in question, there was scaffolding installed at the lifting site which was not just a potential, but an actual obstruction to the lifting works. Tang said that the site was inspected a few days earlier by his safety officer and certified safe for lifting works. If the scaffolding had been present when the inspection was carried out, the certification ought not to have been made. If the scaffolding had been installed after the inspection, the scaffolding clearly ought not to have been permitted to be installed in that manner, or it should have been installed only after the lifting works had been completed. The second defendant had therefore breached its duty of care to the plaintiff by permitting the lifting works to proceed. As the plaintiff was injured due to the lifting work, I held that the second defendant was liable to the plaintiff for damages resulting from the injury.
12     However I was also of the view that the plaintiff had failed to exercise due care in carrying out his work, in particular, in failing to wear gloves which he knew he was required to wear. Had he done so, the extent of his injury may not have turned out to be as serious. In view of this, I held that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent to the extent of 50%. I therefore gave judgment for the plaintiff against the second defendant for 50% of the damages to be assessed by the Registrar, with costs reserved to him.",2012-12-18 00:00:00,SG High Court

1       The appellants were each charged for an offence under s 8(4) of the Common Gaming House Act (Cap 49, 1985 Rev Ed) for “promoting” a game of chance called “Red and Blue” using cash as stakes. The Statement of Facts stated that on 21 February 2012 the appellants were each “seen manning a makeshift table promoting a game of chance styled “Red and Blue” using cash as stakes… and encouraging by-passers to place bets at the gaming table”. The appellants were each sentenced to two weeks jail and fined $20,000 and in default of which, 40 days imprisonment. The appellants had served the two weeks imprisonment but now filed an appeal. In their petition of appeal they stated that they pleaded guilty after they were told by the Bangali interpreter “that they must plead guilty and don’t make trouble or otherwise their sentence may be higher”. The appellants’ case was that they did not “promote gaming” and were only “curious bystander[s]” who had placed bets. They thus prayed that their convictions be set aside.
2       Mr Darryl Soh, the Deputy Public Prosecutor (“the DPP”) applied for the affidavit of the said Bengali Interpreter to be admitted in evidence. The affidavit dated 18 May 2012 was admitted without objection by Mr S K Kumar for the appellants. The interpreter denied the allegations stated in the petition of appeal. The DPP submitted that the appellants’ version cannot be true. A finding of fact of this nature cannot be made without a trial, but that is unnecessary in this instance. While I see no reason to doubt that the interpreter had discharged his duty properly, the appellants might still have misunderstood the interpreter.
3       The appellants were arrested on 21 February 2012 and convicted on 23 February 2012 when they pleaded guilty without counsel. They were foreign workmen earning $480 each a month. The Notes of Evidence showed that the court had asked the appellants if they were maintaining their stand, made in mitigation, that they were “not the organiser[s]” but were only customers. The court informed them that if that were the case, the pleas would be rejected. Given the circumstances, I will accept that the interpreter had duly interpreted the court’s comments. The appellants are not trained in the law and were unlikely to know that a plea of guilty must be unqualified and acceptance of the statement of facts is essential. It is possible that they did not understand they could and should claim trial if they disputed the statement of facts. I therefore set aside the conviction. I directed that the case be remitted to the District Court for the plea to be re-taken.",2012-08-01 00:00:00,SG High Court

Negligence
28 June 2012
 Choo Han Teck J:
1       The plaintiff fell as she was trying to catch a bus (SBS 655L) owned by the second defendant. The first defendant was the driver of that bus at the time. The plaintiff sued the defendants for damages in negligence. Her case as pleaded in the Statement of Claim and in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief was that on the day in question, namely 14 March 2010 at 9 am, she wanted to board the bus at the bus-stop along Tanjong Katong Road but the first defendant shut the front (boarding) door without warning and drove off “causing the plaintiff to lose her balance and [fall] off and run over by the bus”. Twice in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief she asserted that “one of [her] legs was on the steps of the bus when the bus suddenly and without warning started to move off” thus “causing [her] to lose her balance.” This evidence as Mr Wee, counsel for the defendants, pointed out were inconsistent with the police report made by the plaintiff and the averments made in her Statement of Claim and the amendment to the Statement of Claim embellishing her account to the clearly untrue version that the bus driver stopped the bus and allowed her to put one foot on the bus but he drove off before she could board.
2       The defendants’ case and evidence from the first defendant driver was that the bus had already started moving because there were no more passengers alighting or boarding. The bus could not move unless both doors were shut. The plaintiff ran from behind the bus and slipped when she was hoping to catch the bus before it could leave.
3       The defendants produced a video clip of the incident. The video was filmed by another bus driver with the camera mounted on his bus which was travelling behind SBS 665L. The video clip was shown in court and I had watched it again many times, each time focussing on different aspects of the incident. The video showed that the plaintiff was walking along the pavement towards the bus stop when passengers were alighting from SBS 665L. She was not in a queue as averred in her evidence-in-chief and police report. When it appeared that no passenger was at the boarding door in the front of the bus, and the last passenger had alighted, the driver shut the doors and the bus began to move. It was almost simultaneously that the plaintiff must have realised that the bus was moving that she began to run.
4       She was just at or slightly ahead of the rear door of the bus when she started running. She then lost her footing because she was running too close to the edge of the pavement, and fell. At that point she had not reached the front door of the bus. The bus driver was probably watching the traffic on his rear right since he was moving ahead. The sequence of events as shown on the video clip showed that the plaintiff fell when she slipped as she was running for the bus that was already about to move if not having already moved. Having seen the video I am satisfied that the first defendant (and consequently, the second defendant) had not caused the plaintiff’s fall and that the injury to the plaintiff could not reasonably have been avoided. Even if he had seen the plaintiff running after the bus he was not obliged to stop and even if he was, not stopping was not the cause of the plaintiff’s fall. There appeared no necessity for him to say that he looked in the rear view mirror but he said he did not only because counsel asked if he did.
5       The plaintiff must have realised the true state after she had sight of the video because she amended her affidavit of evidence-in-chief by deleting the portions I had quoted above. The video does not show the plaintiff tapping on the bus but it appeared that she was either attempting to tap it or had reached out when she lost her footing, but that motion (of stretching her arm) took place as she lost her footing. There was nothing the bus driver could have done. As he had prepared to move off or was moving off it was not unreasonable for him to look to the right and to the road. The accident happened too quickly for the driver to avoid.
6       The sole issue before me in this trial therefore was whether the first defendant caused the plaintiff to fall and subsequently injuring her. The evidence showed that the first defendant did not cause her to fall, and even if causation was shown, he was not negligently responsible for her injury in that there was no time for him to have avoided injury to her if the injury had been caused by contact with the bus after she fell. I agree with Mr Wee that the first defendant was not in breach of any duty of care to the plaintiff in these circumstances. Mr Pillai submitted that I should consider the objective evidence. However, the only objective evidence which seemed not in dispute, such as her age and what she wanted to do, were irrelevant with regard to the causation of the injury, is no fault on the part of the defendant.
7       I am thus of the view that the plaintiff has failed to prove her case. The claim is therefore dismissed and I will hear the parties on costs at a later date if they cannot agree costs.",2012-06-28 00:00:00,SG High Court

Introduction
1       This case involves a claim for damages for assault and wrongful arrest. The plaintiff, a private investigator, claimed that he was doing surveillance on a subject on 10 March 2009 when he was assaulted and then wrongfully arrested by the first defendant, an auxiliary police officer (“APO”) employed by the second defendant.
2       The trial proceeded on liability as well as damages. For the plaintiff’s case, a total of eight witnesses (including the plaintiff) testified, four of them by way of affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) and four by way of oral testimony in court. The first defendant and two other witnesses testified for the defence.
3       At the conclusion of the trial, counsel for the parties requested time for written submissions to be made. Directions were then given for the plaintiff to file his written submissions, followed by the defendants’ response and finally the plaintiff’s reply. After considering the three sets of written submissions tendered sequentially, I am of the opinion that the plaintiff fails in his claim against both defendants.
The plaintiff’s case
4       The plaintiff, who was born on 8 April 1947, is the managing director of Simmon Security and Investigation Services Pte Ltd (“Simmon”), a company engaged in the business of private investigations. The company is registered under the Private Security Industry Act (Cap 250A, 2008 Rev Ed).
5       In early March 2009, Simmon was engaged by a client to conduct surveillance on her husband (“the subject”) who was suspected of having an adulterous relationship with another female. That female was residing in an apartment block located at the junction of Dalvey Road and Stevens Road.
6       On 5 March 2009, Simmon commenced surveillance on the subject and found out that he had visited one of the apartments in the said apartment block. On 10 March 2009, the plaintiff, anticipating that the subject would be visiting the female at her residence, drove to Dalvey Road and parked his car at a recessed area along that road at about 3pm. He then walked to Stevens Road and sat down on the raised concrete footpath along Stevens Road between Stevens Close and Dalvey Road. He had a black pouch with him and was looking generally towards Dalvey Road.
7       The plaintiff claimed that he was not aware at that time that the Israeli Embassy (“the embassy”) was located at the end of Stevens Close, some 400 metres away from its junction with Stevens Road. The embassy actually occupies a plot of land that straddles Stevens Close and Dalvey Road. At about 5pm that day, a member of the embassy’s security staff approached the plaintiff from Stevens Close and asked him what he was doing there. The plaintiff replied casually that he was waiting for someone and, being curious, he then asked the male Caucasian security officer whether he had done anything wrong and why he was being questioned. The security officer merely mentioned “security” and then walked away.
8       The security officer called the embassy’s security post and the first defendant, a uniformed officer stationed at the embassy, was despatched to the scene. He arrived a few minutes later on a bicycle and parked it on the raised footpath about two metres away to the left of the plaintiff. The first defendant squatted next to the plaintiff, who was still sitting on the raised footpath, blocking the plaintiff’s view of Dalvey Road, and asked the plaintiff in an aggressive and antagonistic manner as to what he was doing there. He also pointed his right index finger at the plaintiff’s face. The plaintiff replied that he was waiting for someone and asked the first defendant if he had done anything wrong. At that point in time, the plaintiff’s colleague, Muhammad Rasyid (“Rasyid”), contacted the plaintiff over the radio set to inform him that the subject had arrived at the female’s residence. Rasyid had been conducting surveillance along Killiney Road where the subject’s place of business was. The plaintiff did not respond to the radio message as the first defendant was in front of him questioning him in a raised voice. The first defendant responded to the plaintiff’s question by saying that that location was “a sensitive place”. The plaintiff asked him why Stevens Road was a sensitive place and what he meant by “sensitive”.
9       On hearing the plaintiff’s retort, the first defendant became furious and told the plaintiff that he could be a suspected terrorist. The plaintiff was taken aback and asked if he looked like a terrorist. Realizing that he was probably not able to continue with the surveillance work, he then contacted Rasyid to meet him at that location, intending to pass some instructions to Rasyid as the latter was very new on the job at that time.
10     Upon hearing the plaintiff asking if he looked like a terrorist, the first defendant flew into a rage. He accused the plaintiff of being violent and aggressive and grabbed the sleeve of the plaintiff’s T-shirt, tugging at it with such great force that the sleeve tore.
11     The plaintiff immediately stood up. As soon as he was on his feet, the first defendant, without any warning, handcuffed his right wrist. The plaintiff was shocked at being handcuffed but did not struggle as he realized that no good would come out of struggling. He implored the male security officer, who was standing nearby, to witness what the first defendant was doing and said that there was no reason to assault him. The security officer remarked nonchalantly that he did not see what was happening.
12     The first defendant then dragged the plaintiff to the verge of the raised footpath, swiped him off his feet and slammed him onto the concrete footpath. The plaintiff felt a sharp pain at his head and knees and became dizzy. The first defendant then pinned the plaintiff down with his knee and bodyweight and tugged his handcuffed right hand, causing pain to the plaintiff. While the plaintiff was lying prostrate on the ground in pain, the first defendant continued to pull the handcuff, causing pain to the plaintiff’s right shoulder, arm and wrist.
13     The first defendant then attempted to get hold of the plaintiff’s black pouch which he was still holding in his left hand and which contained his video recorder. He did not ask the plaintiff what the black pouch contained. If he had done so, the plaintiff would have told him that he was a private investigator and that there was a video recorder in the said pouch. He told the first defendant that he was in pain and that what he was doing was uncalled for and wrong. The first defendant responded with a vulgarity, uttering “lan chiau” (Hokkien for penis) and continued tugging the handcuff.
14     The plaintiff was traumatised by the first defendant’s actions as he had never been treated in such a manner before. He felt degraded, helpless and completely humiliated. The first defendant had totally immobilized him and was ignoring his “agonising and unbearable pain”. Each time he tried to turn his head to speak to the first defendant, the latter would pull on the handcuff, causing the plaintiff greater pain. In the plaintiff’s estimate, the time that passed from the moment the first defendant approached him while he was seated on the raised footpath until the moment he was assaulted was about 15 to 20 seconds. He estimated that he was restrained by the first defendant for about 30 minutes.
15     Not long after this, Rasyid arrived at that location. He did not know what to do. He asked the first defendant to release the plaintiff. As the first defendant did not do so, Rasyid telephoned the police. The message in the first information report stated, “One CISCO officer beat my man. No need ambulance”. A group of passers-by had gathered to see what was happening, causing the plaintiff great embarrassment and humiliation as they must have thought that the plaintiff was an “iniquitous criminal” who had committed some “grotesque crime”.
16     Two police officers arrived at the location. They were SSG Alvin Kum and CPL Muhd Taufiq. At their behest, the plaintiff was allowed to get back on his feet. SSG Alvin directed the first defendant to remove the handcuff and he complied. However, CPL Taufiq grabbed the plaintiff’s T-shirt near the collar and continued holding on to the plaintiff until he was placed in the ambulance which arrived subsequently. When the plaintiff asked whether it was necessary to hold him as it was embarrassing, CPL Taufiq explained that he had no choice because the plaintiff was under arrest. Another police car arrived later.
17     Being a heart patient and a diabetic dependent on insulin, the plaintiff felt faint and giddy. His feet wobbled under him. He then told the police that he needed to go to the hospital. He was in a daze. His limbs hurt and his forehead was bleeding. He noticed that there was a tear in his jeans.
18     When the ambulance arrived, the paramedics examined the plaintiff. In their ambulance report, the paramedics noted that there was swelling over the plaintiff’s right knee and there were abrasions over the left elbow and the forehead. They also noted that the plaintiff complained of pain over his right wrist and right knee. He requested to see a doctor.
19     Upon hearing his request, the first defendant smiled sarcastically, pulled up his trousers and told the paramedics that he too was injured. He then lifted both his hands, claiming that he was injured. The paramedics ignored the first defendant who then sneered at the plaintiff and remarked that the alleged pain was a bluff and that the plaintiff was putting on a show.
20     The plaintiff recalled that there were four police officers and two paramedics at the scene that day. Another two police officers arrived in another police car after the first two (see 
[16]
 above). These were SI Rashid and SI Ng Swee Hong. Apparently, a third police car arrived after the plaintiff left the scene in the ambulance for the hospital.
21     At the Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”), Dr Shanaz Matthew Sajeed examined the plaintiff and found the following injuries on him:
(a)     a 2cm abrasion over the right forehead;
(b)     mild bruising of the right forearm;
(c)     mild bruising of the left wrist;
(d)     a minor abrasion over the right knee cap; and
(e)     a minor abrasion over the left upper forearm.
The plaintiff’s jeans and T-shirt were torn.
22     After the medical examination, DSP Heng Chih Yang interviewed the plaintiff. The plaintiff found out subsequently that the incident was classified as an offence of voluntarily causing hurt.
23     The plaintiff claimed that there was no reason justifying his arrest and that the arrest was therefore unlawful. Further, he claimed that the force used by the first defendant in effecting the arrest was unjustified. He did not put up a struggle and did not taunt the first defendant. He was also not rude towards the first defendant. His right hand remained handcuffed for about 30 minutes with the first defendant using his knee and body weight to pin him down on the hard ground.
24     All the actions by the first defendant were done while performing his functions as an APO in the employ of the second defendant. The second defendant was therefore vicariously liable for his actions.
25     Where damages were concerned, the plaintiff claimed that he was trembling and distressed when he arrived at SGH. All his energy had been sapped from him and he felt degraded and embarrassed. His injuries took three weeks to heal fully. During that period of time, the injuries at his forehead and forearm were particularly embarrassing to him as people would often ask how he sustained those injuries and he did not know how to reply to them.
26     Even after the physical injuries had healed, he “continued to experience the emotional and psychological disturbances”. He would become distressed and jittery whenever he saw a police car or a police officer. This caused him a “significant increase in stress” when he undertook surveillance work. He would also deliberately avoid the vicinity of Stevens Road for about a year after the incident. He asserted that the first defendant’s actions were “calculated to cause me maximum pain, suffering, embarrassment and deprivation” and that he had succeeded in doing so because the plaintiff was “thoroughly traumatised” and left in a “state of desolation”. The trauma did not just vanish after his release but “continued for a substantial time thereafter”.
27     The plaintiff claimed aggravated damages as the first defendant’s actions were a “gross affront to my personal dignity and integrity” and were “heinous and highhanded and designed to cause maximum physical pain, humiliation, distress and embarrassment”. He also claimed exemplary damages because the first defendant had acted wilfully and in an arbitrary manner “in total and utter disregard to the Rule of Law”. There was also an absolute lack of remorse on the part of the first defendant.
28     In respect of special damages, the plaintiff acknowledged that his claim was “quite miniscule” as it involved only a total of $300 as the estimated cost of replacing the torn jeans and T-shirt and his lost spectacles.
29     The plaintiff was a former police officer who had spent more than 30 years in the police force before taking early retirement in 1999 as an Assistant Superintendent (“ASP”) in order to pursue a second career as a private investigator. He received numerous awards “for all his exemplary performances” in the police force (see AB 65 and 66, printed from Simmon’s website). His police work included arrest of gang members and shoot-outs with armed criminals. He was a trainer in the Police Academy between 1993 and 1999. He was therefore respectful of persons in uniform and of authority and would never and did not taunt or push the first defendant who was in uniform that day. He claimed that he did not identify himself to the first defendant as a private investigator as the exchange of words took place very fast and was over in about 15 seconds. By the time the first defendant grabbed his T-shirt, it was too late to identify himself as he was already under arrest and could not be released without the authority of a police officer of or above the rank of SGT. He also wanted to see how far the first defendant would go, wondering what the first defendant was going to do next. For the next 30 minutes or so, while pinned down by the first defendant, he did not identify himself as he was in a daze. His colleague, Rasyid, also did not identify himself or the plaintiff when he arrived at the scene. The plaintiff surmised that it could be because Rasyid was then new to the job.
30     The plaintiff added in cross-examination that he requested the nurse at SGH not to ward him. He had to go to Jakarta that evening and was prepared to bear with the pain. He had instructed his staff to bring his luggage from the office and to pick him up from SGH to go to the airport. He rushed to the airport still attired in his torn clothes. A colleague took a video footage of him in his torn clothes there. He then went to change his clothes in a toilet at the airport before boarding the plane. One of his friends had passed away about one month before the incident and the widow was waiting for the plaintiff to bring her some money. He wanted to go to Jakarta that evening to give her the money and to console her.
31     He tried to forget about the incident and had no intention to sue. After suffering physically and emotionally for about one year, the plaintiff decided to take it off his chest by seeking legal advice. On 10 December 2010, this action was commenced.
32     The plaintiff called Rasyid and another colleague, Ms Tham Mei Yong, to testify on his behalf. He also called as his witnesses the first two police officers at the scene, a senior police officer who arrived at the scene after the ambulance had left for SGH (DSP Heng Chih Yang), one of the paramedics and Dr Shanaz Matthew Sajeed of SGH.
33     Rasyid testified that around 3pm on 10 March 2009, he began his surveillance work at Killiney Road. He followed the subject but lost sight of him along the way. He then called the plaintiff on the radio set and he instructed Rasyid to proceed to Dalvey Road. He arrived at Dalvey Road at about 4.15pm, left his motorcycle near a bus stand along Stevens Road and walked towards the plaintiff’s car along Dalvey Road. The plaintiff then called Rasyid and told him to be at the bus stand. As he was walking back to the bus stand, he saw the subject driving into Dalvey Road. He immediately called the plaintiff but received no response from him. At about 4.20pm, the plaintiff informed Rasyid to go to where he was.
34     When Rasyid went to meet the plaintiff, he observed the first defendant pushing the plaintiff on at least three occasions and pulling the plaintiff’s T-shirt. He also saw the security officer next to the first defendant. The plaintiff was talking to the two men there but Rasyid was not able to hear the conversation.
35     The plaintiff’s right hand was handcuffed. The first defendant then swiped the plaintiff’s feet, pinned him to the ground and crouched on the plaintiff who was lying prostrate and appearing helpless. The first defendant was tugging at the handcuff. The plaintiff did not struggle. Rasyid asked the first defendant why he was doing this to the plaintiff and asked him to release him. The first defendant ignored him.
36     The plaintiff requested Rasyid to call the police and to ask for an ambulance. Rasyid called the police and requested assistance and an ambulance. At trial, Rasyid corrected himself and said he only called the police and not the ambulance. When the police asked him whether an ambulance was required, he told them “No”. He saw no need for an ambulance as the injuries did not look very serious. He also said that the conversation with the first defendant was after he had called the police. He then called Ms Tham Mei Yong for instructions. As the incident happened more than two years ago, he was unable to recall all the details.
37     The police arrived and the first defendant released the handcuff on the plaintiff’s right hand. The ambulance arrived shortly thereafter and the paramedics attended to the plaintiff who appeared unsteady on his feet. As the plaintiff was relating the incident to the police and the paramedics, the first defendant taunted the plaintiff and remarked sarcastically that he too was injured. The first defendant wanted to speak to Rasyid for a few seconds but he refused to speak to him as he felt sad about the incident and decided he should not be making any comments. The plaintiff was then taken away by the ambulance. He was “in a pitiful state”.
38     The next day, at the prompting of the plaintiff, Rasyid wrote out an account of the incident. Sometime after the incident, the plaintiff and he returned to the scene with a photographer to re-enact the manner in which the first defendant had restrained the plaintiff. The photographs of the re-enactment were tendered as evidence. According to the photographer, whose evidence was dispensed with by consent, the re-enactment took place on 15 March 2009.
39     Rasyid did not think of identifying the plaintiff and himself as private investigator as he was new to the job then, having joined Simmon only on 1 March 2009. He added that when the plaintiff said he was in pain, the first defendant uttered a vulgarity (as in 
[13]
 above).
40     Ms Tham Mei Yong, one of the directors of Simmon, has known the plaintiff for some 18 years. They have lived together in a rented terrace house for about eight years. They are close friends but their relationship was strictly a professional one. As she is one of the operatives in Simmon, living together makes it easier for them to go out together for their work.
41     She was involved in the surveillance of the subject but not on 10 March 2009. Sometime after 5pm that day, she received a call from Rasyid telling her that the plaintiff had been arrested. She rushed to Dalvey Road where she saw two police cars, an ambulance, four police officers and two paramedics. There was also a crowd of onlookers.
42     The plaintiff was lying down in the ambulance. He was trembling and appeared pathetic, frail and weary. She was worried for him as she knew about his medical problems. The severely distressed man she saw that afternoon was far different from the confident and composed man that she had known for almost two decades. He was “gibbering” and asking her to look for his mobile phone. She eventually located it in his car.
43     She told the first defendant that the plaintiff was a heart patient and that he could have killed the plaintiff. However, she was ignored. Two other police officers arrived at the scene after the ambulance took the plaintiff away. She always carried a spare key for the plaintiff’s car. She called a staff of Simmon to go to Dalvey Road to drive her car. She then drove the plaintiff’s car and they all proceeded to SGH to check on the plaintiff. After that, she left for the airport with the plaintiff. His luggage was actually already in his car when he went to Dalvey Road earlier that day. She told Rasyid to take the video footage of the plaintiff at the airport so as to show the state the plaintiff was in and what his injuries were.
44     After the incident, she observed that the plaintiff would become anxious whenever he saw a policeman. He would also try to avoid Stevens Road. For some time after the incident on 10 March 2009, the plaintiff would become nervous and jumpy when doing surveillance work. She informed the police and the Security Industry Regulatory Department after that day that Simmon intended to continue with the surveillance work at Stevens Road and Dalvey Road in order to avoid further incidents. Subsequent surveillance in that area was conducted by her and others. However, all reports of investigations were written by the plaintiff because of his good command of the English language.
45     SSG Alvin Kum and CPL Muhd Taufiq were in a police car patrolling along Claymore Road at about 5.30pm on 10 March 2009 when they heard over the radio set that there was an incident at Dalvey Road. They rushed to the scene and saw the security officer, the plaintiff and the first defendant. The plaintiff was lying in a prone position next to the brick wall that was parallel to the concrete footpath. The first defendant was beside him holding on to one end of the handcuff that was on the plaintiff’s right wrist.
46     When SSG Alvin Kum asked the plaintiff what had happened, he replied that he was forcibly pulled at his T-shirt and pinned down to effect arrest. He also said that he had injuries and needed immediate medical attention. The two police officers did not interview or give any instructions to the first defendant. They went near to assist the plaintiff and noticed a bruise on his left elbow, abrasions on his right knee and his right forehead and handcuff marks on his right wrist. At that moment, the first defendant began to remove the handcuff from the plaintiff’s wrist. The plaintiff said he was a private investigator waiting for his target. The plaintiff also claimed to have chest pain. SSG Alvin Kum helped him to his feet and interviewed him. He looked untidy and was perspiring profusely at his forehead area. The first defendant explained that he had arrested the plaintiff for trying to obstruct a public servant in the discharge of his duty.
47     The police officers called their operations room for instructions and for an ambulance as the plaintiff looked wobbly and sounded a bit traumatised. The plaintiff did not say how long he was on the ground. A short while later, two other pairs of police officers arrived at the scene. There were a few members of the public standing near Stevens Close. The first two police officers at the scene helped direct traffic along Stevens Road for a while because the ambulance was parked nearby at Stevens Close. They then left in their police car.
48     Contrary to what the plaintiff stated in his AEIC, CPL Muhd Taufiq, who was serving his national service at the material time, denied that he grabbed the plaintiff’s T-shirt near the collar or that he told the plaintiff that he had no choice as he was under arrest while doing so.
49     Sofian bin Osman was one of the paramedics at the scene that day. While he was examining the plaintiff and the other paramedic was examining the first defendant, the latter said to Sofian that he was injured. He showed Sofian his hands and pointed to his leg. The first defendant was not treated medically. The plaintiff was standing and was conscious. His injuries were washed with saline solution and a dressing was put over his leg injury. There were only external injuries.
50     ASP (now DSP) Heng Chih Yang testified that when he arrived at the scene that day, the incident was already over and the ambulance had left. He interviewed the first defendant at the scene, the plaintiff at SGH and subsequently at Tanglin Police Division and Rasyid at the said police division. The plaintiff looked normal to him at SGH. He was initially in a wheelchair and had already seen the doctor. Later the plaintiff told him that he was taking a flight in a few hours’ time. He was with the plaintiff at SGH for about 15 minutes.
51     Dr Shanaz Matthew Sajeed examined the plaintiff at SGH at about 6.35pm that day and noted the injuries as stated at 
[21]
 above. He directed that an X-ray be done on the plaintiff’s right knee although he could walk because of the plaintiff’s age and as he had said that he fell as a result of a tackle. This was to check for fractures. None was detected. The plaintiff spoke of pain over his right knee, right forearm and right wrist. The doctor noted that “there was no loss of consciousness, chest pain, or any significant head injury” in his medical report of 12 May 2009. The plaintiff’s wounds were dressed appropriately and he was given some painkillers. He was discharged well with no follow-up needed as the injuries were minor.
The defendants’ case
52     The first defendant, presently a diploma holder, was about 40 years old at the time of the incident in 2009. He joined the second defendant as an Auxiliary Police Officer (“APO”) on 1 June 1998. From August 1998 to Nov 2010, he was deployed for duty at the embassy. His duties as an APO at the embassy, as spelt out in the operations order issued by the second defendant, included the protection of lives and properties by detecting and deterring unauthorised persons at the embassy and taking appropriate action against such unauthorised persons in the act of committing any breach of security or any undesirable acts. He also performed patrols on foot or on a bicycle in the vicinity of the embassy to ensure that there were no suspicious persons which might pose a threat to the embassy. This was particularly crucial during the periods when the embassy’s top officials were arriving at or leaving the embassy’s grounds.
53     The operations order provides guidelines to APOs on what to do in confrontations. When confronted by an unknown person who is angry or uses abusive language, the APO is to politely tell that person to stop using such language and, if the abuse continues, to warn him that he will be arrested. If he persists, the APO is to effect arrest and hand him over to the police. When a person obstructs the APO in his duties, he is to go through the same three stages. If there is physical assault, the APO is to use unarmed combat techniques and to arrest by using handcuffs and then hand the arrested person over to the police.
54     On 10 March 2009, the first defendant was on duty at the embassy. At about 5.15pm, the security officer radioed him to inform him that a male Indian was behaving suspiciously, sitting at the footway along Stevens Road. The security officer said the male Indian did not answer questions put to him. As a senior official of the embassy was scheduled to leave the embassy grounds shortly, the first defendant was asked to check on that person.
55     When the first defendant arrived at the scene by bicycle, he saw the plaintiff sitting on the concrete footpath along Stevens Road. There was a small black bag next to him. After speaking briefly to the security officer, he approached the plaintiff, stood next to him in a bending position and asked him for his particulars and the reason for his presence there. Apart from saying rudely that he was waiting for a friend, the plaintiff refused to answer the first defendant’s questions. A short while later, the plaintiff asked whether there was a problem with him sitting there. The first defendant told him it was a sensitive place to which the plaintiff retorted angrily, “Do I look like a terrorist?” The plaintiff then made remarks along the lines of “You are a lowly educated CISCO officer, not a policeman and have no right to check on me”. The first defendant showed his warrant card and replied that he had the right to question the plaintiff as an APO. He squatted and asked the plaintiff what was inside the black bag and whether he could take a look at its contents. The plaintiff ignored him.
56     Because of this, the first defendant was concerned that the plaintiff could be a threat to the embassy, in particular, that the black bag could contain some dangerous weapon or some such items. He decided to check the black bag and therefore reached across the plaintiff in an attempt to take a closer look at it. The plaintiff immediately shoved the first defendant’s hand away with force. The first defendant was thrown off balance and fell to the ground.
57     As the plaintiff was obstructing the first defendant in his duties, the first defendant was even more concerned that the plaintiff could be a serious security threat. He decided to arrest the plaintiff and therefore informed him of his intention. He then held the plaintiff’s right arm and attempted to put the handcuff on his right wrist. The plaintiff resisted and put up a strong struggle.
58     As the plaintiff was vigorously resisting arrest, the first defendant had no option but to throw the plaintiff off balance by using his leg to sweep him off his feet. He then brought the plaintiff down to the ground in a controlled manner, using reasonable and proportionate force. Once the plaintiff was on the ground, the first defendant placed his left knee lightly on the plaintiff’s back as a precautionary measure in case the plaintiff should suddenly try to get up. He then handcuffed the plaintiff’s right hand and asked the plaintiff to let him have his left hand. The plaintiff refused to comply. Instead, he complained of chest pains. Shortly after hearing this, the first defendant released the handcuff and allowed the plaintiff to get up and sit on the concrete footway. The first defendant then called the police for assistance. The plaintiff was seated on the concrete footway and appeared to be making some calls. The first defendant said the time that elapsed between his arrest of the plaintiff and the release of the handcuff was definitely not as long as 30 minutes.
59     The first defendant denied that he had slammed the plaintiff to the ground. He argued that if he had done that, the plaintiff’s injuries would have been more serious than mild bruising and abrasion of his arms and knees.
60     At about 5.40pm, a police patrol car arrived at the scene. The plaintiff and the first defendant were interviewed separately by the police officers. The first defendant overheard the plaintiff saying that he was a private investigator carrying out surveillance work on a man. The plaintiff also complained of pain and demanded that an ambulance be called.
61     At about 5.55pm, the ambulance arrived and attended to the plaintiff. He recalled the paramedic telling the plaintiff that there was no need for him to go to the hospital. However, the plaintiff insisted on going. He was therefore brought to SGH.
62     At about 6pm, the first defendant called Inspector Annuar bin Abdul Rahman, his superior officer. At about 7pm, he gave a statement to the police. As a result of the struggle with the plaintiff, the first defendant sustained cuts on both hands and some bruising of his right knee and was attended to at Changi General Hospital. The police subsequently discovered that the plaintiff’s black bag contained a camera used for surveillance operations.
63     The first defendant said that if the plaintiff had informed him earlier that he was a private investigator doing surveillance work that day, the incident would not have happened. The first defendant would have merely asked the plaintiff to show him his private investigator’s licence and/or identification papers and then allowed him to carry on with his tasks. He claimed that he was acting in accordance with the operations order that day.
64     The first defendant testified that Rasyid did come along while the plaintiff was handcuffed and said, “Hey, what are you doing? Why are you treating this old man like that?” The first defendant did not respond to him as he appeared to be just a passer-by.
65     The first defendant said he had lost his official pocket book for the period in issue. It was kept in a warehouse which he had rented to store his things because he had moved his home. He also said he was not charged for any offence by the police in relation to the incident of 10 March 2009. No disciplinary action was taken against him too. He made a workman’s compensation claim for the injuries to his palms caused during the incident.
66     ASP Annuar has been in the employ of the second defendant since April 1979. At the time of the incident, he was the officer commanding sector B and the embassy was one of the areas within his purview. Because of the worldwide threats against embassies of Israel, the security of the embassy here was of great importance.
67     At about 5.40pm on 10 March 2009, he was informed that an arrest had been made in the vicinity of the embassy. He instructed his deputy to proceed to the scene to gather more information. At about 6pm, the first defendant called him and related the incident to him. The next morning, ASP Annuar called the first defendant to obtain the reference number of the report that he had made to the investigating officer of the incident and to ask about the time that the first defendant left the scene. Based on what the first defendant told him, he then prepared an Incident Report on 11 March 2009.
68     The defendants have not been able to get the embassy’s security officer to testify in court. The embassy did not give its consent to the security officer testifying in court and, in any event, he was out of the jurisdiction attending a course.
69     DAC Deryl Ang was the final witness for the defence. He has been with the Singapore Police Force since 1986. He is presently seconded to the second defendant as the commander of the Auxiliary Police Force.
70     His evidence related to the issue of the legality of the arrest made by the first defendant. Based on the Incident Report dated 11 March 2009 (see 
[67]
 above), he was of the opinion that the first defendant was entirely justified in effecting the arrest on 10 March 2009. The plaintiff’s behaviour, his proximity to the embassy and the fact that he was carrying a black bag with unknown contents would cause a person to reasonably suspect that the plaintiff might pose a genuine threat to the security of the embassy. The plaintiff’s use of force was an obstruction of the first defendant’s duties and also an assault on a public servant. The first defendant was therefore justified in arresting the plaintiff and it was appropriate that handcuffs were used. This was because the plaintiff had resorted to physical force and it was reasonable for the first defendant to believe that he would resort to further violence or make an attempt to escape when the arrest was being effected. This was in line with the second defendant’s standing orders.
The decision of the court
71     This case hinges on the credibility of the plaintiff and the first defendant and their respective versions of the events that took place after they first met that afternoon on 10 March 2009.
72     It is clear to me that the whole episode would not have taken place if the plaintiff had not been so deliberately reticent towards the security officer and then the first defendant. It is hard to comprehend why a former senior police officer like the plaintiff would take umbrage at being questioned as to his purpose in sitting on the footpath along Stevens Road that day. Even if he was justified in refusing to explain himself further to the security officer, who was not in uniform, and saw no need to blow his cover as a private investigator and did not fully appreciate the meaning of “security” uttered by the security officer as he was then not aware that the embassy was nearby, surely the situation had changed by the time a uniformed APO came along and questioned him as to his purpose in waiting there. There was no issue about the plaintiff knowing that the first defendant was an APO.
73     A former senior police officer like the plaintiff must surely appreciate that the first defendant was merely performing his duties and that since an APO was called to question him, there must be something that the security officer and the APO were concerned about. He could have easily set their minds at ease by mentioning that he was a private investigator doing surveillance work on a subject. If necessary, he could have produced some proof of his status. Instead, he chose to be difficult and pugnacious towards a uniformed officer.
74     I believe the first defendant’s account as to what transpired after he arrived at the scene and went towards the plaintiff. He did not appear to me to be someone given to violence or to exaggeration. He was in uniform and on official duty. It defies belief that he would approach the plaintiff as if spoiling for a fight in bright daylight in an open public space and that he would become so furious over the plaintiff’s seeming nonchalant attitude when he was being questioned. It was even more incredible that he would slam the plaintiff face down in the manner alleged. If he had done that, it would be quite amazing that the black pouch or bag was not flung out of the plaintiff’s left hand and that the video recorder inside it was not damaged at all with that hard landing on the concrete floor, even if there was some padding inside the said pouch or bag. The plaintiff’s minor injuries certainly did not bear out his version of the events. On the other hand, the first defendant’s account accorded with the injuries found on the plaintiff and on the first defendant’s hands.
75     I do not place much weight on the exact sequence or timing of the events from the witnesses. It was understandable that there would be some discrepancies in the sequence and timing, given the circumstances of the incident here. However, the plaintiff’s evidence that he was on the ground with his right arm twisted behind his back for about 30 minutes was simply unacceptable. If the incident took that long, it would be highly surprising that the first defendant did not pull the plaintiff’s left arm backwards to be handcuffed. As acknowledged by the plaintiff, who was very familiar with police arrest procedures, the next thing after handcuffing his right wrist would be to handcuff his left wrist as well. Yet, the first defendant, practically kneeling on top of the prostrate plaintiff, lying on the hard ground helpless and not struggling, somehow could not or did not reach out to pull the plaintiff’s left arm, which was still clinging on to the black pouch or bag, to be handcuffed for the whole 30 minutes. Instead, according to the plaintiff, a uniformed APO would choose to kneel forcefully on an arrested person’s back and continue to tug at his handcuffed hand in an open space next to a public road in bright daylight for a good half hour, with the plaintiff’s left arm outstretched and hanging on to the black pouch or bag and with onlookers observing what was happening. If not for the seriousness of the allegations made in this case, the scenario presented by the plaintiff would be quite comical indeed.
76     The plaintiff also claimed that he did not identify himself during all that time because he was in a daze after the violent arrest. However, when Rasyid arrived at the scene later, he could instruct Rasyid to call the police. Scenes of arrest were nothing new to the plaintiff although he had left the police force for about a decade by then. Even though he was the one handcuffed on this occasion, one can only wonder why, for 30 whole minutes, he could not even simply explain that he was a private investigator doing some surveillance work and that he had a video recorder to prove it. However, despite being in a daze, he could feel embarrassment and humiliation because of the onlookers (see 
[15]
 above). The arrest could not have taken anything close to 30 minutes. According to the first defendant’s evidence, which I accept, it would have taken no more than a few minutes.
77     All this shows that the plaintiff’s version of the events could not be true. The more probable version is that he, having been a senior police officer before, was truculent and disrespectful towards the first defendant, whom he regarded with disdain as he considered him “a lowly educated CISCO officer, not a policeman” (see 
[55]
 above). For that reason, the plaintiff saw no need to identify himself or to explain his presence there despite the lawful queries from the APO thereby leading unnecessarily to the events that followed.
78     The first defendant had every reason to check out the plaintiff as a senior official of the embassy was about to leave the premises at that time. He was in uniform and the plaintiff knew what that uniform was. If the plaintiff had merely condescended to answering the simple and lawful queries made by the “lowly” first defendant, even if he was justified in not being forthright with the security officer, he would not have subjected himself to this unhappy incident. As things happened, the plaintiff’s conduct became the cause of his own arrest.
79     It was unfortunate that the security officer of the embassy could not testify at the trial. He was not in Singapore during the trial. One can also easily appreciate why the embassy may be reluctant to have its security officer testify in court about security matters of the embassy. I draw no adverse inference from his absence. In any event, the evidence adduced in court was more than sufficient for me to come to a firm view as to which version of the incident is the truth.
80     Under s 32(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Ed), the applicable law on 10 March 2009, a police officer may arrest without a warrant of arrest any person who has been concerned in any seizable offence or against whom a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so concerned. By virtue of s 32(1)(e), a police officer may also arrest without a warrant any person who obstructs him while in the execution of his duty. The plaintiff acknowledged that an APO has all the powers, privileges and immunities of a police officer (see Gazette No. 43 of 2004).
81     Carrying or possession of an offensive weapon in a public road or place otherwise than with lawful authority or for a lawful purpose would be a seizable offence under s 6 of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65). Under s 9 of that Act, a police officer has powers of search without warrant if he has reasonable grounds for believing that any evidence of the commission or of the preparation for the commission of an offence under the Act is likely to be found on any person.
82     The first defendant had every reason to be concerned as the plaintiff was sitting on a footpath near the embassy at a time when the senior official was about to leave the premises. The plaintiff’s attitude towards the security officer and the first defendant, his refusal to say what was inside his black pouch or bag when asked, followed by his physical resistance against the first defendant reaching out to the said pouch or bag provided reasonable grounds for the first defendant to believe that it might contain a weapon. The plaintiff was also making it more difficult for the first defendant to carry out his duty as an APO by being truculent and uncooperative. He was therefore obstructing the APO in the execution of his duty.
83     The plaintiff’s use of force against an APO could also be an offence under s 353 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Ed) which is a seizable offence of assaulting or using criminal force to a public servant in the execution of his duty. Further, his uttering of the offensive words against the first defendant (see 
[55]
 above) could also fall within s 13D of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184) which provides for an offence of using abusive or insulting words or behaviour towards a public servant in the execution of his duty in a public place or in a private place (a seizable offence pursuant to s 40 of the same Act).
84     In all the circumstances of this case, the arrest of the plaintiff by the first defendant was therefore completely justified. Further, the force used by the first defendant was reasonable and justifiable on account of the plaintiff’s resistance and struggle. The injuries to the plaintiff all occurred in the course of effecting the lawful arrest in a lawful manner. There was therefore no wrongful arrest and no unlawful force used. The first defendant could not be liable for the injuries caused. Consequently, his employer, the second defendant, could not be vicariously liable as the first defendant had done no wrong.
85     In the plaintiff’s written submissions, he included a claim for false imprisonment on the basis that the handcuffing of his right wrist and pinning him to the ground constituted such. However, this claim was not pleaded. In any case, it would have failed in the light of my findings on the facts.
86     The plaintiff claimed $150,000 as compensatory and aggravated damages and $100,000 as exemplary damages. In addition, he claimed special damages in the sum of $300 as the estimated cost of replacing his torn jeans and T-shirt and his lost spectacles. Although it is unnecessary for me to deal with the issue of damages in the light of my findings on liability, I shall make some comments on the plaintiff’s evidence relating to the physical injuries and the mental agony allegedly suffered by him as a result of the incident.
87     In respect of the plaintiff’s physical injuries, even the untrained eyes of Rasyid observed that they were not serious and did not merit calling for an ambulance to the scene. The paramedic who examined the plaintiff noted that the plaintiff was standing and was conscious. He washed the plaintiff’s injuries with saline solution and put a dressing over his leg injury. There were only external injuries. Dr Shanaz Matthew Sajeed directed that an X-ray be done on the plaintiff’s right knee although he could walk because of the plaintiff’s age and his description as to the cause of his fall. No fracture was detected. There was no loss of consciousness, chest pain, or any significant head injury. The plaintiff’s wounds were dressed appropriately and he was given some painkillers and was then discharged well with no follow-up needed as the injuries were minor.
88     The physical injuries listed at 
[21]
 above confirmed that the plaintiff suffered only minor injuries during the arrest. Such injuries would not attract more than $5,000 in damages.
89     As for the emotional and psychological disturbances the plaintiff alleged he suffered, although he claimed that he deliberately avoided the vicinity of Stevens Road for about a year after the incident, he was able to return to the scene five days later for a photographic re-enactment of the arrest. At least the earlier segment of the re-enactment must have been directed by him because Rasyid appeared at the scene on 10 March 2009 subsequent to the arrest. As a seasoned former senior police officer, arrest scenes involving more suspects and much worse struggles must have occurred many times during the plaintiff’s illustrious career as described on Simmon’s website. He retired early from the police force but not on medical grounds.
90     He was sufficiently alert during the incident to notice and be embarrassed by passers-by looking curiously at him lying on the ground with an APO kneeling on his back. His mind was clear enough for him to remember that he had a flight to catch in a few hours’ time and to give instructions regarding his luggage. He was obviously well enough to tell the hospital staff he did not want to be warded because of the trip. He was certainly stable enough to make the trip to Jakarta on his own that very night.
91     Why then would this tough former senior police officer suddenly turn into a nervous wreck for a substantial period over an allegedly wrongful arrest and assault to the extent that he would be distressed and jittery whenever he saw a police car or a police officer? The objective evidence pointed clearly to a grossly exaggerated dramatization of the purported aftermath of the incident. I do not accept that there was any emotional and psychological disturbance.
92     The plaintiff therefore fails entirely in his claim against both defendants. His action against them is dismissed with costs to be agreed or taxed. If the parties would like me to fix the costs of the action, they may request in writing to attend before me in chambers on a suitable date to make the necessary submissions on costs.",2012-04-05 00:00:00,SG High Court

Criminal law

 Lee Seiu Kin J:
1       The appellant claimed trial at the District Court to two charges of criminal breach of trust. The trial took 22 days. On 27 October 2010, he was convicted of the first charge and fined $6,000. He appealed against the conviction, and the Prosecution appealed against the sentence. The district judge acquitted the appellant of the second charge, a decision which the Prosecution appealed.
2       The facts of this appeal were tangled and it was easy to lose sight of what was important. The length of the trial and the muddled manner of prosecution did not help. But once the core issues were identified, it was clear to me that the appellant had to be acquitted of any criminal wrongdoing.
The factual background
3       The complainant owned a Hyundai Matrix (“the Car”). He had bought it with a bank loan, of which about $42,000 remained unpaid. Buying the car was a poor investment decision, as the value of the Car was now only slightly more than $26,400. This value was the combined total of the value of the body (or export value) and the paper value (the Preferential Additional Registration Fee (“PARF”) and Certificate of Entitlement (“COE”) rebates).
4       Undeterred, the complainant wanted a new car – a Honda Fit. The appellant, a car salesman, agreed to buy the Car from the complainant for $29,200. The understanding was that the complainant would then buy a new Honda Fit from appellant for $58,800. On 24 May 2008, the complainant delivered the Car to the appellant.
5       But the unpaid loan on the Car had to be repaid. Since the value of the outstanding loan (about $42,000) was more than the agreed sale price of the car ($29,200), the complainant agreed to pay the difference of about $13,000 to the appellant. If all went well, the appellant would, upon receipt of the $13,000, redeem the car loan and sell the new Honda Fit to the complainant (taking into account the $29,200 credit for the Car).
6       Things did not go so well. The appellant sold the Car on 28 May 2008 to a re-exporter and received $4,000 for the body. The complainant paid some sums of money to the appellant, yet the car loan was never redeemed. Accordingly, the Car was not de-registered at the material time. Meanwhile, since PARF and COE rebates are paid only upon de-registration, the paper value of the Car declined as time passed. Interest on the unpaid loan also accrued. The bank began waving the threat of bankruptcy. Amidst this financially harrowing time, the complainant made a police report on 28 January 2009. He complained that he had transferred the Car to the appellant and given him certain sums of money, but the appellant had failed to perform his end of the bargain. This complaint led to the appellant’s prosecution for criminal breach of trust.
The central question
7       The first charge read:
... that you, sometime on 24.5.2008 ... being entrusted with [a Hyundai Matrix belonging to the complainant], did commit criminal breach of trust by dishonestly converting to your own use, the said property, to wit, by selling the said motorcar to a car exporter ... for $4,000 and retaining the proceeds of sale, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 406 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
The appellant was convicted by the district judge on this charge. This charge related to the appellant’s taking delivery of the Car and his subsequent sale of it to the re-exporter.
8       The second charge read:
... that you, sometime on or about 22 June 2008 ... being entrusted with property, namely cash amounting to S$6,412 belonging to [the complainant] ... did dishonestly misappropriate the said property, and you have thereby committed criminal breach of trust in respect of the said property, which offence is punishable under Section 406 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
The appellant was acquitted of this charge. This charge related to money which the complainant allegedly paid to the appellant, for the purpose of redeeming the car loan.
9       The link between the two charges was provided by the appellant’s defence. Stripped to its essentials, the appellant’s position was this: contrary to their agreement, the complainant had not given him the $13,000 needed to redeem the car loan. Accordingly, he had never been in a position to complete his part of the transaction. It followed that any form of criminal wrongdoing in relation to the facts of the first charge would depend in part on the facts of the second charge – to the extent that the alleged payment of $6,412 made up the $13,000 paid to the appellant for him to redeem the car loan.
10     Therefore although framed as two isolated charges, in reality they were elements of one and the same transaction. Proceeding with two independent charges was unhelpful because it tended to gloss over the connexion between them. Neither did it assist the district judge to firmly grasp the central question.
11     To my mind, the appellant’s criminal wrongdoing hinged on only one question: why had he not redeemed the outstanding car loan? It was accepted that the appellant did not credit the complainant with the $29,200 for the Car. If it had been so credited, clearly there would be no cause for any prosecution. The appellant said that he never credited the complainant because the bank loan was never redeemed (and so the car could not be de-registered). Why? Answering this question would decide the appeal.
12     The appellant accepted that he had a contractual duty to redeem the car loan. The complainant also accepted that he had to top-up the difference of $13,000 before the appellant could redeem the loan. Hence it became very important to decide if the appellant had received the $13,000 from the complainant. If he had, then the appellant would have to explain why he nonetheless failed to redeem the car loan. But if not, the Prosecution’s case would fail at the first hurdle.
Did the appellant receive the $13,000?
13     According to the appellant, he received $5,000 (in three instalments) before 24 May 2008, and one payment of $3,000 on 22 June 2008 – a total of only $8,000. The Prosecution’s case was that the appellant had received $8,000 (in three instalments) before 24 May 2008, and a payment of $6,412 on 22 June 2008 – a total of roughly $14,000. No receipts had been issued for any of the payments.
14     The key document in the appellant’s favour was the police report made by the complainant on 28 January 2009. In this report, the complainant was recorded as having said:
On 24.05.2008 at about 3.00pm, I traded my old car, SFJ 4579Y (Hyundai Matrix) with Apex Global Trading via an agent, [the appellant], for a new car, SJF7946A (Honda Fit). 
I paid him SGD8000.00 for the transaction.
 [emphasis added]
Hence, the complainant himself had complained to the police months after the transaction went awry, that he had given only $8,000 to the appellant. This is very different from the $14,000 he alleged at the trial. This statement corroborated the appellant’s story, which had been made before he knew of the contents of the police report.
15     This glaring discrepancy in the complainant’s evidence was neither addressed by the district judge, nor addressed in the Prosecution’s written submissions on appeal. When the complainant was confronted with the police report during cross-examination at the trial, he did not offer an explanation for the inconsistency. An explanation only surfaced during re-examination, when he blamed his forgetfulness and “muddled” state of mind.
16     A plea of forgetfulness is too glib an explanation on the present facts. When the complainant went to the police station more than seven months after the last payment to the appellant on 22 June 2008, the bank was threatening him with bankruptcy. The overriding question in his mind must have been why the appellant had not redeemed the car loan. The total payment to the appellant (for the purpose of redeeming that very loan) would have been foremost in the complainant’s mind. Further, if he remembered paying the $8,000 (which, on his own testimony was made in three instalments), it is difficult to accept that he would have somehow forgotten about the most recent payment of $6,412, which was a substantial sum.
17     For this reason, the Prosecution has not proven beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant received the $13,000 needed to redeem the car loan. That being so, there is nothing about the appellant’s subsequent sale of the car that the complainant can protest. 
If
 the appellant had credited the $29,200 to the complainant, it is irrelevant that he subsequently sold the car to a re-exporter. The appellant did 
not
 credit the complainant with $29,200. But why? The answer is that he was not given the $13,000 to redeem the car loan. It follows that the Prosecution has not proven any criminal wrongdoing.
Assuming that the appellant received $14,000
18     Even if I accepted that $14,000 had been paid to the appellant, there is another problem in the Prosecution’s case. The complainant did not, in the end, buy a new Honda Fit from the appellant. This is because the appellant could not provide one in the desired colour. Upon the appellant’s recommendation, the complainant bought his new car from another company Apex Global.
19     The Prosecution accepted that on 11 June 2008, the appellant issued two cheques totalling $3,055.86 to Apex Global. This sum was to pay for the down-payment, insurance and first instalment on the complainant’s new Honda Fit. Hence even if the appellant had initially received $14,000 from the complainant, there would 
still
 be a shortfall once the payment of $3,055.86 was taken into account. Hence no matter how one looked at the entire transaction, the appellant did not receive sufficient money from the complainant to redeem the car loan.
Conclusion
20     For the reasons given above, I allowed the appeal and acquitted the appellant. I also ordered the $6,000 fine to be refunded to him.",2012-03-05 00:00:00,SG High Court

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing
7 February 2012
 Choo Han Teck J:
1       The appellant was aged 56 on 21 April 2010, the time of the offences. He was convicted by the District Court on three charges after a trial lasting two days. He appealed against the convictions. The first was a charge of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) for which he was sentenced to imprisonment for two weeks. The second and third charges were under s 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the Miscellaneous Offences Act”) for behaving in a disorderly manner, and for which he was fined $1,000 each. He appealed against conviction and sentence.
2       The facts found by the trial judge were as follows. The appellant went to the Family Court on 21 April 2010 in relation to applications by him for a Personal Protection Order against his four siblings and counter applications by his siblings against him. While waiting for proceedings to commence the appellant head butted his brother, PW2 Chong Fook Leng (“PW2”). He then shouted when still in the corridor of the court. He and his brother were sent in to explain their conduct to the Family Court judge. When they left the Family Court the appellant started shouting again.
3       Two of the brothers including PW2 testified. The other, PW3 Chong Fook Tuang (“PW3”) testified that he saw the appellant hit PW2 with his head. He saw PW2 holding his nose and realised that the appellant had struck him on the nose. Both brothers testified that the appellant was aggressive and shouting. Their evidence was corroborated by PW4 Foo See Chong Jacky (“PW4”), a security officer of the Subordinate Courts. He too saw the appellant using his forehead to hit a man (PW2). He saw PW2 covering his nose and shouting in pain. PW4 heard the appellant shouting at PW2. PW5 was the investigation officer (“PW5”) who produced a footage of closed circuit television (“CCTV”) tape and explained that there was a two to three seconds lapse between frames.
4       Under cross-examination when confronted by PW4’s account to the Family Court judge, the appellant told the trial judge hat he was not saying that PW4 was lying but “it could be a clash of head. It all happened in a split second”. The trial judge also found the appellant’s testimony that he had followed PW3 into the Protecting Orderly Services room to be untrue because it was not borne out by the CCTV footage. The trial judge disbelieved the appellant’s account of the incident. The trial judge noted that the appellant’s testimony before her was that there was no bodily contact between him and PW2 whereas he told the Family Court judge at the time that it was possibly just a clash of heads. The trial judge disbelieved the appellant’s explanation of the head butting as a spasmodic action arising from shock and fear. On the other hand, she accepted PW2’s account and the corroborative testimonies of PW3 and PW4. PW1, Dr Leong Chui Ling testified that PW2 went to her for medical attention about four hours after the incident. She did not find any visible signs of injury but concluded that there was tenderness due to contusion and explained that was a soft tissue injury. She said that signs of redness could have subsided by the time of her examination of PW2.
5       The trial judge took into account the broad range of conduct that could be considered under a charge of disorderly behaviour. She concluded that shouting in the premises of a courthouse in the manner of the appellant was disorderly behaviour within the meaning of s 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences Act. She disbelieved the appellant’s account of the incidents in which he denied shouting in respect of the first charge, and in respect of the second, that he only said some Chinese words to PW4 as he was walking out of the courthouse.
6       On appeal, the appellant repeated his claim that he did not touch PW2 and did not shout. He also claimed that his evidence would be borne out by the CCTV. After perusing the CCTV footage, it was clear that it was not helpful to either the prosecution or the defence. Contrary to the appellant’s assertion, the trial judge did not rely on the CCTV to convict him. She relied on the oral testimonies of all the witnesses, including the appellant. The appellant also alleged a conspiracy and false evidence by PW4 but in spite of lengthy adjournments to produce such evidence and to engage counsel, he produced neither.
7       There was nothing on record that supported the appellant’s version. He claimed that it was impossible for him to have hit PW2 and not to have that recorded on the CCTV. The court below accepted the explanation that there was a two to three seconds lapse between frames. The appellant himself claimed at the Family Court that “all happened in split second”. There was no basis to disturb any of the trial judge’s findings of fact. Further, so far as the convictions for disorderly behaviour were concerned, I agree with the trial judge that a high level of decorum is expected in and near the vicinity of any courtroom. The conduct of the appellant as narrated by the prosecution witnesses was disorderly. I agree with the trial judge that the charges had been proved. The sentences meted out were not excessive. If it were not a family dispute, the appellant might have received a longer term of imprisonment. Accordingly, the appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed.",2012-02-07 00:00:00,SG High Court

 Choo Han Teck J:
1       The appellant was a 46 year old restaurateur. He was disqualified by a Subordinate Court from holding a driver’s licence for two years. The disqualification order took effect from 26 November 2008 and would have expired on 25 November 2010. However, on 29 July 2010 the appellant was arrested for riding a motorcycle FZ 7117 T. He pleaded guilty to that charge as well as a charge for riding without insurance cover. He was sentenced to five weeks’ imprisonment and four years’ disqualification in respect of the first charge, and fined $500 in respect of the second charge.
2       The appellant was married with two daughters aged 11 and 14 at the material time. He started a restaurant in Tanjong Pagar on 8 May 2009. Coming from Italy, he had misgivings in having sent his children out of their country at too young an age. One of his daughters had more trouble adapting than he feared, and he and his wife wondered if they should send her back to Italy. On the evening in question, the appellant spent an hour in vain to catch a taxi home. He had also received several telephone calls from his wife telling him that their daughter was distressed and had locked herself in the bathroom at home. The appellant was also physically tired for want of sleep. It was under these circumstances that he rode his brother’s motorcycle towards home when he was stopped at a routine police road block. His brother had just left for China to work and had asked the appellant to have the motorcycle towed away.
3       The trial judge below was of the view that an offence under s 43(4) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) usually attracts a custodial sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment, and a disqualification of three years. Several cases were referred to in which the range of sentence was between four to eight weeks’ imprisonment. Counsel on appeal referred to the same authorities and conceded that he was unable to find cases involving motorcycles. All the authorities referred to driving a motor car while under disqualification. The only one that involved a motorcycle was Fazil bin Azman 
[2010] SGDC 186
, but in that case the rider was involved in a collision at the time of the offence.
4       I am of the view that the court may, in appropriate cases, distinguish a case in which a motorcar or heavy vehicle was used, from one in which a motorcycle was used in offences under s 43(4). In this case, a shorter sentence of imprisonment may be ordered where the vehicle was a motorcycle, no accident had occurred, no physical harm was caused and there were sympathetic considerations available to the court. The appellant from despair and temptation rode himself to prison. I think that he will not place himself in a similar situation again. Consequently, I reduced the term of imprisonment from five to two weeks. Other terms remain undisturbed.",2012-01-12 00:00:00,SG High Court

Introduction
1       The plaintiff’s claim against the defendant was for personal injury arising out of an accident on 2 December 2006 at about 5.50am in a Central Expressway (“CTE”) tunnel from Upper Cross Street towards Ang Mo Kio involving a Mazda car driven by the defendant.
2       The defendant’s car spun out of control and hit the left wall and then the right wall of the tunnel before coming to a stop. The plaintiff’s left arm was injured.
The different versions
3       The defendant’s version was that he was travelling at a speed of about 40 to 50 kilometres per hour (“kph”) when his car was hit by another car from the rear causing him to lose control of his car which then hit the walls of the tunnel. The car was dark in colour and the defendant thought that it was a Honda Civic. The driver of that car drove off after the accident. The defendant added that the plaintiff was unsteady before he got into the defendant’s car as the plaintiff had consumed more alcohol than he should have during an event the night before. The plaintiff was also reaching for the steering wheel of the defendant’s car just before the accident occurred and had also not been wearing his seat belt.
4       The plaintiff’s version was that no car had hit the defendant’s car from the rear. The defendant had been speeding at about 100 kph and refused to slow down even though the plaintiff urged him to do so. As the defendant was negotiating a bend in the tunnel, he was about to doze off and lost control of the car. The plaintiff said he himself was wearing a seat belt and denied he tried to reach for the steering wheel of the car before the accident occurred.
The evidence and the court’s conclusion
5       The trial proceeded on the issue of liability only. The main dispute was over the defendant’s version that another car had hit his car from the rear. The burden was on the defendant to establish this version on a balance of probabilities.
6       The witnesses who had first-hand knowledge about this version were the defendant and the plaintiff themselves. Thus, each side sought to establish that the other side was not a credible witness by pointing out inconsistencies in various aspects of the evidence of each of these witnesses.
7       On one aspect of the defendant’s evidence, he was shown to be incorrect. He referred to the plaintiff as his cousin in his statement to the police made at about 1.30pm on the day of the accident. The plaintiff was not his cousin and was at most a close friend. The defendant suggested that he referred to the plaintiff as his cousin because of their close relationship. The plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Charan Singh (“Mr Charan”), sought to make much out of the misdescription of the relationship as I shall elaborate on later.
8       Generally speaking, I found that there were inconsistencies in various aspects of the evidence of each of these witnesses on issues other than the main dispute. Each seemed to lack some credibility. As regards the main dispute as to whether another car had hit the defendant’s car from the rear, there was evidence in favour of the defendant’s version, other than his own evidence, as I shall elaborate on later.
9       The damage to the defendant’s car, especially the rear thereof, was not properly established. While admissibility of the photographs of the damaged car (which were introduced for the defendant) was not in issue as the plaintiff admitted the authenticity of the photographs, the photographs were not clear. The photographer was not called to give evidence. No one who had assessed or repaired the damage was called to give evidence. Even with the photographs, the defendant’s evidence about the damage to the rear of his car was not steady. I found the photographs and evidence about the damage to be neutral. They did not establish the defendant’s version that his car had been hit by another car from the rear. Neither did they disprove his version.
10     Fortunately for the defendant, there was an important piece of evidence that supported his version.
11     After the accident, the plaintiff had taken a taxi to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“TTSH”) where he was admitted and warded. TTSH records contained Inpatient Clerking Notes in respect of the plaintiff. Under the heading “HISTORY SHEET”, someone had written, 
inter alia
: “Pt’s car hit by another vehicle from rear”.
12     The handwriting was that of a medical officer, Dr Uma Alagappan (“Dr Alagappan”). The notes were written on the same date of the accident, 
ie
, 2 December 2006 at 10.35am. Unsurprisingly, by the time she gave evidence on 4 March 2011, she could not identify the plaintiff or remember who gave her the information she had recorded.
13     She said that usually she would obtain such information from the patient himself. If the source was from someone else like a relative, she would mention the source in her notes. No other source was mentioned in her notes. Even if the patient was unable to give a history of what had happened, for example, if he was unable to talk, she would try and obtain the history from someone else in the patient’s presence and try to get verification from him.
14     The plaintiff denied giving the information recorded by the doctor. It was suggested to the doctor that the patient was too drowsy then to give the information as he was under medication. To this suggestion, the doctor pointed out that according to another part of the Inpatient Clerking Notes under the heading “CLINICAL EXAMINATION SHEET”, she had described the plaintiff’s general condition as “Comfortable, Alert”.
15     Mr Charan submitted that the information had come from the defendant himself who was trying to avoid responsibility for causing the accident. The defendant had referred to the plaintiff as his cousin in a report made to the police at about 1.30pm of the same day. He must have also described himself as the plaintiff’s cousin to Dr Alagappan earlier that day so that she would trust him enough to receive information from him and write down his self-serving version in her notes. The defendant had spoken out of earshot of the plaintiff who was therefore in no position to correct him.
16     I found this submission unlikely to be true. Firstly, the doctor had said that if the source of the information was from someone other than the patient himself, she would have recorded the source down. Secondly, there would have been no reason to record the history from someone else other than the patient unless there was good reason to do so. The only reason suggested to her was that the plaintiff was drowsy then but this was contradicted by her notes that the plaintiff was alert.
17     I was of the view that it was more likely that the information came from the plaintiff himself. The information corroborated the defendant’s version on the main issue.
18     There was yet another piece of evidence on the main issue which reinforced the above conclusion.
19     There was a letter dated 5 October 2007 written by one Dr Lee Keng Thiam of TTSH to Messrs Kannan SG (“Kannan SG”) who were the plaintiff’s initial solicitors. The letter was on the injury of the plaintiff and treatment thereof. However, the second sentence also mentioned the following: “He was apparently the front seat passenger in a car that was hit by another vehicle”. By the time of the trial, it was not in dispute that Dr Lee had obtained such information from the clerking notes written by Dr Alagappan. Her notes had also mentioned that the plaintiff was in the passenger seat in a car and his left arm had hit against a dashboard.
20     It is not in dispute that the plaintiff saw Dr Lee’s letter soon after 5 October 2007. Neither the plaintiff nor his solicitors asked TTSH in October 2007, or soon thereafter, as to the source of the information that the car in which the plaintiff was in had been hit by another vehicle. If the plaintiff’s version was true, he would have been shocked by such an allegation and he would have promptly sought the clarification either by himself or through his solicitors. This was not done until 14 June 2010, almost three years later, when the plaintiff’s present solicitors wrote to TTSH on that date. That letter was to seek medical notes and records and also to state that the plaintiff did not give any statement to any staff or doctor at TTSH. That letter alleged that the defendant had told the plaintiff that it was he who had given the version recorded by Dr Alagappan both to the traffic police as well as to a doctor at TTSH.
21     In addition, the letter of 5 October 2007 from Dr Lee was not disclosed in the first list of documents filed for the plaintiff on 1 April 2010. On 22 April 2010, the defendant’s solicitors wrote to the plaintiff’s solicitors to request for an in-patient discharge summary from TTSH. There was no reply.
22     On 12 May 2010, the defendant’s solicitors filed a Notice to Produce for medical notes, reports and/or an in-patient discharge summary.
23     On 19 May 2010, the defendant’s solicitors applied for discovery of specific documents. It was only thereafter that the plaintiff obtained a certified true copy (of the 5 October 2007 letter from TTSH) on 24 May 2010 and a copy was then forwarded to the defendant’s solicitors.
24     Mr Charan suggested that he had not received the relevant papers or file from Kannan SG at the time when the plaintiff’s list of documents was filed but he was not able to give me concrete evidence to establish this.
25     The circumstances in which the letter dated 5 October 2007 was eventually disclosed suggested that the plaintiff was hiding it although Mr Charan submitted that the plaintiff did obtain a certified true copy thereof and eventually consent to the application for discovery of specific documents. In my view, that submission did not adequately address the reason why such an important letter was not disclosed in the plaintiff’s list of documents in the first place.
26     I add that while the defendant gave a statement to the police about the accident on the same day as the accident at about 1.30pm, the plaintiff did not. The defendant’s statement mentioned that his car was hit from the rear by another car, dark in colour and described as a Honda Civic.
27     On the other hand, the plaintiff did not give his statement to the police on the same day of the accident or soon thereafter. He said that when the police officers came to see him at TTSH, he was still shocked and dazed. He was very sleepy and in pain. So he told them that he would give a statement after he was discharged. He was discharged on 7 December 2006 but he said that his first attempt to give a statement to the police was in April 2007. He was unsuccessful and eventually Kannan SG wrote on 7 December 2007 to the traffic police to say that he wanted to give a statement. This was followed up by a few reminders from Kannan SG until apparently a telephone conversation between the traffic police and one of the staff of Kannan SG on 29 April 2008 in which the traffic police said that the matter was closed. Nevertheless, the plaintiff eventually gave a statement to the police on 17 December 2008 in which he claimed,

 Lee Seiu Kin J:
Introduction
1       The plaintiff is the management corporation of strata title no 2757, which is an industrial development known as Northlink Development (“the Development”) located at 10 Admiralty Street, Singapore 757695. The Development comprises three connected blocks of 6-storey light industrial buildings (“the Building”) subdivided into 545 individual subsidiary units. The defendant is a consultant engineer and he had carried out the civil, structural and foundation design for the Development.
2       The plaintiff’s claims against the defendant are in negligence – the plaintiff alleges that the defendant’s design of the Building was negligent and this had resulted in defects therein which require to be rectified. The alleged defects are in the following areas of the Building:
(a)     expansion joints and surrounding areas;
(b)     lift motor rooms; and
(c)     mezzanine floors.
3       In the course of the trial, the parties reached a settlement on items (b) and (c) with the defendant agreeing to pay the plaintiff damages of $49,000 in relation to the lift motor rooms and $5,225 in relation to the mezzanine floors. The trial then proceeded on item (a), 
vi
z the expansion joints and surrounding areas. This claim arose from cracks discovered at the ends of several beams as well as at the edges of some corbels which are protrusions from columns to support beams. In the run up to the trial, both parties prepared expert reports in support of their respective positions. At the commencement of the trial, the parties’ experts attended a series of hearings in chambers which resulted in an agreement on a substantial number of points in relation to their evidence, leading to a considerable reduction of the issues in dispute. In the event, the parties agreed that the issue turns on whether the defendant’s design of the corbel/beam configurations at the expansion joints and surrounding areas (“the Design”) is defective.
4       The nub of the plaintiff’s case is that the Design was not in compliance with the requirements of the British Standards Institution’s (BSI) Code of Practice BS 8110:Part 1:1985 (“the Code”), in particular cl 5.2 thereof. The effect of this provision is that the bearing pad (which sits between the beam and the corbel, and transfers the load from the former to the latter) may only be located within the area where the steel reinforcement bars (“rebars”) are horizontal in both the beam and corbel. The reason offered by the plaintiff’s expert is that the part of the concrete where the rebars are bent does not have the ability to bear the tensile forces that would result from the load. In determining the dimensions of the corbels, the defendant had failed to take this factor into account and had specified corbel dimensions that, given the bar bending radius of the rebars selected, had insufficient overlap of horizontal bars; in some cases there was no overlap at all.
5       The nub of the defendant’s case is that this was not a defective design. The defendant did not dispute that, given the dimensions and rebar sizes, there was either very little or no overlap of horizontal rebars. However the defendant’s position is as follows:
(a)     Clause 5.2 of the Code does not apply to it as it is stated therein that this clause is only applicable to precast concrete whereas the corbels and beams in question were cast 
in situ
 (
ie
 cast on site).
(b)     The Code is only for guidance and non-compliance 
per se
 does not render a design inadequate: what was important was that it was calculated to be able to safely bear the design loads, based on engineering principles.
6       In relation to contention (a) above, the plaintiff’s expert opined that the requirements for 
in situ
 concrete construction in fact required more stringent constraints compared to precast concrete. This is because in the latter case the concrete elements are cast under controlled factory conditions and a higher level of quality control is achieved. As there is no other provision for corbels in the Code, the prudent thing for a designer to do would be at least to comply with the provisions of cl 5.2. Indeed, an extract from Allen: “Reinforced Concrete Design to BS8110” (marked as exhibit 3PE) tendered by the plaintiff’s expert, at Cap 10, suggests that the Code be used as well for corbels cast 
in situ
. I agree with the plaintiff’s expert in this regard.
7       Nevertheless, I accept the defendant’s contention that non-compliance with the Code does not, in itself, mean that the Design is inadequate. Both experts accepted that the Code represents cumulative engineering knowledge over a long period. It would follow that even though there is no strict requirement to comply with the Code, nevertheless, a design that is in compliance with it can generally be assumed to be safe. On the other hand, if a design does not comply with the Code, the designer would have to satisfy himself that it was safe by applying accepted principles of engineering. Therefore, in the present case, it is necessary for the defendant to demonstrate that his design is safe. To this end the defendant’s expert produced an analysis (marked as exhibit 6DE) to show that the stresses induced by the bearing pad over the critical parts of the corbels and beams did not exceed the tensile bearing capacity of the concrete. On the other hand, the plaintiff’s expert conducted his analysis (marked as exhibits 11PE and 15PE) of the stresses and strains in the corbel and found, for most of the loading scenarios, that the concrete would fail at the extreme end of the corbel. The analysis by the plaintiff’s expert was carried out with a computer using the finite element analysis method (“the FE Analysis”). The defendant’s expert accepted that the software used to produce the FE Analysis would produce an accurate answer if the parameters used were valid. He also accepted that the FE Analysis accurately showed that the corner of the corbels would be subjected to tensile strain beyond the acceptable range. I accept the findings of the plaintiff’s expert that at various points in the corbels and beams the stresses exceed the permissible tensile stress for concrete.
8       There is also the question of what is the acceptable range of tensile stress and strain. Both experts agreed that concrete is strong under compression and is designed to take compressive stresses. They also agreed that concrete is not strong under tension; its tensile strength is only about 10% of its compressive strength. Therefore, any part of a concrete structural member that has to bear any substantial tensile load should contain steel rebars to take over the tensile load. Where the load is below the tensile capacity of the concrete it is permissible for that part to be unreinforced. However, the two experts disagreed on the limit of such loading: the defendant’s expert was of the view that it may be the full 10% whereas the plaintiff’s expert opined that it should be reduced by a partial safety factor of 1.5, which is the same factor applied to limit the compressive load on concrete. This factor is applied to take into account variations in construction quality. However, both experts agreed that the constraining factor is the limiting strain of 0.0001. Nevertheless, although it is not really material, I find the position of the plaintiff’s expert that the tensile strength should be reduced by a factor of 1.5 to be logical: this same factor is applied to the compressive strength and there is no reason why a reduction to take into account construction variations should not apply to both limiting strengths. I would just say that the fact that there is no guidance on this appears to be because, as both experts had said, engineers are not supposed to design concrete to take any significant tensile load without steel reinforcement.
9       I should add that the plaintiff’s position accords with the position taken by the Code, 
ie
 that the concrete cover region of the corbel and beam should not be subjected to any loading at all. It seems to me that this was an oversight on the part of the defendant, and it had resulted not only in an inadequate design, but had in fact resulted in actual failure in various corbels in the building. The defendant’s expert admitted that in principle there was a shortcoming in the design of the expansion joints. He said that he would have provided 25mm chamfers at the edges of the corbel and beams. This means that those structural elements should not be loaded at the concrete cover zone.
10     The foregoing covers, in a nutshell, the main issues in the case. In the course of the trial, various other issues were ventilated. For example, the plaintiff also contended that the defendant had failed to make allowances for (a) thermal expansion and (b) shrinkage and creep. The plaintiff’s case is that these would cause the beam to move lengthwise, and doing so in the direction away from the corbel would cause a horizontal force to act on the surface of the corbel increasing the tensile stresses on the concrete. The defendant’s position is that the bearing pad was supposed to allow the beam to slide without friction. However, the defendant conceded that the bearing pad that was installed had a coefficient of friction of 0.6 and therefore the friction force caused by horizontal movement would be substantial. Indeed, the specifications for the bearing pad installed showed that the bearing pad was designed to allow lateral movement by deformation of the material. In the case of the bearing pad used, the maximum lateral movement was 7mm. However, the plaintiff’s case is that the maximum lateral movement from (a) and (b) would exceed this 7mm capacity of the bearing pad; indeed, thermal expansion alone is computed to be 13mm, with at least another several millimetres for shrinkage and creep. Apart from bearing pad failure, the defendant did not take into account horizontal forces on the surface of the corbel due to friction from horizontal movement of the beam. The defendant said he had specified that the bearing pad should allow for frictionless movement. However, he was unable to point out where he had specified this.
11     Taking into account all the evidence before me, I find that the Design was inadequate and under the design loads, the stresses that would be found in the crucial zones of the corbel and beams would exceed the allowable stresses for the concrete. I should state that this affirms the wisdom in the Code that requires that the concrete cover at the ends of corbels and beams should not be subjected to any loading. The FE Analysis showed that limiting tensile stresses have been reached in parts of the corbel. Most importantly, many cracks were manifested in the corbels and end beams at the site. Although these could have been caused by defective construction, there was no evidence of this. In the light of the shortcomings highlighted by the plaintiff’s expert, it is plain that these were caused by inadequacies in the Design and I so hold. As this is the sole issue between the parties, it would follow that the defendant is liable to the plaintiff in negligence in respect of the inadequacies in the Design. The defendant is therefore liable for the costs of rectification of all expansion joints in which he had failed to comply with the Code.
12     The plaintiff has prayed for an order for the defendant to indemnify the plaintiff “in respect of any claims made by any subsidiary proprietors against the plaintiff, caused by or arising from defects in the common property”. This prayer is too wide and to the extent that it extends to defects that are not caused by the defendant, there is no evidence that he is so liable. In relation to the liabilities of the defendant established in this suit, whether by consent or pursuant to my findings, it appears to me that the orders for damages are sufficient.
Orders
13     There will therefore be judgment for the plaintiffs in the following:
(a)     Damages to be assessed, in relation to costs of rectification of expansion joints and surrounding areas in which the Design had failed to comply with cl 5.2 of the Code.
(b)     By consent, the defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum of $49,000 being damages in relation to the lift motor rooms.
(c)     By consent, the defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum of $5,225 being damages in relation to the mezzanine floors.
14     There will also be an order against the defendant for costs of this action on a standard basis. The defendant is also to pay interest on damages ordered at the usual rates from date of writ and of judgment.",2011-05-03 00:00:00,SG High Court

1       The appellant was a 41-year old who was convicted on two charges under the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed). The first was a charge under s 170 for impersonating a police officer. The second was for using criminal force, an offence punishable under s 352 of the Penal Code. The offences in both charges were committed on 11 May 2007 in a hotel room in Geylang. The appellant first requested sexual services from a woman of Chinese nationality (“the complainant”). Under cross-examination the complainant admitted to being a prostitute. They went up to a room in Hotel 81 nearby and there the appellant showed the complainant a card and identified himself as a police officer. The complainant was not able to verify if the card was a genuine police identification card, which, in the event, it was not. The appellant then took out a piece of paper with English writing the content of which the complainant was not able to make out. He told the complainant that other girls had been arrested and he then bound the complainant’s hands with plastic cable bonds. The complainant became frightened. The appellant then told her that he would release her if she stayed with him till dawn. She agreed and they had sexual intercourse during that time. After that the appellant brought the complainant to a convenience store to buy a phone card. The complainant did not report the events to the police until the next day when she was arrested in a raid by the police anti-vice squad. In the course of this arrest the complainant realized that the appellant was a fraud and thus lodged a complainant leading to the two charges against him.
2       The appellant was convicted at trial and sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment on the first charge (impersonation) and one month on the second charge (criminal intimidation). The trial judge ordered the two sentences to run consecutively. The appellant appealed against both conviction and sentence. Mr Peter Ong, counsel for the appellant submitted that although the appeal against conviction was an appeal on facts, the evidence showed that the trial judge ought to have disbelieved the complainant. He submitted that the appellant had paid her $60 for the sexual intercourse but did not pay her for the additional service of staying over the night and that was her motive for reporting him to the police. This submission was also made before the trial judge.
3       In a case such as this where the principal evidence is largely based on the oral testimony of the witnesses, an appellate court will not overturn the findings of fact made by the trial judge unless there is obvious evidence on the record that the facts were wrong. For example, had the court found that the appellant produced a paper with English writing when the paper produced as an exhibit in court was in fact written in Chinese (this was not the case here and this example was used only as an illustration). In that event, the appeal court may overrule the finding of fact and then proceed to determine if that had a material bearing on the outcome of the trial. Findings of fact include inferences drawn from the facts found, and in the case where an appeal was based on an inference drawn from the facts, the appeal court will not overrule the inference unless it was an unreasonable inference. The term “unreasonable” will usually be used with great respect because trial judges, especially experienced ones, must be presumed to be competent to make reasonable inferences from the facts they have found.
4       The evidence in this case was largely based on the oral testimony of the complainant. There is no presumption that a prostitute’s evidence cannot be accepted without corroboration although the circumstances surrounding the offence may be relevant in determining whether the evidence ought to be accepted or whether the appellant ought to be given the benefit of the doubt. There was nothing before me to indicate that the facts found by the trial judge were wrong. The appeal against conviction was therefore dismissed.
5       Counsel then argued that the sentences were too harsh, especially in the case of the second charge where the maximum sentence was three months’ imprisonment or a fine up to $500 or both imprisonment and fine (the provision on sentence has since been amended but does not affect the appellant here). The maximum sentence for impersonating a police officer was two years’ imprisonment or fine, or both imprisonment and fine. In exercising his discretion, the trial judge took into account the previous convictions and record of the appellant. He found that the appellant had been convicted on 12 charges for various offences, including impersonation, in a period of 18 years in which the appellant had been imprisoned for some of them. In those circumstances, the sentences imposed, even if ordered to run consecutively, were not manifestly excessive. There being no other material or relevant reason to interfere with the sentences imposed, the appeal against sentence was also dismissed.",2011-01-11 00:00:00,SG High Court

1       This was an appeal by the same appellant in Magistrate’s Appeal No 310 of 2010 which was heard preceding/before this. This appeal concerned a different case from that in Magistrate’s Appeal No 310 of 2010. It was committed on 5 April 2010 whereas the offences in the Magistrate’s Appeal No 310 of 2010 were committed on 11 May 2007. In this case, the appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of theft of personal belongings of a woman. He had taken the handbag of the complainant in this case and drove off with it after a dispute with her. He took the valuables from the handbag including her cellphone and $200 cash. He then returned the handbag with the complainant’s work permit by leaving it at the KTV lounge where the complainant worked. The maximum punishment for the offence under appeal was three years imprisonment or fine or both. The trial judge sentenced the appellant to 30 months imprisonment.
2       The record of this appellant showed that between 1992 and February 2009 he had been convicted for various offences including cheating and theft. The appellant committed the present offence about two months after he was released from prison on a conviction for a cheating offence. The appellant pleaded for a lighter sentence on the ground that he wanted to “turn over a new leaf”, that is to say that he will reform. This is a plea that a trial court may take into consideration especially for a first time offender, or perhaps even a single repeat offender if the court thinks that the circumstances merit it. However, in a case such as this, the only matter to be taken lightly is the appellant’s promise of “turning over a new leaf”. Given the appellant’s record, the court below was entitled to be sceptical about such promises. The sentence imposed was not manifestly excessive and the appeal was therefore dismissed.",2011-01-11 00:00:00,SG High Court

1       The appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of possession of tenamfetamine, a Class A controlled drug. He was a 36-year old Korean who was entering Singapore from Kuala Lumpur on 13 September 2010. He was given the tablets by his friend in Kuala Lumpur and he kept them in his trouser pocket. When he was stopped by immigration officers he readily took out the tablets and admitted to possessing them.
2       His counsel, Mr S K Kumar, submitted that the appellant had forgotten about the tablets when he was entering Singapore and only recalled that they were with him when he was questioned at the immigration checkpoint. He was also a first offender. However, two other charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. The first concerned possession of two other Class A drugs, and the second concerned the possession of utensils for drug consumption. The maximum penalty for an offence under s 8(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), under which the appellant was charged, is imprisonment up to 10 years or fine up to $20,000 or both.
3       For first time offenders on a charge similar to the one before this court, a sentence of imprisonment may be as low as six months or less, and although the sentence here of 8 months’ imprisonment might have been a little on the high side given the circumstances, it was not one which could be said to be manifestly excessive.

29 October 2010
Judgment Reserved
 Choo Han Teck J:
1       The appellant is a taxi driver driving a Mercedes limousine taxi that he hires from Comfort Transportation Pte Ltd (“Comfort”). He was convicted of two charges. The first was for over-charging passengers, an act in contravention of r 23(n) of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Vocational Licences and Conduct of Drivers, Conductors and Passengers) Rules (the “Rules”), and was fined $600 under s 131(2) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276). The second charge was for not switching on the taximeter and keeping it in motion during a journey under hire. This was in contravention of r 23(e) of the Rules of which he was fined $400, also under s 131(2) of the Road Traffic Act.
2       The appellant claimed to be a member of a group of about 20 taxi drivers who called themselves MICE. It is not a registered association or business. The appellant claimed that MICE had a contract with the Grand Mercure Roxy Hotel (“the Hotel”) in which the MICE taxi drivers had a private arrangement to take the Hotel’s guests to the airport for fees agreed between the Hotel and MICE. A single-page “contract” was produced at the trial below by the appellant. It was dated 15 January 2008 and merely stated the rates payable for a trip to the airport at various times. The applicable rate in this case according to the appellant was $20.
3       On 5 September 2009, two officers (the “officer(s)”) from the enforcement unit of the Land Transport Authority boarded the appellant’s taxi at the Hotel. They were approached by the Hotel bell-hop who they told they needed a taxi to the airport. The bell-hop approached the appellant and signalled “2” and “0” to him. The appellant opened the boot of his taxi for the officers to load the luggage and after that he drove them to Terminal 3 at Changi Airport. The first officer testified that the appellant did not turn on the taximeter. At the end of the journey, the appellant informed the officers that the fare was $20. It was not disputed at trial that a metered fare from the Hotel to Terminal 3 at Changi Airport was about $9.50. It was also not disputed that a taxi driver with Comfort could only collect a flat fare of $40 to the airport if the job was booked through Comfort and assigned to the taxi driver by Comfort. In this regard, the argument by the appellant that he was actually undercharging with a $20 fare has no merits because the trip in question was not made through a Comfort booking. At all other times the appellant must charge the fare approved by Comfort and reflected by the taximeter reading.
4       Mr Tan Hee Joek, counsel for the appellant submitted that the officers were informed of the fare to be charged before they agreed to take the appellant’s taxi. Mr Tan submitted that the bell-hop had told the officers that the fare was $20. The officers denied this at trial when it was put to them under cross-examination. Counsel submitted that the trial judge made no finding of fact whether the officers knew about the $20 fare in advance. He submitted that in view of the evidence of Comfort’s representative, one Mr Joshua Soon Beng Huat (“Mr Joshua Soon”), that private agreements between taxi drivers and their passengers “were not illegal”, the judge’s failure to make this finding was crucial. There was no dispute that unless the appellant’s case was proved, the amount charged under the MICE-Hotel agreement would have contravened r 23(n) of the Rules which provides that a taxi driver “shall not obtain or attempt to obtain any fare which exceeds the fare set by (i) the owner of the taxi, where the owner is a company”. The evidence of the MICE-Hotel agreement was given by the appellant as well as the Chief Concierge of the Hotel, one Miss Doris Lim (“Miss Lim”). Miss Lim’s evidence as recounted by the trial judge was as follows:
When the guests come down at the last minute and they are at the taxi stand, whenever there is a limousine taxi on standby for their ‘booking guest’ with a last minute cancellation or no show, they would offer the taxi to the guest. If the guests agreed with the price, they would be put in the taxi to the airport and [the Hotel] would ask for [the guests’] room number and record it. If [the guests] did not agree with the price, they would wait for the next regular taxi to come into the hotel driveway.
This evidence must be considered with that of Mr Joshua Soon who clarified his evidence relating to private agreements. This was noted by the trial judge in her grounds of decision where she set out the vital qualification: in a case of a private arrangement between a driver and his passenger, the taximeter must also be switched on and the agreed fare has to be keyed into the taximeter.
5       The evidence of Mr Joshua Soon was consistent with the public policy that taxi fares are not a matter of private arrangement between the taxi driver and his passenger, or else the public system for taxi services would revert to the old days of the “pirate taxis”. His evidence was also consistent with r 23(n) of the Rules. Hence, the requirement that the private agreement must be recorded in the taximeter is validated by the owner of the taxi only if the agreed fare is recorded in the taximeter. This must be done regardless of whether the agreed fare was a discount or a premium from the usual metered rate. Otherwise, the procedure adopted by the appellant of not keying the agreed fare in the meter in the present case might lead to the very abuse that the Rules were meant to prevent, 
viz
 the overcharging of unsuspecting passengers. Even if the appellant was not involved in a deliberate ploy of overcharging his passengers in this way, his conduct, if vindicated, cannot be distinguished from a case in which the taxi driver sets out to overcharge or cheat his passengers. These rules were intended to distinguish the honest, hardworking taxi drivers from the errant ones. In this regard, the bell-hop could either be an independent witness or an accomplice. That was not a finding of fact that the trial judge needed to make in view of the evidence that any private agreement must be recorded — by the taxi driver in his taximeter. Once that had been done the role of the bell-hop would not be relevant to a charge under the circumstances. The appellant admitted that he did not switch on the taximeter for the trip in question. There was thus no question that he also had not keyed in the alleged agreed fare of $20 on the taximeter. I should add that the evidence of the meter was a crucial one because without that or without the express consent of Comfort, the private agreement envisaged and carried out by MICE as exemplified in this case, would result in charging a passenger more than the fare set by the owner of the taxi (in breach of r 23(n)).
6       For the reasons above the appeal is dismissed.",2010-10-29 00:00:00,SG High Court

) read with s 12 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed). He was found guilty and convicted of all five charges (see 
Public Prosecutor v Abdul Salam bin Musthafa
 
[2010] SGHC 81
). The Appellant was sentenced to a total of 30 years’ imprisonment with effect from 2 January 2008 and 24 strokes of the cane. The Appellant appealed against both his conviction and his sentence.
2       Of the five charges which the Appellant faced at his trial, two charges (“the Main Charges”) concerned offences alleged to have been committed on 31 December 2007, while the remaining three charges (“the Remaining Charges”) concerned offences alleged to have been committed on 27 December 2007. The Main Charges were that, on or about 31 December 2007, the Appellant engaged in a conspiracy with Khairul Anwar bin Zaini (“Khairul”), Jamaliah binti Yacab (“Jamaliah”), Maryati binte Sipon (“Maryati”) and one “Boy Cino” to traffic in two different types of controlled drugs, namely, not less than 14.99g of diamorphine and 0.42g of methamphetamine (the charges relating to these two quantities of drugs will be referred to hereafter as, respectively, “the First Charge” and “the Second Charge”). The Remaining Charges were that, on or about 27 December 2007, the Appellant engaged in a conspiracy with Khairul, Jamaliah and Boy Cino to traffic in three different types of controlled drugs, namely, 8.76g of methamphetamine, not less than 6.43g of diamorphine and 0.01g of morphine (the charges relating to these three quantities of drugs will be referred to hereafter as, respectively, “the Third Charge”, “the Fourth Charge” and “the Fifth Charge”).
3       The trial judge (“the Judge”) found the Appellant guilty of all five charges and convicted him on 21 January 2010. On 15 March 2010, the Appellant was sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane in respect of the First Charge, five years’ imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane in respect of the Second Charge, and, in respect of the Third Charge, the Fourth Charge and the Fifth Charge, five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane for each of those charges. The terms of imprisonment in relation to the First Charge and the Second Charge were to run consecutively, while the terms of imprisonment in relation to the Third Charge, the Fourth Charge and the Fifth Charge were to run concurrently with the term of imprisonment in respect of the First Charge. The Appellant was therefore sentenced to a total of 30 years’ imprisonment with effect from 2 January 2008 and 24 strokes of the cane.
4       Subsequent to the trial, the sentence of caning was remitted by the Judge on 28 September 2010. This was due to a letter from a medical officer of the Singapore Prison Service, dated 6 September 2010, stating that the Appellant was confirmed as being HIV (positive) and was therefore permanently unfit for caning.
5       The Appellant appealed against his conviction and his sentence for all five charges. After hearing submissions from the parties, we allowed the appeal against conviction in part, in so far as we found that the Remaining Charges, 
viz
, the charges relating to the offences alleged to have been committed on 27 December 2007 (
ie
, the Third Charge, the Fourth Charge and the Fifth Charge), were not proved beyond a reasonable doubt. We thus set aside the Appellant’s conviction in respect of those charges. With respect to the Main Charges (
ie
, the First Charge and the Second Charge), however, we agreed with the Judge that those charges were proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and dismissed the appeal against conviction in so far as those charges were concerned.
6       In respect of the appeal against sentence, we allowed the appeal in so far as we reduced the term of imprisonment for the Main Charges from a total of 30 years’ imprisonment to a total of 25 years’ imprisonment with effect from 2 January 2008.
7       We now give the detailed grounds for our decision. As we fully agree with the reasoning and the findings of the Judge with respect to the Main Charges, we shall address only the Remaining Charges.
The evidence against the Appellant
8       The Prosecution’s evidence against the Appellant in respect of the Remaining Charges consisted of:
(a)     Maryati’s testimony and plea in mitigation;
(b)     Khairul’s statement of 26 August 2008; and
(c)     the telephone call-cum-SMS records.
We shall address these in turn.
Maryati’s testimony and plea in mitigation
9       The relevant portions of Maryati’s testimony which appeared to implicate the Appellant with respect to the Remaining Charges are as follows. First, Maryati testified that she had previously delivered money for the Appellant prior to 31 December 2007, although (and this is a significant point which we shall return to below (at 
[11]
–
[12]
)) she was unable to recall exactly when she had done so:
[note: 1]
Q:
Right. All right, your earlier evidence was that 31st
 
December 2007 wasn’t the first time that you have sent money from Singapore to Malaysia for [the Appellant]. Right. So my question is, when was the first time? Can you remember?
A:
 
I cannot remember
.
Q:
All right.
A:
 
It’s been one year plus, I cannot remember
.
Q:
All right. 
Can you remember how many times?
A:
 
No
.
Q:
Right. Okay. And those occasions that you had previously delivered the money from Singapore to Malaysia, to whom did you pass the money to?
A:
Boy Cino.
[emphasis added]
The following testimony is also relevant:
[note: 2]
Q:
On 
those previous occasion
 [
sic
], when you brought the money from Singapore to Malaysia to pass to Boy Cino, was the money passed to you by [the Appellant]?
A:
Yes.
[emphasis added]
10     On cross-examination by counsel for the Appellant at the trial, Mr S S Dhillon, Maryati disagreed with counsel’s contention that, since the Appellant’s telephone line had not been in use in the week prior to 27 December 2007, the Appellant could not have been involved in the drug transaction of 27 December 2007. Maryati’s evidence on this point was as follows:
[note: 3]
Q:
Now, witness, I’m putting it to [you] that [the Appellant] was never involved in any drug dealings on 27th December because his phone call records prove that his phone was shut down from 20th December to 26th
 
December.
A:
I disagree because the shutdown of his handphone was on the 20th to 26th
 
December but the – the – the incident happened on the 27th December.
11     On re-examination by Deputy Public Prosecutor Mr Ng Cheng Thiam, Maryati was unable to confirm if she had gone to Johor Bahru on 27 December 2007 to send money as part of a drug transaction or to attend to personal matters:
[note: 4]
Q:
Next question, you have said that for the 27th
 
of December 2007, you would be telling a lie if you say that you did not agree that you were involved in the tran – in the drug transaction on that day. All right, and you had also admitted that you went to Johor Bahru on the 27th
 
of December 2007.
A:
Yes.
Q:
I see. The question is why did you go to Johor Bahru on the 27th of December 2007?
A:
To send monies.
Q:
What?
A:
 
But I cannot remember
.
Q:
What money?
A:
 
The monies – maybe – I did go to Malaysia on the 27th December but I’m not sure whether I went to Malaysia to send monies or to do my personal things. There are certain dates as appeared in my passport, I just went to Johor to do personal things. I can’t – I can’t recall exactly which dates but I did send monies about 7 to 8 times
.
Q:
For who?
A:
Accused [
ie
, the Appellant].
[emphasis added]
12     Although Maryati’s testimony (as reproduced above) alludes 
generally
 to some previous involvement by the Appellant in drug transactions, it is far from compelling with respect to the Appellant’s alleged involvement in the drug transaction 
of 27 December 2007
. Indeed, Maryati was unable to confirm 
specifically
 that the Appellant was involved in a drug transaction 
on 27 December 2007 itself
.
13     Maryati’s plea in mitigation is not much more helpful to the Prosecution’s case. The relevant extracts are as follows:
[note: 5]
8.    Sometime in or around the last quarter of 2007, [the Appellant] contacted [Maryati] and asked her whether she was keen to make some money by running a small errand for him into Malaysia. He explained to her that every now and then he would have to pay his business partner in Malaysia. This Malaysian partner was known to her as “Boy Cino”. She agreed and in the first few couriers she was paid about S$300 for each trip.
9.    Up until a couple of weeks before her arrest, she did not know that the money she couriered into Malaysia was connected with drugs. She had laboured under the false believe [
sic
] that it was money paid for a legitimate business. When she first discovered from “Boy Cino” that the money she had couriered was in connection with drugs, she confronted [the Appellant] about it and wanted to stop.
10.    [The Appellant] managed to convince and assure her that as long as she wasn’t the one carrying the drugs, she was not committing any offence. Foolishly she accepted the assurances and carried on the service for [the Appellant].
11.    [Maryati] knew it was wrong [of her] to have carried the money into Johor 
that fateful day
. She regrets her actions. She now realises how foolish she was in believing [the Appellant].
[emphasis added]
14     Notably, Maryati’s plea in mitigation refers to “that fateful day”,
[note: 6]
 which, presumably, means 31 December 2007 since Maryati could not say for sure that she brought money into Malaysia as part of a drug transaction on 27 December 2007. Maryati’s plea in mitigation therefore does not address the events that transpired on 27 December 2007; neither does it address the Appellant’s alleged involvement in the drug transaction of 27 December 2007.
15     Having regard to the evidence of Maryati as a whole, therefore, neither her testimony nor her plea in mitigation implicates the Appellant 
specifically
 with respect to the Remaining Charges. In particular, her testimony and her plea in mitigation do 
not
 implicate the Appellant 
specifically
 with respect to 
the drug transaction of 27 December 2007
, and thus do not assist the Prosecution’s case in so far as the Remaining Charges are concerned. Nevertheless, in our estimation, the portions of Maryati’s testimony extracted above (at 
[9]
 and 
[11]
) certainly do not undermine Maryati’s testimony with respect to the offences allegedly committed on 
31 December 2007
. In fact, had Maryati been intent on implicating the Appellant, rather than being uncertain about the events that transpired on 27 December 2007, it would have made more sense for her to have emphatically testified that the Appellant had been involved in the drug transaction of 27 December 2007. This, therefore, does not undermine the credibility of Maryati as a witness and her testimony with respect to the Main Charges.
Khairul’s statement of 26 August 2008 
16     The next piece of evidence in the Prosecution’s case against the Appellant with respect to the Remaining Charges was Khairul’s statement of 26 August 2008, which we shall hereafter refer to as “P142” for short. The material parts of P142 which appear to implicate the Appellant are as follows:
[note: 7]
82    I wish to explain that I had held back on telling the truth on [the Appellant] being the one giving me instructions to receive the controlled drugs and distributing the controlled drugs which [were] seized because I feel that telling the truth now is better than lying. I do not know whether [the Appellant] is the boss of the drug syndicate. 
However, [the Appellant] is the one that had been giving me instruction[s] pertaining to receiving the previous consignment of controlled drugs which was seized in my house on the day of my arrest too
, except for the subutex tablets which “Boy Nizam” delivered to me before my arrest. … [The Appellant] is the one who is paying me money for helping him to receive the controlled drugs consignment from Malaysia and distributing the re-packed drugs of heroin and ice in Singapore. [emphasis added]
The italicised portion of the above extract from P142 appears to refer to acts that are directly connected with the Remaining Charges, while the rest of the extract refers to the Appellant’s role in drug transactions generally.
17     However, the italicised portion of the aforesaid extract fails, in our view, to disclose sufficiently whether the “previous consignment”
[note: 8]
 refers to the drugs which were the subject matter of the drug transaction of 27 December 2007, or to drugs which were the subject matter of some other drug transaction. Khairul’s testimony was of little help to the Prosecution as, in court, Khairul sought to distance himself from P142 and alleged that he had made the statement due to coercion (notwithstanding this allegation by Khairul, the Appellant’s counsel subsequently consented to Khairul’s statements, P142 included, being admitted). Although (as we have seen) Maryati alluded in her testimony to the Appellant’s involvement in other drug transactions, P142 does not indicate if the Appellant was involved in the drug transaction of 27 December 2007 specifically, as opposed to some other previous drug transaction. P142 therefore does not add much – if any – weight to the Prosecution’s case against the Appellant 
vis-à-vis
 the Remaining Charges.
The telephone call-cum-SMS records
18     The last piece of evidence which the Prosecution relied on for its case against the Appellant with respect to the Remaining Charges consisted of the telephone call-cum-SMS records. The Prosecution argued that the flurry of communications between the Appellant and the conspirators on 27 December 2007 led one to the conclusion that the conspirators were making arrangements for the drug transaction which was to take place that day. This was so especially since the conspirators, who had all pleaded guilty to various drug trafficking offences, were also calling each other to make the necessary arrangements 
vis-à-vis
 their particular roles. This (so the argument ran) therefore meant that the Appellant must have been communicating with the conspirators on drug transactions (including the transaction which was alleged to have occurred on 27 December 2007).
19     However, in our view, the above corroborative evidence against the Appellant is precisely that: merely corroborative evidence. It is insufficient to establish the Prosecution’s case against the Appellant 
vis-à-vis
 the Remaining Charges beyond a reasonable doubt when the other evidence against the Appellant with respect to those charges is so weak.
Conclusion
20     Taking into account the totality of the evidence against the Appellant in respect of the Remaining Charges, we were of the view that the Prosecution’s case against the Appellant on these charges was not established beyond a reasonable doubt. Maryati was unable to confirm if the Appellant had been involved in a drug transaction on 27 December 2007. P142, while suggesting that the Appellant had been involved in the trafficking of a previous consignment of drugs, shed little light on whether that consignment was the one which was the subject matter of the drug transaction of 27 December 2007, or whether it was the subject matter of a drug transaction on some other date. The telephone call-cum-SMS records were insufficient (in and of themselves) to establish the Prosecution’s case beyond a reasonable doubt, and had to be considered together with the other evidence, which evidence (as we have seen) was in fact rather weak.
21     We therefore allowed the appeal against conviction in respect of the Remaining Charges.
22     Given that the only charges proved beyond a reasonable doubt against the Appellant were the Main Charges, we were of the view that the Appellant’s terms of imprisonment in respect of the First Charge and the Second Charge ought to run concurrently rather than consecutively. This would reflect the gravity of the offences proved against the Appellant, and, at the same time, take into account the fact that the Remaining Charges were not made out against him. This would also be an appropriate sentence for the Appellant, having regard to the relative sentences of his conspirators. We therefore ordered the total length of the Appellant’s imprisonment in respect of the Main Charges to be reduced from 30 years’ imprisonment to 25 years’ imprisonment with effect from 2 January 2008.

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing
20 September 2010
 Choo Han Teck J:
1       The appellant was a 32-year old Muslim convert who admitted to using a male toilet at the Bethesda Church Bukit Arang (the “Church”) on 20 May 2010. After being apprehended by the Church staff, he was told that if he wanted to visit the Church, he ought to first register for a “visitor pass”. However, on 27 May 2010 he went to the Church again and had a shower using the soap and shampoo there. The statement of facts merely stated that he was found to have used the soap and shampoo after he left “the cubicle”. He was not charged with theft. The senior pastor of the Church then apprehended the appellant and confiscated the Muslim Conversion card the appellant used to identify himself. The appellant was then escorted out of the Church premises. On 29 May 2010, the senior pastor lodged a complaint against the appellant. On 18 June 2010 the appellant lodged a police report claiming that he had lost his Muslim conversion card although he knew that it was not lost but was confiscated by the senior pastor.
2       Arising from the facts admitted, he was charged with two charges of committing house-trespass, punishable under s 448 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) and one charge of giving false information to a public servant, an offence punishable under s 182 of the Penal Code. He was sentenced to two weeks imprisonment for the s 182 charge and eight weeks imprisonment for each of the s 448 charges. The two s 448 sentences were ordered to run concurrently but consecutively to the sentence under the s 182 charge, making a total of ten weeks imprisonment. Another s 448 charge and one charge of loitering with intent to commit an offence under s 27(2) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997 Rev Ed) were taken into consideration.
3       The judge at first instance described the conduct of the appellant as an “egregious behaviour” that “far outweighed” the mitigation of pleading guilty. The judge also took into account a previous conviction of criminal trespass in 2009 where he was sentenced to two weeks imprisonment (one further charge of criminal trespass was taken into consideration). Nothing was stated in the grounds as to the facts concerning those previous convictions. On the record, the appellant was also convicted of theft in 2006, for which he was imprisoned for 101 days. While the judge acknowledged the latter conviction, that did not form part of his reasons in the sentencing for the current offences.
4       Previous convictions are relevant and courts are generally inclined to impose a higher sentence for subsequent convictions. The question is how much higher should the sentence be were the court to accept the relevance of the previous conviction? In cases of this nature, that is to say, petty theft and criminal trespass, the court should note that though they were related offences in that a person might have stolen after committing house trespass or alternatively, a person could have committed house trespass in order to commit theft, the two offences might also have been un-related. The present offences of house trespass did not appear, from the record, to have involved any intention to commit theft. For an offence of house trespass, the nature of the trespass and the property are relevant factors. How the trespass was effected, at what time and the duration of the trespass must also be taken into account; and so too, the motive and intention of the trespasser.
5       Where the trespass did not involve any threat or alarm to persons the sentence need not include imprisonment. In the present case, I was of the view that the nature and circumstances of the trespass would not have merited a custodial sentence had the appellant not had a previous conviction. The property in question was not a private home, and there was no evidence that the trespass had caused any mischief or trouble. In both instances, it seemed to me that the appellant was apprehended and admonished for using the Church’s male toilet. In these circumstances, there was nothing overtly sinister in his actions. There was also no indication of forcible entry. In the statement of facts, it was said that the appellant may have entered and left the Church premises through the back door at the second level of the Church. Furthermore, it was on record that he would have been permitted entry had he asked for a “visitor pass” which, I suppose, the church might not uncharitably refuse if the appellant merely needed a place to wash himself, which was what he did in this case. I was therefore of the view that the total sentence should be reduced from ten weeks imprisonment to six weeks so that the appellant who was already serving sentence could be released forthwith.",2010-09-20 00:00:00,SG High Court

 Philip Pillai J:
1       At around 10.20am on 12 December 2008, the defendant was driving the van GT 3199C along Bedok North Avenue 1. This is a 4-lane dual carriageway with 2 lanes running in each direction and separated by a road divider. The defendant was travelling on one side of this road, on the sidemost lane. The plaintiff, who was 13 years old at that time, was diagonally crossing the road from the other side. He was trying to reach the bus stop on the opposite side. There was light traffic on both sides. The defendant’s van collided with the plaintiff just before it reached the bus stop. The plaintiff sustained severe head injuries. The right windscreen of the defendant’s van was damaged, and there was a dent on its right side.
2       The defendant was subsequently charged and convicted of the offence of careless driving and fined $800 and disqualified from driving for four months. He filed a notice of appeal but did not proceed further with the appeal on this conviction and sentence.
3       In this action, the plaintiff’s litigation representative is his father. The plaintiff did not himself give any evidence in court as the plaintiff’s representative avers that the plaintiff could not remember any details of the accident because of his head injuries. According to the medical reports submitted, the plaintiff suffered traumatic brain injury as a result of the accident. His cognitive functions have been severely impaired, and he has mobility problems on his right side which may be permanent. He is also being considered for cranioplasty to repair the damage to his skull.
4       The plaintiff’s case is that the accident was caused either solely or substantially by the defendant’s negligence in failing to keep an adequate and proper lookout for pedestrians and driving at an excessive speed in the circumstances, resulting in him being unable to brake in time to avoid the collision with the plaintiff. The plaintiff relies on the road traffic police investigations which resulted in the charge and conviction of the defendant for careless driving and on the doctrine of 
res ipsa loquitor
 insofar as the facts of the case disclose the negligence of the defendant and consequent loss suffered by the plaintiff.
5       The defendant avers that the accident arose solely or substantially because of the negligence of the plaintiff and accordingly that any loss suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the accident should be borne solely or substantially by the plaintiff.
6       The defendant’s oral evidence in court is that he had seen the plaintiff commence diagonally crossing from the opposite side of the road in the direction of the bus stop. He had seen the defendant running across three lanes and the road divider before colliding with his van. He gave evidence that the plaintiff was running with a bag and wearing earphones. He also said that he was driving in third gear and at a speed of about 30 km/h. He noticed the plaintiff running from the opposite side of the road, but because this was abrupt, he had no time to brake or swerve his van to avoid the plaintiff or to sound his van’s horn.
7       The accident sketch plan drawn up by the Road Traffic Police Sketch Plan was produced in court and the investigating officer, Station Inspector Chew Sook Yeng, gave evidence on the same. Station Inspector Chew’s evidence was that she observed brake or skid marks of the van at the accident site and these were correctly recorded and marked in the accident sketch plan, which showed skid marks measuring 8.1 m and a distance of 2.8 m between the end of the skid marks and the final position of the defendant’s van. It was also her evidence that the road was a normal road and not a highway. She added that the damage to the side mirror and front body of the defendant’s van, which were captured in photographs produced before me, suggested that the impact of the collision was considerable.
8       The defendant’s counsel submits, relying on 
Bingham’s Motor Claims Cases
, (Butterworths, 8th Ed, 1980) at pp 112-113, that at a speed of 30 km/h the braking distance would be 6.1 m which is consistent with the skid marks. This, he submits, is consistent with the defendant’s evidence and is not a high speed. A higher speed of 48 km/h would have meant a braking distance of 13.7m with longer skid marks. In any case, the speed would be well within the road’s limit of 60 km/h. The stationary van veered to the left which indicates that the defendant took some evasive action to avoid colliding with the plaintiff. Next he draws attention to the damage to the side of the defendant’s van which, he submits indicates that the plaintiff collided into the side of the van. Thirdly he draws attention to the evidence that the collision caused no serious bodily injury or fracture to the plaintiff. He states that the injury was caused by the running speed of the plaintiff and not the van colliding with the plaintiff. He submits that the criminal conviction for careless driving does not preclude the defendant from denying liability and submits in the alternatively that the defendant should only bear 20% responsibility for the accident.
9       Since traffic conditions were light on all lanes and since the defendant had seen the plaintiff commencing and running diagonally across three lanes before colliding with him, it is curious why the defendant was not able to avoid the collision with the plaintiff if indeed he was not driving at an excessive speed and was paying care and attention. Having seen the plaintiff commence running diagonally across the street from the opposite side, in the direction of the bus stop, the defendant was aware of the plaintiff’s action, speed and purpose. In the light of all these circumstances, and the fact that a 13-year old was running across the street in the direction of the bus stop, I find that the collision could have been avoided had he taken due care and attention. The 8.1m skid marks indicate that the van was moving so fast that an application of brakes while the van was moving still caused it to skid some distance. The dent marks and damage to the windscreen suggest considerable force of the van against the plaintiff’s head and body. The incidence of side damage to the van as opposed to frontal damage to the van in my view does not, in these circumstances, diminish his responsibility. Had the defendant been paying due care and attention he would in my view, have been able to avoid the collision. Whilst the criminal conviction for careless driving does not 
per se
 preclude the defendant’s defence raised in these proceedings, it is not totally irrelevant or to be excluded.
10     In the light of all the evidence and relevant circumstances, I find the defendant to be negligent in failing to keep an adequate and proper lookout for the plaintiff, and in failing to drive his van with sufficient care. The accident was, I find, substantially caused by his negligence.
11     Taking into account that the plaintiff was rushing across the 4-lane road in the direction of the bus stop and wearing headphones at the time, I also find the plaintiff to have been distracted and thus contributed to the collision.
12     I would apportion 80% of the responsibility for the accident to the defendant, and 20% to the plaintiff. Damages are to be assessed by the registrar in accordance with this apportionment.
13     The plaintiff is entitled to his costs of the trial.",2010-07-23 00:00:00,SG High Court

Introduction
1       The accused was born on 30 May 1977. He was tried and convicted on the following capital charge under the Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”)(Cap 185):
That you, Mohamad Fadzly bin Din,
on 16
th
 day of July 2008, at about 6.00pm, at Block 34 Marsiling Drive #11-393, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, to wit, by having in your possession not less than 31.37 grams of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185.
Three other related non-capital charges under the MDA were stood down at the commencement of the trial. These were withdrawn at the conclusion of the trial and the accused was granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal on these stood down charges.
The prosecution’s case
2       On 16 July 2008, at about 6pm, W/ASP Tan Siew Fong (“W/ASP Tan”), SI Rosli bin Mustaffa (“SI Rosli”) and SSSG Henry Chong (“SSSG Henry”) of the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) visited Block 34 Marsiling Drive #11-393 (“the flat”) and arrested the accused on suspicion that he was trafficking in a controlled drug. The accused was handcuffed with his hands behind his body. When they entered the accused’s bedroom (one of three bedrooms in the flat), there was a white envelope containing nine packets of brownish granular substance on the sofa. When SI Rosli asked the accused whether he had any more drugs with him, the accused used his chin to gesticulate that there were and showed a bundle wrapped in transparent masking tape behind the sofa. When probed further, the accused said that there was another bundle behind the sofa. SI Rosli then moved the sofa away from the wall and saw a bundle wrapped with black tape on the floor behind the sofa. He informed W/ASP Tan and was instructed to stop the search in the bedroom.
3       At around 7.10pm, W/ASP Tan instructed SI Rosli to continue with the search of the bedroom in the presence of the accused. Besides the exhibits mentioned in 
[2]
 above, the CNB officers also found drugs in various places in the bedroom, improvised pipes, lighters, a digital weighing scale, empty plastic sachets and cash in $100, $50 and $10 notes totalling $12,125.
4       Subsequently, each of the two bundles mentioned in 
[2]
 above was found to contain 30 packets of granular/ powdery substance. The contents of these 60 packets, together with those in the nine packets on the sofa, three packets in one cigarette box, one packet in another cigarette box and one straw in the cupboard, were analysed by the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) and certified to contain not less than 31.37 grams of diamorphine, the subject of the charge.
5       At about 8.23pm, W/ASP Tan informed SI Rosli that she wanted to record an oral statement from the accused. As the admissibility of this statement was disputed by the accused on the ground of involuntariness, a trial within a trial was conducted. This oral statement was admitted after the trial within a trial. I shall deal with this later.
6       At about 9.40pm, officers from the Forensic Management Branch arrived to take photographs of the flat. Later in the evening, the accused was brought to the CNB headquarters where the exhibits seized were photographed and the drug exhibits weighed, both in his presence. His instant urine test showed a positive result for methamphetamine. The witness from HSA confirmed in court that the presence of methamphetamine in a sample of urine would not interfere with the detection of diamorphine if diamorphine was present in that sample.
The Trial within a Trial
7       The oral statement in dispute was recorded in the flat on 16 July 2008 between 8.23pm and 8.45pm. Three witnesses each testified for the prosecution and the defence.
8       The prosecution’s evidence was that the oral statement was recorded in the accused’s bedroom by W/ASP Tan, with only the accused and SI Rosli present. The bedroom door was shut during the recording of the statement. SI Rosli asked the accused what language he would like to speak in. The accused elected to speak in English. Thereafter, the conversation was only between W/ASP Tan and the accused. SI Rosli merely stood nearby to watch over the accused. The statement was recorded in question and answer format in W/ASP Tan’s pocket book. The accused answered each of the nine questions promptly. The questions and answers were then read back to him and he was invited to made additions or amendments to his answers. The accused wanted to add something and that was recorded by W/ASP Tan accordingly. The accused then signed each page of the pocket book entries. The accused looked normal to the two CNB officers who stated that they did not make any threat, inducement or promise before or during the recording.
9       Under cross-examination, W/ASP Tan said that a female Malay lady (the accused’s grandmother) opened the door of the flat for the CNB officers. She spoke to that lady in the living room while SI Rosli and SSSG Henry went into the accused’s bedroom. After a while, SI Rosli reported that there might be drugs in the accused’s bedroom. W/ASP Tan then went into that bedroom and saw some drugs there. She told SI Rosli to stop the search and then went out of the bedroom.
10     There was also a Thai lady in the flat. After checking her passport, her luggage and her handbag, which were in another bedroom, W/ASP Tan ascertained that she was not an immigration offender and had no incriminating substance on her. She could not remember whether the Thai lady was handcuffed by any of the CNB officers. She learnt that the Thai lady was a family friend. W/ASP Tan denied that an officer told her that the Thai lady was the accused’s girl friend. She also denied that the Thai lady was crying or that she told the accused that the Thai lady had brought in the drugs. The Thai lady appeared normal to her. W/ASP Tan further denied coercing the accused to admit that the drugs belonged to him by telling him that if he did not do so, the Thai lady would be brought back by the CNB officers for investigations.
11     The Thai lady was not arrested nor brought back to the CNB headquarters. W/ASP Tan had sought the concurrence of her superior officer for this after having ascertained her status.
12     SI Rosli testified that when the elderly Malay lady answered the knocking on the main door, the CNB officers identified themselves and told her that they were looking for the accused. She told them that he was in his bedroom. SI Rosli and SSSG Henry then went into the accused’s bedroom. SI Rosli only asked the accused about the location of the drugs. He did not ask him whom the drugs belonged to. SI Rosli did not see W/ASP Tan checking the Thai lady as he remained in the accused’s bedroom. Later, during the recording of the oral statement, W/ASP Tan and the accused sat on the sofa in that bedroom. Both were speaking normally. The accused was forthcoming in his answers. He spoke in English only.
13     SI Rosli denied having spoken to the Thai lady, telling the accused that she was the accused’s girl friend and that the drugs in the flat were brought in by her and that she would be brought back for investigations if he did not admit that the drugs were his. He could not remember if she was crying. He did not show her the drugs or question her about them.
14     The accused spoke in English and in Malay during his testimony in the trial within a trial. He said that he was in his bedroom that day surfing the internet and smoking “ice” when SI Rosli and SSSG Henry went in. They said that he was suspected of trafficking in drugs. He showed the CNB officers where the drugs were. They had to pull the sofa away from the wall to retrieve the two bundles of drugs.
15     SI Rosli told him in Malay to admit that the drugs belonged to him or they would take the Thai lady away. He asked the accused many questions about the drugs. While he was doing so, the Thai lady was brought into the bedroom by W/ASP Tan. SI Rosli asked him whether the Thai lady was his girl friend and whether she was the one who brought in the drugs. The accused replied that she was a family friend and had arrived on Sunday to attend a wedding. When W/ASP Tan asked the Thai lady what the bundles of drugs were, she merely shook her head and cried. She was handcuffed with her hands in front of her body. She was in the accused’s bedroom for about ten minutes. The CNB officers told the accused that if he did not want to admit, they would bring her away. This was said in front of the Thai lady and before the recording of the oral statement.
16     The accused testified that he then lied in the oral statement that the drugs were his as SI Rosli was quite persistent in telling him to admit to it. He had seen the Thai lady handcuffed and crying and therefore felt like he was forced to admit that the drugs were his.
17     In cross-examination, the accused said that he was not related to the Thai lady at all and was not close to her. He addressed her as Aunt Anna. She has two children and knew the accused’s father. She was staying in the flat while in Singapore. She did not understand English or Malay. She did not say anything while in the accused’s bedroom other than “No, no, no” in English when asked whether she knew anything about the drugs. She merely shook her head and cried. She was standing near the bedroom door which was ajar. The accused claimed that his mother was also in the flat at that time.
18     The accused agreed that only W/ASP Tan and SI Rosli were in the bedroom during the recording of the oral statement and that he was prompt in his answers to W/ASP Tan’s questions. While he accepted that no threat, inducement or promise was made by W/ASP Tan, he insisted that SI Rosli had repeated to him many times in Malay that they would take the Thai lady to CNB headquarters if he did not admit that the drugs were his. SI Rosli did not use a threatening voice while doing so. He was not sure whether SSSG Henry was around when SI Rosli said all this. He did not know what would happen to the Thai lady if she was taken away. However, he pitied her and did not want that to happen and so made the admission as the drugs were found in his bedroom. He agreed that he had given additional information to W/ASP Tan.
19     Fatimah binte Samat (“Fatimah”), aged 79, is the accused’s grandmother. She lived in the flat with the accused and his parents. The accused’s mother was ill and had just returned home in the evening of 16 July 2008. The accused’s father was out working. The Thai lady (“Anna”), who was like a daughter to her, was in Singapore to attend someone’s wedding.
20     When the CNB officers went to the flat that day, Fatimah was in the living room while the accused’s mother was in her own bedroom and Anna was in Fatimah’s bedroom. When Anna went out to the living room, W/ASP Tan asked for her passport. As it was kept by the accused’s father, Fatimah telephoned him to ask where he had kept it.
21     Fatimah saw W/ASP Tan pull Anna to the accused’s bedroom. Fatimah held on to one of Anna’s hands and told W/ASP Tan that Anna had nothing to do with the accused. W/ASP Tan held on to Anna’s other hand. Fatimah showed W/ASP Tan the gift brought by Anna for the wedding. Fatimah and W/ASP Tan were pulling Anna in different directions but not in an angry manner. Fatimah did not see Anna being handcuffed because Anna was brought inside the accused’s bedroom and the door was shut. Fatimah brought Anna’s passport to the bedroom door and the door was then opened slightly for her to hand over the passport. After that, Anna emerged from the room, crying and looking sad as she was handcuffed. Fatimah hugged and kissed Anna and cried, feeling sad and ashamed as Anna was a visitor. She did not speak to Anna about what went on in the accused’s bedroom as there was nothing to talk about. The accused’s father returned home at about that time. Anna’s luggage was searched. The handcuffs on Anna were removed subsequently.
22     Fatimah said that she loves the accused very, very much as he is her only grandson. She was naturally very sad that he was facing such a serious charge. She confirmed that the CNB officers did identify themselves and that they spoke politely. According to her, Anna could speak English although Fatimah spoke to her in Malay. Anna was not taken away by the CNB officers that day. She returned to Thailand two days later.
23     After Fatimah testified, the prosecution called SSSG Henry as a rebuttal witness. SSSG Henry said that he did not quite understand what SI Rosli asked the accused in Malay in the bedroom. SSSG Henry was helping to guard the accused but he was not involved in the recording of the oral statement by W/ASP Tan in any way. He only noticed the presence of Anna when W/ASP Tan brought Anna to another bedroom to ascertain her identity. He then assisted W/ASP Tan in escorting Anna. Anna took out her passport and handed it to W/ASP Tan. He confirmed that Anna was not handcuffed and that she was not crying. He did not see W/ASP Tan pulling Anna towards the accused’s bedroom. Anna was not brought inside that bedroom. At no time were the three CNB officers together in that bedroom with the accused and Anna with the door shut. He did not see SI Rosli speaking to Anna and none of them told the accused that Anna had brought in the drugs or that she would be brought away for investigations if the accused did not admit that the drugs were his.
24     In cross-examination, SSSG Henry said that he left the flat at about 9pm for about 40 minutes to assist in some arrest at the ground level of the block of flats. At the time of the recording of the oral statement, he was standing outside the flat.
25     The trial within a trial was held in abeyance at that stage and the trial proper resumed as defence counsel indicated that they were arranging for Anna to come to Singapore from Thailand to testify at the trial within a trial.
26     Anna was in Singapore a couple of days later and the trial within a trial resumed. Her full name is Thanittha Hadu. She is 46 years old. She testified in the Thai language. Anna said that she sold shirts in Hatyai in Songkhla Province. She could speak some English. She was not able to speak Malay but could understand some words.
27     Anna testified that she was in the bedroom directly opposite the accused’s when the CNB officers went to the flat that day. When she heard the word “police”, she went out to the living room to see what was happening. However, the CNB officers alleged that she had emerged from the accused’s bedroom. W/ASP Tan handcuffed her with her hands in front of her body. She was then brought inside the accused’s bedroom. Five persons were in that bedroom at that time – Anna, the accused and the three CNB officers. She stood at one corner while the officers searched the bedroom. She was told not to say anything and that if she spoke too much, she would be taken to a police station. She was kept inside that bedroom for five to six hours. She felt angry and sad and cried as she was handcuffed although she had not done anything wrong. When she was brought out of the bedroom, she was still in handcuffs. She was released only after a high-ranking male Malay officer arrived at the flat. Her belongings were searched by W/ASP Tan who took away a nose ornament.
28     In cross-examination, Anna said that she met the accused’s father in Thailand some six or seven years ago. She was familiar with his mother, his wife and her relatives. She would visit the accused’s family every year during the Hari Raya festivities and sometimes to attend weddings. Whenever she was in Singapore, she would stay in the flat. She communicated with the family in English and with Fatimah in Malay but hardly spoke to the accused.
29     Anna alleged that the CNB officers spoke in an impolite tone of voice. W/ASP Tan refused to listen to her and told her to keep quiet or she would be brought to a police station. Fatimah was in the living room and was not involved much as she could not speak English. W/ASP Tan and SSSG Henry asked the accused in English where he hid the drugs. They searched the bedroom. The accused went to get the drugs and showed them to the officers. She was not paying attention and therefore did not know where the drugs were found. The bedroom door was kept open. She could see that Fatimah was sitting in the living room. While Anna stood at one corner during the search, the accused was standing in the centre of the bedroom. The CNB officers were also standing and searching the bedroom. The accused did not speak to Anna during the five to six hours.
30     Anna testified further that she told W/ASP Tan that her passport was kept by the accused’s father. The accused’s father telephoned home and told the officers that he was returning home. He returned home to the flat subsequently and showed Anna’s passport to W/ASP Tan. He also spoke later to the high-ranking male Malay officer about why Anna had been handcuffed.
The decision of the court in the trial within a trial
31     The burden is on the prosecution to prove that statements recorded from an accused person were made by him voluntarily, free from any inducement, threat or promise.
32     The evidence from the accused and his witnesses was inconsistent on many fronts. Among the more glaring contradictions was the length of time that Anna was kept inside the accused’s bedroom. While the accused said she was there for about ten minutes, her estimate was vastly different. Fatimah and Anna also contradicted each other’s evidence on whether the room door was shut or kept ajar while Anna was inside the accused’s bedroom. Anna did not say anything about being in the centre of a tug-of-war of sorts between Fatimah and W/ASP Tan and neither did she say that SI Rosli asked her questions about the drugs while she was in the accused’s bedroom.
33     The accused had already volunteered information to SI Rosli about the location of the two bundles of drugs behind the sofa and did not allege at any time that they did not belong to him. It was therefore unnecessary for SI Rosli to goad him into admitting that the drugs belonged to him. If indeed Anna was the one who brought the drugs to Singapore or was suspected of having done so, why should the CNB officers be so keen to pin the blame on the accused and so willing to exonerate Anna? They could have just as well arrested both of them.
34     The accused was not close to Anna although Fatimah and perhaps his parents were. It was obvious from his testimony about her that he did not know very much about her. Anna also said that she hardly spoke to the accused and they merely exchanged greetings. It was thus quite unbelievable that the accused would sacrifice himself for the sake of merely saving Anna from being brought back to CNB headquarters for investigations and perhaps being detained for a few days. It was not even a case of the CNB officers threatening to make Anna the scapegoat for the drugs. Further, it was uncontroverted evidence that the accused even volunteered more information to W/ASP Tan after she had finished questioning him.
35     I was therefore of the view that the oral statement in question, if it amounted to a confession admitting to ownership of the drugs found in the flat, was not one that had to be disregarded under s 24 of the Evidence Act as the facts showed clearly that no inducement, threat or promise was made to him by any of the three CNB officers. I therefore ruled that the oral statement had been given voluntarily and was admissible.
The trial proper resumes
36     In the said oral statement recorded by W/ASP Tan, the accused admitted that the contents of the white envelope found on the sofa and of the two bundles behind the sofa were heroin and that they belonged to him. When asked what he intended to do with the said heroin, his reply was “To sell, for paying for my mother’s medical bills.” He also stated that he charged “$2100 - $2200 for one set” and explained that he obtained the heroin from one Roy who would telephone him. Roy had the accused’s telephone number but the accused did not have Roy’s. After the nine questions and answers had been recorded, the accused was invited to make amendments or additions to his statement. He added that:
This Roy will call and ask when to send the ‘thing’ and I will tell him when. Someone else will send the ‘thing’. That is all. And I only deal with him twice.
37     Inspector Lim Wee Beng (“INSP Lim”) recorded several statements from the accused. The prosecution tendered 3 statements recorded respectively on 18 July 2008 at 3.27pm, 19 July 2008 at 11.14am and 20 July 2008 at 10.51am. The accused did not challenge the admissibility of any of these three statements and elected not to cross-examine INSP Lim on his evidence.
38     In the statements, the accused said that when the CNB officers asked him inside his bedroom if he had anything to declare, he said “yes” and pointed to the sofa. After the officers found the white envelope with the nine packets of heroin, they asked him whether he had anything else to declare. He then retrieved one bundle of heroin from behind the sofa and told them that there was another bundle there. The accused explained that he had obtained the heroin from Roy whom he got to know in 2004. Roy had asked him whether he wished to have additional income by keeping some heroin for him. All the accused had to do was to keep the heroin and deliver it to Roy’s buyers whenever Roy called to inform him. The accused wanted a bit of time to think about the proposal as he knew that keeping heroin was illegal. He gave his telephone number to Roy.
39     Shortly after that, the accused, a driver, was retrenched by his employers. When Roy called him, he told Roy that he would help him until he found a new job. He accepted the task as he needed money for his family’s household expenses and for some vocational courses that he wanted to take. Roy then told him that someone would deliver 60 packets of heroin to him and he would have to separate them into packs of five or ten.
40     A few days later, a man went to the ground floor of the accused’s block of flats. Roy told the accused to meet that man there. That man handed the accused a plastic bag containing a tissue box with some tissue paper sticking out of it. When the accused brought the tissue box home, he opened it and found two bundles inside wrapped in transparent tape. Each bundle had 30 packets of heroin. The accused then separated them into packs of ten each and placed each pack into one envelope. He had only ten envelopes. He then threw the tissue box away.
41     Later that day, Roy called the accused and informed him that he would pay him $1,200 for each bundle. Roy told him to be on standby to deliver 30 packets of heroin. About an hour later, Roy called again and told the accused to go to the ground level. The accused then took three envelopes (of ten packets each) and went to meet the contact. Roy told him there was no need to collect any money.
42     The next day, Roy called the accused and told him to separate the remaining heroin into 15 packets each and to pass them to a male Malay on the ground level. The accused did as he was instructed. Again, there was no collection of money involved.
43     As the accused had no more stocks of heroin, three more bundles of the drug were delivered to him a few days later in the same way. He asked Roy about the money promised to him and was told that he would get his money after helping with these three bundles. The accused repacked one bundle and left the other two behind the sofa in his bedroom. One pack of ten packets was sold to one Casper for $2,700. Another pack of ten packets was sold by the accused that night for an unknown amount.
44     The next day, the accused discovered that one packet of heroin was broken. He placed the heroin inside a cigarette box, scooped up the spillage and put it in a green straw. He could not recall where the other three packets found inside a cigarette box on the sofa came from. The accused also stated that he had a weighing scale in his bedroom. That was used to weigh the heroin which weighed about 7.9 to 8 grammes per packet.
45     Roy has not paid the accused any part of the $6,000 (i.e. $1,200 x 5 bundles) promised. The accused admitted that he consumed “Ice” (methamphetamine) just before his arrest. That was the only drug that he used to consume.
The case for the accused
46     No submissions were made by the defence at the conclusion of the prosecution’s case. As there was obviously a case for the accused to answer, he was asked to enter upon his defence to the charge. This was done on a Friday afternoon. The accused wanted to consult his defence counsel before deciding whether to testify or not and was permitted to do so. After conferring with the accused, defence counsel applied for time for the accused to decide on his course of action. The trial was then adjourned to the following Monday morning.
47     The following Monday, I was informed that the accused chose not to testify and would call no witness in his defence. However, the accused instructed his defence counsel to place a psychiatrist’s report dated 17 August 2009 from Tommy Tan Psychiatric Clinic before the court. However, he did not wish to call Dr Tommy Tan as a witness. He also instructed his counsel not to make any closing submissions.
48     In the said psychiatric report, Dr Tommy Tan reported that the accused had dependence syndrome on crystal methamphetamine, characterised by the need to take the substance every day. This syndrome was secondary to a prolonged depressive reaction to his mother’s illness (cancer). The accused was not of unsound mind and knew what he was doing. He was aware that possession of heroin could be a capital offence but thought the amount of heroin had to be many kilograms in weight before it became a capital offence. When he lost his job, he became desperate for money. He admitted that he was very stupid for agreeing to help Roy. The “Ice” caused him to think that he was invincible. Grandiosity is a known effect of “Ice”. The accused was remorseful for what he had done.
49     After the prosecution had made its closing submissions, the accused told the court that he was most remorseful for what he had done and for having caused so much hardship to his relatives. He admitted that he committed the offence and asked that he be given a second chance.
The decision of the court
50     The prosecution has proved that the accused was in possession of more than 2 grams of diamorphine. Under s 17(c) of the MDA, the accused is presumed to have had the drug in possession for the purpose of trafficking unless it is proved otherwise. As the accused has adduced no evidence relating to this, the presumption stands.
51     In any event, the disputed oral statement admitted after the trial within a trial showed that the heroin found in bedroom belonged to the accused and that it was meant to be sold. The three undisputed long statements proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had sold heroin before and that the heroin seized from his bedroom was also meant for sale to others. Selling is one of the meanings included in the definition of “traffic” (s 2 MDA).
52     While the psychiatric report explained why the accused resorted to selling heroin, it provided no defence at all to the charge. As explained to the accused, while I noted the points raised in that report and his expression of remorse in court, the sentence provided by law is a mandatory one and there is therefore no scope for mitigation of sentence.
53     I therefore convicted the accused as charged and passed the mandatory death sentence on him.",2010-04-20 00:00:00,SG High Court

 Choo Han Teck J:
1       The accused was 39 years old. He owned a company called “JMS Call Centre Pte Ltd” which carried on the business of telemarketing from its office at Jalan Besar. He claimed trial to five charges of drug trafficking. The charges concerned offences occurring on two days, namely, 27 December 2007 and 31 December 2007. The first charge (C1) was in respect of 14.99g of diamorphine; the second (C2), 0.42g of methamphetamine; the third (C3), 8.76g of methamphetamine; the fourth (C4), 6.43g of diamorphine; and the fifth (C5), 0.01g of morphine. The cluster of charges concerning the offences alleged to have been committed on 31 December 2007 (“first cluster”) were the main ones although the other cluster of three charges were in respect of offences alleged to have been committed four days previously (“second cluster”). Both clusters concerned the accused in conspiracy with others. In the case of the first cluster, with Maryati Binte Sipon (“Maryati”) Khairul Anwar Bin Zaini (“Khairul”), Jamaliah binti Yacab (“Jamaliah”), and a male person known only as “Boy Cino”; and in the case of the second cluster, with Khairul, Jamaliah and Boy Cino only. Maryati, Khairul, and Jamaliah had pleaded guilty for their roles in the transactions in question and are serving varying sentences of imprisonment each. I begin with the first cluster.
2       Maryati testified for the prosecution. She said that on the morning of 31 December 2007 she brought along her seven-year old daughter Nur Fitri along to meet the accused. She was given S$30,500 by the accused and she went to Johor Bahru, Malaysia where she changed the money into M$69,692.50. She then handed that money over to Boy Cino. Jamaliah also testified on behalf of the prosecution and she said that about 1pm or 2pm Boy Cino called her and arranged for her to collect a plastic bag in which was a detergent box where the drugs in question were concealed. She was instructed to bring the drugs across to Singapore and hand them to Khairul. At 5.25pm she crossed over to Singapore and headed to Khairul’s flat at Block 19, Telok Blangah Crescent. She met Khairul at the 10th floor lift landing and handed the plastic bag with the drugs to him. He gave her $50 as transport money back to Malaysia. Both of them were arrested moments after they had completed the transaction. There was no dispute that the drugs seized from Khairul here were the drugs in respect of the first cluster of charges. Khairul’s flat was searched and more drugs were seized. These were the remnants of the drugs delivered to him by Jamaliah in conspiracy with the accused in respect of the second cluster of charges.
3       Maryati maintained her evidence that she was given the money by the accused to hand to Boy Cino. She also maintained that Boy Cino telephoned the accused to confirm that he had received the money. Shortly after that the accused telephoned Maryati to say she could leave. The evidence from the prosecution’s narrative showed that after Maryati left, Boy Cino contacted Jamaliah to deliver the drugs to Khairul. Maryati and Jamaliah maintained their evidence even under cross-examination. Khairaul, on the other hand, retracted his earlier statement recorded on 26 August 2008 (P142) stating that the accused was the one who instructed him in the delivery of the drugs concerned in the five charges against the accused. In court, he testified under cross-examination that he gave the statement eight months after his arrest because he was coerced into doing it. He gave no convincing details as to how he was coerced apart from the fact that he was facing the death sentence. I was not persuaded by his testimony under cross-examination. I accept his statement of 26 August (P142) as corroborative of the overall evidence against the accused. The main evidence against the accused was the testimony of Maryati which I found to be reliable. If Maryati was telling the truth, the accused must be lying. Hence, Mr Dhillon, counsel for the accused, subjected her to a strenuous cross-examination, but I do not think that either her credibility or her story was discredited. I was satisfied that Maryati’s evidence was reliable.
4       The accused was arrested in his office at Jalan Besar at 6.30pm on 31 December 2007. Nothing incriminating was found on him or in his office. The evidence against him came mainly from the testimonies of Maryati and Khairul, and, indirectly, Jamaliah, whose evidence completed the prosecution’s narrative. The accused elected to testify in his defence when his defence was called. He had no witness other than himself. Mr Dhillon submitted that the telephone call made from telephone number 962XXXXX (from a phone registered in the name of the accused) to Maryati on 30 December at 11.44pm did not belong to the accused. First, he submitted that Khairul agreed that the accused had only one cell-phone and that was 919XXXXX. Secondly, there were calls made from 962XXXXX from Malaysia between 20 and 25 December 2007, and that proved that they were not by the accused because he did not have a passport and did not travel to Malaysia. That may remain a mystery but it would not absolve the accused and neither is it sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether Maryati’s evidence was unreliable. I am of the opinion that the evidence that the accused used only 919XXXXX was unreliable. On the other hand, even so far as telephone number 919XXXXX was concerned, on 26 December 2007, there were 35 communications with the other accomplices. The number, frequency and timing of the communications indicated that a co-ordinated activity was in progress, contrary to the evidence of the accused that he was only making small talk. I was unable to accept the explanation that the accused had given his cell phone 962XXXXX to a man known only as “Bob”. I also did not accept the explanation as to why Bob could not be located to testify on behalf of the accused. I also noted that the various cell phones were, on the accused person’s own evidence, liberally borrowed by the persons in the accused’s circle of friends.
5       There was another piece of prosecution evidence that the accused disputed. The prosecution adduced a message from the short message system which the accused sent to Boy Cino. It stated in Malay, “Boy kuda dah jalan?” The interpreter’s evidence was that it meant “Boy has the horse moved?” Maryati and Khairul understood the message as a message addressed to Boy Cino, asking him (Boy Cino) whether the courier had moved (left or started off). The accused insisted that the words “Boy kuda” was a nickname for another friend called “Rashid”. The circumstances did not seem to justify this and no other evidence was led to persuade me that a Rashid who was also known as “Boy kuda"" existed. I was not inclined to accept the accused person’s explanation. Defence counsel submitted that the call records should not be taken into account if other evidence contradicts them. I was of the view that the call records are part of the evidence upon which I evaluate the veracity of the witnesses. A witness is believed or disbelieved not only by what he says or how he says it, but also by how his story compares with other evidence.
6       For the reasons above, I was of the view that the prosecution had proved its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. I therefore found the accused guilty and convicted him on all the five charges. In mitigation, the accused said that he had no trouble with the law since 2000 although his convictions were recorded only in 2004, for which he was sentenced to a total of 36 months’ imprisonment, in connection with the consumption of morphine and breaches of supervision orders. He also stated that because of his terminal illness, a long prison sentence will effectively be a “death sentence” for him. He has a 17-year old daughter and two sons aged 11 and 15 respectively.
7       The learned DPP, Mr Ng Cheng Thiam, drew my attention to the sentences meted out to the co-accused persons. After taking into account the mitigation, I was of the view that in sentencing this accused the sentences of his co-accused, who had all pleaded guilty, should be taken into account also. I, therefore, sentenced this accused to a total of 30 years imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. The sentence of imprisonment was to take effect from 2 January 2008.",2010-03-15 00:00:00,SG High Court

2       The prosecution proceeded with the second, third, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth charges. AGG pleaded guilty to all the charges and I accepted his plea of guilt and convicted him on the charges. AGG agreed to the first, fourth and fifth charges to be taken into consideration for sentencing.
3       The facts leading to the commission of the offences, the arrest and other relevant information were contained in the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) which AGG agreed to. Paragraphs 3 to 30 of that SOF read as follows:
 
B.    FIRST INFORMATION REPORT
 
3.    On 30 April 2009, at about 3.50pm, the victim lodged a police report at the Criminal Investigation Department, in which she stated that between the year 2000 and mid-2007, she had been molested by her brother on several occasions. The victim also stated that the accused had begun to rape her, at their residence, from sometime in either 2005 or 2006.
4    The accused was thereafter arrested on 2 June 2009, at about 4.50pm, at the Serious Sexual Crimes Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department.
 
C.    FACTS RELATING TO THE 6
th
 CHARGE (OUTRAGE OF MODESTY)
 
5.    The victim’s immediate family consists of her parents and two older brothers. The accused is the eldest son of the family.
6.    …
7.    …
8.    …
9.    At [address redacted], the victim’s father occupied the master bedroom, while the victim’s mother slept on the living room sofa. This was due to the fact that the victim’s parents were estranged and on poor terms. The accused and the victim shared the other bedroom in the flat: the accused slept on the only bed in the room, while the victim slept on a pull-out mattress placed on the floor adjacent to the accused’s bed.
10.    On a night sometime in the year 2005 or 2006, both the accused and the victim were in their shared bedroom at [address redacted]. The accused was lying on his bed and the victim was lying on her mattress. The accused then came over to where the victim lay on her mattress. Assuming that the victim was asleep, the accused then inserted his hand into the victim’s panties, and used his hand to rub on the victim’s vulva and clitoris. The accused admitted that he felt aroused and excited whilst touching the victim in this manner.
11.    Unbeknownst to the accused, the victim was awake and aware of that the accused was touching her. However, out of fear and embarrassment, the victim refrained from stirring, in order not to alert the accused to the fact that she was awake.
12.    In addition to stroking her vulva with his hand, the accused also began to touch the victim’s bare breasts by sliding his hands under her top. The accused also caressed and sucked on the victim’s nipples. The accused then inserted his finger into the victim’s vagina whilst she lay on her mattress in their shared bedroom at night.
13.    The above acts were carried out, at night, whilst all of the lights in the bedroom were switched off. When the accused committed the acts of molest against the victim, he had assumed that the victim had remained asleep throughout the entire episode.
14.    …
 
D.    FACTS RELATING TO THE 2
nd
 AND 3
rd
 CHARGES (RAPE)
 
15.    On a night sometime in the year 2007, the accused and the victim were again in their shared bedroom at [address redacted]. At around midnight, the accused went to where the victim lay on her mattress, in the darkness, and proceeded to remove all of the victim’s clothing. As the victim did not appear to move, the accused assumed that the victim was asleep. The accused then turned the victim so that she lay facing up, spread her legs apart, and kneeled in between her thighs. He then began to rub, grope, lick and suck on the victim’s breasts and nipples. The accused also inserted a finger into the victim’s vagina and began to move it in and out of the vagina.
16.    When the victim did not stir, the accused then undressed completely and guided his erect penis into the victim’s vagina with his right hand. He began moving his hips and thrusting his penis repeatedly in and out of the victim’s vagina, supporting his weight by resting his palms at the side of the victim’s body. The accused did not use a condom or any other contraceptive devices.
17.    …
18.    The accused raped the victim again on a second occasion sometime in the year 2007. …
19.    Although the victim was awake and aware of what the accused was doing on the second occasion as well, she once again remained still due to her fear of the accused, as well as due to the fact that she felt embarrassed by the sexual abuse perpetrated by the accused on her. The victim did not at any time consent to having sexual intercourse with the accused.
20.    The accused admitted that he enjoyed having sexual intercourse with the victim, even though he was aware that she had not consented to the said sexual intercourse, and that it was wrong for him to have forced himself on her in such a manner. Prior to each act of sexual abuse committed on the victim, the accused had viewed pornographic material via the Internet, and felt the urge to touch a female. He would thereafter ensure (so he thought) that the victim was asleep, before starting to molest and rape her. The accused therefore continued to have sexual intercourse with the victim as he could not resist his sexual urges.
21.    …
 
E.    SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
 
i.     
Confrontation and violence between the accused and the victim
 
22.    Sometime in 2007, at [address redacted], the victim confronted the accused and threatened to tell their parents that he had been having sexual intercourse with her without her consent. Their parents were not at home at the time. The accused was shocked that the victim was aware of the sexual abuse he had committed on her, and surmised that she had not been asleep after all when he committed the acts of molest and rape on her.
23.    The accused immediately began punching the victim on her face and body several times, in response to her threat to inform their parents. The victim quickly ran out of the flat and ran to a neighbouring flat for assistance, where she called both the police and their parents. When their parents and the police returned to the flat, the accused admitted that he had assaulted the victim, but did not mention that he had done so after having been confronted by the victim. The police subsequently advised the victim’s parents to apply for a Personal Protection Order (‘PPO’) on behalf of the victim. However, the victim’s parents eventually decided against applying for the said PPO.
 
ii
.     
Discovery of the offences
 
24.    At the end of 2007, the victim ran away from her home at [address redacted] as she could not endure the incidents of molest and rape committed by the accused against her any further. She did not tell her parents that the accused was raping her as she felt that her parents were unsympathetic to her, and would either not believe her or not do anything (a feeling partly engendered by their decision not to apply for a PPO on her behalf against the accused). The victim therefore went to stay with her then-boyfriend at his residence.
25.    The victim continued to reside with her then-boyfriend until April 2009, when she finally informed her secondary school principal about the incidents of molest and rape committed by the accused on her. The principal and school counsellor duly informed the police about the matter, after which the victim formally lodged a police report against the accused on 30 April 2009.
 
F.    MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF THE VICTIM
 
26.    The victim was examined on 5 May 2009 by Dr. [D], an Associate Consultant at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at [hospital 1]. In a medical report dated 20 May 2009, Dr. [D] stated that:
a.    Clinical examination of the victim’s breast and abdomen were normal;
b.    Pelvic examination revealed multiple old hymenal tears;
c.    The victim’s urine pregnancy test was negative; and
d.    Screening for common STD’s were negative.
 
G.    MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF THE ACCUSED
 
27.    The accused was examined on 14 July 2009 by Dr. [E], a Consultant at the Department of Urology at [hospital 2]. In a medical report dated 14 August 2009, Dr. [E] stated that the accused did not have erectile dysfunction.
 
H.    FACTS RELATING TO THE TRAFFIC CHARGES (7th – 9th CHARGES)
 
28.    The complainant is Senior Staff Sergeant Kheong Yew Ming, attached to the Tanglin Police Division of the Singapore Police Force.
29.    In the early morning of 30 January 2009, the complainant was performing road-block duties along Farrer Road. At about 3.33 am, the accused, who was riding a motorcycle bearing registration number [XXX] along Farrer Road, was stopped by the complainant at the said road-block. Upon conducting a check, the complainant discovered that the accused did not possess a valid Class 2B driving licence in respect of the motorcycle.
30.    Investigations revealed that the said motorcycle bearing registration number [XXX] was registered to one [C], the accused’s father. On 30 January 2009, the accused had taken the ignition keys of the said motorcycle without the consent or permission of his father. The accused thereafter took the motorcycle from their residence [address redacted] and rode the said motorcycle, until he was stopped by the complainant at the road-block along Farrer Road.
4       AGG pleaded for a lighter sentence. He said that he was extremely remorseful. He was a hooligan a few years ago but had changed. He wanted to finish his national service. He was concerned about his mother and grandmother who were seriously ill.
5       AGG had previous convictions in 2002 in respect of uncensored or obscene films, voluntarily causing hurt and theft for which he was asked to reside in a juvenile home. I did not enhance his sentence because of these prior offences as they were different in nature from the offences of outrage of modesty and rape. However, they demonstrated that he had had a brush with the law before. Instead of changing his ways, he had gravitated to the more serious offences of outrage of modesty and rape.
6       There is only one other case of rape by a sibling of a young age. This was 
PP v S
 
[2003] SGHC 70
 (“
PP v S
”) in which I had convicted the accused on his plea of guilt in respect of rape under s 376(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed). I said at [22]:
I took into account the fact that the accused was in a position of responsibility and trust vis-à-vis the victims but he was not their parent and he was of a young age. I also took into account the fact that he had sexually abused not one but three of his siblings in various ways on various occasions over a number of years.
7       In that case, I sentenced the accused to ten years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for each of the two charges under s 376(2) of the Penal Code with the sentences for each of these two charges to run consecutively making a total of 20 years of imprisonment.
8       However, in 
PP v S
, there were three victims and the charge was under the more serious s 376(2) rather than s 376(1) of the Penal Code.
9       On the other hand, AGG, while professing to be remorseful, had escalated his sexual offences from outrage of modesty to rape and had assaulted B when she confronted him instead of feeling shame and remorse.
10     In the circumstances and being mindful of his young age, I sentenced AGG to 12 years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane on each of the charges under s 376(1) and one year’s imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for the charge under s 354 of the Penal Code. While the sentence of ten years’ imprisonment on each of the s 376(2) charges in 
PP v S
 might appear lower than that of 12 years’ imprisonment for each of the s 376(1) charges in the present case before me, it must be remembered that in 
PP v S
, I had ordered the two stiffest sentences to run consecutively making a total of 20 years whereas I was not minded to do that for the present case. Accordingly, the total imprisonment for AGG was in fact 13 years’ imprisonment, 
ie
, the sentence of one year for the sixth charge (under s 354) was to run consecutively with the sentence of 12 years for the second charge (under s 376(1)) which was in turn to commence from 4 June 2009, the date of remand. On the totality principle, I was of the view that the conduct of the accused person in 
PP v S
 was more heinous than that of AGG. This explains why the total imprisonment for AGG was less than that in 
PP v S
.
11     As for each of the seventh to ninth charges, I sentenced AGG to a fine of $600 and in default, six days’ imprisonment. I added the mandatory disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence under the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) for 12 months from the date of conviction, 
ie
, 19 February 2010 for the ninth charge.
12     AGG has filed an appeal against the sentence.",2010-03-19 00:00:00,SG High Court

Introduction
1       The accused, born on 10 April 1972, faced seven charges. The first charge concerned housebreaking by night by entering a house at 44 Holland Green (“the house”) through a window in order to commit rape, an offence punishable under s 457 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). The second charge alleged that he used criminal force on a female, (“V”), intending to outrage her modesty, by kissing her breasts and sucking her nipples, and that in order to commit this offence, he voluntarily caused fear of instant death to V by threatening to kill her if she made any noise, an offence punishable under s 354A(1) of the Penal Code. Four charges alleged that he raped V by penetrating her vagina with his penis without her consent, and that in order to commit the rape, he put V in fear of death, offences punishable under s 375(3)(a)(ii) of the Penal Code. Another charge alleged that he sexually penetrated V’s vagina with his finger without her consent, and that in order to commit this offence, he put her in fear of death, an offence punishable under s 376(4)(a)(ii) of the Penal Code.
2       The housebreaking was allegedly committed at about 10.55pm on 23 June 2008, while the outrage of modesty charge allegedly took place at about 11pm on the same day. The other five offences allegedly happened between 11pm on 23 June 2008 and 12.30am on 24 June 2008. All six sexual offences were said to have taken place in a small bedroom (“the maid’s room”) located at the back of the house.
The facts
3       The accused is a Bangladeshi national. At the time of arrest in June 2008, he was working as a gardener in Singapore.
4       V is an Indonesian national, born on 6 February 1985. Her parents are farmers in Indonesia. V completed secondary school education. She could speak Bahasa Indonesia and a smattering of English.
5       She arrived in Singapore on 16 June 2008 and commenced working as a domestic helper at the house on Saturday, 21 June 2008, only two to three days before the alleged incidents. Her employers and owners of the house were Dr and Mrs Wujanto.
6       44 Holland Green is a three-storey, detached house in a quiet residential area. It is located at the end of a row of similar houses. When V started work at the house, she was given the use of the maid’s room at the back of the house. The maid’s room, with the toilet next to it, was separated from the main house by an outdoor wet kitchen area. The maid’s room and the toilet were accessed through doors from this wet kitchen area. Access into the main house from the wet kitchen area was by way of another door.
7       The maid’s room was furnished sparingly. It had a single bed with a pillow and a bolster and two low chests of drawers. There was a table fan, three small clocks and a radio placed on top of these two chests of drawers. As one stands looking into the room from the doorway, there are two small top-hung windows at the top left of the opposite wall, one above the other (“the small window”). On the right side of that wall, there is a long casement window (“the long window”) with a small top-hung window above it. Both sets of windows had curtains at the material time. There are ledges on the outside of these windows facing the barbecue pit and garden. The top of the ledge of the long window is slightly below 130 cm measured from ground level outside. There is an intercom set mounted on the wall facing the windows. Next to it are an alarm switch (with a sticker stating “Alam”(sic)) and the ceiling light switch. However, V did not know what the alarm switch was for as she was not taught how to use it. An outdoor wall lamp would be turned on at night and that provided some light in the maid’s room even with both sets of curtains drawn.
8       V was taught how to open the main wooden door of the house but not the main gates leading to the car porch which can be operated electronically from inside the house. At the material time, she did not know how to operate the intercom at all. Nothing eventful happened on the first day of her work. She completed her household chores and went to bed at around 9.30pm after locking the door of the maid’s room (using the locking mechanism in the door knob) and turning on the table fan. All the windows in the maid’s room were closed and the curtains drawn. She read English newspapers on her bed. She was not able to sleep soundly as she was not used to the room and was frightened.
9       The next day, she went about her household duties. At night, she returned to the maid’s room and locked its door. The two top-hung windows of the small window were never opened. She latched the long window but could not see whether the smaller top-hung one was also latched.
10     On Monday, 23 June 2008, she did her household duties. Later that morning, Mrs Wujanto asked her to go outside the main gates of the house to show her how to wash the rubbish bins. After about five minutes, they went back into the house.
11     At about noon, Mrs Wujanto drove out to buy lunch. V was alone in the house. She did not speak to anyone. After a while, Mrs Wujanto returned and they had lunch.
12     After lunch, V went to hang up the laundry at the side of the house. The maid from the adjacent house spoke to her over the low wall. They introduced themselves. After about five minutes, V went back into the house.
13     At night, she returned to the maid’s room, locked the door, switched on the table fan and the ceiling light and then fell asleep as she was exhausted. Suddenly, she woke up to find that the room light and the table fan had been switched off and that there was someone lying next to her. She was nearer the windows. She shouted “Hah!” but was told in Malay by the man not to make any noise or he would use a knife to kill her and “throw” her. She did not see any knife.
14     V felt very frightened and weak. The man placed his leg on top of her legs and held her hands. He asked her when she arrived and how long she would be there. He also asked her for her name and whether the maid in the adjacent house was also Indonesian. V remained silent. He then asked V whether she was married and she said she was not. He asked her whether she wished to marry him. She replied that she did not as she wanted to earn money. He also asked her whether she wanted to “follow” him or not. She told him, “No”.
15     Suddenly, the man knelt astride her body and took off his shirt. He held on to her hands. She tried to struggle but could not free herself. He then took off her shorts and her panties. After that, he undid her top and removed it and her brassiere. He squeezed her right breast and kissed the nipple. He wanted to kiss her lips but she spat at his lips.
16     He then took off his pants. The maid’s room was not in total darkness although she could not see clearly. He forced her legs apart and then inserted his penis into her vagina. As she was a virgin, she felt great pain, “as if poked with a knife”. He moved his penis inside her for a few minutes and then lay down beside her, holding on to her wrists. After about two minutes, he went on top of her again and tried to kiss her lips but only managed to kiss her eyebrow.
17     He then took the pillow from the floor and placed it under her head. He then raped her a second time. Again it was a painful experience for V. After moving his penis inside her for a few minutes, he lay down beside her. There was no conversation.
18     After a few minutes, the man tried to insert his penis into her again but had a bit of difficulty doing so. He then inserted a finger into her vagina. After that, he raped her a third time. She tried to shout but he said he would kill her with a knife if she did. After that, he lay beside her again, still holding on to her hands and with his legs on her body. She pleaded with him not to bother her and asked him to leave. He refused.
19     Later, the man raped her a fourth time. She tried to struggle. She felt that her vagina was wet. After that, he took her blanket and used it to wipe his penis. He asked her whether she had a mobile phone. She kept quiet. He wanted to call her on her employers’ telephone line but she asked him not to. He told her that he knew the telephone number of the house and that her employers would not be home during the day and that Mrs Wujanto would go out to buy lunch for V. He asked V whether she would like him to bring her food and fruits which he could place next to the maid’s room the next time he went there. After that, he took out some money notes from his trousers and placed them in her right hand. A total of $28 was subsequently found on the bed. She closed her eyes as she was afraid to look. He then left. She did not see him leave but she heard the shutting of the room door.
20     It was past midnight when the man left the maid’s room. V sat on her bed for the next two hours or so as she was frightened. After that, she went to open the kitchen door (leading into the main house) and ran upstairs to her employers’ bedroom on the second level of the house and banged on the bedroom door. When her employers opened the door, she told them that someone had entered the house. Dr Wujanto went down to take a look while V remained upstairs with Mrs Wujanto. When he returned, they asked her what had happened and she told them she had been raped. They called the police immediately.
21     The police arrived. A police woman went upstairs to meet V and Mrs Wujanto in the bedroom. V explained to her what had happened. They then went downstairs. There were a lot of police officers in the house. When they asked V to go to the maid’s room, she screamed and cried and refused to go there. They calmed her down and gave her a change of clothing.
22     Later, they brought V to the National University Hospital for a medical examination. The nurses asked her whether she would like them to inform her family in Indonesia. She did not wish to as her parents would be very upset. She was examined by a doctor and found to have fresh tears in her vagina. Her hymen was also found not to be intact.
23     Three days later, the police brought a man (the accused) to the playground that was beside 44 Holland Green and asked V to look at him from inside the compound of the house. V was not able to say whether that was the man who had attacked her in the maid’s room as she could not see her attacker’s face clearly. She believed that she had seen the man (who was with the police) before but was not entirely sure.
24     In cross-examination, V said that the maid agency fee that she had to pay amounted to eight months of her salary. $310 per month would go towards discharging the fee and she would get the balance of $10 per month for herself. She had worked before in Indonesia in a clothing shop and also as a maid. She had had two boyfriends while she was in Indonesia.
25     On 24 June 2008, she was menstruating and had a sanitary pad inside her panties. However, she did not tell the accused about it. She did tell him her fear of getting pregnant. She did not scream throughout the incident as she was afraid. She denied that the sexual acts with the accused were consensual ones. The defence informed V that the accused was doing gardening in 57 Holland Green that morning and went across to 44 Holland Green to collect some money from Mrs Wujanto. She denied having spoken to the accused earlier that day (when she was washing the rubbish bins outside the main gates) and asking him to go to the park next to the house that night. As she had started work only a few days earlier, she knew no one in that area. Up to the day she testified in court, she had not seen the accused’s face. She denied meeting the accused that night and asking him to go to the main gates so that she could open them from inside (using the intercom set in the maid’s room) and let him into the compound of the house. She said she did not even know how to use the intercom to open the main gates then. She denied the rest of the accused’s story about their alleged conversation at the long window (with the accused standing outside in the garden) and how she eventually allowed him into the maid’s room and had sex with him. The accused did offer to buy her a mobile phone but she did not ask him for one. She also did not ask him for a necklace. He was the one who said the words “Kita happy happy” sometime after raping her. She did not open the main gates using the intercom set to let him out of the compound.
26     Mrs Wujanto testified that at about 10am on 23 June 2008, the accused, known to her as Robin, rang the doorbell of 44 Holland Green to collect his money. The accused did gardening work for her neighbour at 57 Holland Green once a week. As the neighbour was overseas, she asked Mrs Wujanto to pay the accused on her behalf. On the fourth week of every month, she would pay the accused $130 when he went to the house to collect his pay. This was the arrangement for about two years. V was in the house and did not meet the accused.
27     About an hour after the accused left 44 Holland Green that day, Mrs Wujanto went out with V to wash the rubbish bins. After about ten minutes, she went back into the house, leaving V to continue with the washing. V went into the house one or two minutes later.
28     At around noon, Mrs Wujanto drove out to buy lunch. She saw the accused still at 57 Holland Green. Two things struck her as being unusual. Firstly, she had never seen the accused working until so late in her neighbour’s house. Secondly, he appeared not to be working but merely standing behind the gates and looking at her when she drove out of 44 Holland Green. She was not alarmed as she knew who the accused was. In fact, she had met the accused some time ago when he was working in Duchess Court condominium where her neighbour used to live.
29     Mrs Wujanto and her husband went to bed at close to midnight on 23 June 2008. At about 2am on 24 June 2008, V went up to their bedroom and knocked on the door. She said there was an intruder in the maid’s room. As Mrs Wujanto did not speak Bahasa Indonesia, her husband did the interpretation. V was very tense, disturbed and upset, jumping about, and could not tell them exactly what had happened. Worried for the safety of her husband, Mrs Wujanto accompanied him downstairs to look around. They could not find any intruder. They called the police subsequently to report that there was an intruder and went back to their bedroom. Upon further questioning, V told them that she had been raped. V was very traumatised when she was speaking.
30     Mrs Wujanto added that there was an alarm for the door that led from the wet kitchen area into the house. It was not activated between 21 and 23 June 2008 as there was a new maid in the house who had to learn many things and she did not want to upset her neighbours in case the new maid set off the alarm by mistake. That door was merely locked at night during that period. The intercom set was also not used during that period as its operation was complicated. It could open the main gates but V was not taught how to do that during the material time. It would be quite noisy when the main gates are opened that way. The maids were not given the key to the door of the maid’s room.
31     The last maid at 44 Holland Green had been dismissed about a month before V started work as she was found to be pregnant after working for less than six months. The accused had done odd jobs at 44 Holland Green before. He trimmed the branches of the trees in and outside the compound. On one occasion, he helped Mrs Wujanto clear leaves from the top of the car porch. He was very quick and agile. On 23 June 2008, the accused asked her whether there was any work for him to do but she was busy and did not give him any work.
32     V’s services were terminated in February 2009 as she was not performing well in her work.
33     Dr Wujanto’s evidence was similar to that of his wife. He said that V was very distraught and kept uttering, “There is a man, there is a man” in Bahasa Indonesia when she went up to his bedroom. When he went downstairs to look around the house, it was very dark in the garden area outside the maid’s room. The outdoor light outside the maid’s room was turned off when they retired for the night because the playground next to the house was well lit. The lights at the main gates, however, would be switched on throughout the night. He did not pay attention to the windows in the maid’s room. As far as he could recall, they were shut but he could not say whether they were also latched.
34     When the police arrived at the house in the early hours of 24 June 2008, they found V in a traumatised state in the bedroom upstairs. She was seated on the floor in a crouched position and cried and screamed when questions were asked of her. When they managed to calm V down, she told them she had been raped by an unknown man who had threatened to kill her if she made any noise. Investigations by the police led to the discovery of a fingerprint on the door knob of the maid’s room. There was no sign of forced entry into the room. Later that day, the fingerprint was traced to the right thumbprint of the accused (as he was a work permit holder, his fingerprint was stored in a police database). The police did not dust for fingerprints in the other parts of the maid’s room or on the windows and their ledges outside at that time.
35     Suriakumar Ridgeway (“Suriakumar”) is the managing director of Shakti Management Pte Ltd, the employers of the accused since April 2000. The company provides workers for jobs in shipyards. After some time, the accused somehow ended up doing his own gardening work and did not return to the company’s quarters. When the police asked Suriakumar to help locate the accused, he asked his friend, Ananthan (“Anan”), to handle the matter as Anan was closer to the workers. He called the accused and asked him to contact Anan.
36     When the accused called Anan, he asked Anan why Suriakumar and he wanted to see him. The conversation was in English. The accused told Anan that his body was shaking and asked him whether it was about sex with a maid. He told Anan that he had gone out with a maid and had consensual sex with her, that the maid asked him for money and as he did not want to give it to her, she might have reported him. Anan did not know then why the police was looking for the accused and merely told the accused to meet him the next day. The accused knew it was a police problem and said he wanted to go back to Bangladesh. This last sentence was mentioned by Anan only in court. He had forgotten about this when the police was taking his statement.
37     The next day (25 June 2008), Suriakumar and Anan went to meet the police at 9am. At about 11am, they went to pick up the accused and drove to a restaurant in Birch Road. They then informed the police about their location. About ten minutes later, police officers arrived and arrested the accused.
38     Anan agreed in cross-examination that the accused had told him to help bring his brother to Singapore but denied that the accused had deposited $3,000 with him for that purpose.
39     The accused made several statements to the police. Two oral statements were made at about 2.15pm and 3.15pm respectively on 25 June 2008. The accused spoke good Malay and could also speak English fairly well. The communication was in Malay. In the first statement, the accused said that he had sex with the maid on a bench in the park next to 44 Holland Green. He said that he saw the maid for the first time on 23 June 2008 when she was outside the house washing the rubbish bins with Mrs Wujanto. He claimed that the maid asked him to meet at 10pm that night in the park and that he did not enter the compound of the house.
40     The accused was then brought to 44 Holland Green. The second oral statement was made there. He showed the police officers the pathway outside the perimeter wall of the house and told them that he and the maid had sex at the end of that pathway, in a standing position. He said that he did not enter 44 Holland Green that night. However, he could not tell them the maid’s name. He also could not explain why he changed the place of the sexual intercourse from the park bench to the pathway.
41     The police then drove to 4 Jalan Pandan as the accused had told them that he resided there. They then returned to 44 Holland Green where the police interviewed V for about half an hour.
42     At about 9.34am on 30 June 2008, the accused’s statement was recorded in the Police Cantonment Complex. In the afternoon, he was brought to 44 Holland Green where he made an oral statement at about 4.44pm. The admissibility of these two statements was challenged by the accused and will be dealt with below.
43     At about 5.11pm that day, they arrived at 4 Jalan Pandan so that the accused could get some of his personal belongings. They met the house owner, Dennis Hugh Murphy (“Murphy”). Murphy asked him what had happened and the accused told him in English, “I raped girl”.
44     Scientific evidence confirmed that the DNA profile extracted from the seminal fluids obtained from V’s panties, sanitary pad and her vaginal area matched the DNA profile extracted from the accused’s blood sample. The accused was also found not to be suffering from any erectile dysfunction.
45     The accused underwent a psychological assessment in July 2008. He was examined by Dr Lim Boon Leng (“Dr Lim”), the Registrar of the Department of General and Forensic Psychiatry, Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”), on 7 and 11 July 2008. They communicated in simple English. The accused was calm and cooperative. He was not depressed and demonstrated no abnormal behaviour during his remand.
46     The accused told Dr Lim that he first saw V in the morning of 23 June 2008 when he was doing gardening work and she was clearing the rubbish bin. That night, he cycled for 30 minutes from his home to 44 Holland Green. He arrived there at about 11pm. He entered the compound of the house from the back by climbing over a low wall and then over the fence. He went to the maid’s room but found the door locked. He subsequently climbed into the maid’s room through a window. Once he was inside the room, he switched off the light. He woke V up and placed his hand over her mouth when she shouted. He admitted that he threatened to hit her if she shouted. He then took off her brassiere and underwear and proceeded to penetrate her vagina with his penis. He did not ask her for permission before doing so. Later, he ejaculated outside her vagina and cleaned himself with her blanket. The accused also said that he offered to buy V a mobile phone. He gave her some money before leaving the room.
47     Dr Lim was of the opinion that the accused was not of unsound mind and was fit to plead in court. He added that during the first interview, the accused said he penetrated V once but during the second interview, he said, “Then I do again”.
48     V underwent a psychological assessment in November 2008 at the IMH. Dr Kenneth Koh, a consultant psychiatrist, examined her on 4 November 2008 and also interviewed Mrs Wujanto. V was able to give a coherent account of the alleged rapes which was fairly consistent with her testimony in court. Dr Kenneth Koh opined that V suffered from an acute stress reaction subsequent to the alleged rapes with features of depression and post traumatic disorder but had recovered largely since then.
The trial within a trial
49     As mentioned in 
[42]
 above, the admissibility of two statements made on 30 June 2008 was in issue. A trial within a trial was conducted accordingly to determine their admissibility. The first statement was recorded in the morning by SSI Thermizi Tho (“SSI Tho”) with the assistance of a female Bengali interpreter. After that, the accused had his lunch. At about 4.22pm, SSI Tho and two other police officers brought the accused to 44 Holland Green because the accused had mentioned something in the morning that warranted bringing him there to verify what he had said.
50     At the house, SSI Tho recorded in the field diary a summary of what the accused said. The whole process took about 30 minutes. The summary was not signed by the accused as there was no need to. It was consistent with his written statement recorded in the morning.
51     Under cross-examination, SSI Tho agreed that he asked the accused whether he had a key to the maid’s room’s door. The accused told him that he did not. SSI Tho believed that the accused had such a key as the long window was shut and latched but the top-hung window above it was left ajar and he did not think that anyone could have entered the maid’s room through that top-hung window.
52     SSI Tho denied calling the accused “You bloody Bangla bastard”. He also denied that he threatened to hit the accused with his laptop when he did not hand over the door key. He further denied that he offered the accused a reduction from the (then) four charges to two- if he was cooperative. He asserted that he did not say that he would write to the judge to recommend a lighter sentence for the accused so that the accused could go home earlier. He agreed that the accused was in a T-shirt and shorts but he did not think that the temperature in the interview room was very cold. He disagreed that he did not record what the accused said but put facts not narrated by the accused into his statement. He did not ask the accused about the money in the maid’s room as he had inadvertently omitted to do so. It was after the accused said that he entered the maid’s room via the window that the police dusted the window for fingerprints but found no latent fingerprints. There were also no footprints found on the window ledges.
53     SSI Tho agreed that the accused subsequently made cautioned statements in February 2009 under s122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”) (Cap 68) stating that he and V had sex with each other willingly. This was at the remand prison in the presence of another interpreter (a male). The accused had also made such a cautioned statement on 26 June 2008 claiming that sex was consensual.
54     The female interpreter, Nandani, was a free-lance interpreter called by the police to assist every now and then. Her evidence was essentially the same as that of SSI Tho. She agreed that the accused told her he was feeling cold but not that he could not carry on with the recording of his statement because of that. Most accused persons would say that it was very cold but the temperature in the interview room seemed normal to her. She did not think that the temperature there was any different from that in the lock-up. SSI Tho informed the accused that the air-conditioning was central-controlled and could not be adjusted. She interpreted whatever was said between SSI Tho and the accused. After SSI Tho had typed the statement, he read it back to the accused.
55     Nandani denied having told the accused that if he cooperated with the officer, the officer would write to the judge to recommend a lighter sentence or that the officer would reduce the number of charges from four to two. She also denied that she was taking a nap at times in the corner of the room during the interview and that the accused was afraid to sign the statement. She did not recall any threats by SSI Tho. For the cautioned statement on 26 June 2008 (see 
[53]
 above), she also interpreted whatever the accused said, whether positive or negative. Her work with the police was not her sole source of income as she did interpretation work for other entities as well. She did not tell the accused that he must say the same thing consistently, even with the doctor, or SSI Tho would not “do good things” for him.
56     ASP Burhanudeen accompanied SSI Tho and the accused when they went to 44 Holland Green on 30 June 2008. There was no threat, inducement or promise made by anyone to the accused.
57     The accused said he had coffee and a small piece of bread before the interview in the morning of 30 June 2008. When he told SSI Tho that he did not have any key to the maid’s room, the officer simulated the raising of his laptop and a book as if to hit the accused and said, “Bastard Bangla, I want the key now, give the key to me now”. Later, the accused asked the interpreter what would happen if he confessed. She replied that the officer would write to the judge but the sentence would be decided by the judge and not the officer. After that, SSI Tho wrote something and the accused said “yes” to everything that was asked of him. SSI Tho “wrote according to his will” and did not want to hear what the accused said. At times during the interview, the interpreter was sleeping. SSI Tho said he would write to the judge for lenient punishment and that the judge would decide the punishment. He then asked the accused to sign the statement as it “is the rule of the court”. SSI Tho also told him that if he cooperated with him, he would reduce the four charges to two.
58     The interpreter told the accused to listen to SSI Tho. The accused did not know what was written in the statement, parts of which were wrong and parts correct. It was not read back to him. The interpreter also told him to say the same thing everywhere, or the officer would bring him back and may torture him. Because of that, he said what he did to Dr Lim of the IMH (see 
[46]
 above). The accused spoke about the money and the gold chain but was told by the interpreter it was not necessary to record those things.
59     The accused said he confessed that he entered the maid’s room through the window because he was told to say so by the officer and the interpreter. He confessed because he believed them and because he had entered the house illegally without the owners’ permission, although he had V’s permission. He thought the charge was for entering the house without permission. He did not understand the meaning of “rape”. He had never encountered any trouble with the police before in his 8 years in Singapore.
60     In the afternoon, at 44 Holland Green, he merely told SSI Tho that he entered through the window but did not say how he did so. He did not demonstrate the entry to the officer. He said he entered via the window as he could not produce the door key. He had been advised earlier by the interpreter that if he said that, SSI Tho would not force him to produce the key. The truth was that he entered the maid’s room on 23 June 2008 via the door. What he told SSI Tho in the cautioned statements on 16 February 2009 in the remand prison was the truth.
61     SSI Tho told the accused what the alleged rape scenario was. The narration did not emanate from the accused who did not even know that SSI Tho had written such in the statement. As he did not understand the meaning of “charge” at that time, the promise to reduce the number of charges had no effect on him signing the statement.
62     The only reason why the accused signed the statement was because he was assured by the interpreter that the officer would write to the judge to ask for leniency for him. He added later that it was the interpreter who suggested that he say that he went into the maid’s room through the same window where he and V were having a conversation on 23 June 2008. The temperature in the interview room was not as cold as that in the lock-up. The accused had a runny nose on 30 June 2008 and was shivering. He asked for some Panadol tablets but was not given any although others were given the medicine. The four hours or so that the statement took to complete in the morning seemed like only an hour or so to him.
The decision of the court in the trial within a trial
63     It was not disputed that SSI Tho allowed the accused to say whatever he wanted in the cautioned statements recorded before and after 30 June 2008. In all these statements, the accused claimed that all the sexual activities between him and V were consensual. If SSI Tho wanted to incriminate the accused unfairly, it would be very strange for him to have allowed the accused to make contradictory assertions before and after the statements of 30 June 2008. He might as well have coerced or somehow induced the accused to confess to the alleged crimes in the cautioned statements. As he did not do that, it showed that he was not out to pressurize the accused to incriminate himself.
64     I disbelieved the accused’s claim that the charges were not explained adequately to him or that he did not understand the meaning of “charge”. He clearly understood that he was being accused of rape when making the first cautioned statement four days earlier. Following from 
[63]
 above, I also disbelieved his testimony that the bulk of his statement was composed by SSI Tho without any input from him. There was no conceivable reason why the police should favour V to the extent of framing the accused in the manner alleged.
65     Nandani was not beholden to SSI Tho. Interpretation work for the police constituted only about 10% of her monthly income. She was also forthright in saying that the accused did complain about being cold during the interview. I have no doubt that she was not the unscrupulous interpreter that the accused had made her out to be. SSI Tho also said that the police used whichever interpreter was available at any particular time.
66     There would have been no need for SSI Tho to go to 44 Holland Green again on 30 June 2008 if he did not have to check something. He had to go there that day because the accused volunteered the information about entry via the window, something that the investigators initially ruled out because of the fingerprint on the door knob of the maid’s room.
67     The accused’s testimony concerning the recording of his statement on 30 June 2008 was perplexing. Since things were not properly explained to him and the bulk of the material came from SSI Tho and not from him, how was he able to give a consistent account of the incident to Dr Lim of the IMH about a week later?
68     Despite the allegations about threats of violence and inducement, the accused’s testimony was that he signed the impugned statement only because of the promise to write to the judge for leniency. Similarly, I disbelieved these allegations. For argument’s sake, even if the threats and other inducements did happen, they had no effect at all on him signing the statement. They also appear to have no effect on him on 16 February 2009 when he was charged with other offences as he was able to state his defence to those charges.
69     The oral statement made in the afternoon of 30 June 2008 was merely a follow-up of the morning’s proceedings. Based on my findings about the morning’s events, there could have been nothing to render this statement inadmissible.
70     On the totality of the evidence adduced in the trial within a trial, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the impugned statements of 30 June 2008 were made voluntarily. I therefore admitted them in evidence.
Continuation of the trial proper
71     In the statement made in the morning of 30 June 2008, the accused said that he worked for five years as a gardener in Brunei before coming to Singapore. There, he learnt slowly to speak in English and in Malay. He did odd jobs in 44 Holland Green when asked by Mrs Wujanto to do so. About two to three months earlier, he started a sexual relationship with Alee, the previous maid there. She was also from Indonesia. He got to know her because of his work at 57 Holland Green. Alee would telephone him whenever the house owners were not in. He went to the house seven or eight times at night and had sex with Alee in the maid’s room. He caused her to be pregnant and she was then repatriated to Indonesia.
72     The accused had two bicycles which he used to travel from place to place to do gardening work. He also knew two other females from the Philippines working as maids in Singapore. He had a sexual relationship with one of them.
73     He said he saw Mrs Wujanto and V on 23 June 2008 when they were washing the rubbish bins outside the house. V did not talk to him or smile at him. He decided to return to the house that night, planning to have sex with V. At about 10.30pm, he left his residence at 4 Jalan Pandan (Murphy’s house)(see 
[43]
 above) and cycled to Holland Green. When he arrived there, he pushed his bicycle along a path next to the canal that was more or less parallel to Holland Green. When he reached the back of 44 Holland Green, he placed his bicycle on the ground and climbed up the perimeter wall and “went through a small hole among the iron grille” and entered the compound. He had always entered the house the same way when he went to meet Alee as he did not dare to enter via the main gates at the front, even when he was told that the house owners were not at home.
74     He noticed that the light in the maid’s room was on. He tried to open the room door but it was locked. He knocked on it lightly, thinking that V was still awake. When there was no response, he went back to the garden area behind the maid’s room. He saw that the long window was shut but the top-hung one above it was open. He climbed onto the window ledge and stood on it. He then put his arm through the top-hung window and unlatched the long window. He opened the long window and moved the curtains aside. V was sleeping on the bed inside the room. He climbed slowly into the room and then switched off the light.
75     After that, he sat on the bed. He pushed V’s shoulder and she woke up. When she screamed, he quickly used his right hand to cover her mouth and told her in Malay not to make any noise as he had a knife and would use it on her if she made noise. He actually did not have any knife on him. V kept quiet and still. He tried to strike up a conversation with her. He asked her how much her agency took from her salary and she told him eight months’ worth of it. He tried to kiss her but she turned her face away and shouted. He covered her mouth and told her he would “throw” her away. She then kept quiet again.
76     He unbuttoned her blouse and took it off. He then removed her brassiere and kissed her breasts and sucked her nipples. She kept saying that she did not like it and was trying to move her body away from him but could not as he was astride her thighs. He then took off her shorts, not knowing whether the panties came off as well as it was dark. However, V was naked when he touched her. He then stripped and pushed her legs apart. When his penis penetrated her vagina, she said it was painful and told him to stop by saying “chukup” (enough) but he continued his thrusting actions for a few minutes. He then withdrew his penis and sat next to her.
77     The accused asked V whether she needed anything, saying that he wanted to buy her a mobile phone. He then penetrated her vagina again with his penis. Again she said it was painful and asked him to stop. He continued with the intercourse for a few minutes and then ejaculated outside her body. There was only a small amount of semen as he was afraid that V would shout. He took her blanket to wipe his penis. After that, he got dressed and told her that he would be back the following Sunday with her mobile phone. He then left via the room door after turning a button in the door knob to unlock it. He was familiar with the door because of his past visits to Alee.
78     The accused added in the statement that he was sorry and regretted what he had done when he could not control himself. He also apologised for lying that he and V had sex in the park willingly.
79     When the accused was brought by the police officers to 44 Holland Green in the afternoon of 30 June 2008, he repeated to SSI Tho the route that he took on the night of 23 June 2008 to reach 44 Holland Green and how he entered the compound and the maid’s room. They then brought him to 4 Jalan Pandan to retrieve some of his personal belongings (also at 
[43]
 above). When Murphy asked the accused what was the matter, he replied in English, “I raped girl”.
80     SSI Tho said that V’s blanket was subsequently examined with an ultra violet light scan but no semen was found. He also said that when the police arrived at the house in the morning of the incident on 24 June 2008, the long window was shut but the top-hung one above it was slightly open. He did not think too much about it then as it was not possible for a man to climb into the maid’s room through that top-hung window. There were no visible fingerprints on the long window and no visible palm prints or footprints on the window ledge.
81     On 13 May 2009, SSI Tho went to 44 Holland Green with defence counsel as the latter wanted to take photographs of the house and its surroundings. There, SSI Tho enacted the entry into the maid’s room in the way described by the accused. He could not ask the accused to demonstrate the entry when they were at the house on 30 June 2008 as the accused’s arms had to be kept restrained. Further, the accused may be injured during any demonstration by him.
Submissions on no case to answer
82     The defence argued at the conclusion of the prosecution’s evidence that there was no case for the accused to answer. This was because V testified that all the windows in the maid’s room were closed on the night in question and there was therefore no way anyone could have entered via the windows. The accused was about 1.6m tall while SSI Tho was 1.78m tall. Even if the accused managed to lift himself up to the ledge outside the long window, he could not reach in through the top-hung window above to unlatch the long window. Further, the room door was locked. There was therefore no way of access into the maid’s room at all. The only explanation must be that V let the accused in and that the sexual acts were all consensual.
83     The prosecution submitted that V was clearly traumatised on 24 June 2008. The accused would have to explain at the very least why he said what he did in the statement of 30 June 2008. The distance from the opening in the top-hung window to the latch of the long window was about 0.5m only. SSI Tho’s arm had excess length to reach the latch. The accused’s shorter arm should be able to reach it too.
The decision of the court on no case to answer
84     Forced entry into the maid’s room might have been difficult but it was certainly not impossible. The statement made by the accused in the morning of 30 June 2008 has been ruled admissible and it is highly incriminating. In the light of all the evidence adduced, clearly the accused’s defence had to be called on all the charges.
The case for the accused 
85     The accused testified in his own defence. Murphy was also called as a character witness for the accused.
86     The accused received his education in Bangladesh until grade 10. He used to be a farmer. He is divorced. His eight year old daughter is with his former wife. In Singapore, he earned $700 to $800pm as a gardener and remitted $400 to $500pm to his family comprising his father, five sisters and two brothers. He corrected this during cross-examination, saying that he misunderstood his counsel’s questions. He actually earned between $900 and $1,500pm, depending on the weather. He managed to have savings every month after taking care of all his expenses.
87     He worked in Duchess Court condominium for about six years and got to know Mrs Wujanto because she used to visit the owner of 57 Holland Green who was formerly living in that condominium. He last worked as a gardener in houses in the Holland Road/Bukit Timah area. He did grass cutting for Murphy. About seven to eight months ago, Murphy agreed to rent half his house to the accused at $300pm.
88     Murphy, a retired teacher and a widower, saw the accused as a “first grade guy, completely trustworthy”. He was helpful and would re-stock the refrigerator for Murphy as he knew that Murphy had difficulty walking. The accused’s girlfriend used to go to Murphy’s house to clean up and to cook.
89     On 30 June 2008, when the police brought the accused to 4 Jalan Pandan, he asked the accused what was the matter and was told, “I rape girl” or words to that effect. That was totally out of character for the accused as far as Murphy was concerned. He did not think that the accused understood “rape” in any legal sense. While the accused’s English was acceptable for daily communication, it was not that good.
90     On 23 June 2008, when the accused went to 44 Holland Green to collect his pay, V, who was working behind the main gates, smiled at him. Later, when he was outside 57 Holland Green sweeping the ground after dumping a bundle of cut branches in a rubbish truck, he saw V washing the rubbish bins outside 44 Holland Green. Mrs Wujanto had already gone back into the house.
91     V started talking to him in Malay. She called him “Abang” (brother) and asked him to go to the park at 10.30pm that night because she wanted to talk to him. He agreed and then continued with his work. At about 12.15pm, he left for his residence to have lunch and then proceeded to a house in Victoria Park to do work. In the evening, he returned home again for dinner.
92     At about 10.10pm, he cycled to Holland Green and went all the way down that road to the cul-de-sac just after 44 Holland Green and waited at a bench at the playground beside the house. He did not know that he could get there by the pathway next to the canal. The public lights at the playground were switched on and so were the gate lights and the garden lights of 44 Holland Green.
93     After a while, V waved to him from within the compound of the house. He walked over to meet her. V told him that Mrs Wujanto was in and she therefore could not go out of the house. She said there was a phone in the maid’s room which the employer could use to check on her. She told him that she would open the main gates for him. The accused replied that he was afraid as Mrs Wujanto was in the house. V then told him that Mrs Wujanto had gone upstairs for the night. The accused walked towards the main gates of the house. They opened outwards. He walked in and saw two cars parked in the compound. He was curious and wanted to hear what V had to say to him.
94     The accused walked to the garden area outside the long window of the maid’s room. V opened the long window and they talked there, with V in the room and he standing outside the window. When he asked her where the phone was, she pointed it out to him. She asked him to help her as she had just arrived in Singapore. She wanted a mobile phone but would have no salary for eight months because it was used to pay the maid agency. The accused looked into his wallet and saw only $28 inside. V introduced herself as Eli. She told him that she had no working clothes and no trousers. The accused told her he would bring some for her the next day. When he asked her what sort of mobile phone she liked, she said she liked Nokia very much. The accused said that he would bring one for her in a week’s time.
95     V then asked him for batteries for the radio in her room. The accused asked for the radio, took a look at the old batteries and then said he would bring some new ones for her the next day. He would place all the things requested by her next to the rubbish bins outside the house. V wanted to call Indonesia on his mobile phone but the accused advised her against it as her employers might hear her.
96     The accused next asked V what she would give him in exchange for the mobile phone and the money. V replied that they can be “happy, happy”. He asked to enter her room and she consented. He pushed the long window a little to shut it. She closed it from within the room and then latched it. He was hoping that they would do some petting and kissing. He walked to the wet kitchen area. He was not wearing any shoes then as he had left them near the barbecue pit in the garden area as his shoes were not clean. He could not open the room door and she opened it for him. When he went in, he closed the door and then gave her the money. She was sitting on her bed. The room light was off but there was light filtering in from the garden light, the upper floors of the house and the neighbouring house. She put the money into a drawer.
97     V closed the room door. The windows were shut and the curtains were drawn. They started kissing and caressing. The accused asked her to move further into the bed. She lay down and they continued with their kissing and touching. She then unbuttoned her blouse and asked him to unhook her brassiere. He did so and took off his t-shirt. When he placed his hands on her shorts, there was no resistance from her. She removed her shorts and he took off his blue jeans. He then removed her panties and his underwear. She took the sanitary pad that she had on and placed it somewhere. Her legs parted and she became excited. He went on top of her and penetrated her with his penis, making thrusting movements for several minutes. She held him very tightly just before her orgasm. She was very satisfied and lay on the bed looking happy. He used the blanket to wipe his penis. He had not ejaculated yet.
98     V then asked him for a gold chain. He penetrated her again. He told her he would give one to her the next day. After a few minutes, he withdrew his penis and ejaculated. He did that because V told him that her medical check-up was not done yet and asked him not to ejaculate inside her. He did not have a condom with him as he was not going there to have sex but merely to talk. That was the second and last intercourse that night. He did not insert his finger into her vagina.
99     While they were dressing up, V said she wanted a mobile phone the next day. The accused said he would give her a chain first because she might use the mobile phone to look for a new boyfriend. She became angry, took the blanket to cover herself and then lay down on the bed. The accused apologised for what he had said. He asked for a kiss and she gave one almost reluctantly. He asked for a better one and she kissed him on the lips.
100    When he wanted to leave the room, he could not open the room door. He wanted to switch on the light and was about to touch the alarm switch located next to the light switch (see 
[7]
 above) when she told him not to touch it as it would turn off the alarm. She got off her bed and opened the door for him. He asked her to open the main gates for him. She took the phone (intercom), put it to her ear and then said the gates were open. He went to retrieve his shoes and walked back to his bicycle at the playground. He then cycled home using the road. When he reached home, he cleaned up and went to bed a very happy man.
101    The next day (24 June 2008), he went to various houses to do gardening work. In the evening, he took a bus to Mustafa Centre along Serangoon Road to buy a gold chain. He purchased one at $203.02 to give to V that night because she had made him happy. A gold chain and a receipt dated 24 June 2008 with a time stamp of 1921 hours were tendered in court. He also bought some coffee and biscuits, intending to leave them for her by the rubbish bins outside the house so that she could collect them when she brought the rubbish out from the house at night. He had told her the night before that he would do that and when she saw the things there, she would know that he was at the playground area and he would then wave to her. He intended to give the gold chain to V at the playground.
102    When the accused returned home from Mustafa Centre, he noticed that he had nine missed calls from Suriakumar and three missed calls from Anan on his mobile phone which he had left at home because he was re-charging its battery. He called Suriakumar who asked him to call Anan. Anan asked him what happened at his worksite as there was a complaint against him. He asked the accused where he was the previous night. As he had only been to 44 Holland Green, he realized that it must have something to do with V. Anan asked him to meet him and the accused said he would the next day. He did not tell Anan that he wished to return to Bangladesh. He had paid Anan $3,000 to bring his brother from Bangladesh to Singapore but that has not been done.
103    That night, the accused felt very nervous. However, he did not think that going to the house for love-making was much of a crime.
104    On 25 June 2008, he went about his work as usual. He thought about Anan wanting to meet him. He then decided to put the gold chain that he had bought in some other location. Another house owner whom he knew while working in Duchess Court had allowed him to leave some of his belongings at her home at 55 Sunset Avenue. He had the key to the small gate at that house as he did gardening work there too. He kept the gold chain there as that place was more secure than his residence at 4 Jalan Pandan where the gates were kept open all the time.
105    The accused then left in a taxi to meet Anan. Anan, Suriakumar and another man brought him to a restaurant in a car. While the accused was telling them that V had invited him to her place, police officers came and arrested him.
106    When the police questioned the accused about the incident, he related to them that V had invited him to meet in the evening and that they met in the park next to 44 Holland Green. He also told them that they talked at the bench in the park, did some petting and then went near the perimeter wall of the house where they had sexual intercourse. Out of respect for Mrs Wujanto and because of his shame, he did not speak the truth about having sex in the maid’s room in the house. He did not tell the police that they had sex at the bench in the park.
107    When the accused made the s122(6) CPC statement on 26 June 2008, the rape charge was not read to him. He did not know that he was being charged for rape. In answer to one of the interpreter’s questions, he told her that he and V met and had sex willingly. He acknowledged that it was a mistake to have entered the house without the owners’ permission.
108    The accused first read the impugned statement of 30 June 2008 after the preliminary inquiry. He did not know Alee (her name was actually Eli), the previous maid of the house and neither did he tell SSI Tho that he and Alee had sex seven or eight times. In fact, he did not know any maid in the Holland Green neighbourhood. He affirmed that what he said during the trial within a trial was correct and disputed the incriminating portions of this statement.
109    On 5 February 2009, SSI Tho went to the remand prison to take the accused’s fingerprints. The accused asked him why he accused him of rape when he did not do it. The police officer retorted with “Fuck you”. The accused asked him why he talked like that. The police officer replied that he would charge him. The accused said he did not care.
110    On 16 February 2009, the accused made six more s122(6) CPC statements in response to the rest of the charges. He maintained that he had consensual sexual intercourse with V twice on 23 June 2008 and that there was no knife and no threat made against her.
111    As he had savings every month (see 
[86]
 above), buying a Nokia mobile phone for about $250 as a gift was not a big amount for him. However, he decided he would get the mobile phone for V only after knowing her a little better. The gold chain was to establish a relationship between them and to make sure that she would not contact other men. He did not go back to 44 Holland Green on the night of 24 June 2008 because he wanted to meet Anan first as he was concerned that there might have been some trouble. It was not because he had committed rape and was afraid to return to the house. He produced the gold chain and the receipt only during the trial but had told the interpreter about them on 30 June 2008. He was informed that these things were not necessary. He also informed SSI Tho about the purchase but was merely asked to let the police have the Sunset Avenue house owner’s contact number so that they could check the facts. Although the accused had the said house owner’s mobile phone number, he did not inform SSI Tho about it.
112    The accused believed that V made the allegations against him to get him into trouble because he had refused to give her the mobile phone the next day. When he spoke to Anan, Anan told him that the police had called him and also asked him whether he had sex with anyone. He therefore told Anan that he was a little afraid in his mind.
113    He told Murphy that he “raped girl” as he had been instructed by the interpreter earlier to say the same thing everywhere. At that time, he did not know the meaning of “rape” but he had been told to use that word. The interpreter was not present during the visits to 44 Holland Green and 4 Jalan Pandan in the afternoon of 30 June 2008.
114    The accused added later that V was not a virgin as he could penetrate her easily. There was no mention by her of any pain, no talk of using a condom and no bleeding at her vaginal area.
The decision of the court
115    V was a relatively young lady who had arrived in Singapore for only a week and had started working for Dr and Mrs Wujanto for only three days when the incident happened on 23 June 2008. I believed her evidence that she needed time to adjust to life here, especially living alone in a room at the back of the house. She certainly did not appear to be the 
femme fatale
 that the accused portrayed her to be. It was therefore hardly possible that she made the move on the accused and invited him into the house and into her body three days into her first job here.
116    Dr and Mrs Wujanto were quite sure that they had not taught V within the first three days how to operate the main gates by remote control. Without disrespect to V, I do not think she was capable of figuring out the gate mechanism by herself within that short space of time. It would also be illogical for her to open the main gates by remote control as they would definitely make noise when opening, as testified by Mrs Wujanto, and the neighbourhood would be pretty quiet at 10.30pm. V’s employers were upstairs in their bedroom at that time and could easily have heard the main gates swinging open and closing two times (when the accused walked in and when he left later).
117    V’s account of the incidents was clear and consistent. She could not scream for help after the threat by the accused. She would not know whether he had a knife with him. Even if he did not, it was obvious that he was much stronger than her and could easily have assaulted her if he wanted to. It was true that she did not run for help for one or two hours after the accused left the maid’s room. However, I find her explanation that she was afraid that he was still around the house logical. After all, she was not aware how he had gone into 44 Holland Green and could not assume that he walked out of the house after leaving the maid’s room.
118    Her conduct after the events was consistent with a person who had been recently traumatised. Her employers who saw her and the police officers who subsequently attended to her after she ran upstairs did not detect any trace of play-acting by her.
119    Of course, no one would expect a rape victim to calmly give a thorough account of each stage of the harrowing events soon after they happened. It was natural that the story would come out in bits and pieces and sometimes only in answer to questions. Similarly, there could be discrepancies when the story is repeated after a period of time. So long as the discrepancies do not cast any doubt as to V’s truthfulness or her ability to recall facts, they are immaterial. This was my conclusion despite the valiant attempts by defence counsel to attack V’s credibility by comparing her evidence in court with her conditioned statement tendered at the preliminary inquiry and her account to the psychiatrist (see 
[48]
 above).
120    Any suggestion that V was angry with the accused over the conversation about the mobile phone and therefore accused him falsely of rape and the other offences was completely demolished by V’s inability to identify the accused. She did not even ask for his name. If the accused had not fortuitously left his fingerprint on the door knob, he might never have been found out. I believed she was telling the truth in court and accepted her evidence, which was corroborated on material issues in any event by the accused’s statements of 30 June 2008 made to the police and by his account to Dr Lim of the IMH.
121    The accused may be relatively short at 1.6m in height but, as Mrs Wujanto testified, he was very agile and fast. The 1.3m high window ledge outside the long window would not have posed great difficulty for him. The top-hung window above the long window must have been unlatched or otherwise capable of being pulled open from the outside. That was how the accused managed to get into the maid’s room stealthily. He was familiar with that room, having been there many times to visit the previous maid. He was also familiar with the way to climb over the perimeter wall facing the canal.
122    I have stated earlier in my decision in the trial within a trial (at 
[63]
 to 
[70]
 above) why I rejected the accused’s version as to how the impugned statements were taken. His statement of 30 June 2008 explained convincingly how he accessed and exited the maid’s room and what he did to her in between. They supported V’s evidence concerning the crucial facts, save that he said he raped her only twice and not four times. Similarly, his account to Dr Lim of the IMH showed that what V alleged about coerced sex was true.
123    The accused was untruthful on both occasions when he told the police officers that he had sex with V at the bench in the park and then changed the location to the end of the pathway next to the perimeter wall of the house. He was in custody, accused of serious crimes and being questioned by the police. As he said, in his eight years here, he never had occasion to be involved with the police. It was highly unlikely therefore that his first concern was to show respect to Mrs Wujanto by lying about not having been inside her house.
124    Murphy’s evidence as to the accused’s character was of little value in defence to the charges. His knowledge of the accused was confined to what the accused did in 4 Jalan Pandan and, even then, it was not for a substantial period of time. It was noteworthy that the accused said “I raped girl” instead of merely saying “I had sex with girl” or any such words. However, I do not place weight on this brief utterance by the accused.
125    Considering the totality of the evidence adduced, I was convinced beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty as charged and I convicted him on all seven charges.
The sentences
126    The accused had a clean record before the incidents of 23 June 2008. The prosecution only wished to highlight that the offences were pre-meditated, that the accused elected to claim trial in the face of overwhelming evidence against him, that V was working for only three days when the incidents happened and that the accused had portrayed V as a loose woman.
127    Defence counsel submitted that the four charges of rape were essentially one transaction. Further, as the accused had no criminal record, I was urged not to pass a crushing sentence on him.
128    In my view, the accused was opportunistic and much too confident that the new maid of 44 Holland Green would fall for his charms in the same way that the previous maid did. He thought he could force himself on the new maid and then buy his way out by offering her money and gifts. He committed housebreaking in order to violate V. He raped her in the sanctity of her locked room and on the bed on which she rested every night and which she had to continue to use after the incidents of 23 June 2008. The trauma he inflicted on someone who, like him, had to leave her homeland to work in the hope of having a better life is cruel.
129    I accepted that V was a virgin before the rapes. That added to her physical and psychological pain.
130    The accused has shown during the trial that he would not hesitate to tar and mar the reputation of police officers and the interpreter by accusing them of lying and/or of incompetence. However, I agreed with defence counsel that the four rape charges were essentially one transaction as they were committed within a short span of time.
131    I sentenced the accused as follows:
(a)
s457 Penal Code charge - 3 years imprisonment;
(b)
s354A Penal Code charge - 2 years imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane;
(c)
s375(3)(a)(ii) Penal Code charges - 15 years imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for each of the four charges;
(d)
s376(4)(a)(ii) Penal Code charge - 10 years imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.
The imprisonment terms for the s457 Penal Code charge and the first of the s375 Penal Code charges were ordered to run consecutively with effect from 25 June 2008, the date of arrest. All other imprisonment terms were ordered to run concurrently with these two terms. The accused is to be subject to a maximum of 24 strokes of the cane, as mandated by the CPC. The total sentence is therefore 18 years imprisonment with effect from 25 June 2008 and 24 strokes of the cane.",2010-01-11 00:00:00,SG High Court

Background
1       The accused AEY (“the Accused”) faced seven charges involving the same victim (“the Victim”) on various occasions. The charges read:
That you, [
AEY
],
1st Charge    on a day between 8 and 16 March 2008, at about 6.00 pm, at [XXX] Singapore, being a person who has care of [XXX] [DOB: XXX], then a child of 8 years, did ill-treat the child, namely, by subjecting her to physical abuse by using a carrot-shaped glass table decorator to slash her stomach, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act, Chapter 38, and punishable under section 5(5) of the same Act.
2nd Charge    on a day in the month of April 2008, sometime in the afternoon, at [XXX], Singapore, being a person who has care of [XXX] [DOB: XXX], then a child of 8 years, did ill-treat the child, namely, by subjecting her to physical abuse by pulling her hair and punching her face, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act, Chapter 38, and punishable under section 5(5) of the same Act.
3rd Charge    on a day in the month of April 2008, sometime in the evening, at [XXX], Singapore, being a person who has care of [XXX] [DOB: XXX], then a child of 8 years, did ill-treat the child, namely, by subjecting her to physical abuse by using a towel to strangle her, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act, Chapter 38, and punishable under section 5(5) of the same Act.
4th Charge    on a day in the month of April 2008, sometime in the afternoon, at [XXX], Singapore, being a person who has care of [XXX] [DOB:XXX], then a child of 8 years, did ill-treat the child, namely, by subjecting her to physical abuse by using force to separate the middle and ring fingers of her right hand, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act, Chapter 38, and punishable under section 5(5) of the same Act.
5th Charge    sometime in February 2008, at [XXX], did penetrate with your penis, the mouth of XXX [DOB: XXX], a person under 14 years of age, without her consent, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 376(1)(a) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224, and punishable under section 376(4)(b) of the same Act.
6th Charge    on a day in April 2008, at [XXX], Singapore, did sexually penetrate, with your finger, the vagina of XXX [DOB: XXX], a person under 14 years of age, without her consent, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 376(2)(a) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224, and punishable under section 376(4)(b) of the same Act.
7th Charge    on a second occasion in April 2008, at [XXX], Singapore, did sexually penetrate, with your finger, the vagina of XXX [DOB: XXX], a person under 14 years of age, without her consent, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 376(2)(a) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224, and punishable under section 376(4)(b) of the same Act.
2       The prosecution proceeded with the first, second, fifth and sixth charges. The Accused pleaded guilty to these charges. After considering a statement of facts which the Accused accepted, I convicted him of the offences under the first, second, fifth and sixth charges. For the purposes of sentencing, the Accused consented to the remaining three charges to be taken into consideration.
3       The charges under s 5(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev Ed) (“CYPA”) were punishable with a fine not exceeding $4,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding four years or both.
4       The more serious charges were those in respect of offences under s 376(1)(a) and 376(2)(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). As the Victim was under 14 years of age at the time of the offences, the prescribed punishment under s 376(4) of the Penal Code was imprisonment for a term between eight years to 20 years and caning of not less than 12 strokes.
5       I sentenced AEY as follows:
(a)
First charge – 24 months’ imprisonment.
(b)
Second charge – 12 months’ imprisonment.
(c)
Fifth charge – 12 years’ imprisonment and 14 strokes of the cane.
(d)
Sixth charge – 12 years’ imprisonment and 14 strokes of the cane.
The sentence for the sixth charge was to run consecutively from the sentence for the fifth charge which was backdated to 27 May 2009. That was the date of remand. Therefore, the total sentence of imprisonment was 24 years. The maximum number of strokes of the cane was 24 as provided under s 230 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed).
6       The Accused has filed an appeal against sentence.
7       The circumstances in which the offences were committed were found in the statement of facts.
The Victim
8       The Victim was eight years old at the material time.
9       The Victim is in the low average range of intelligence. Based on the findings of Dr [C], Senior Consultant Psychiatrist of [G] Clinic, the Victim has an IQ of 80, whilst the normal IQ range is between 90 and 110.
10     The Victim is currently being cared for by a foster mother.
The Accused
11     The Accused is a 48-year old Malay male. Prior to his arrest, he was residing at a Housing and Development Board flat (“the Flat”) with his wife. He was babysitting the Victim at the time that the offences were committed.
First Information Report
12     On 23 April 2008, the Police received information from the [E] Hospital that the Victim had suffered non-accidental injuries.
Background
13     The Victim and her younger sister had been entrusted to the care and guardianship of the Accused and his wife sometime in 2007 as the Victim’s biological mother was unable to care for them personally. The Accused’s wife had agreed to care for them for a stipulated monthly sum, and the Accused and his wife were fully responsible for all of the Victim’s affairs, including school-related matters. The Victim and her younger sister resided at the Flat. The Victim’s biological mother only visited the Victim about once a month or once every few months.
14     On 23 April 2008, the Victim’s school counsellor noticed some bruises on the Victim’s forehead and the outer part of her palm. Upon closer examination, more bruises were discovered on the Victim’s body and the Victim was referred to and warded at [E] Hospital. The Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports was also notified. The Victim was eventually discharged from [E] Hospital on 9 May 2008. The Victim and her younger sister were then placed in the care of a foster mother.
15     On 18 April 2009, the Victim told her foster mother that the Accused had put his penis in her mouth and had also digitally penetrated her private parts. On 6 May 2009, at about 4.43pm, the Victim’s foster mother lodged a police report at [N] Neighbourhood Police Centre about the Victim having been sexually abused by the Accused.
Arrest
16     On 25 May 2009, the Accused was arrested. His wife was also placed under arrest.
17     The wife has since been convicted on four counts of physical abuse of the Victim under s 5(1) of the CYPA and sentenced to 14 months’ imprisonment.
Facts relating to the first charge under s 5(1) of the CYPA
18     Sometime during the March school holidays of 2008, between 8 March 2008 and 16 March 2008, at about 6pm, in the Flat, the Accused had used a carrot-shaped glass table decorator to slash the Victim’s stomach.
19     During her examination of the Victim on 23 April 2008, Dr [T], Registrar of the [E] Hospital, noted that there was a healed “1cm scar (self-inflicted)” on the Victim’s stomach.
20     Dr [T] subsequently clarified that the reference to the 1cm scar as having been self-inflicted was recorded based on information provided by the Victim during the examination on 23 April 2008.
21     The Accused admitted that he had used a carrot-shaped glass table decorator to hurt the Victim in the manner set out in the first charge.
Facts relating to the second charge under s 5(1) of the CYPA
22     Sometime in the month of April 2008, in the afternoon, at the Flat, the Victim was playing in the master bedroom with her younger sister when the Accused came into the room and started pulling the Victim’s hair. The Accused also punched the Victim’s face.
23     In her medical report dated 30 May 2008, Dr [T] confirmed that there was some dried blood at the Victim’s right nostril, and that the area around the Victim’s right cheek was tender and swollen.
Facts relating to the fifth charge under s 376(1) of the Penal Code
24     Sometime in February 2008, the Victim helped the Accused’s wife put some clothes into the cabinet in the master bedroom of the Flat. The Accused’s wife was in the living room. When the Victim was about to leave the master bedroom after putting the clothes in the cabinet, the Accused appeared and told her to go back into the room.
25     The Accused stood in front of the Victim and pulled down his shorts. The Victim was standing and facing the Accused then. The Accused then took out his penis and pushed it into the mouth of the Victim while holding onto the Victim’s head.
26     The Accused only withdrew his penis from the Victim’s mouth when the Victim shook her head in objection and was about to shout. The Accused then warned the Victim not to tell his wife about what he had done and threatened to beat her if she did. Thereafter, he left the room.
Facts relating to the sixth charge under s 376(2) of the Penal Code
27     Sometime in April 2008, the Victim came out from the toilet in the master bedroom of the Flat and found the Accused sitting on the floor of the bedroom. The Accused told the Victim to sit beside him and she complied. After the Victim sat down on his left, the Accused told the Victim to raise her right leg as she was sitting on something.
28     When the Victim raised her leg, the Accused slipped his hand into the side opening of her shorts and panties, and penetrated her vagina with his finger. The Accused then pushed his finger in and out of the Victim’s vagina a few times.
29     When the Victim shouted out in pain, the Accused covered her mouth and told her not to shout. The Accused then withdrew his finger and saw that his finger was stained with blood. He then left the room. After the Accused left the room, the Victim pulled down her shorts and saw that there was blood on her panties.
30     The Victim was examined by Dr [R], Associate Consultant, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the [E] Hospital, and found to have an old hymenal tear at the 6 o’clock region.
31     In mitigation, the Accused asked for leniency as he has three children.
32     The prosecution submitted that there were many aggravating factors.
33     The Victim was of a tender age of eight years old and also of a low average range of intelligence.
34     In moving the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill through which s 376 of the Penal Code was enacted, the Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee) stated on 22 October 2007:
“Sir, whilst the Penal Code protects society generally, we should be mindful that some amongst us are more vulnerable to crimes than others. These include persons of a young age and persons with mental disability.”
35     The Victim had suffered significant injuries such as the 1cm scar on her stomach, dried blood in her right nostril, tenderness and swelling in her right cheek, a 4cm scar in the web space between the middle and ring finger of her right hand and a tear in her hymen. She had to be hospitalised for more than two weeks.
36     She also suffered considerable pain when the Accused used force to separate her fingers and when the Accused digitally penetrated the Victim’s vagina. In the latter situation, the Victim shouted out in pain. The Victim found blood on her panties.
37     The psychiatric report on the Victim stated that she felt ashamed and angry at the Accused. She tried not to think about the incidents.
38     The Victim’s Impact Statement dated 2 December 2009 stated that the Accused had hurt her and embarrassed her. The medical examination she had to undergo for police investigation caused her pain and embarrassment. At times before the Victim went to sleep, she would feel sad and troubled over what the Accused had done. She would no longer trust any babysitter suggested by her mother. She now gets angry more easily with her younger sister.
39     The prosecution submitted that for the first charge, an instrument had been used. The Accused had abused the trust reposed in him and abused the Victim in her home which she would have considered to be a safe haven.
40     The physical abuse was without reason and the sexual abuse took place even when it was clear that the Victim was an unwilling participant.
41     The prosecution submitted that the Accused’s plea of guilt and lack of antecedents should be given little or no weight. It was only in April 2008 that the Victim’s injuries were noticed and the physical abuse was discovered. Even then, the Accused did not surrender himself. It was only after the Victim had confided in her foster mother about a year later in April 2009 that the Accused was arrested on 25 May 2009. The Accused had also vacillated in his plea of guilt before he affirmed this plea.
42     The prosecution accepted that a psychiatric report on the Accused stated that the Accused was functioning at the borderline or low average range of intelligence. Nevertheless, he was found to be fit to plead and was not of unsound mind. He was aware of the wrongful nature of his offences.
43     The prosecution submitted that the sentences for the two more serious offences under the Penal Code should be ordered to run consecutively and that the Accused should be sentenced to three to four years’ imprisonment for each of the CYPA charges. In total, the prosecution sought a minimum of 24 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane.
44     In 
Mohd Iskandar bin Abdullah v PP
 (MA No 187/98/01), the accused pleaded guilty to two charges of assaulting two of his sons in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to their health under s 4(1) of the CYPA (Cap 38, 1994 Rev Ed). In one offence, the accused had punched his ten year old son on his right cheek for uttering vulgar language at a boy in the neighbourhood. In the other offence, his twelve year old son had run away from home with his sister. Three days later, the victim returned home alone and the accused kicked him on his head causing him to lose consciousness temporarily. Thereafter, the accused used the buckle of his belt to hit the victim’s left hand, buttock, thighs and his head near to a ear until the belt buckle broke off. Three other offences were taken into consideration. He was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment on each of the two charges in question with the sentences to run concurrently. His appeal on sentence was dismissed.
45     In 
PP v Z
 
[2003] SGDC 62
, the accused pleaded guilty to three charges of wilfully causing unnecessary injury to the health of her nine year old step-daughter under s 4(1) of the CYPA (Cap 38, 1994 Rev Ed), 
ie
, the third, fourth and fifth charges. Under the third charge, the accused had slapped and caned the victim. Under the fourth charge, the accused had given the victim one sleeping pill to eat about three times a week because she wanted the victim to sleep. Under the fifth charge, the accused bit the victim on her right ear as she blamed the victim for causing a kitchen cabinet to fall and the plates within to drop onto the floor. The accused was sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment for the third and fourth charges and six months’ imprisonment for the fifth charge. The first two sentences were to run consecutively making a total of eighteen months. The accused’s appeal against sentence lapsed.
46     In 
PP v Firdaus bin Abdullah
 
[2009] SGDC 197
, the accused was tried, convicted and sentenced to one year’s imprisonment for each of two charges of ill-treatment of a three year old child. The first (DAC 040615/2008) was for punching the victim on the head (the punch was so hard that it caused the accused to injure his knuckle and the victim to fall), an offence under s 5(1) CYPA. The second (DAC 040616/2008) was for grabbling, shaking and biting the victim’s penis and scrotum after slamming the victim’s head against a wall which was also an offence under s 5(1) CYPA. The accused was also sentenced to six years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for causing grievous hurt to the victim by repeatedly punching his face and slamming his head against a doorframe. The victim eventually died from the injuries. One sentence for ill-treatment was ordered to run consecutively with the sentence for causing grievous hurt making a total of seven years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.
47     On appeal, Chan Sek Keong CJ enhanced the sentence for the ill-treatment under DAC 040616/2008 to the maximum four years’ imprisonment but did not vary the other sentence for ill-treatment. The charge for causing grievous hurt was enhanced to the maximum of seven years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. All three sentences were ordered to run consecutively, making a total of 12 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.
48     As for the more serious charges under the Penal Code, I considered two precedents to be helpful as some other precedents involved more than one victim.
49     In 
PP v Selvaraju Jayaselvam
 (CC No 14/2009), the accused was a 26-year old Indian national male with no antecedents. The accused was sent to a primary school to do some repair work. In the school toilet, the accused performed fellatio on his seven year-old primary school victim and attempted to force the victim to perform fellatio on him. The accused pleaded guilty to one charge of sexual assault by penetration under s 376(1)(b) punishable under s 376(4) of the Penal Code. He was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.
50     In the case of 
PP v Chan Kok Weng
 (CC No 24/2009), the accused was a 29-year old male who performed fellatio on the victim, a seven year old boy, in the toilet of the Yishun Community Library. The accused was a stranger who had targeted the victim and waited for the victim in the toilet. The accused pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. He had no similar antecedents.
51     I accepted that the lack of antecedents was not a mitigating factor as the Accused had abused the Victim on various occasions.
52     As for his plea of guilt, I did give some weight to that even though he did not surrender himself and even though he did vacillate before affirming his decision to plead guilty. A plea of guilt did save the Victim from having to testify and it would be no easy task to prosecute any accused based on the evidence of a young victim.
53     On the other hand, I accepted the aggravating factors submitted by the prosecution.
54     Unlike the two precedents mentioned above for the charges under the Penal Code, the Accused had abused the trust reposed in him. As one of the care-givers, he was supposed to protect and care for the Victim. Instead, he did the opposite.
55     The young age of the Victim was an aggravating factor as reflected in the minimum punishment provision in s 376(4)(b) Penal Code.
56     The low average range of intelligence of the Victim was an aggravating factor even though the Victim was not mentally retarded.
57     In respect of each of the four offences, the Victim had suffered pain and suffering as the prosecution had outlined.
58     The Victim appeared to have undergone much more severe post-trauma psychologically and emotionally than the victims in the two precedents (for the charges under the Penal Code) who did not appear to have any significant post-trauma. Furthermore, the Victim is now more easily annoyed with her sister who has become an indirect victim.
59     In the case of the offences under the CYPA, the Accused had abused the Victim for no reason at all. It was not as though she had done something wrong that caused him to lose his temper. It appeared that he abused her as and when he felt like it. The Accused’s conduct in respect of the first charge, as compared with the second charge, was the more blameworthy. He had deliberately taken the carrot-shaped glass table decorator to slash her stomach, not sufficiently to cause her more serious injury, but to inflict pain on her which resulted in a scar. That is why I ordered two years’ imprisonment for the first charge and one year for the second charge.
60     As for the more serious offences, I was of the view that the Accused should be sentenced to at least 12 years’ imprisonment and 14 strokes of the cane for each of them in view of the aggravating factors. In considering whether to impose stiffer sentences of imprisonment, I took into account the fact that I was minded to order both of these sentences to run consecutively. Bearing in mind the totality principle, I was not minded to order stiffer sentences of imprisonment for each of the two of the more serious offences. Neither was I minded to order stiffer caning sentences. In any event, the total number of strokes under the law was 24.
61     In view of the fact that the Accused was convicted of at least three offences, at least two of the sentences were to run consecutively. I was of the view that it would be too light if I ordered the sentence for only one of the more serious offences to run consecutively with the sentence for one of the offences under the CYPA. Hence, I ordered both sentences for the more serious offences to run consecutively.",2010-01-05 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judith Prakash J:
1       On 26 October 2006, the plaintiff, Cindy Goh Pin Yi, who was then 15 years old, was severely injured after the bicycle she was riding collided into a stationary lorry. The lorry was owned by the second defendant, Tri-Mas System Pte Ltd (“Tri-Mas”) and the first defendant, Mahmod Fadzuli Bin Mahnor (“Mr Mahmod”), who was then employed by Tri-Mas, had parked it along Sungei Tengah Road for the night. By this action, the plaintiff seeks damages for her injuries.
The facts
2       Sungei Tengah Road is a four lane road which carries traffic moving in both directions. The road is divided by a continuous centre white line and there are two traffic lanes on each side of the road. The road is about 15.24m in width and therefore each lane is about 3.81m wide. The road is lined by trees and lit by a number of lamp posts. There is an unnamed narrow road (“the lane”) which runs downhill and is perpendicular to Sungei Tengah Road. The lane is, apparently, quite steep. It joins Sungei Tengah Road at a junction which is in the vicinity of lamp post no 117 but opposite it. There is an unbroken white line across the lane at its junction with Sungei Tengah Road and traffic approaching Sungei Tengah Road along the lane is supposed to stop before this white line prior to turning into Sungei Tengah Road. Vehicles turning right from the lane into Sungei Tengah Road have to cross two lanes of on-coming traffic before entering the lane proceeding in the direction in which they wish to travel. Vehicles that wish to turn from Sungei Tengah Road into the lane may do so by way of a slip road which is situated to the right of the main junction between Sungei Tengah Road and the lane.
3       According to Rule 22(a) of the Road Traffic Rules (Rule 91 of the Highway Code), no person is allowed to park a vehicle on any road between the edge of the roadway and any portion of an unbroken white line laid down on such road. Rule 22(d) prevents parking on the grass verge of a road. Despite this prohibition, the evidence was that prior to the accident, vehicles were often parked overnight in the outermost lane of Sungei Tengah Road opposite the junction with the lane and along the edge of the road.
4       The lorry involved in this case bears the registration no GZ2395C. It is silver in colour, has a width of 169cm and the mirror on the driver’s side extends 27cm out from the frame of the lorry. If the width of the body of the lorry were to include the mirror then the total width would be 196cm or just under 2m.
5       Mr Mahmod’s evidence was that it was his usual custom to park Tri-Mas’ lorry along Sungei Tengah Road in the evenings before he went home. Mr Mahmod lives in Chua Chu Kang Avenue 3 and it was a short walk from Sungei Tengah Road to his home. He did not park the lorry in a car park in his estate as he could not afford to do so and Tri-Mas did not pay the lorry’s overnight parking fees. Mr Mahmod testified that he was not the only person to use Sungei Tengah Road for overnight parking. There were usually several lorries parked along the road every night.
6       On 13 October 2006 at about 7pm, Mr Mahmod drove the lorry to Sungei Tengah Road and he then parked the vehicle at the side of the road. In his affidavit, Mr Mahmod alleged that the lorry was parked under a lamp post opposite the premises at 51 Sungei Tengah Road known as the Chengtai Nursery. In court, however, he agreed that the lorry was not parked opposite the Chengtai Nursery but further away and closer to the junction between the lane and Sungei Tengah Road. It was, he said, slightly forward of the junction. Mr Mahmod did not park the lorry on the grass verge but very slightly away from it. He said there was a gap of about an inch between the lorry and the verge. He maintained that at the time he parked the lorry, there were other lorries already parked there both in front of and behind the lorry. Mr Mahmod was aware that it was not lawful for him to have parked the lorry where he did but this fact did not bother him at the time since he had been parking along Sungei Tengah Road for about four to five years prior to the accident and during that period, he had not received any summons or been charged with illegal parking. He was also reassured by the habitual parking of other lorries at the same location.
7       The 13 October 2006 was the last day of the end of year examinations for the plaintiff and her friends. They decided to go cycling that evening to celebrate. A group of teenagers met at a basketball court in Choa Chu Kang and thereafter they proceeded to cycle uphill from Choa Chu Kang Farmart. Their ultimate destination was a shopping centre called Sunshine Plaza. Around 10.30 that evening, the cyclists approached the lane. Their intention was to cycle down the lane and turn right into Sungei Tengah Road.
8       Evidence as to what happened that evening was given by three persons: the plaintiff herself and her friends Miss Lian Miaoyu and Miss Lee Wan Ting. Miss Lee was the only person who saw what happened as Miss Lian had preceded the plaintiff down the lane and was not aware of the accident until later.
9       The plaintiff’s evidence in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief was that she had cycled down the lane and then made a right turn into Sungei Tengah Road. Whilst she was negotiating the bend, she collided into a lorry that was parked there. She lost consciousness and when she awoke she was in the National University Hospital. The plaintiff also stated that Sungei Tengah Road has many trees, is quiet and is not heavily utilised. Even though there were lamp posts lighting the path, the road was still rather dim. As she was negotiating the turn, she did not observe the presence of the lorry on the road. There were, however, several vehicles parked along the road.
10     Under cross-examination, the plaintiff said that she could not remember very much about the accident. In particular, she did not remember whether there was a white stop line at the junction of the lane and Sungei Tengah Road or what the traffic condition along that road had been. The last thing she remembered before the accident was cycling down the lane. She also remembered that the area was quite dimly lit although the lamp posts were functioning that day. The plaintiff agreed that she had cycled frequently around the area and whilst she disagreed with counsel’s suggestion that there were always a lot of lorries parked along one side of Sungei Tengah Road, she stated that sometimes lorries had been parked there.
11     Ms Lee Wan Ting stated in her affidavit that at the time of the accident, she and the plaintiff were classmates in Fajar Secondary School. On the 13 October 2006, she was part of the group of friends that was celebrating the end of the examinations by cycling in the Choa Chu Kang area. Some time that evening, they decided to go to Sunshine Plaza for supper. To get there, the group had to cycle down the lane and then turn right into Sungei Tengah Road. Ms Lee said that the usual route that the friends took to get into Sungei Tengah Road was to enter the slip road. They did this, even though it was against the flow of traffic, because this was a convenient way of negotiating the junction. On the night of the accident, however, as they approached the junction on their respective bicycles, Ms Lee saw a car using the slip road. Thus, it was not available and the friends had to make their turn at the junction proper.
12     The first bicycle to approach the junction was ridden by a boy named Richard and he was carrying Ms Lian on the bicycle’s main bar. He proceeded down the lane and made the turn into Sungei Tengah Road without incident. Thereafter, Ms Lee proceeded down the slope. After negotiating the turn, she stopped and turned back to look at the remaining riders. The plaintiff was one of the last few riders to proceed down the slope. Ms Lee saw her move down the lane and negotiating the turn and then colliding into the lorry. The accident happened fast. Ms Lee then turned her bicycle round to cycle to the lorry to check on the plaintiff. Her initial conclusion was that the plaintiff had fallen off her bicycle onto the road. As she approached, however, she saw that the plaintiff was hanging from another lorry that was parked in front of the lorry into which she had collided. The plaintiff’s bicycle was on the ground and there was blood all over the place. Subsequently someone called the ambulance and the plaintiff was conveyed to the hospital.
13     Ms Lee deposed that she and the plaintiff had often cycled over the weekends and had often used the same stretch of Sungei Tengah Road. Even though there were lamp posts with orange lights, it was quite dark and the road was dim. Further there were several trailer lorries parked along Sungei Tengah Road.
14     During cross-examination, Ms Lee reaffirmed that she and the plaintiff had frequently cycled along the stretch of Sungei Tengah Road in question and that they were familiar with the road and the usual traffic conditions. She also confirmed that they were both competent cyclists. She agreed that lorries and trailers frequently parked along the left lane of the road. She agreed that on the 13 October 2006, when she approached the junction of the lane and Sungei Tengah Road, the lorry was parked along the opposite side of the road together with other trailer lorries. She agreed that she had seen the lorry before she had made the turn into Sungei Tengah Road itself. She also agreed that when she made the right turn at the junction she had done so without colliding into the lorry.
15     Ms Lee was asked a series of questions relating to visibility on the night in question. She agreed that when cycling down the lane towards the junction, there was nothing obstructing her view. She did not agree that the lorry was clearly visible to her as she cycled down the lane but she did agree that it was visible to her as she approached the junction. She agreed that if the plaintiff had kept a look out when she was approaching the junction she would also have seen the lorry. Ms Lee confirmed that there was a stop line at the end of the lane. She also agreed that the plaintiff did not stop at the stop line before she made the right turn into the junction.
16     Ms Lee was then asked questions relating to the space available at the junction for her turn. This series of questions and answers went as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
 
 
… I’m now suggesting to you that you came down the slope, you were able to make a right turn without colliding into the 2
nd
 defendant’s parked lorry on the opposite side of the road because the road is wide enough for you to turn and still keep a safe distance from the 2
nd
 defendant’s lorry. Do you agree?
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
 
 
No, quite squeezy.
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
 
 
Okay. Do you agree with me that Sungei Tengah Road is a wide road and there are two lanes on each side of the road?
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
 
 
Yes.
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
 
 
You agree with me that at the material time, the 2
nd
 defendant’s lorry was parked on the left side of Sungei Tengah Road?
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
 
 
Yes.
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
 
 
Do you agree with me that the 2
nd
 defendant’s lorry did not take up the whole of one lane?
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
 
 
Yes.
 
 
 
 
 
…
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
 
 
So would you agree with me that when you made the right turn, you had an allowance of at least one lane from the 2
nd
 defendant’s parked lorry?
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
 
 
Yes.
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
 
 
Thank you. You will agree with me that at no time when you were making the right turn at the junction were you in any danger of colliding into the 2
nd
 defendant’s lorry?
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
 
 
No.
 
 
 
 
 
…
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
 
 
You were not in any danger, right? Is that what you are saying?
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
 
 
No, as in won’t bang onto it, but ---
 
 
 
 
 
…
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Court
 
 
 
Please don’t rush it. What --- what did you say? Can you repeat that, please?
 
 
 
 
 
Witness
 
 
 
Erm, not --- wouldn’t bang onto it lah, but a bit --- somehow a bit can’t turn.
 
 
 
 
 
Court
 
 
 
A bit?
 
 
 
 
 
Witness
 
 
 
Can’t turn, as in ---
 
 
 
 
 
Court
 
 
 
You had to make a hard turn ---
 
 
 
 
 
Witness
 
 
 
Yes.
 
 
 
 
 
Court
 
 
 
--- in order not to hit the lorry, is that what you’re saying?
 
 
 
 
 
Witness
 
 
 
Yes. It’s a bit squeezy, the road.
 
 
 
 
 
Court
 
 
 
It was a bit squeezed?
 
 
 
 
 
Witness
 
 
 
Yes.
 
 
 
 
 
Court
 
 
 
Yes. So was there enough room for you to manoeuvre easily?
 
 
 
 
 
Witness
 
 
 
Not easily ah, but can make it.
 
 
 
 
 
17     Ms Lee confirmed, under further questioning, that she had been travelling at quite a fast speed when she was cycling down the lane, though she did not agree that it was a high speed. She agreed that if she had slowed down and stopped at the stop line and then proceeded to make the right turn, she would not have been anywhere near the parked lorry. She also agreed that if the plaintiff had slowed down or stopped at the stop line, she would not have collided into the lorry and that the collision took place because the plaintiff may have lost control of her bicycle when she made the right turn. She agreed that the impact of the collision between the plaintiff and the lorry must have been quite great and that this must have been because the plaintiff was riding down the lane at a fast speed prior to that. She did not agree, however, that the lorry was clearly visible to anyone travelling down the lane. It would only be visible as you came closer to the junction and there would only be a few seconds between the time you saw the lorry and the time you made the turn.
18     Under re-examination, Ms Lee said that she did not know the exact speed at which she had been travelling when she approached the junction. It was, however, a speed at which she could make a right turn. She also clarified, by reference to the dimension of the court room, that she was about 30ft away from the lorry when she was first able to see it. She said too that when she used the word “squeezy” she had meant that after the turn her position had been “almost near the lorry” and she further clarified this to mean about a metre away from the lorry. Ms Lee stated that the lorry was parked in front of the junction and the light was a bit dim. She also said that she considered her own speed as normal and not fast or too fast. She confirmed that she did not really know what speed the plaintiff had been travelling at although she had said earlier in court that the plaintiff had been travelling at the same speed as she herself had.
19     Ms Lian’s evidence was less helpful as she did not see the accident occur, having negotiated the turn ahead of the plaintiff. She had travelled on Richard’s bicycle and had been rather scared as they approached the junction because of the speed of the bicycle and because they were travelling down the slope. She had therefore closed her eyes. Thus she did not see the lorry parked along the side of Sungei Tengah Road. She did recall that Richard did not stop at the stop line at the bottom of the lane before he proceeded to turn right at the junction. Under re-examination, Ms Lian confirmed that the environment was dim. She said that she had had her eyes closed all the way down the slope and she only opened them after they had made the turn. She then clarified that she had seen the lorries parked along Sungei Tengah Road before they had started down the slope though she had not identified them as lorries but had just seen them as objects.
20     Mr Mahmod testified that he had been driving the lorry in question for about a year before the accident. Tri-Mas allowed him to drive the lorry home at the end of his working day because of his difficulty in obtaining alternative transport to and from work every day. Tri-Mas, however, would not pay the season parking rates for the lorry to be parked in the car park near Mr Mahmod’s home and that was why he had regularly parked it along Sungei Tengah Road at night. In cross-examination, he was asked to show where the lorry had been parked on the 13 October 2006. He pointed to a lamp post and further questioning elucidated that the rear end of the lorry was about one metre away from the lamp post. The distance from the lorry to the Chengtai Nursery was about 30m away. He agreed that he had not parked the lorry immediately opposite the Chengtai Nursery but some distance away and near the lamp post.
21     Mr Mahmod confirmed that he had been charged under r 22(a) of the Road Traffic Rules for the offence of illegal parking and that he had compounded this offence by paying a fine of $70. He also admitted that parking along the stretch of Sungei Tengah Road where his lorry had been placed was illegal. He explained that on the day in question he had not put on his hazard lights because there were other lorries parked to the front and to the rear of his vehicle. He did not agree that this created a danger because there were street lights along the road and also there were other lorries parked there.
22     Mr Mahmod was asked whether he had obstructed the flow of traffic along Sungei Tengah Road by the manner in which he had parked the lorry. He did not answer the question directly but admitted it was an offence to park the lorry where he had. He reiterated that he had parked along the road for four or five years before the incident and up till that time had not been summoned or charged for illegal parking. Mr Mahmod was then asked whether parking near the junction of the road with the lane would create more of a danger. His response was that there was a stop line at the junction so that every vehicle approaching the junction had to stop before turning into Sungei Tengah Road. He disagreed that he had created a danger for other road users by parking near the junction. He also disagreed that by parking at the junction he had restricted the space needed by vehicles that were turning into Sungei Tengah Road from the lane. In his view, there was still sufficient space for the turn to be made. On being pressed, however, he agreed that his action had “restricted the space” available for turning vehicles. As far as visibility was concerned, Mr Mahmod maintained that visibility in the vicinity was good as there was a lamp post near his vehicle. Subsequently, after further questioning, Mr Mahmod agreed that by parking where he had, he had posed a danger for other road users. He also confirmed that the position of the lorry was slightly to the front of the place where the lane met Sungei Tengah Road. Under re-examination, having been referred to the photographs of the area where the accident took place, Mr Mahmod stated that there were no trees or other objects that would block the view of persons using the lane and prevent them from seeing traffic on Sungei Tengah Road. He also said that in his view, vehicles going down the lane would have been able to see his lorry parked along the left side of Sungei Tengah Road.
Submissions and analysis
23     Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that in view of their youth, the plaintiff’s witnesses were incapable of grasping the essence of the questions posed by either counsel. He also said that it could be gleaned from the evidence of Ms Lee and Ms Lian that the road was dim despite the lamp posts being in working order. As for the defence, Mr Mahmod had conceded that he had parked the lorry along Sungei Tengah Road for his own convenience and that that parking had been illegal. He had also agreed that he had not put on the hazard lights and that the lorry was parked on the road itself rather than on the grass verge. He further acknowledged that his manner of parking created a hazard for other road users. In view of this evidence, counsel submitted that Mr Mahmod was acutely aware that he had parked the lorry illegally and that he was culpable.
24     Turning to the law, counsel noted that it was well established that road users owe a duty to take reasonable care for each other’s safety and not to injure other road users. The defendants had breached this duty of care by their action of parking the lorry along Sungei Tengah Road near the junction with the lane. Counsel relied on the cases of 
Hill-Venning v Beszant
 [1950] 2 All ER 1151 (“
Hill-Venning
”) and 
Parish v Judd
 
[1960] 1 WLR 867
 (“
Parish
”). In 
Hill-Venning
, the defendant motorcyclist stopped his motorcycle on the road after its light bulb went off. He did not push the motorcycle to the grass verge at the side of the road but instead attempted to repair the motorcycle while it was on the road. While he was doing the repairs, the plaintiff’s motor vehicle collided into the motorcycle. The majority of the Court of Appeal held that by failing to remove his motorcycle off the highway, the defendant had not taken all reasonable precautions to prevent danger to other traffic. He was therefore negligent and blame for the accident had to be apportioned as to two-thirds to the plaintiff and one-third to the defendant. The plaintiff in the present case laid emphasis on Denning L.J’s observation at p 1153 of the report of 
Hill-Venning
.
The presence of an unlighted vehicle in a road is 
prima facie
 evidence of negligence on the part of the driver, and it is for him to explain how it came to be unlighted and why he could not move it out of the way or give warning to oncoming traffic …
25     The above decision had to be contrasted with the 
Parish
 case where due to a breakdown of its lighting mechanism one night, the defendant’s car was towed by a lorry to the side of the road some six or seven yards from a street lamp. While both vehicles were stationary, the defendant’s car being completely unlit, the lorry carrying rear and side lights, a car in which the plaintiff was a passenger collided with the rear of the defendant’s car. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant had wrongfully obstructed the highway. It was held that the presence of a wholly unlit vehicle upon a dark road at night where there was no street lighting was 
prima facie
 evidence of negligence on the part of the person responsible for the vehicle, but as the breakdown of the lighting mechanism could not be attributed to any negligent, omission or act of commission on the part of the defendant, the presumption of negligence had been displaced and the plaintiff’s action failed. The judge observed (at p 870) that the standard imposed by common sense demanded that if a person left a vehicle parked in a dark place at night, the vehicle should have lights upon it.
26     The plaintiff submitted that the negligence of Mr Mahmod in this case may be imputed from the following:
(a)   Mr Mahmod had knowingly parked his lorry on the road in contravention of r 91 of the Highway Code;
(b)   Mr Mahmod had parked the lorry on the road instead of on the grass verge;
(c)   the lorry was parked on a dimly lit road with poor visibility; and
(d)   the lorry was parked on the road for the sake of Mr Mahmod’s convenience and its presence there did not arise out of necessity.
27     The defendants submitted that the evidence showed that the accident was caused by the plaintiff’s own negligence because it established the following:
(a)   the plaintiff was a competent cyclist and regularly cycled in the Sungei Tengah area;
(b)   the plaintiff had a clear, unobstructed view of Sungei Tengah Road when she was cycling down the lane to make the right turn at the junction;
(c)   the plaintiff was riding too fast in the circumstances and failed to stop at the white stop line at the bottom of the lane; and
(d)   the plaintiff sustained severe injuries during the accident because she was riding too fast and therefore there was a great impact when she collided with the lorry.
28     Counsel further submitted that whilst Mr Mahmod had paid a composition fine for the traffic offence of parking opposite a continuous white line, the said traffic offence was irrelevant in establishing his liability for the accident. The charge was one that was established once it was shown that Mr Mahmod had parked opposite a continuous white line and it was not a necessary ingredient of the charge that the parking of the lorry in the position Mr Mahmod left it should have posed a danger to other road users. This requirement would have been relevant if Mr Mahmod had been charged under s 122 of the Road Traffic Road (Cap 276) which makes it an offence to leave a vehicle on a public road in such a position as to be likely to cause danger, obstruction or undue inconvenience to other users of the road. In this case, the evidence showed that the lorry in its parked position did not pose a danger to road users coming down the lane.
29     Counsel for the defendants relied on the English Court of Appeal decision of 
Dymond v Pearce
 
[1972] 1 QB 496
 (“
Dymond
”) to support his contention that Mr Mahmod was not liable for the plaintiff’s accident.
30     In that case, a lorry driver had parked his lorry on the highway overnight. The road was divided into two carriageways, each 24 feet wide; it had street lighting and was subject to a 30 m.p.h. speed limit. The lorry, 7½ feet wide, was parked with its lights on beneath a street lamp and was visible for some 200 yards when at 9.45pm, a motorcyclist with the plaintiff riding as pillion, collided into the back of the lorry, causing the plaintiff to be injured. The plaintiff brought an action in both negligence and nuisance against the lorry owners and driver on the basis 
inter alia
 that the parked lorry was a hazard to road users. The trial judge found that the sole cause of the accident was the negligence of the motorcyclist in the circumstances presented and that the lorry owners and driver had not been negligent. The plaintiff appealed but his appeal was dismissed.
31     Sachs L.J. said at p 500:
So far as negligence is concerned, it is sufficient to say that the finding of the judge in favour of the defendants was right. To park a lorry, even of the size of the one under consideration, under a good street lamp on a one-way carriage track 24 feet wide with its tail lights on at the appropriate time cannot be said to be negligent, at any rate when there was no evidence of difficulties likely to be caused to traffic (the traffic was said to be light at the relevant times), or as to the risk of heavy mist or fog supervening. Moreover, the lorry was parked in that position on a bend which is the more likely to be clear of other vehicles pursuing a normal course.
32     Edmund Davies L.J., another member of the bench in 
Dymond
 in dealing with the claim in nuisance, said at p 504:
Where a vehicle has been left parked on a highway for such a length of time or in such other circumstances as constitute it an obstruction amounting to a public nuisance, I remain of the view I expressed in 
Parish v Judd
 
[1960] 1 W.L.R. 867
 that, in order that a plaintiff in such proceedings as the present may recover compensation for personal injuries caused by a collision with that obstruction, he must establish that the obstruction constituted a danger.
33     Counsel for the defendant submitted that the facts of 
Dymond
 are very similar to the present case. The salient facts common to both cases are as follows:
(a)   the accident happened around the same time at night;
(b)   the respective roads in both cases were wide and the parked lorries occupied less than half of the width of the respective lanes;
(c)   the street lamps in both cases were lit along the respective roads and in working condition;
(d)   in 
Dymond
, the lorry was parked immediately beneath a street lamp whilst in the present case, it is the defendants’ evidence that Mr Mahmod parked the motor lorry under or near a street lamp;
(e)   the weather condition was fine and visibility was good at the material time of the accident; and
(f)   in both cases, there was nothing to obstruct road users’ view of the parked lorries.
34     Counsel acknowledged that there was a difference between 
Dymond
 and the present case in that in 
Dymond
, the driver had left the taillights of the parked lorry switched on while Mr Mahmod had admitted during cross-examination that he did not switch on the hazard lights when he parked his lorry along the opposite left lane of Sungei Tengah Road. He submitted, however, that this difference was not material because both Ms Lee and Ms Lian had testified during the trial that they were able to see the parked vehicles along the opposite left lane of Sungei Tengah Road before they reached the bottom of the lane and made the right turn at the junction. Hence, visibility was good in the present case even without Mr Mahmod switching on the hazard lights of his lorry.
35     Based on the principles enunciated in 
Dymond
, counsel submitted that the plaintiff here had to establish the nexus between the parked lorry here being an obstruction and the accident in that the plaintiff had to establish that this obstruction caused the accident as the parked lorry constituted a danger to road users.
36     The defendants submitted that throughout the course of the trial, the plaintiff had not established, either through the evidence of her own witnesses or the evidence of the defendants, that the act of Mr Mahmod parking his lorry along the opposite left lane of Sungei Tengah Road had caused an obstruction such that it constituted a danger to road users. She had also not established that the injuries that she had suffered as a result of the accident were a foreseeable consequence of Mr Mahmod’s act of parking the lorry where he had. On the contrary, the evidence of the plaintiff’s witnesses showed that that particular stretch of Sungei Tengah Road was sufficiently lit and parked vehicles along the said road were clearly visible to all road users, including the plaintiff which necessitated the conclusion that the accident, though unfortunate, was not foreseeable. The defendants submitted that if the plaintiff had slowed down and/or stopped at the white stop line at the bottom of the slope and/or kept a proper lookout, the accident could have been avoided.
37     In starting my own analysis, I must first of all emphasise something that is probably obvious to readers of the authorities cited by counsel for both sides in this case and that is how closely each case depends on its own facts. In the two authorities cited by the plaintiff, the motorist who parked on the road was found to bear at least some responsibility for the accident which ensued whilst in the 
Dymond
 case, the parking motorist was completely exonerated. Thus the act of parking on a road cannot be viewed in isolation. The degree of responsibility depends on the surrounding circumstances. In 
Chan Loo Khee v Lai Siew San
 
[1971] 2 MLJ 253
, Ong CJ made the following statement of general principle (at p 254):
If parking a car, however recklessly, so as to cause needless obstruction to other road users, were to be held blameless, merely because other motorists could still have room to pass, 
provided they kept a proper look-out
, then it would appear that the deliberate parking of a car anywhere, even in the middle of the highway, should be considered equally excusable, if not justifiable, regardless of the fact that, by reason of such obstruction, other motorists had come to grief by reason of their not being fully alert. In such cases there should, in my opinion, be proper apportionment of blame, depending on the circumstances. But to exonerate the obstructionist completely – when it is undeniable that, but for the presence of the obstruction, there could not possibly have been an accident – is to ignore the principle of placing the blame fairly on those to be blamed for their acts or omissions. In this age of fast motor transport I think it is the duty of the courts to eschew excessive legalism and to require that every motorist should observe the golden rule of showing due consideration for other road-users, or suffer the consequences of his failure to do so.
That statement was specifically approved by the Privy Council in the case of 
Chop Seng Heng v Thevannasan & Ors
. 
[1975] 2 MLJ 3
 where the Privy Council upheld the trial judge’s apportionment of liability in a case where a lorry owned by the appellants and driven by their employees crashed into the rear of a stationary lorry owned by the second respondents which was in charge of their employee. The employee had parked it along a winding road in the middle of the night but it was a fairly wide road and the trial judge had found that there was ample room for an overtaking vehicle to have passed it in safety. Notwithstanding this, he held the respondents to be 75% liable for the accident because he found it more probable than not that the accident occurred because the lorry had been parked 30ft from the exit of a blind left-hand bend.
38     My most important task, therefore, is to find the facts. In my judgment, the evidence supports the following findings:
(a)   that the lamp posts along Sungei Tengah Road were in working order on the night of 13 October 2006 and provided sufficient light for any road user approaching the junction of the lane and Sungei Tengah Road to see the parked lorries along the road;
(b)   notwithstanding the lamp posts, the lighting was somewhat dim because of the presence of many trees along Sungei Tengah Road in the vicinity of the junction and therefore from further up the lane, it may not have been possible to make out individual lorries although parked objects would have been visible;
(c)   the lane had a fairly steep gradient downwards and there was a stop line at the end of the lane at which road users turning from the lane into Sungei Tengah Road were supposed to stop before proceeding with the turn;
(d)   the plaintiff did not stop at the stop line. She must have been travelling fairly fast and she lost control of her bicycle as she made the turn;
(e)   the plaintiff was familiar with the area where the accident occurred;
(f)   it was not unusual at the time of the accident for lorries and other vehicles to be parked along Sungei Tengah Road although such parking was against the road traffic rules;
(g)   contrary to the second defendant’s assertion in his affidavit, the lorry was not parked closer to the Chengtai Nursery, instead, it was parked in the vicinity of lamp post 117 which was situated fairly close to the junction of the lane and Sungei Tengah Road;
(h)   the second defendant did not put on any hazard lights as he thought this was not necessary since he was parked in between other vehicles;
(i)   although Sungei Tengah Road had two lanes of traffic on either side of the continuous white line and the lorry occupied slightly less than half of one lane, the result of the positioning of the lorry near the junction with the lane was that it restricted the space available for persons who were turning right into Sungei Tengah Road from the lane; and
(j)   the presence of the lorry therefore posed a danger to persons who, travelling down the lane, approached the junction at night.
39     In my judgment, both the plaintiff and the first defendant were to blame for the accident. The first defendant did not pay enough attention to the positioning of the lorry in relation to the junction and was careless in the way that he parked it. He realised this subsequently and that was why he admitted in court that the way that he had parked it had posed a danger to other road users. The difference between the present case and 
Dymond
’s case was not only the absence of the hazard lights but also the fact that in 
Dymond
’s case, the court found that there was no evidence that there were difficulties likely to be caused to traffic by the manner in which the lorry was parked. That was not the case here in relation to traffic turning right into Sungei Tengah Road.
40     I should say that I accept the evidence of the plaintiff’s friends and find that they understood the questions and responded honestly to them. I do not accept the submission that because of their youth, they did not understand what they were being asked. I was satisfied that when they did not understand questions, they indicated as such and the questions were then explained to them. Ms Lee in particular impressed me. She admitted without equivocation to matters that were not in favour of the plaintiff but at the same time she was also able to give a clear picture of the situation on the road caused by the presence of the lorry.
41     I find that the plaintiff must shoulder a greater degree of blame for the accident in that she did not pay enough attention to the presence of the lorries and did not slow down or stop prior to making the turn into Sungei Tengah Road. That caused her to lose control of her bicycle and to hit the lorry. She must have seen the lorry, despite the dim lighting, as she approached the junction but she did not pay sufficient heed to its presence. She too was negligent and bearing in mind that despite the obstruction of the lorry, her friends were able to negotiate the turn safely albeit with some difficulty, I consider her to bear the larger share of the blame for the accident.
42     In the circumstances, I apportion the liability of the parties as follows: two-thirds to the plaintiff and one-third to the defendants. I therefore enter interlocutory judgment for the plaintiff for damages to be assessed on the basis that she will be entitled to recover one-third of the damages so assessed. The question of costs is also to be determined at the assessment.",2009-04-20 00:00:00,SG High Court

1       The first defendant (“Ting”) is the arbitrator in arbitration proceedings between the plaintiffs and the second defendant (“the Contractor”) and has written an arbitration award (“the Award”), although to date it has not been collected by either side. On 24 September 2008, the plaintiffs took out this originating summons for an order, 
inter alia
, to set aside the Award and refer any outstanding disputes with the Contractor to the courts for resolution. On 31 October 2008, the plaintiffs filed Summons No 4814 of 2008 (“the Summons”) with the following prayers:
1)    pursuant to the Rules of Court Order 4 Rule 1, the matters pending in Originating Summons OS1231/2008/W 
AND
 Originating Summons OS1807/2006/S 
AND
 Suit 348/2006/M be consolidated on such terms as the Honourable Court thinks just;
2)    any other directions which the Honourable Court deems fit and just in respect of and/or arising from the consolidation of the aforementioned three pending matters so as to ensure the economic, expeditious, fair and just resolution of all the pending matters;
3)    pursuant to the Rules of Court Order 28 Rule 8 and Order 5 Rules 2 and 4 the Originating Summons OS1231/2008/W be converted into a Writ of Summons and the proceedings should be continued as if the matter had been begun by Writ;
4)    any other directions which the Honourable Court deems fit and just in respect of and/or arising from the conversion of OS1231/2008/W into a Writ of Summons including but not limited to the requirements under Order 25 Rules 2 to 7;
5)    that the Police and/or the Commercial Affairs Dept (CAD) and/or any other appropriate Investigating Authority be directed to:
a)    speedily complete their investigations into Magistrate’s Complaint Nos COM-002184-04 (CM-002943-04), COM-001081-04 (CM002436-04) and MAG-000262-05/C (CM-002282-05) and to 
furnish their comprehensive report to this Court
 together with full details of the names, particulars (including NRIC No and address) and nationality of parties named and/or identified in the report(s) and/or photographs;
b)    speedily investigate
i)    all allegations of fraud, fraudulent claims and cheating, falsification of bills and/or receipts made against the 1st and 2nd Defendants and/or their agents and/or staff and/or servants;
ii)    all allegations of criminal negligence due to loss of documents and/or any other evidence caused by and/or resulting from the actions/omission of the 1st Defendant
And to submit their Report urgently and directly to this Honourable Court;
6)    any other relief and/or remedies as the Honourable Court deems fit and just;
7)    Costs.
2       The plaintiffs, who were unrepresented, and counsel for the defendants appeared before me on 19 January 2009 solely for the purpose of prayer 5 of the Summons. After hearing the submissions of the plaintiffs and counsel for the defendants, I declined to make the order prayed for in prayer 5. I informed the plaintiffs that criminal complaints are investigated by the police and if any criminal offence is disclosed as a result of such investigation, the matter is referred to the Public Prosecutor who decides whether an offence is made out and if so, whether to prosecute the offender. While a judge may refer criminal complaints to the police for investigation, he has no power to order them to conduct an investigation if they decide not to do so, or to speed up any investigation. I would add that even if I had such power, in the circumstances of this case, in particular the fact that there was no connection between the events complained of in the three Magistrate’s complaints referred to in prayer 5 of the Summons and the dispute in this originating summons or any of the related cases, 
viz
 Originating Summons No 1807 of 2006 and Suit No 348 of 2006, I would not be inclined to exercise such discretion to make those orders.
3       As the plaintiffs have failed in this application, I ordered the plaintiffs to pay costs to the defendants, which are to be taxed.",2009-03-25 00:00:00,SG High Court

Choo Han Teck J:
1       The appellant was convicted of two charges of cheating, an offence punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) and seven charges of attempted cheating, punishable under s 420 read with s 511 of the Penal Code, at the end of a trial. She was sentenced to a total of ten months’ imprisonment. She appealed against her conviction and sentence.
2       The background facts can be found in the grounds of decision of the District Judge, 
viz
, 
PP v Lim Chin Yen
 
[2008] SGDC 339
. The appellant was accused of cheating a Statutory Board, 
viz
, the Standards, Productivity and Innovation Board (SPRING Singapore). SPRING Singapore administered a scheme, that is the Local Enterprise Technical Assistance Scheme (LETAS), in which small and medium enterprises could obtain, from SPRING Singapore, up to 50% of the cost of a consultancy project. In order to be eligible for the LETAS grant, an application had to be submitted to SPRING Singapore for its approval of the project to be carried out. In this application, the applicant and the consultant would provide information about the company, the objectives and duration of the project and the consultancy fees involved. Both the applicant and the consultant would have to declare that the facts and information provided in the application were true. If the proposed project was approved, SPRING Singapore would inform the applicant and the consultant of the amount of money that could be claimed by the applicant for the project. Before a claim could be made, the project would have to be completed and the applicant would have to make full payment to the consultant. The applicant would also have to submit a claim form that had to be accompanied by a report prepared by the consultant company, setting out what was done and achieved under the project, with supporting documentation evidencing full payment. To prevent over-declaration of the cost of the project in order to obtain a higher grant, the applicant and the consultant were required to declare in the claim form that the consultant company did not and would not be giving any refund or rebate to the applicant for the project.
3       The appellant was the sole proprietor of Review Communications. She was also a director and shareholder of MediaBank Asia Pte Ltd (“MediaBank”). Both Review Communications and Mediabank share the same premises. The nine charges relate to applications for the LETAS grant by nine different applicants. Review Communications was the consultant company in all these cases. In eight of the charges, the appellant was accused of making false declarations, stating that the project in question had been completed, overstating the scope of the project in question, and declaring that no refund of any moneys had been made. In relation to the remaining charge, she falsely declared that she had not refunded any money to the applicant.
4       The evidence relating to each of the cheating charges showed a common 
modus operandi
. The appellant or an employee of Review Communications and Mediabank, one Johnny, would tell the applicants about the LETAS grant and would inform them that they would be able to have websites built or upgraded for free or at a small fee. The applicants were told that they need not pay anything, or at most, a small fee, as they would only be required to pay over the LETAS grant disbursed by SPRING Singapore as payment. The project proposals submitted to SPRING Singapore in support of the applications were exaggerated so as to justify a higher project cost. An inflated project cost was reported to SPRING Singapore in all the applications. All the projects were said to cost $22,000, regardless of the size and nature of the applicant’s business. Based on the reported cost, a grant of over $9,000 was approved in each case. Following the approval of the grant, the Appellant would send a quotation for the grant sum to the applicant in question from Mediabank for services which overlapped in scope with the project purportedly undertaken by Review Communications for which the grant was given. This was the basis for the later transfer of the grant sum to Mediabank. In the meantime, the applicant was asked to pay Review Communications the sum of $22,000. Once that was done, the Appellant would refund either the whole of the $22,000 or $22,000 less a small payment or deposit to the applicant by way of cheques from Mediabank or personal cheques from the appellant. The refund was disguised as payment by Mediabank to the applicant in question for either Mediabank’s web banner being placed on the applicant’s website, or for a recycling project, or as a refund for the cancellation of an exhibition. All of the applicants testified that the $22,000 from Mediabank was meant to be a refund of the same amount that they had paid to Review Communications for the purpose of obtaining the LETAS grant.
5       The evidence established clearly the 
actus reus
 required for the offence of cheating. That said, the remaining issue would be whether the requisite 
mens rea
, of dishonesty, was present. In this respect, there was nothing to refute the clear inference to be drawn from the acts of the appellant, namely, that she had intended to cause SPRING Singapore to pay out various sums of money under the LETAS scheme which it would not otherwise have done. Counsel for the appellant, Mr Gwee, attempted to portray the appellant as a simple-minded person who had no intention to commit the offence of cheating. The objective facts indicate otherwise; in particular, the complex 
modus operandi
. The appellant had clearly intended to manipulate the system in an illegitimate way. There was thus no basis for me to interfere with the conviction.
6       Having regard to sentencing precedents, the elaborate nature of the scheme, the significant role of the appellant, and the various mitigating factors, I am of the opinion that the sentence imposed by the District Judge was not manifestly excessive.
7       For the above reasons, the appeal is dismissed.",2009-04-03 00:00:00,SG High Court

Choo Han Teck J:
1       The first and second accused were described as members of a “motorcycle” gang known as the “Onyx”. All that can be presumed and notice taken of the common description of a “motorcycle gang” is that they are groups of people, not restricted to males, who ride about in groups on their motorcycles. They often give themselves names, such as “Onyx”, but it cannot be said that all motorcycle gangs have violence or gangsterism as their object; some gather for the thrill of riding. In the present case, members of the Onyx gang gathered on the evening of 16 September 2006 near midnight with the common object of assaulting members of another motorcycle gang known as the “Alif” whose members had recently assaulted an Onyx member. At least 17 members of the Onyx eventually gathered in the vicinity of Magazine Road. Shortly after midnight, when the second accused was at Magazine Road, he was told by a gang member that one Zainal Bin Nek (“Zainal”) was spotted near Central Square, near Havelock Road. Onyx members believed that Zainal was the deputy leader of another motorcycle gang called “Blackjack” which, according to the Statement of Facts, “had ties” with the “Alif” gang. It was not clear what the nature of that relationship between “Blackjack” and “Alif” was – that is always a problem with idiomatic phrases, such as “had ties” – but it was not crucial in this case for the court to know the nature of the relationship between the Alif and Blackjack gangs.
2       When he was told that Zainal was at Central Square, the second accused instructed his gang to go and search for Zainal. The second accused and three others did not join in the hunt nor did they take part in the assault by the Onyx gang on Zainal. Zainal was stabbed and eventually died. Six members of the gang pleaded guilty and were sentenced on 17 October 2007. Of the four who did not participate in the attack, the second accused was the only one charged. He pleaded guilty to this charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, a charge under s 304 (a) read with s 149 of the Penal Code, Cap 224. He was also charged with an unrelated incident of assault which took place on 15 April 2007. This was a charge under s 324 of the Penal Code. He pleaded guilty to both charges.
3       The first accused was similarly charged for culpable homicide not amounting to murder in respect of Zainal’s death. He also pleaded guilty to the charge. The first and second accused persons were also charged for being members of an unlawful assembly and causing hurt to Zainal in respect of the same incident. These charges were taken into account for the purposes of sentencing. The first accused was 19 years old at the time of the assault. He was the second youngest of the members who had been charged. One Khairul Iskandar was a year older. Khairul was sentenced to seven years imprisonment and six strokes of the cane in the previous proceedings before this court. The others were sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane except for one Mohamed Hishamadi who was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane on account of his being the oldest of the group and the instigator of the actual assault.
4       In a case such as the present where many accused persons were involved, the court had to maintain a consistency of sentences without ignoring or overemphasizing the individual circumstances of each offender. Hence, the differences may not be as great as might be expected by the accused or the prosecutor. The first accused in the present proceedings was younger than Khairul but his participation was more violent. On the other hand, the second accused was not present at the assault but he had the same common object and appeared to be one of the senior members of the gang. Taking all these factors into account, I was of the opinion that the first and second accused persons before me in these proceedings should be given sentences that are close to those imposed on the six others in the previous proceedings. The first accused was thus sentenced to nine years imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane; and the second accused was sentenced to eight years imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane in respect of the homicide charge, and 12 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane in respect of the charge for causing hurt. Since they were totally unrelated offences and since I also took into account the overall terms of imprisonment, I ordered the two terms of imprisonment to run consecutively.
5       The DPP submitted that a sentence of corrective training might be an appropriate sentence in respect of the second accused. The conditions required to be satisfied under s 12(1) of the Criminal procedure Code, Cap 68 are that the charge for which the accused is being sentenced was one that was punishable with imprisonment of up to two years and the accused must also have, since attaining the age of 16, been convicted of two offences punishable with imprisonment of at least two years. The DPP produced a memorandum of previous convictions which showed that the second accused was convicted in 2002 and 2003 of an offence under s 427 of the Penal Code (for committing mischief) and also for an offence under s 506 of the Penal Code for criminal intimidation. An offence under s 427 as well as s 506 is punishable with imprisonment of up to two years. The DPP sought to persuade me that the second accused had other offences related to violence which were punishable with more than two years imprisonment. These were not in evidence so I do not think that they should be taken into account. The DPP submitted that the requirement to produce the memorandum of previous convictions was only a “technical requirement”. Insofar as the appropriate previous convictions were concerned, they were not just a matter of a “technical” requirement. It was, as Mr Pereira, counsel for the second accused, pointed out, a legal requirement. It was a condition imposed by law. Further, in addition to those conditions, the court may impose an order for corrective training of not less than five and not more than 14 years of corrective training, only if it were satisfied that “it is expedient with a view to [the accused person’s] reformation and prevention of crime that he should receive training of a corrective character”. In the present case, given the overall circumstances and what appeared to me to be sufficient and sincere remorse, I was of the opinion that a sentence of corrective training was not necessary.",2009-03-30 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judith Prakash J:
Background
1       This is the first of two actions that the plaintiff, Orix Leasing Singapore Limited, commenced in this court to recover damages for conversion. The other is Suit 740 of 2006 (“suit 740”).
2       The plaintiff carries on the business of providing leasing and hire purchase services and, in this connection, purchases heavy machines to lease out to its customers. Among these customers in 2005 was a company named Rav Graphic Pte Ltd (“RGPL”) which had two directors and shareholders, Tan Kim Seng Crispian (“Crispian Tan”) and Ms Tan Soi Ngoh. On 25 August 2005, RGPL entered into an agreement to take a printing machine on hire purchase from the plaintiff 
viz
 one Mitsubishi 4-Colour Sheetfed Offset Press (the “Mitsubishi 4C”). At that time RGPL already had hire purchase agreements with the plaintiff in respect of two other machines, namely a Heidelberg Four-Colour Press Machine (the “Heidelberg 4C”) which is the subject matter of suit 740 and a Mitsubishi 5-Colour Sheetfed Offset Press (the “Mitsubishi 5C”).
3       Sometime in September 2006, the plaintiff discovered that the Mitsubishi 4C, together with the two other machines, had been removed from RGPL’s premises without the plaintiff’s prior consent or knowledge. The plaintiff then engaged a private investigator to investigate the matter and to trace the whereabouts of the machines with a view to recovering all of them.
4       In the meantime, RGPL had defaulted in meeting its obligations under the three hire purchase agreements. The plaintiff therefore commenced Suit 645 of 2006/T against RGPL and its two directors seeking recovery against the company under the hire purchase agreements and against the two directors under the personal guarantees that the latter had provided in respect of RGPL’s obligations. The plaintiff claimed approximately $3.65 million in this suit. Judgment was obtained against the two directors on 7 November 2006. However, RGPL itself was put into liquidation before judgment was entered against it by the plaintiff. The plaintiff filed a proof of debt in RGPL’s liquidation. The two directors were subsequently made bankrupt by other creditors and the plaintiff’s judgment against them was not satisfied. The plaintiff had not recovered any amount in respect of the three machines when it started the present action.
5       The investigator reported to the plaintiff that the three machines had been unlawfully sold by RGPL and also obtained certain information regarding the transportation of the machines from RGPL’s premises and the persons who had bought them. Despite further efforts being made, including commencing legal action in Malaysia, the plaintiff was unable to recover any of the machines.
6       This action was commenced on 8 November 2006 against four defendants. The original statement of claim alleged that sometime in March 2006, the first defendant Mr Koh Mui Hoe (“Mr Koh”) acting on his own or as a director of the second defendant, Ink Trading Pte Ltd (“ITPL”), unlawfully caused the Mitsubishi 4C to be removed from RGPL’s premises by arranging with the third defendant, Kenzone Logistics Pte Ltd, and/or the fourth defendant, Kim Heng Mechanic, to do so. It was further pleaded that the third defendant and/or the fourth defendant then proceeded to remove the machines from RGPL’s premises and to deliver the same to persons unknown. In the premises, the plaintiff asserted, all four defendants had converted the Mitsubishi 4C to their own use.
7       By the time this suit came on for trial, the action against the fourth defendant had been discontinued. The claim against the third defendant was discontinued at an early stage of the trial and, thereafter, the trial proceeded only against Mr Koh and ITPL. Thus, when hereafter in this judgment I refer to “the defendants” collectively, I should be understood as referring only to the first and second defendants.
8       On the morning of the second day of the trial, the plaintiff applied for and obtained leave to amend its statement of claim to remove the allegation that Mr Koh and ITPL had made arrangements with the third and fourth defendants to remove the Mitsubishi 4C from RGPL’s premises. Instead the plaintiff averred that Mr Koh and ITPL had caused the machine to be dismantled in RGPL’s premises and sold to a Taiwanese buyer whose identity was unknown to the plaintiff.
9       This action was heard before me at the same time as I heard suit 740. The witnesses who appeared in this action also testified in suit 740 except for the witnesses for the fourth defendant in suit 740 as that party was not a party to this action. However, by an order of court made on 15 November 2007, the parties were given leave to use the evidence adduced in suit 740 for the present action and 
vice versa.
The issues
10     The defence filed by Mr Koh and ITPL was a total denial. They denied that they had anything to do with the removal of the Mitsubishi 4C from RGPL’s premises.
11     In its closing submissions, the plaintiff submitted that the two principal issues before the court arising from the pleadings and the evidence were as follows:
(i)     Whether, as a matter of fact, the Mitsubishi 4C was sold to a Malaysian buyer named Mr Mani, as alleged by Crispian Tan, or, as alleged by the plaintiff, to the defendants, alternatively, to a Taiwanese buyer through them.
(ii)    If the machine was sold to Mr Koh or to a Taiwanese buyer through the defendants, whether, as a matter of law, Mr Koh’s conduct, either by buying the Mitsubishi 4C directly from RGPL or acting as a middleman to facilitate the sale of the machine by RGPL to the Taiwanese buyer, amounted to conversion on the part of the defendants.
12     The defendants did not disagree with the formulation of the issues.
The evidence
For the plaintiff
13     There were five witnesses for the plaintiff but it is not necessary to summarise the evidence of all of them. The chief witness on the matters that had occurred at RGPL was Chua Soo Meng, a former employee of RGPL. Mr Chua testified that he was employed as a production supervisor by RGPL from 2003 to 2006. He stated that he was working for RGPL at the time the Mitsubishi 4C and the Heidelberg 4C were removed from RGPL’s premises in March 2006 and August 2006 respectively.
14     Mr Chua was the person who gave the plaintiff’s investigator information about the loss of the machines. When he was first asked to prepare an affidavit of evidence in chief in support of the plaintiff’s case, he refused because he did not want the hassle of having to give evidence in court. Subsequently, after he was served with two subpoenas, one for this action and the other for suit 740, Mr Chua decided to affirm an affidavit since he had to give evidence in any case. His affidavit therefore covered matters at issue in both actions. For the purposes of the present judgment, I will summarise his evidence in relation to the Mitsubishi 4C and will only refer to his evidence in relation to the other machines where relevant.
15     Mr Chua stated that the Mitsubishi 4C was purchased by RGPL sometime in 2005. He recalled that the Mitsubishi 4C was sold to one “Jimmy Koh” (
ie
 the first defendant) from ITPL and was dismantled in early March 2006. He remembered that on the day the machine was dismantled, four Malaysian Chinese men went to RGPL’s premises to dismantle the machine. They started to dismantle the Mitsubishi 4C at about 7am. It should be noted here that, in court, Mr Chua corrected his statement that the Mitsubishi 4C had been sold to Mr Koh. He said that he was not sure whether Mr Koh was the purchaser or the middleman for the sale of the machine.
16     After the machine had been dismantled, about eight to ten local Chinese men loaded the components into two forty-foot containers. Mr Chua remembered that a crane had been used to lift the components into the containers but he could not remember who the crane belonged to. At that time, RGPL’s premises were located in a building called Quek Industrial Building in Toh Guan Road East. After the first container was fully loaded, it was transported out of Quek Industrial Building at night by a prime mover which also brought the other container to the premises for loading. He recalled that the second container was also transported out of RGPL's premises at night. He was not aware of who the trailers or prime movers belonged to.
17     Mr Chua clearly remembered that Mr Koh was at RGPL's premises on both days to oversee the dismantling of the machines. Mr Koh was known to Mr Chua from past dealings that the two men had had. As far as Mr Chua knew, Mr Koh was in the business of buying and selling second-hand printing and printing-related machines. Mr Koh’s Taiwanese buyer, whom Mr Chua was not formally introduced to, was also there on both days. According to the Taiwanese buyer, the machine was to be transported to Malaysia before being shipped to Taiwan.
18     Mr Chua wished to clarify that when he was interviewed by the private investigator, Henry Tay, he had told Mr Tay that the third defendant was involved in the dismantling of the machines. Mr Chua said that he had been mistaken in saying this. The third defendant, as far as he could recall, had been involved in the installation of the Mitsubishi 4C, not its dismantling.
19     Mr Chua also stated that the Mitsubishi 5C was dismantled in mid-May 2006. As far as Mr Chua was aware, it was sold to an Indian buyer through a man named S Mani from a company called Newtrend Machinery Services (M) Sdn Bhd.
For the defendants
20     Mr Koh filed an affidavit of evidence-in-chief in suit 740 in which he gave evidence for both actions. He stated that he was the managing director of ITPL which was a company in the business of trading in printing equipment and consumables. He first met Crispian Tan when the latter responded to advertising brochures that ITPL had sent out to printers in Singapore.
21     In February or March 2006, at Crispian Tan’s request, Mr Koh attended at the latter’s office on the ground floor of Quek Industrial Building for the purpose of viewing a cutting machine that RGPL wanted to dispose of. On his arrival, Crispian Tan introduced Mr Koh to Mr Chua. Mr Chua then took Mr Koh to see the machine which he then ascertained to be a Polar 137 EMC cutter. Subsequently Mr Koh told Crispian Tan over the phone that ITPL did not have any prospective buyers for a cutter of that size. Notwithstanding this, Mr Koh went on to notify some of his customers about the availability of the Polar 137 EMC cutter. As a result, in May 2006, Mr Koh received queries from his customers regarding the technical specifications of the machine. As ITPL did not possess this information, Mr Koh contacted Crispian Tan who told him that he could inspect the machine and gather the information himself.
22     In May 2006, Mr Koh went to RGPL's premises again to examine the Polar 137 EMC cutter and to take photographs of it. Thereafter, however, no offers were received from any of ITPL’s customers and this matter did not proceed.
23     On 27 July 2006, Crispian Tan contacted Mr Koh to let him know that RGPL had a CTF (
ie
 computer to film) Online image setting machine for sale. Mr Koh went immediately to RGPL's premises to view this CTF machine. Again Crispian Tan instructed Mr Chua to show the machine to Mr Koh. Mr Koh noticed that the CTF machine had been dismantled and shrink-wrapped. He took some photographs of it and left as he could not inspect it in its wrapping. Crispian Tan subsequently informed Mr Koh that the CTF machine would be sold for $85,000 but Mr Koh thought this price was too steep.
24     Subsequently, one of ITPL’s customers and Mr Koh went down to RGPL's premises on a few occasions to check on certain technical specifications of the CTF machine but in the end no sale eventuated because of the price demanded by RGPL.
25     The next contact was on 29 August 2006 when Mr Koh learnt from Crispian Tan that RGPL was selling its forklift (stacker), plate maker, plate processor, scanner and some light tables. That evening Mr Koh went down to RGPL’s premises to inspect and photographed some of these machines. He then had some negotiations with Crispian Tan who wanted to sell all the machines to IPTL in one lot. Mr Koh was not sure however whether IPTL needed the plate maker and the plate processor. Two days later, on 31 August 2006, Mr Koh went down to RGPL's premises to inspect these machines again. He decided not to buy the plate maker and the plate processor and, after some negotiations, Crispian Tan agreed to sell the forklift and the scanner to IPTL at the price of $2,000 on condition that payment would have to be made in cash and delivery taken by 1 September 2006.
26     On the morning of 1 September 2006 Mr Koh went to RGPL's premises and paid $2,000 to Crispian Tan personally. There were a lot of workers moving machinery, furniture and office equipment. As Crispian Tan was so busy, Mr Koh did not ask him for an official receipt for the $2,000 payment. He told Crispian Tan that he would come back in the evening to transport the two machines.
27     Mr Koh then engaged one Yeo Tian Poh, a lorry driver, to transport the machines that he had bought. Mr Yeo and his lorry arrived at RGPL's premises at about 6pm. Unfortunately they were not able to take the machines that day because the forklift was busy moving other items and Crispian Tan asked him to come back the next day. On 2 September 2006, the forklift and the scanner together with a fibre tank and some light tables which Crispian Tan had given to IPTL on the spur of the moment were loaded onto Mr Yeo’s lorry and taken to ITPL’s premises.
28     The only mention that Mr Koh made in his affidavit of the matters involved in this action and suit 740 was in paragraph 32 where he stated that contrary to the plaintiff’s allegations, neither IPTL nor he were in any way involved or responsible for the removal of the Heidelberg 4C or the Mitsubishi 4C.
Crispian Tan’s evidence
29     Technically, Crispian Tan did not give evidence in this action. He was however called as a witness for the fourth defendant in suit 740 and his evidence there was available for consideration in this action as well.
30     Crispian Tan filed two affidavits of evidence-in-chief. In his first affidavit he first gave an apology to the third and fourth defendants in suit 740 for getting them involved in a legal action brought by the plaintiff. Most of his affidavit dealt with matters relevant to suit 740 rather than to this action. In paragraph 32, however, he stated that sometime in August 2006, he was approached by a male Malaysian of Indian descent who was also responsible for the sale of the Mitsubishi 4C which was the subject of this action. Crispian Tan said that he knew this male Indian only as “Mr Mani”. He also said that just as Mr Mani had previously done, Mr Mani had gone to RGPL’s office in Quek Industrial Building to inspect the Heidelberg 4C. That was all that Crispian Tan said about the matters in issue here.
31     Crispian Tan’s second affidavit was basically a refutation of the evidence given by Mr Chua in the latter’s own affidavit of evidence-in-chief. Most of Crispian Tan’s second affidavit was argumentative rather than factual. Counsel for the plaintiff objected to it and I upheld his objection. Consequently, the second affidavit was not admitted.
The submissions and analysis
Was the machine sold to Mr Mani?
32     The plaintiff pointed out that during cross examination Crispian Tan had admitted that the Mitsubishi 4C belonged to the plaintiff. Therefore, the plaintiff submitted that it was entitled to sue for the conversion of that machine. Crispian Tan had also admitted that he had unlawfully sold the Mitsubishi 4C, allegedly for $700,000, sometime in March 2006. He asserted, however, that the machine was sold to a Malaysian buyer by the name of Mr Mani and not to Mr Koh or IPTL or any purchaser introduced by them.
33     The plaintiff submitted that this was not true. In this connection, it cited the evidence of its credit control manager, Tay Chin Liang also known as Vincent Tay. Vincent Tay had testified that in order to ascertain whether the Mitsubishi 4C was sold to Mr Mani, he contacted Mr Mani on 6 November 2007, using the mobile phone number that was shown on Mr Mani’s calling card which Mr Chua had given to the private investigator Henry Tay. During this telephone conversation, Mr Mani denied that he had bought the Mitsubishi 4C and said that he had only bought the Mitsubishi 5C.
34     On 7 November 2007, Vincent Tay called Mr Mani again, this time from the plaintiff’s lawyer’s office. During the second telephone conversation, Mr Mani again said that he had only bought the Mitsubishi 5C. Mr Mani also told Vincent Tay that he had signed a contract with RGPL for the purchase of the Mitsubishi 5C but had given the contract to the police when he lodged the police report in Singapore regarding the purchase of the machine and that the plaintiff could get a copy of the contract from the police. Thereafter, Vincent Tay tried to get a copy of this contract from the police but the investigating officer refused to give it to him. Vincent Tay also testified that on 6 September 2006, when Crispian Tan had gone to the plaintiff’s office to discuss the missing machines, he told the plaintiff’s staff that he had sold all three of them to a Mr Yusoff of Kuala Lumpur. He did not mention Mr Mani at that time and only identified him as the buyer months later in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief.
35     The plaintiff submitted that the defendants appeared to accept Vincent Tay’s evidence on his telephone conversation with Mr Mani as their counsel did not challenge any of the evidence. It further submitted that Mr Mani’s statements to Vincent Tay were corroborated by Crispian Tan who had confirmed in court that there was a written contract for the sale of the Mitsubishi 5C to Mr Mani. Crispian Tan had not disclosed that contract and had asserted that no written contract was signed for either the Mitsubishi 4C or the Heidelberg 4C, even though both machines were also supposedly sold to Mr Mani because Mr Mani did not asked for any contracts to be signed for those two machines.
36     The plaintiff submitted that there would be no reason for Mr Mani to have insisted on signing the contract for the Mitsubishi 5C and not the Mitsubishi 4C or the Heidelberg 4C if he had bought all three machines. The only logical conclusion to be drawn from the fact that there was only one sale contract and that was in respect of the Mitsubishi 5C, was that Mr Mani only bought the Mitsubishi 5C. Such a conclusion would not only be consistent with what Mr Mani told Vincent Tay over the telephone, but also with Mr Chua’s evidence.
37     The plaintiff further submitted that apart from being obviously implausible and inconsistent with Vincent Tay’s and Mr Chua’s evidence, Crispian Tan’s allegation that the Mitsubishi 4C was sold to Mr Mani should also be rejected simply because Crispian Tan had confessed in court that he was a thief and a dishonest person because he had sold three machines belonging to the plaintiff. Further Crispian Tan’s evidence regarding Mr Mani was not corroborated by Mr Mani himself. Crispian Tan had admitted that although he knew Mr Mani, he did not make any effort to arrange for Mr Mani to testify in this action. The plaintiff submitted that Crispian Tan did not want Mr Mani to attend court because Mr Mani would have exposed his lies.
38     Developing on the above line, the plaintiff also submitted that an adverse inference under s 116 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) should also be drawn against the defendants for failing to call Mr Mani as a witness. Mr Mani was an extremely important witness for the defendants because if he confirmed he bought the Mitsubishi 4C, the defendants would be completely exonerated. I should say immediately that I cannot accept this submission regarding the adverse inference. Illustration (g) of s 116 states that the court may presume that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it. It can be seen therefore that before an adverse inference can be drawn regarding the non-production of a witness there would have to be evidence that that witness could have been produced by the party against whom the inference is to be drawn. There was no evidence in this case that the defendants had any control over Mr Mani so that they could be held responsible for not producing him. In fact the reverse was the case. The plaintiff’s own evidence showed that Mr Mani is a Malaysian citizen resident in Malaysia and not amenable to the jurisdiction of this court. It also showed that Mr Mani was annoyed with Crispian Tan in that he had lodged a police report regarding the purchase of the Mitsubishi 5C. He was unlikely to want to assist Crispian Tan or those whom Crispian Tan was assisting.
39     In their closing submissions, the defendants reiterated that their position was that they were never involved in the sale of the Mitsubishi 4C and had no knowledge of how it was sold or disposed of. They, therefore, did not suggest that it was sold to Mr Mani whether in their defence, cross examination or evidence-in-chief. They contended that the plaintiff’s submissions concerning whether the Mitsubishi 4C was sold to Mr Mani were not relevant to the issue at hand. They also disagreed that any adverse inference should be drawn against them for not calling Mr Mani as a witness since it was not their case that the machine was sold to Mr Mani.
40     Despite the position taken by the defendants, I do need to consider whether there was credible evidence that the Mitsubishi 4C was sold to Mr Mani as such evidence would have an impact on the plaintiff’s ability to prove that it was the first and second defendants who were instrumental in the loss of that machine. Having considered the evidence and the submissions, I find that there was no credible evidence that the Mitsubishi 4C was sold to Mr Mani. The only person who made this assertion was Crispian Tan and it is difficult to believe his uncorroborated statement. Not only did Crispian Tan act dishonestly in this whole transaction, he also was not a forthright and truthful witness. Bearing in mind that he had already been found liable to the plaintiff under his guarantee, there was no reason for Crispian Tan not to tell the truth and assist the plaintiff in recovering its machines. He, however, did not give evidence in a forthright manner. Instead he was often vague and evasive. While admitting that he had stolen the machines from the plaintiff, he was not willing to lay his cards on the table and disclose exactly how he had done so and who had helped him apart from Mr Mani, a man who was conveniently out of the jurisdiction and the reach of the court. In the course of cross-examination, it was apparent to me on many occasions that Crispian Tan was not telling the truth. Though he resisted doing so, at times even he had to admit that he had not been truthful on certain points.
Were the defendants involved in the removal of the Mitsubishi 4C?
41     In making its case against the defendants, the plaintiff relied heavily on the evidence of Mr Chua. It repeated what Mr Chua had said in his affidavit and in cross examination and emphasised the following evidence given by Mr Chua:
i.       Sometime in March 2006, Crispian Tan told Mr Chua that some buyers would be taking the Mitsubishi 4C and asked him to attend to the handing over the machine. The next day Mr Koh accompanied by another man came to RGPL’s premises and Crispian Tan instructed Mr Chua to hand over the Mitsubishi 4C to them.
ii.      The dismantling of the Mitsubishi 4C took two days and two nights and both Mr Koh and the other man were present at RGPL's premises on both days to supervise this operation, at times even giving instructions to the workers who were dismantling the machine.
iii.     During these two days, Mr Chua found out from his conversations with the other man that he was from Taiwan and that he had bought the Mitsubishi 4C with the intention of sending it to Taiwan.
iv.     After the dismantling had been completed, Mr Chua had personally handed over the machine and some spare parts which the Taiwanese buyer wanted to Mr Koh and the Taiwanese buyer who then transported the machine out of the premises.
42     The plaintiff further submitted that Mr Koh’s denial of the truth of Mr Chua’s evidence should not be accepted. Mr Koh had admitted meeting Crispian Tan in February or March 2006 but asserted that Crispian Tan had offered to sell him a second hand cutter only. Pointing out that Mr Koh had admitted that he had been dealing in second hand printing machines since 2002 or 2003, and since Crispian Tan had already decided to sell the Mitsubishi 4C, the plaintiff submitted that it was impossible that Crispian Tan would have offered only to sell a relatively cheap machine like the cutter to Mr Koh and not the significantly more expensive Mitsubishi 4C as well.
43     Turning to the evidence of Mr Koh, the plaintiff noted that according to Mr Koh, when he went to inspect the cutter at RGPL’s premises in February or March 2006, it was Mr Chua who showed him the cutter. During this inspection, Mr Chua had told him about technical problems that RGPL was facing with the two Mitsubishi machines. If that was in fact the case, the plaintiff submitted that it would have been uncharacteristic for Mr Chua to mention the Mitsubishi machines unless Mr Koh had asked specifically about them. The plaintiff added that Mr Koh would not have asked about the Mitsubishi machines unless he knew that one or both of the machines were for sale and that he was interested in buying either or both of them.
44     The plaintiff pointed out the following areas where it considered that Mr Koh had given untrue evidence:
i.       Mr Koh had asserted that he decided not to buy the cutter after reviewing it as he did not have a ready buyer for it and the cutter was eventually sold by RGPL. This assertion was, however, completely contradicted by Mr Chua who testified that he had personally handed the cutter to Mr Koh.
ii.      Mr Koh had asserted that he had only bought the scanner and the forklift for $2,000. He admitted that there was no invoice or receipt to show he had paid that sum. He had also said that the fibre tank and light tables were a gift from Crispian Tan. The aforesaid evidence was inconsistent with Mr Chua’s testimony which was that, apart from the forklift, scanner, fibre tank and light tables, Mr Koh also took the plate maker and the plate processor.
iii.     Mr Koh refused to admit that he also took the plate maker and the plate processor and continued to maintain this position during the trial. At the trial, however, his own payment voucher showed he had taken the plate maker.
iv.     In court, Mr Koh admitted he had created and signed the payment voucher dated 3 January 2007 to reimburse himself from ITPL in respect of the money he had paid for the transportation of various items from RGPL’s premises. This voucher, the plaintiff submitted, clearly showed that one of the machines that had been transported for ITPL was the plate maker. The plaintiff contended that Mr Koh would not provide any credible explanation as to why he had denied taking the plate maker when his own voucher showed that he took it. The voucher corroborated Mr Chua’s evidence that Mr Koh took the plate maker.
v.       In relation to the CTF machine, Mr Koh had not mentioned in his affidavit that he had taken this machine. It was only at the trial that he had attempted to amend paragraph 27 of his affidavit to include the CTF machine as one of those he had removed. His reason for not mentioning this fact earlier was that he had listed only the machines he had paid for and he had not paid for the CTF machine since he had only taken it because Crispian Tan wanted him to safe keep the machine. The plaintiff submitted that this excuse was implausible. How could Mr Koh have “remembered” to state the cheaper items such as the scanner and the forklift but not the larger and more expensive CTF machine? The plaintiff submitted that Mr Koh intentionally omitted the CTF machine from his affidavit because he was hiding the machine for Crispian Tan. This would be consistent as well with the fact that the CTF machine was not included in the payment voucher. The plaintiff submitted that Mr Koh had amended his affidavit because of his fear that his lie would be found out.
vi.     A similar submission was made in respect of Mr Koh’s attempts on the stand to amend the date on which he allegedly went to RGPL’s premises to inspect the plate maker and plate-processor (from 31 August to 30 August) and the date on which he allegedly paid RGPL the $2,000 (from 1 September 2006 to 31 August 2006). Mr Koh said that he was amending these dates because of the evidence that Mr Chua had given. The plaintiff’s submission was that Mr Koh was forced to amend his evidence because he knew he could not have paid the $2,000 to Crispian Tan at RGPL’s premises in Quek Industrial Building on 1 September 2006 since nobody would have been there as RGPL had shut down its operations on 31 August 2006. In this connection the plaintiff reminded me of Crispian Tan’s evidence that he had terminated the employment of RGPL’s staff on 31 August 2006 and no one went to work thereafter.
45     The plaintiff also made much of what it considered to be Mr Koh’s rather far-fetched evidence about why Mr Chua should have been, as he asserted, telling lies about him regarding the Mitsubishi machines. He said that Mr Chua was intentionally giving false evidence because Mr Chua bore him a grudge. This allegation was, the plaintiff submitted, completely baseless as Mr Chua could not have known that Mr Koh was unhappy with him as Mr Koh never expressed any displeasure to Mr Chua.
46     The defendants, on the other hand, submitted that I should accept the evidence of Mr Koh as being more truthful than that of Mr Chua.
47     In regard to Mr Koh’s evidence, it was submitted that his testimony that he did not buy the cutter should be accepted. Neither Mr Koh nor ITPL was sued for the purchase of that machine and therefore there was no reason for Mr Koh to lie about the cutter. The discrepancies that the plaintiff had raised in Mr Koh’s evidence were inconsequential disparities that were not central to the issue of the conversion of the Mitsubishi 4C.
48     In regard to the payment voucher dated 3 January 2007, the defendants pointed to Mr Koh’s explanation as to why he had denied taking the plate maker when the voucher showed that he took it. Mr Koh maintained he did not take either the plate maker or plate processor as the same had been returned to the agent, Agfa. Since neither ITPL nor Mr Koh was being sued for conversion of these two items, there was no reason for Mr Koh to lie about them.
49     Mr Koh had voluntarily amended his affidavit to show he had taken the CTF machine. He was not attempting to hide it for Crispian Tan. The truth was that ITPL had subsequently purchased the CTF machine from its owners, Singapore Finance Ltd. Again there was no reason for him to lie. His amendments to the dates were made because he realised his mistake after hearing Mr Chua’s evidence and he chose to amend his evidence despite knowing that the plaintiff would use this to attack his reliability.
50     The defendants further submitted that Mr Chua’s evidence should be rejected as it was fraught with mistakes and conjecture. They pointed out the following discrepancies:
i.       Henry Tay, the investigator, had testified that during his initial interview with Mr Chua, the latter had stated that it was Mr Koh who had informed Mr Chua that the Mitsubishi 4C was going to be transported to Malaysia before being shipped to Taiwan. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, however, Mr Chua insisted that it was the Taiwanese buyer who said the machine would go to Malaysia before it went to Taiwan.
ii.      Mr Chua admitted in para 15 of his affidavit that he had been wrong during his interview with Henry Tay to implicate the fourth defendant as being involved in the dismantling of the Mitsubishi 4C.
iii.     Mr Chua had also told Henry Tay that a company called Chin Guan Crane had been used to remove the Heidelberg 4C. Henry Tay, however, had later ascertained that the cranes used had, in fact, belonged to Tat Seng Machine Movers Pte Ltd, the fourth defendants in suit 740.
iv.     During cross-examination, Mr Chua had admitted that neither Crispian Tan nor Mr Koh nor the Taiwanese buyer had told him that Mr Koh was the middleman. Henry Tay’s evidence had been, however, that when he had asked Mr Chua during the interview how he knew that Mr Koh was the middleman, his reply was “I spoke to Jimmy”.
v.       In para 10 of his affidavit, Mr Chua stated that the Mitsubishi 4C was sold to Mr Koh from ITPL and was dismantled in early March 2006. During examination in chief, however, Mr Chua retracted this and said he was not sure whether Mr Koh was the buyer.
vi.     Mr Chua had also admitted he had made a mistake in telling Henry Tay that Mr Koh was the middleman for the sale of the Heidelberg 4C.
vii.    Finally, Mr Chua had admitted during cross-examination that the Taiwanese buyer had not been introduced by the defendants in respect of the sale of the Mitsubishi 4C.
51     In their closing submissions, the defendants did not repeat Mr Koh’s assertion that Mr Chua had a grudge against him as the basis for Mr Chua’s alleged lies. Instead, they argued that Mr Chua’s involvement in the handing over of the Mitsubishi 4C could also amount to a conversion of the same. As such, he must have been aware that the plaintiff could have taken legal action against him for the conversion of the machine. Mr Chua gave evidence falsely implicating various parties as being responsible for the conversion of the Mitsubishi 4C and the Heidelberg 4C machines because he would rather give evidence on behalf of the plaintiff than be sued by it if no other party was implicated.
52     There is no doubt that the only direct evidence against the defendants was that provided by Mr Chua. The defendants argued that it would be unsafe to rely on his evidence because it was uncorroborated. However, this in itself is not a reason to reject the evidence if it is consistent and coherent. It is also important to weigh Mr Chua’s evidence in the context of the other evidence given by the defendants and the witnesses on whom they relied. On the whole, I find Mr Chua to be a more impressive witness than Mr Koh. There is no real reason to reject the basic truthfulness of his evidence although he did make mistakes which, on further consideration, he candidly admitted. Mr Chua did not come forward voluntarily to give evidence. He had to be subpoenaed and even in respect of his earlier revelations to Henry Tay, these were made in response to questions after Henry Tay had sought him out. He was not a volunteer who was eager to dish the dirt on other people. There was no evidence of any grudge that Mr Chua may have had against Mr Koh and it was significant that even the defendants’ own lawyers dropped this suggestion in their closing submissions. As for the defendants’ suggestion that Mr Chua was giving evidence only because the plaintiff had promised not to pursue any claim against him for his involvement in the matter, this was not put to Vincent Tay, the plaintiff’s representative, when the latter was in the witness box. Mr Chua himself denied that such a promise had ever been made. In fact, he himself was confident that he had done no wrong whatsoever because he had merely been carrying out his employer’s instructions. It should also be remembered that Crispian Tan’s evidence was that Mr Chua would not have been aware of management and financial matters in the course of his employment. Mr Chua was therefore, most probably, ignorant that the sale of the machines was wrongful 
vis-à-vis
 the plaintiff. He would not have considered, therefore, that he could possibly be liable to the plaintiff for its loss.
53     As for the other criticisms that the defendants made of Mr Chua’s evidence, these do not really affect its basic veracity. In regard to the defendants’ denial that Mr Chua had said in his evidence that Crispian Tan had instructed him to hand over the Mitsubishi 4C to Mr Koh and the Taiwanese buyer, the defendants did not, perhaps, understand the full implications of Mr Chua’s evidence. In court, when he was asked for the basis of his assertion that Mr Koh was the middleman for the sale of the Mitsubishi 4C, his answer was:
Okay. On March – early March 2006, Jimmy Koh, was as I said, came with a Taiwan[ese] buyer and Crispian instructed me, “This machine they are coming to collect. Please oversee to it.”
The logical inference from the instruction that Crispian Tan gave Mr Chua was that he was to oversee the collection of the Mitsubishi 4C by Mr Koh and the Taiwanese buyer.
54     The defendants had queried why Mr Chua did not have any conversation with Mr Koh while the Mitsubishi 4C was being dismantled but only spoke to the Taiwanese buyer. This was a surprising query as the defendants did not ask Mr Chua during cross examination whether he had struck up any conversation with Mr Koh during this period. There was in any case no particular reason why Mr Chua should have spoken to Mr Koh as well as the Taiwanese buyer or instead of the Taiwanese buyer.
55     The defendants attempted, as I stated above, to discredit Mr Chua’s credibility on the basis of an inconsistency between paragraph 31 of Henry Tay’s affidavit and paragraph 14 of Mr Chua’s own affidavit in relation to whether it was Mr Koh or the Taiwanese buyer who told Mr Chua that the Mitsubishi 4C was going to be transported to Malaysia before being shipped to Taiwan. As the plaintiff pointed out however, the apparent inconsistency was not put to Mr Chua during cross examination. Further, whether Mr Chua was wrong in his affidavit or wrong in his statement to Henry Tay about who had given him the information, the fact remained that he had consistently stated that he had been told that the machine was going to be transported to Malaysia before being shipped to Taiwan. The substance of his evidence as to what was going to happen to the machine therefore remained unchanged.
56     To discredit Mr Chua, the defendants had also relied on his mistake as regards the involvement of Kim Heng Mechanic in the removal of the Mitsubishi 4C and the conflict between Mr Chua’s evidence and Henry Tay’s evidence in relation to Chin Guan Crane’s involvement. However, Mr Chua clarified in re-examination that he did not tell Henry Tay that Chin Guan Crane was involved in the removal of the Heidelberg 4C. As regards Kim Heng Mechanic, while there was no really acceptable explanation for the confusion, I think this was a minor lapse in Mr Chua’s testimony which does not affect its essential truthfulness.
57     The defendants’ assertion that Mr Chua’s evidence could not be accepted because he had wrongly identified Mr Koh as the middleman for the Heidelberg 4C is not a weighty one. As the plaintiff submitted, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the Heidelberg 4C were very different from those that existed when the Mitsubishi 4C was removed. In the case of the Heidelberg 4C, RGPL's premises were in a state of confusion as various things were being moved out. Further, Mr Chua was not instructed to hand over the Heidelberg 4C to any particular person. It was not unreasonable for him to have inferred that, as with the Mitsubishi 4C, Mr Koh was also involved in the removal of the Heidelberg 4C since Mr Koh was present at RGPL's premises at the time that this latter machine was being taken away.
58     On the other hand, the discrepancies in Mr Koh’s evidence were harder to explain away. Although Mr Koh asserted that he did not know Crispian Tan before February or March 2006, and thereafter only bought two machines worth $2,000 from RGPL, he wanted the court to believe that this was enough to make Crispian Tan give him the fibre tank and light tables for free and also trust him enough to ask him to keep the CTF machine (a large and expensive machine) safe for RGPL even though RGPL had new premises in Bendemeer Road to which that machine could have been transported. Mr Koh had initially lied about the CTF machine and the plate maker in that he had vehemently denied taking these machines. Eventually he admitted (after hearing Mr Chua’s evidence) that he took the CTF machine though, as I said, he maintained it was taken for safe keeping. As for the plate maker, despite being shown his own document, the payment voucher, in which he recorded that the plate maker was one of the items removed from RGPL's premises, he persisted in his assertion that he did not take that machine.
59     It would be recalled that Mr Chua testified that he had handed over the cutter to Mr Koh. Mr Koh, however, asserted that he had decided not to buy the cutter. In this regard I accept Mr Chua’s evidence. The defendants could have called Crispian Tan as a witness to confirm that the defendants had not purchased the cutter and that he had only offered to sell the cutter (rather than both the cutter and the Mitsubishi 4C which was a much larger and more expensive machine) to the defendants. They did not call him. In fact, although the defendants had the opportunity to do so when Crispian Tan took the stand in suit 740, they did not then put to him their case in relation to his dealings with Mr Koh. I also find it difficult to believe Mr Koh’s assertions that when he first went to visit RGPL's premises in February or March 2006, he was not told about or shown the Mitsubishi 4C. It is clear from Crispian Tan’s evidence that that was the time when he was trying to raise money by selling the Mitsubishi 4C. He would have wanted to show it to every possible buyer and there would be no reason for him to limit his dealings with Mr Koh to only the cutter which was a smaller machine and the sale of which, therefore, would have raised less money for RGPL.
60     There were also difficulties with Mr Koh’s story of having gone to RGPL's premises at Quek Industrial Building on 1 and 2 September 2006 to pick up the minor items that he had purchased. After hearing Mr Chua’s testimony about the termination of employment of RGPL’s employees on 31 August 2006, Mr Koh changed certain dates in his affidavit. He then said that he had paid Crispian Tan on 31 August 2006 rather than 1 September 2006 because he knew he could not have met Crispian Tan at the Quek Industrial Building after 31 August 2006. He maintained however, that he and his lorry driver Mr Yeo went down to those premises on both 1 and 2 September 2006 to pick up the items in question and could not pick up the items on 1 September because the forklift truck was being used to move other items. This evidence is not credible because even though Crispian Tan testified that he had instructed Mr Chua to go back to Quek Industrial Building to assist the defendants on 1 September 2006, there would have been no reason for Mr Chua to do Crispian Tan this favour after Mr Chua’s employment had been terminated. Further, even if Mr Chua had obliged Crispian Tan once, why ever would he have obliged him for the second time on 2 September 2006? In any case, since the other workers had been terminated on 31 August 2006, apart from Mr Chua and Mr Koh and the lorry driver Mr Yeo, there would have been no one at RGPL's premises on 1 September 2006 and therefore Mr Koh could very well have picked up the defendants’ items that day itself and removed them without having to come back again the next day. The defendants called Mr Yeo to corroborate Mr Koh’s evidence about the September dates but Mr Yeo was not a credible witness. He was unable to explain how he could remember those two dates and his evidence did not add to the credibility of Mr Koh’s story.
61     Mr Koh also failed to provide any credible explanation to explain the obvious inconsistencies in his own payment voucher which showed that he had taken the plate maker (which he insisted he did not take) but did not include the CTF machine (which he admitted he took). His explanation that he had merely scribbled whatever machines he could think of in the voucher was a feeble excuse. He further failed to satisfactorily explain why he had omitted to state in his affidavit that he had taken the CTF machine. His explanation that he only remembered the items that he paid for was another puerile excuse since he had mentioned the plate maker which was not a machine that he had paid for.
62     Mr Koh had voluntarily altered his evidence in two aspects. The first was in respect of his taking of the CTF machine and the second was in respect of the dates on which he allegedly inspected the plate maker and plate processor and paid Crispian Tan for the various items he purchased. Mr Koh admitted that he had altered his evidence after listening to Mr Chua’s evidence. The fact that this was the cause of his changes showed that in some material aspects he had to accept the veracity of Mr Chua’s testimony. Perhaps, too, he feared that his inaccurate assertions would be exposed during cross examination.
63     On the basis of the evidence and for the reasons given above, I find that the defendants were involved in the removal of the Mitsubishi 4C from RGPL's premises in March 2006 and in delivering it to a third party, the Taiwanese buyer, who was going to remove it from Singapore and deprive the plaintiff of its use. It is not clear that the defendants were the buyers of the Mitsubishi 4C but whether they bought it and then sub sold it to the Taiwanese buyer or simply acted as a middleman for the latter, they were active participants in the whole transaction involving this machine.
Liability for conversion
64     It was common ground at the trial that the plaintiff was the owner of the Mitsubishi 4C and thus had the necessary title to sue for the conversion of the machine.
65     The law on conversion was set out by the plaintiff in its closing submissions and the principles so stated were not disputed by the defendants. The essence of these principles (as derived from paragraphs 17-07 to 17-68 of 
Clerk & Lindsell on Torts
 (19
th
 Ed)) is that a person who, without authority, takes possession of another’s goods with the intention of dealing with them in a manner inconsistent with the rights of the true owner is, 
prima facie
, guilty of conversion. The intention required is that the person who deals with the goods must want to negative the right of the true owner or assert a right which is inconsistent with the ownership of the true owner. The same text states that if a person takes an active part in delivering another’s goods to a third party by sale or gift or otherwise in a manner which is adverse to the right of the true owner, then he will be a wrongdoer. The conduct must be deliberate, not accidental, and as long as it is a deliberate act which is inconsistent with the true owner’s right, the wrongdoer will be liable for conversion even if his act was done in ignorance of such rights and without intending to challenge those rights. See 
Motis Export Ltd v Dampskibsselskabet AF 1912 Aktieselskab
 [1999] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 837 and 
Kuwait Airways Corp v Iraqi Airways Co
 
[2002] 2 WLR 1353
.
66     The defendants submitted that the burden of proof lay with the plaintiff to show, on a balance of probabilities, that the defendants were liable for conversion. They cited two cases in which the court had found that this burden had not been discharged 
viz Lam Teik Kai v Hallam Nominees Ltd
 
[1997] 1 MLJ 146
 and 
Watercraft Pte Ltd v Chong Chee Yan
 
[1996] SGHC 46
. In this case, however, there was direct evidence from Mr Chua, which I have accepted, that the Taiwanese buyer bought the Mitsubishi 4C, the first defendant and the Taiwanese buyer oversaw the dismantling, and both of them caused the machine to be removed from RGPL's premises. Mr Chua also testified that he had handed some of the machines spare parts to Mr Koh and the Taiwanese buyer. The plaintiff has established its case on a balance of probabilities.
67     The more pertinent issue is whether I can hold both Mr Koh and IPTL liable for conversion or whether I can only hold one of them to be so liable and if so, which one. In regard to the basis for joint or several liability, the statement of claim was brief. Para 5 thereof simply stated that:
… sometime in March 2006, the 1
st
 defendant acting on his own or as a director of the 2
nd
 defendants unlawfully caused the machine to be removed from Rav Graphic’s premises …
There was no plea that Mr Koh and the second defendant were acting jointly or were co-conspirators. If Mr Koh was acting on his own behalf, then only he could be held liable for conversion and not IPTL. On the other hand, if Mr Koh was acting as a director of IPTL, then only IPTL could be held liable and not Mr Koh personally. The plaintiff made the submission that Mr Koh should be held liable personally even if he was acting on behalf of IPTL because the evidence was that he was the directing mind of IPTL. Whilst I accept that that was the evidence, I do not consider that proof that Mr Koh ran IPTL would in itself justify piercing the corporate veil and making Mr Koh liable for the actions of IPTL. The principle of independent corporate personality is well entrenched in our law and the acts of the corporation cannot be ascribed to its directors for the purpose of imposing civil law liability for damages on the latter simply by showing that they caused the corporation to take certain actions. More has to be done.
68     In the present case, it appears to me that all along Mr Koh was acting as the agent of IPTL in whatever he did in connection with not only the Mitsubishi 4C but also in relation to all his transactions with RGPL. It would be recalled that Mr Koh first met Crispian Tan after he had sent out IPTL’s brochures to advertise IPTL’s business of dealing in second-hand machines. Then, when it came to transporting the machines that he admitted buying from RGPL, Mr Koh first paid the transport charges out of his own pocket and later reclaimed them from IPTL. This showed that he had been acting for IPTL in the transactions. In any case, there was no evidence that Mr Koh himself ever carried out any dealing in second-hand machines on his own behalf rather than as director of IPTL. There would, in fact, be little reason for Mr Koh to do so since he had control of IPTL and had, presumably, procured the incorporation of that company for the purpose of trading in second-hand machines. Accordingly, I find that it is the second defendant IPTL that is liable for the conversion of the Mitsubishi 4C and that Mr Koh has no personal liability therefor.
69     As to quantum, the plaintiff’s submission was that the proper measure of damages would be the market value of the Mitsubishi 4C at the time of conversion. In support, it cited the case of 
Chartered Electronics Industries Pte Ltd v Comtech IT Pte Ltd
 
[1998] 3 SLR 502
. This principle was not disputed by the defendants.
70     The evidence given by Mr Chua Liang Seng, the managing director of Heidelberg Asia Pte Ltd, was that the market value of the Mitsubishi 4C at the time of conversion was about $850,000. Chua Liang Seng testified that he was in a position to provide an estimate of the value of the Mitsubishi 4C because his company, while dealing mainly in Heidelberg machines, also did a business in trade-ins of Mitsubishi machines. The defendants did not contest these figures. Nor did they introduce any evidence of their own as to the relevant value of the Mitsubishi 4C. In the statement of claim, the plaintiff had claimed damages of $800,000 for the machine. Since this figure is supported by the evidence, I will award damages in that amount to the plaintiff.
Conclusion
71     Accordingly, there shall be judgment in favour of the plaintiff against the second defendant for the sum of $800,000 with interest thereon at the court rate from the date of the writ and costs. Although I am not granting the plaintiff judgment against the first defendant, I am not making an order for costs in favour of the first defendant since his costs would, to all intents and purposes, have been practically identical with the costs incurred by the second defendant in defending the action and it would not be correct to make the plaintiff pay any part of the second defendant’s costs.",2008-11-17 00:00:00,SG High Court

3 November 2014
 Choo Han Teck J:
1       The accused is a 26-years old Malaysian who was arrested and charged for importing 22.24g of diamorphine when he drove into Singapore on 12 April 2012 at 5.15am. He was charged under s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). The offence is punishable under s 33 of the MDA.
2       The prosecution adduced evidence, unchallenged by the accused, that at the material time the accused drove a Hyundai Sonata bearing a Malaysian licence number JHY 93 from Malaysia. The car passed through the immigration booths at the Woodlands Checkpoint. SSgt Chan Tim Fatt, an officer from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (“ICA”) noticed the black-tinted windows of the car and stopped the vehicle. He then told the accused to go to an inspection pit for a thorough check by other ICA officers.
3       ICA Sergeant Chen Zhongfu Roger searched the accused and his belongings but nothing incriminating was found. He and ICA Sergeant Aidil Rafael then searched the car. Sgt Aidil Rafael lifted the tray inside the centre arm-rest console next to the driver’s seat. He saw a black bundle in the console under the tray. Officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) were alerted and Sgt Goh Yang Lun went to the inspection pit and took custody of the two black bundles. W/SSSgt Kengadhelagam and SSgt Chew Tai Waif of the CNB went with Sgt Goh.
4       W/SSSgt Kengadhelagam recorded a statement from the accused at the inspection pit at 5.43am. She asked the accused about the black bundles. The accused stated that he did not know anything about them because the car belonged to his friend ‘Nathan’. The two black bundles were opened and the contents sent to the Health Sciences Authority of Singapore (“HSA”). The contents were examined and analysed by an analyst of the HSA, Miss Lim Jong Lee and she certified that the contents were diamorphine weighing 22.24g.
5       The accused gave a number of statements to the CNB in the Tamil language through the Tamil interpreter Mr Manickam. None of his statements were directly incriminatory. His cautioned statement was recorded on 12 April 2012 between 3.35pm and 4.46pm. He stated that he had done nothing wrong and that he only came to Singapore to work. He stated that the car belonged to his friend.
6       The prosecution also adduced the record of the calls made to and from the cell phone used by the accused. The record shows that one ‘Balu’ called at 12.20pm on 11 April 2012. He called again on 12 April 2012 at 1.22am and the accused subsequently called him at 4.15am on the same day. About 40 minutes later at 4.47am the accused received a call from one ‘Nathan’. The accused then called one ‘Batte’ at 5.06am and at the same time also called ‘Nathan’. At 5.12am ‘Batte’ returned call. The accused was arrested about 5.15am. Thereafter, ‘Balu’ called at 5.20am, ‘Batte’ called at 5.38am, ‘Nathan’ called at 6.03am and ‘Balu’ called again at 6.34am. All these calls went unanswered because the accused was in the custody of the ICA officers.
7       On the evidence adduced by the prosecution, I was satisfied that a case against the accused was sufficiently made out for him to enter upon his defence. The accused elected to testify. His defence was that he had no knowledge that there were two black bundles in the console box, and therefore, there was no knowledge that he was driving a car with the 22.24g of diamorphine into Singapore.
8       Under ss 18(2) and 21 of the MDA, the law presumes the accused in the circumstances (as here proved by the prosecution) to be in possession of the drugs knowing them to be so. These are rebuttable presumptions and the accused must persuade the court that he did not know that he was in possession of the drugs in question. I now set out these provisions below for ease of reference.
 
Presumption of possession and knowledge of controlled drugs
 
 
18.
 – …
(2)    Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug.
…
 
Presumption relating to vehicle
 
 
21
.    If any controlled drug is found in any vehicle, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be in the possession of the owner of the vehicle and of the person in charge of the vehicle for the time being.
9       The accused testified that he was born in Penang, Malaysia on 16 November 1987 and obtained an equivalent of the Secondary Four level education. His father died about five years ago. His mother works as a security officer. He told the court his employment history. The accused says that he worked as a petrol pump attendant in Pasir Panjang, Singapore. He first worked there in 2006 but subsequently worked in the Port of Singapore Authority as well as the Jurong Port. He then worked as an ‘operator’ in a company in Kaki Bukit but stopped working there about February or March 2012 when he was dismissed for not reporting for work regularly. He then went back to work at a Caltex station in Bukit Batok and was still employed there when he was arrested for the present offence.
10     He has been riding motorcycles and driving cars without licence from Malaysia to Singapore. He bought a motorcycle in Malaysia for RM6,000 and was making instalment payments of RM250 a month but had not kept up payment from January to April 2012. He rode his motorcycle to two places in Singapore on 9 April 2012 looking for a job as a security guard. He testified that he worked in Caltex in 2006 and ‘did not like the job and didn’t want to return to the same job’. However, he returned to Caltex to work as a pump attendant. His first day back at work was 10 April 2012. He went to work on his motorcycle.
11     On 11 April 2012, the younger brother of the accused told him that the motorcycle shop called asking for payment of arrears of the instalments. The accused then spoke to a person at the motorcycle shop and asked for an extension of time till he has been paid by Caltex. He then left for work. He went home after work that evening about 11.30pm. He was afraid that the motorcycle will be repossessed by the shop, so he called his friend ‘Balu’ (whom he had known for four years) and asked to borrow his motorcycle. ‘Balu’ told him that the road tax had expired for his motorcycle, and offered to get a car from a common friend, ‘Nathan’, for the accused.
12     On the morning of 12 April 2012, the accused called ‘Balu’ at 4am and told him to tell ‘Nathan’ that he (the accused) would be going to ‘Nathan’s’ house to collect the car. The accused arrived at ‘Nathan’s’ house thirty minutes later, left his motorcycle there and took the car from ‘Nathan’. He drove it straight to McDonald’s and left the car unlocked in the carpark while he went to buy his breakfast. At that point, one ‘Batte’, a close friend of ‘Balu’ telephoned the accused and asked him where he was. Nothing transpired when the accused told ‘Batte’ that he was at McDonald’s. Thereafter, he returned to the car and drove to Singapore where he was arrested.
13     That was the summary of the accused person’s effort to rebut the presumption of knowledge of the contents in the black bundles found in the console box of the car.
14     I find the story of the accused implausible to have even created any doubt in my mind as to his knowledge of the drugs in his possession. The reason for borrowing ‘Nathan’s’ car (through ‘Balu’) was strange and illogical. The fear that his motorcycle would be repossessed does not justify leaving it in ‘Nathan’s’ house and taking ‘Nathan’s’ car to work instead. No explanation was given as to how that helps against the repossession of the motorcycle by the shop. There was no elaboration as to how long he intended to keep ‘Nathan’s’ car or how long he intended to leave his motorcycle at ‘Nathan’s’ house.
15     The accused did not explain why he needed to contact ‘Balu’ and trouble ‘Nathan’ at 4am in the morning. There was no evidence that ‘Balu’ and ‘Nathan’ also believed that the motorcycle would be repossessed should the accused ride it into Singapore, and thus, it was a situation that required the three of them to be involved in passing ‘Nathan’s’ car to the accused. Nothing that the accused did or said when he was arrested and his car searched exculpated him in anyway. They were mere denials and attempts at passing off ignorance of the illicit contents in the car. Although the accused testified that he had left the car unlocked and unattended when he went into McDonalds to get his breakfast, I find no evidence to suggest that someone else planted the drugs in the car during that time. If there were such a person, it would have been utterly senseless for him to plant the drugs inside the car and hope that the accused would again leave it unlocked and unattended in Singapore for that person to retrieve the drugs. By this evidence the accused appears to show that if he had known that there were drugs in the car he would not have left the car unlocked. If that were the only reason for this evidence, I am of the view that it was self-serving and I do not believe it. There was no other evidence that persuaded me that this evidence could be accepted.
16     I am of the view that the accused have little room and imagination to present a more credible account of why he was driving a car with drugs to Singapore at 5am – when he was only required to start his shift as a petrol pump attendant at 3pm. The story as he presented was probably the best he could adduce in the circumstances. I therefore find that the evidence of the accused to be untrue and that the presumptions against him under ss 18(2) and 21 of the MDA have not been rebutted. Accordingly, I found him guilty as charged. The Deputy Public Prosecutor Mr Lim informed the court that the Public Prosecutor was not issuing a certificate of substantive cooperation under s 33B(2)(
b
) of the MDA to the accused. Thereafter, the accused’s lawyer Mr Kanagavijayan informed the court that he has no further submissions to make on behalf of the accused. I therefore sentenced the accused to suffer the mandatory punishment of death.",2014-11-03 00:00:00,SG High Court

 Choo Han Teck J:
1       The appellant is a Singapore citizen. He became acquainted with one Wang Yingde (“Wang”), the managing director of Shanghai Construction (Group) General Company (“Shanghai Construction”), in 2003. He pleaded guilty to 25 charges in contravention of s 22(1)(d) read with s 23(1) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A, 1997 Rev Ed) (“EFWA”). 75 other charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. He was convicted on the 25 charges, sentenced to two months imprisonment on each charge and was ordered to serve the first six sentences consecutively, thus making the total term of imprisonment twelve months.
2       The details of the charges were set out in the Statement of Facts as follows —
5    The accused abetted the said Wang Yingde by engaging in a conspiracy to furnish information which is false in a material particular by providing the CPF account details of the willing Singaporeans and Singapore Permanent Residents who were freelance workers in his company to the said Wang Yingde to contribute money into their CPF accounts even though these persons were not employed by Shanghai Construction, so that the said Wang Yingde could direct one Xu Hong (NRIC SXXXXXXXE) to certify in the applications made by Shanghai Construction to the Controller for the worker passes (“Controller”) in the name of the above mentioned foreign workers that the Shanghai Construction CPF accounts (which is used by the Controller to determine the Shanghai Construction’s local and foreign workforce entitlement) only included contributions made to persons actively employed by Shanghai Construction. The said declaration forms containing the said false statement were submitted to [the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”)]. Subsequently, the work permit applications were approved and work permits were issued to the above said foreign workers based on the false statements in the said declaration forms.
6    The accused used his company premises as a collection point to collect personal information of the Singaporeans and Singapore Permanent Residents for the said Wang Yingde. The accused helped the said Wang Yingde as he wanted to maintain a good working relationship with him to continue obtaining construction projects from him. Investigations have revealed that the accused had provided the CPF account details of 56 Singaporeans and Singapore Permanent Residents to the said Wang Yingde.
7    The accused was aware that the foreign workforce entitlement of Shanghai Construction was computed based on the number of local workforce employed by it. He was also aware that the number of local workforce was determined from the CPF accounts of Shanghai Construction.
8    The declaration in clause 8 of the said declaration forms, that Shanghai Construction’s CPF account only included CPF contributions made to persons actively employed by it, was a material consideration in MOM’s decision to grant work permits to the said foreign workers. The Work Pass Division (WPD) of the MOM had confirmed that had they known at the time of the aforesaid applications that not all of the local workers receiving CPF contributions from the Shanghai Construction were actively employed by Shanghai Construction, WPD would not have approved the work permit applications. Further, WPD has also confirmed that the applications relating to the above proceeded charges would not have been approved as the Shanghai Construction did not have sufficient foreign worker entitlement based on its genuine local workforce.
3       Counsel for the appellant, Mr Loh Lin Kok, submitted that the sentences were individually harsh because the trial judge had meted out the sentences under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A) (“EFMA”) which came into effect on 1 July 2007, replacing the EFWA. Yet, the appellant had been charged under the EFWA. It is not clear if the reference in the grounds below was a typographical error but I would give the benefit of the doubt to the appellant, without criticism of the judge, and review the appropriateness of the sentences on the basis of the EFWA. With regard to the offences in question, the EFMA increased the punishment from $5,000 to $15,000 and imprisonment from six months to twelve months.
4       Furthermore, counsel submitted that on the principle of the one-transaction rule, the total term of imprisonment was excessive. The prosecution submitted that the offences took place on four different dates and were therefore distinct offences. The dates in question were 24 and 31 January 2007 and, 1 and 2 February 2007. However, the charges taken into consideration for sentencing concerned offences committed in March and April 2007. The criminal activity, not the act, was thus carried out over a period of about three months. The one-transaction principle is thus not relevant but, in view of the nature of the appellant’s involvement in the offences, the totality principle remains relevant. The individual sentences of two months, even under the EFWA, were not manifestly excessive, but they must be considered in totality.
5       I am also of the view that while the court is at liberty to impose more than two consecutive sentences and may do so in order to apply the totality principle, given the facts of this case and taking his antecedent into account, the appellant should be given only four consecutive sentences. The total term of imprisonment will therefore be eight months.
6       For the above reasons the sentence of imprisonment was varied from a total of twelve months to eight with effect from 15 April 2011.",2011-03-15 00:00:00,SG High Court

Introduction
1       Chan Pui Woo Teresa (“Teresa”), who is the plaintiff in this suit, was the unfortunate victim of an advance fee fraud, more commonly known as the “419 fraud” or “Nigerian scam”. She sued Ng Fook Khau Michael (“Michael”) who is the first defendant, and her former colleague Jonathan Tan See Leh (“Jonathan”) who is the second defendant, holding them responsible for the money she lost as a result of the fraud. Advance fee fraud comes in many variations but the basic concept is that the target is induced to part with his money to the fraudster in the hope of realising a significantly larger gain. The fraudster first baits the target by, for example, promising him a cut of a large sum of money locked up somewhere in exchange for his assistance in transferring the money through his bank account, or informing him that he has won a lottery. If the target expresses interest, the fraudster would take him through a series of steps to effect the transfer of the “money”. However, there would invariably be hurdles along the way and the fraudster would ask the target to advance some of his own money first to pay administrative fees, deposits, taxes, 
etc
. The target, lured by the prospect of easy money, coughs up the sum requested but would then encounter more hurdles necessitating the payment of further sums of money. The process repeats itself until the fraudster disappears without a trace or the target realises he has been deceived. By then, the target would possibly have parted with substantial amounts of money.
2       The fraud here was apparently perpetuated by Michael among some members of the Christian community in Singapore which included Teresa. It is not disputed that Teresa had advanced various sums of money to Michael, in respect of which she sued him for recovery. Teresa also claimed damages against Jonathan for fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation in respect of the fraud.
3       Teresa obtained interlocutory judgment against Michael on 11 August 2009 due to the latter’s failure to comply with an “unless” order. The trial before this court was only to determine Teresa’s claim against Jonathan.
The facts
4       Teresa and Jonathan were advocates and solicitors who at the material time practised under the Raffles Group Law Practice. Teresa joined the group sometime in early 2001 practicing under the name of C Teresa & Co. She was called to the Singapore Bar in 1982. Jonathan joined later that same year practicing under the name of Tan Partnership. They initially got along well together both professionally and socially and this was in part due to their mutual Christian background. Teresa was a volunteer for her church in many overseas missions while Jonathan was a pastor. They also worked together on several cases in their practice and shared legal fees.
5       Sometime in mid-2002, Jonathan introduced Michael to Teresa and mentioned that Michael was a fellow Christian. Michael had at that time presented himself as a businessman cum international banker who was trying to retrieve a sum of US$45.8m from an account with a bank in London called the “First Merchant Bank”. Apparently, the money belonged to Michael but in order to obtain the funds, he was first required to pay a tax to an entity called the “British International Monitory [
sic
] Fund” (“BIMF”). Michael had also apparently negotiated with one Dr Paul Smith from BIMF to pay part of the tax first to secure the release of a proportionate amount of the funds, which would then be used to pay the remaining tax for the balance. As such, Michael needed to raise S$150,000 for the purpose and promised a 100% return to those who could assist him financially to achieve his goal.
6       The events that subsequently transpired between Teresa and Jonathan are disputed but suffice it to say, Teresa was convinced enough to participate in Michael’s scheme. By an agreement dated 17 July 2002 (“the First Agreement”), Teresa agreed to advance S$150,000 to Michael, and handed him two cash cheques (drawn on her overdraft facilities with her banks) totalling the said amount. In return, Michael gave Teresa a post-dated cheque for the sum of US$172,911 (equivalent to S$300,000 at the agreed exchange rate of US$1 to S$1.735). It was not disputed that the First Agreement was prepared by Jonathan. Michael then remitted the S$150,000 to a local company called Shankar’s Emporium Pte Ltd (sometimes misspelled as Shanker’s in the documents), which was supposedly the authorised revenue collector for BIMF.
7       The funds in Michael’s account with First Merchant Bank were supposed to have been released shortly after the signing of the First Agreement but in early August 2002, a new hurdle cropped up. Michael’s story was that Dr Paul Smith’s superior in BIMF, one Mrs Margaret York, was now insisting on the full payment of the tax before any funds would be released. Michael thus needed to raise another US$380,000 to pay the balance of the tax. Teresa was of course upset by this turn of events and again, what happened next between her and Jonathan was disputed.
8       In any event, Teresa eventually entered into another agreement with Michael dated 14 August 2002 (“the Second Agreement”). Under the Second Agreement, Teresa would advance a further sum of S$672,600 (equivalent to US$380,000) to Michael, in consideration of which she was “guaranteed” a dividend of S$1,008,900, amounting to about a 150% return. The total sum due to Teresa thus increased to S$1,681,500. The Second Agreement further stipulated that Michael was to pay the S$1,681,500 to Teresa by 26 August 2002, with a penalty of S$5,000 per day chargeable from 29 August 2002 until payment. Finally, the Second Agreement also varied the terms of the First Agreement in that Teresa would now stand to collect S$315,000 under the First Agreement, being her principal of S$150,000 and a dividend of S$165,000. As with the First Agreement, the Second Agreement was also prepared by Jonathan.
9       In order to raise the additional S$672,600 for the Second Agreement, Teresa obtained a bank overdraft facility using her condominium flat as collateral. She then executed a telegraphic transfer of the funds to Shankar’s Emporium Pte Ltd. Pursuant to the Second Agreement, Teresa received another post-dated cheque from Michael for US$950,000 (equivalent to S$1,681,500 at the agreed exchange rate of US$1 to S$1.77).
10     Unfortunately for Teresa, the returns promised by Michael did not materialise by 26 August 2002 and there were no signs throughout the rest of the year that she was going to be paid. It is unclear what happened from here until mid-2003 although Michael apparently flew to London in late 2002 to enquire about the release of the US$45.8m. It seemed that Michael was encountering more and more administrative obstacles in his bid to have the funds released to him.
11     In May 2003, Michael apparently needed more funds allegedly in connection with the release of the US$45.8m. Thus, by another agreement dated 13 May 2003 (“the Third Agreement”), Teresa and Jonathan agreed to advance US$10,000 and US$5,000 to Michael respectively. In return, Michael promised to pay US$127,500 and US$63,750 to Teresa and Jonathan respectively by 21 May 2003, with a late payment interest of 10% per annum. Like the First and Second Agreements, the Third Agreement was also prepared by Jonathan.
12     Not surprisingly, the promised returns on the Third Agreement never materialised. Michael’s story to Teresa and Jonathan was that First Merchant Bank was unable to release the US$45.8m because of a last minute intervention by the Nigerian government. Apparently, the Nigerian government had suspected that the funds in the account were illegally siphoned from Nigeria, and had obtained an injunction against First Merchant Bank requiring the latter to remit the funds back to Nigeria. After further investigation by the Nigerian authorities, the funds were found to be legitimate and were thus transferred to an account with the Union Bank of Switzerland (“UBS”) to be released to Michael. However, Michael was first required to pay a “European Union Tax” of 2% (amounting to US$916,000) plus a further auxiliary sum of US$4,580 to an entity called the “European Tax Advisory Board” before the funds would be released to him.
13     Michael thus started roping more people into the scheme, presumably to raise the funds required to pay off the 2% tax. From September 2003 onwards, Michael entered into agreements with various “investors”, promising them an extremely high rate of return (ranging from 100% to 200%) within 30 days of their initial payment. Some of those investors appeared as witnesses at the trial and testified that they were introduced to Michael by mutual Christian friends. While Michael was raising this money, Jonathan had also been negotiating with one Peter Bockli (purportedly from UBS) to pay the 2% tax in instalments.
14     Around the same time, the Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”) commenced an investigation into Michael’s affairs. Pursuant to the investigation, Jonathan furnished several documents to CAD in January 2004 at its request. The documents comprised Michael’s online account statements with First Merchant Bank and correspondence with both the bank and BIMF.
15     Michael eventually managed to raise enough money from his various investors to pay part of the 2% European Union Tax but this was still not yet the end. Apparently, UBS then insisted on payment of certain audit fees. In September 2004, Jonathan wrote on Michael’s behalf to several investors informing them of the development and assuring them that their monies would be paid with the promised returns in due time. Unfortunately, it seemed that Michael was unable to raise enough monies to pay the audit fees in full. From late 2004 to early 2005, Jonathan corresponded with one Vieri Mallorca and one Lawrence Weinbach, who purportedly worked for UBS, assuring them that Michael would eventually settle the audit fees to effect the release of his funds. It was not disputed that until April 2005, Michael was still entering into new agreements with investors in order to raise funds. All the agreements for the fund-raising exercise were drafted by Jonathan.
16     However, UBS apparently started to lose patience with Michael’s inability to pay the audit fees and threatened to remit the US$45.8m back to Nigeria in early 2005. There was no more correspondence between Jonathan and the purported UBS officials after April 2005.
17     In August 2005, CAD began another round of investigations on Michael and he did not enter into any more agreements with investors thenceforth (save for a single agreement dated 9 May 2006 which he made with an existing investor). Finally, by a letter to Michael dated 13 July 2006, CAD stated:
Our investigations into the case have been completed. We have reasons to believe that you are a victim of a fraud as the correspondence allegedly from UBS had been verified to be fictitious in nature.
You are hereby advised to refrain from soliciting further loans for such purposes. You may be liable for criminal conduct if you persist to continue with such activities.
18     It was unclear what happened to the other investors eventually but Teresa on her part had not recovered the monies she had invested with Michael. Understandably, she was completely devastated when she realised she had been cheated and that the monies she had paid to Michael were never coming back. To make matters worse, she was saddled with substantial debts since she had borrowed heavily from her banks to provide funds to Michael under the First and Second Agreements. Teresa eventually settled her debts by selling off most of her assets and by drawing on her savings. Subsequently, she made several enquires and discovered that First Merchant Bank, BIMF, and the European Tax Advisory Board were entirely fictitious entities.
The claim
19     Teresa commenced this action against Michael and Jonathan in July 2008. As noted earlier at 
[3]
, Teresa has obtained interlocutory judgment against Michael.
20     In her statement of claim Teresa alleged that Jonathan had fraudulently or negligently misrepresented to her that Michael’s scheme was genuine, which caused her to advance monies to Michael under the three Agreements which were never repaid. Teresa claimed damages from Jonathan in respect of those losses. Aside from the three Agreements, Teresa had also advanced other sums to Michael between 2002 and 2005, presumably in connection with Michael’s scheme, and accordingly claimed recovery of those sums from Jonathan. The details of the additional payments are as follows:

Investment with Michael
 
21     It was not disputed that Jonathan was never involved in the three investments set out in the above table. Those investments were made between Teresa and Michael and were wholly separate from the three Agreements. In fact, it was Teresa herself who drafted the agreements for the three investments
Fraudulent misrepresentation
22     It was unclear whether Michael was the ultimate mastermind behind this entire fraud or whether he had been similarly deceived and ended up dragging many other victims down with him. In the light of the letter from CAD (referred to at 
[17]
 above), and the fact that he had not absconded by the time these proceedings began, it is more than likely that Michael too was a victim of fraud. The real perpetrators of the fraud were those who had masqueraded as Paul Smith, Peter Bockli, and the numerous other individuals and organisations with whom Michael and Jonathan had corresponded and who remain scot-free to this date.
23     Although Michael was probably not complicit in the fraud, the evidence at trial strongly suggested that he had, in any event, been dishonest with Teresa and the other investors from whom he procured funds. Teresa and Jonathan both testified that Michael had told them he was a director for Asia of a bank called the “Swiss-Euro Credit Bank”, and had even given them name cards so stating. However, his professed identity was clearly false as no such bank existed. No one really knew what Michael did for a living although it came to light in the course of the trial that he had previously been convicted and sentenced to nine years’ jail in 1981 for his involvement in a conspiracy to cheat a bank using false documents to negotiate letters of credit and making false insurance claims. Unfortunately, this was not known to Teresa and the other investors, who only knew Michael as a Christian brother in need of financial assistance.
24     Much of the background evidence adduced at the trial was incomplete but from available documents, it seemed fairly obvious that Michael had been lured by unknown scammers with the promise of quick money, and was so eager to lay his hands on his new-found wealth that he was willing to lie about himself and promise the moon and more to third parties so that he could raise the funds needed to unlock the fortune that was awaiting him. The critical question to ask is whether Jonathan was complicit in Michael’s dishonesty in promoting the scheme to Teresa.
25     In this regard, Jonathan testified that he had also been a victim of, rather than an accomplice to, Michael’s schemes. He deposed in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) that even before the present fraud involving the US$45.8m with First Merchant Bank arose, he had already lost money in a separate and unrelated investment scheme that Michael had introduced to him. The scheme apparently involved the raising of S$100,000 to pay for the release of cash in diplomatic courier boxes located in London. Jonathan deposed that he, together with his pastor friend Pattamuckil John Johney (“Pastor John”), invested some money in the scheme along with some monies belonging to their church (they had convinced their church council to authorise the investment). However, to date, they had yet to receive any payment from Michael from that investment.
26     Jonathan further explained that when the present scheme to retrieve the US$45.8m from First Merchant Bank came up, Michael had approached Jonathan and Pastor John for more money. However, they had no more funds to invest and that was when Jonathan suggested that Teresa might be interested. Jonathan thus introduced Michael to Teresa. Jonathan said that from then on, the only role he played in the entire scheme was as Michael’s solicitor. Thus, for the next three years, Jonathan was the person who corresponded with the fictitious persons and organisations on Michael’s behalf, and who drafted the various agreements between Michael and his investors. The only additional investment he made was when he and Teresa paid Michael US$5,000 and US$10,000 respectively pursuant to the Third Agreement.
27     Finally, Jonathan also testified (in re-examination) that he was never paid by Michael for the introduction to Teresa or for any other assistance he had rendered to Michael. Jonathan explained that he did not bill Michael for his legal services because there was no prospect of his being paid and he did not want to be taxed on those unpaid bills had they been rendered.
28     I find that Jonathan had acted honestly when he introduced Teresa to Michael and informed her about the latter’s scheme. As I mentioned earlier (at 
[22]
 above), it appeared from the evidence that even Michael himself was unaware that the entire scheme was a scam. That being the case, Jonathan, who was acting on Michael’s instructions, would similarly be unaware of the fraud. Although Michael did behave dishonestly in representing himself as a banker, I did not think that Jonathan would have known of this as he had no reason to suspect Michael at the material time.
29     Even if Michael was indeed knowingly complicit in the entire fraud, the evidence adduced at the trial was nevertheless more than enough to exonerate Jonathan. There were numerous documents detailing Jonathan’s correspondence with the faceless individuals who had assumed the identities of Paul Smith, Peter Bockli, and the other fictitious parties who were supposedly in control of the US$45.8m belonging to Michael. Those letters and emails were solely between Jonathan and such other party and showed that Jonathan had been negotiating and arranging for Michael’s payment of whatever taxes and fees that were needed for the release of the US$45.8m. Since all those letters had not been created for the benefit of any other person, the only possible inference was that Jonathan had truly believed Michael’s scheme was genuine and was dutifully conveying his client’s instructions to the fictitious individuals at the other end.
30     Initially, it was difficult to believe that Jonathan could have acted as Michael’s solicitor throughout without realising that the entire scheme was a scam. The many letters sent to Michael and Jonathan by the supposed BIMF and UBS officials were written in an unprofessional manner in poor English, while the documents they sent “evidencing” Michael’s ownership of the US$45.8m looked dubious and amateurish. Moreover, the mere fact that further payments were being demanded each time without any sight of the promised money should have been cause for suspicion. Nonetheless, it is a truism that things always look clearer in hindsight and the evidence clearly showed that Jonathan was taken in by Michael’s schemes at that time, even after Teresa and the other investors had been anxiously waiting for their money for months and even years. Since Jonathan himself had invested some money with Michael, it was more than likely that he wanted to believe that Michael’s schemes were real and had adopted an attitude of what can only be described as foolish optimism.
31     Counsel for Teresa (Mr S Gunaseelan) pointed out that Jonathan had continued to prepare agreements for Michael and his investors even after January 2004, when he knew that CAD was already investigating Michael’s affairs. However, Jonathan’s explanation, which I accept, was that in January 2004, CAD had only asked him to provide them with documents relating to the US$45.8m account with First Merchant Bank since he was Michael’s solicitor. He was not given any other information and he was not privy to CAD’s investigations. It was only when CAD sent its letter dated 13 July 2006 to Michael (referred to at 
[17]
 above), advising him to refrain from soliciting further loans, that Jonathan ceased to prepare any further agreements for Michael.
32     Mr Gunaseelan also took issue with Jonathan’s failure to call Michael as a witness. However, while Michael would certainly be in a position to shed more light on the relationship between himself, Teresa and Jonathan, I do not think an adverse inference should be drawn against Jonathan since the existing evidence was sufficient to show that Jonathan had acted honestly. I do not believe Michael’s evidence would have added anything to the facts that were already adduced in court from the parties and/or from their witnesses. There were no gaps in the testimony that required Michael’s input to fill.
33     For the above reasons, I am of the view that Teresa’s claim for fraudulent misrepresentation against Jonathan is unsustainable. Jonathan may have been a fool to accept without question whatever Michael said but he was certainly not a knave.
Negligent misrepresentation
34     The only other issue left to decide is whether Jonathan is liable to Teresa for negligent misrepresentation. This in turn depends on whether Jonathan had assumed responsibility to Teresa for whatever assurances he had given her about Michael’s scheme, and whether Teresa had relied on such assurances to her detriment in circumstances as to give rise to a duty of care.
Teresa’s evidence
35     Teresa deposed in her AEIC that in July 2002, Jonathan came into her office and told her that he wished to share a secret with her. He then told her about Michael whom he described as a “very committed Christian” and a “high-powered senior international banker”. Jonathan claimed that Michael was managing an international fund which was making lots of money and wanted to use it to bless fellow Christians. This was the US$45.8m account with First Merchant Bank. Jonathan then brought up the problem about the tax which had to be paid to BIMF and said that Michael was trying to raise money from Christian friends to pay this tax. He also informed Teresa that he had already recommended her to Michael to join this project and “be blessed” since he had received many blessings from her in the past and wanted to return the favour. Jonathan also mentioned that some of the Christian friends whom Michael had chosen to “bless” were already in the project with him.
36     Teresa went on to say that she was hesitant to get involved at the time because she was not a risk-taker by nature. Jonathan, however, assured her that he had verified that the fund was real because he had been to London with Michael and Pastor John and met the relevant people. Even then, she still asked him several times whether the investment was safe, to which he replied that she could trust him and he would do all the work for her, including all the due diligence, legal documentation, monitoring and follow-up work. To give added protection, Jonathan offered to draft an agreement between Teresa and Michael, and suggested including high percentages of returns as a reward for Teresa’s participation. Jonathan also suggested adding in a clause that if Teresa did not receive her money in full by a particular date, she would be entitled to a penalty payment.
37     Despite all this, Teresa was still hesitant to commit herself. Jonathan then told her that BIMF had stipulated a timeline for payment of the tax and if this tax was not paid in time, Michael’s scheme would fail and the other Christians in the scheme would not be able to receive their blessings. Teresa thus felt pressured to step in and help Michael and the other investors. It was on this basis that Jonathan introduced Teresa to Michael, which led to the conclusion of the First Agreement. Even on 17 July 2002, the day the First Agreement was supposed to be signed, Teresa still had doubts about the matter. However, Jonathan assured her that Michael’s scheme was not an investment, but a Christian scheme and God-sent opportunity for them and other Christians. He told her again to trust him and reassured her that the transaction was safe. Consequently, Teresa signed the First Agreement.
38     Throughout the subsequent three tumultuous years, when Teresa was induced to enter into the Second and Third Agreements and part with more and more sums of money to Michael, Jonathan kept telling Teresa to trust him and that she would get her monies back soon. At one point, Jonathan told her that Michael had a very nice and expensive apartment in Clementi which he had visited. Thus, even if Michael failed to return Teresa her monies, he could still sell the apartment and use its proceeds to pay her.
39     There were many other details in Teresa’s AEIC which need not be repeated here but suffice it to say, the gist of her testimony was that she had put complete trust and reliance on Jonathan, who assured her repeatedly that Michael’s scheme was safe and that he had done the required due diligence. She thus felt cheated and betrayed by Jonathan when Michael’s entire scheme fell apart.
40     Lastly, Teresa also relied on the evidence of several investors who subsequently came into Michael’s scheme when he was raising money to fund the 2% European Union Tax (see 
[13]
 above). Those investors testified that they had been introduced to Michael by mutual Christian friends and had given him various sums of money in connection with his scheme. They also gave evidence that they had relied on Jonathan (to differing degrees) in deciding to enter into the scheme.
Jonathan’s evidence
41     Jonathan’s evidence was far more concise and very different. He deposed that he was first introduced to Michael in late 2001 by Pastor John. Pastor John (DW2) testified for Jonathan and said that he himself became acquainted with Michael earlier that same year through a mutual friend. Shortly after Michael got to know Jonathan and Pastor John, he approached both of them with an investment proposal, which was the diplomatic courier boxes investment referred to earlier (at 
[25]
 above). However, the returns on that investment did not materialise because the British Home Office was apparently asking for a Certificate of Release and until this was arranged, the funds could not be released. In 2002, Michael again approached them for help in relation to the US$45.8m in First Merchant Bank. Michael acknowledged that he still owed Jonathan and Pastor John the monies from their earlier investment and promised to repay them.
42     As I noted earlier (at 
[26]
 above), Jonathan said that he and Pastor John had no more money to invest at that time and this was when Jonathan thought Teresa might be interested in Michael’s scheme. He thus introduced Teresa to Michael and from then on, the main discussions on the investment took place between Teresa and Michael directly. It was Michael who showed her the various documents relating to the existence of the US$45.8m fund and who assured her of the authenticity of the scheme. As for the legal documentation, it was Teresa and not Jonathan who dictated the terms of the three Agreements she signed with Michael. When various hurdles cropped up which required the payment of more monies, Teresa went to Michael for answers instead of Jonathan. Jonathan further deposed that his last contact with Teresa prior to this suit was when she met him and another colleague for lunch (this was at the end of 2005 shortly after she left Raffles Law Group Practice). The summary of Jonathan’s evidence therefore was that he was involved in the scheme solely as Michael’s solicitor and this was a fact known to Teresa. He did not assume any responsibility towards her and neither did she rely on him in her decision to invest in the scheme.
The findings
43     Teresa and Jonathan gave diametrically opposing versions of events such that if I were to accept one side’s version, it would naturally mean that the other side had not been truthful. Having considered the evidence, I am inclined to favour Jonathan’s version of events over Teresa’s, for a number of reasons which are set out below.
No evidence that Teresa had blamed Jonathan
44     First, there was no evidence that Teresa had even once blamed Jonathan when the returns on her investment never materialised, or even when she realised the entire scheme of Michael’s was a complete scam. On the contrary, the emails produced at trial clearly showed that Teresa looked only to Michael for her money. For example, there was an email to Michael dated 4 September 2002 in which Teresa expressed her unhappiness about the delay in receiving her returns from the Second Agreement, and asked for his reassurance that he would use his own funds to repay her if the monies from the US$45.8m did not materialise. The following paragraph from the email is particularly telling:
To arrive at a closure next week, I would like to see your sincerity towards me and the return of trust (
since you have asked me to trust you so many times
... this is one time I am asking you to return that trust)...
[emphasis added]
The above paragraph showed that it was Michael, rather than Jonathan, who had repeatedly asked Teresa to trust in his scheme.
45     There were also two other emails dated 1 and 5 August 2003 in which Teresa again blamed only Michael (in much harsher tones) for the continued delays in receiving her money. Although she did mention in the earlier email that Jonathan and Pastor John had a hand in convincing her to invest her money, her unhappiness was directed only at Michael. Finally, in an email to Michael dated 9 February 2004, Teresa wrote:
Tai Kor [this was how Teresa addressed Michael then],
I observe that everybody in your deal gets to know what’s happening, except me. [Pastor John’s] group is continuously updated by Jonathan, whereas Philip, John and Johnson are continuously updated by you, and they would in turn update their investors.
As part of your professionalism and ethics, you should inform me continuously too as I am a large investor, and you should do it 
automatically
 instead of waiting for me to ask. ...
[emphasis in original]
46     All the above emails strongly suggested that it was Michael, not Jonathan, in whom Teresa placed her trust and who Teresa expected would update her with news of her investment. Teresa did not produce a single email or letter to Jonathan in which she sought to blame him for her predicament, despite her assertions that she had relied on him completely to look out for her interests. Although Teresa mentioned in cross-examination that she did write a few angry emails to Jonathan accusing him of putting her in the current mess, she was unable to produce any of those at trial with the excuse that she was unable to locate them. I did not believe her explanation as she had no trouble producing emails she wrote to Michael between 2002 and 2004.
47     Teresa also testified that it was around 2004 to 2005 that she concluded that she had been the victim of a fraud perpetrated by Michael and Jonathan. This was when she was still with Raffles Law Group Practice. Despite this, after she left the group, she was still able to have lunch with Jonathan and one Mok Ching Tee who was the leader of the group. When Teresa was cross-examined on this, she claimed that the purpose of that lunch was to return her office keys to Mok. She also denied inviting Jonathan to the lunch, but had simply told Mok that he could bring Jonathan along if he so wished. I found her explanation to be unconvincing because if she was indeed angry with Jonathan, she would not even have brought his name up in the first place let alone lunch with him. It was also not disputed that Teresa did not say anything to Jonathan at the lunch which would suggest that she blamed him for being cheated.
48     On the evidence, it is to be noted that the first time Teresa actually pointed the finger at Jonathan was when she wrote to CAD on 15 April 2008 accusing Michael and Jonathan of drawing her into the scam with false assurances. I gave little weight to her self-serving letter because it was obvious that by then Teresa was about to sue Jonathan.
Evidence that showed Teresa was in control and dictated the terms of her various agreements with Michael
49     I also did not believe Teresa’s story that it was Jonathan who had included the attractive terms in the three agreements to entice her to invest in Michael’s scheme. Jonathan produced a note in Teresa’s own handwriting in which she had written out several terms which were eventually incorporated into the Second Agreement. Teresa’s explanation in her AEIC was that Jonathan had suggested those terms for her to scribble down, and she later gave those notes to him for reference when he prepared her agreements with Michael. I found Teresa’s explanation unconvincing. The simpler and more probable explanation was that those terms were dictated by Teresa herself and she scribbled the note to Jonathan because she knew he was Michael’s solicitor.
50     A more damning piece of evidence was to be found in a letter from Jonathan to Teresa dated 12 August 2002. In the letter, Jonathan wrote:
Hi Teresa
 
SECOND INVESTMENT AGREEMENT
 
Enclosed is a Draft Agreement as requested.
Please note the following:
1.    I have spoken to Michael Ng about the broad principles, i.e. that you want 150% return on your 2
nd
 Investment and he has agreed. However, please note that with regard to the 1
st
 Investment of SGD150,000.00, he is offering to pay you 5% on SGD300,000.00 on late payment.
2.    I have 
not
 spoken to Michael about the following:
(i)    S$5,000.00 per day for late payment on the 2
nd
 Investment;
(ii)   Regarding his consent to enter into judgment for the sale of his flat (on second thoughts, it sounds a bit too harsh), perhaps you may want to waive this in good faith.
[emphasis in original]
51     It was clearly evident from the above letter that Teresa was the person dictating the terms of the agreements she signed with Michael, contrary to her assertion that Jonathan had voluntarily offered to include those terms “as a reward” for her participation. Teresa subsequently gave another handwritten note dated 15 August 2002 to Jonathan in which she stipulated the various modes of payment to her when the monies from her investment came in.
52     Even more telling was the fact that, Teresa personally entered into three further investment agreements with Michael (of which Jonathan was unaware until the commencement of these proceedings) after she had already signed the three agreements with Michael. Teresa claimed in her AEIC that Michael had needed to borrow money urgently on those occasions and that he had suggested that she draw up an agreement using the format of the agreements Jonathan usually drafted. This explanation was not credible and could not conceal the fact that even after the three agreements, when Teresa’s monies were not forthcoming, she was still willing to invest more money with Michael and continued to dictate the terms of her investments. Although Jonathan was not involved in those later investment agreements, Teresa nevertheless claimed damages from him under those transactions.
53     In the light of such evidence, I find that Teresa was untruthful when she said that she only entered into Michael’s scheme because she felt pressured by Jonathan to help Michael and his other investors receive their “Christian blessings”. She saw Michael’s scheme as an attractive investment, she knew what she wanted therefrom and she was clearly in control at all times. Teresa was not a babe in the woods who relied heavily on Jonathan to protect her interests.
Evidence from Teresa’s other witnesses.
54     As noted earlier (at 
[40]
 above), Teresa called several witnesses who had invested in Michael’s scheme after September 2003, to testify that they had relied on Jonathan. I gave no weight to their evidence because it was irrelevant. The factual issue for this court to determine was whether Jonathan had assumed responsibility towards Teresa and whether Teresa had in turn relied on Jonathan to protect her interests. As such, it did not matter whether Michael’s other investors had relied on Jonathan as they only came into the picture well after Teresa had agreed to participate in the scheme.
55     In any event I also found that those witnesses were, for the most part, unreliable. It bears noting that the only person Jonathan had introduced into Michael’s scheme was Teresa. In fact, Jonathan had never met any of the other investors prior to their investing in Michael’s scheme. Despite this, many of the investors gave evidence that they felt at ease and confident of the scheme upon meeting Jonathan simply because of his status as a lawyer and church leader, and the fact that he practiced at an “impressive office”. This was a blatant attempt on their part to support Teresa’s case. It was also not lost on this court that despite their purported reliance on Jonathan, none of the witnesses have sued Jonathan for the losses they suffered in participating in Michael’s scheme.
56     A number of the witnesses went further and alleged that Jonathan had assured them he had been to London with Michael and personally verified the existence of the US$45.8m fund. This was categorically denied by Jonathan, who said that the only time he had been to London with Michael was in 2001 along with Pastor John, which trip related to their investment with the diplomatic courier boxes and had nothing to do with the US$45.8m in First Merchant Bank. I accept Jonathan’s evidence and find that the witnesses were untruthful.
Other factual inconsistencies
57     There were many other factual inconsistencies in Teresa’s evidence which cast doubts on her veracity. She mentioned in her AEIC that sometime in 2003, Michael had told her that he had quarrelled with Jonathan because Jonathan had apparently demanded US$1m each for himself and Pastor John as a fee for introducing Teresa to his scheme. I found this story to be incredible because Teresa’s total investment did not even reach US$1m. It was also not explained in any event why Teresa did not confront Jonathan or at least seek an explanation from him on Michael’s allegation.
58     Teresa’s story that Jonathan was promoting Michael’s scheme as a means to bless fellow Christians from the start also made little sense because it seemed from the evidence that she was the only investor at the time when Michael was raising money to pay the BIMF tax. It was only much later, when the Nigerian government purportedly transferred the US$45.8m to UBS and Michael started raising money for the 2% European Union Tax, that there were records of other investors getting involved.
59     Teresa also mentioned in her AEIC that she had lodged a caveat over Michael’s HDB flat in March 2003 to protect her interests. Aside from evidencing that Teresa was capable of looking after her own interests, this fact contradicted her earlier evidence that Jonathan told her that Michael had an “expensive apartment” which he could sell to pay her back if the investment failed.
Demeanour of the witnesses at trial
60     I formed the view that Jonathan was a far more credible witness from observing his demeanour at trial. Jonathan answered questions in a forthright manner and was candid in cross-examination, even admitting to the court when he was questioned, that it did not occur to him from the contents and the letterhead, that a letter dated 15 July 2002 Michael received from a firm called Michael Baileys & Co (who were purportedly the English solicitors for First Merchant Bank) could not have been genuine. The court had pointed out to Jonathan that English solicitors would sign their letters and it was not usual to stamp the firm’s name with a date and leave the letter unsigned. The letterhead also appeared suspicious as it looked like it had been generated by a computer together with the address which was appended at the bottom of the letter. Moreover, a firm of English solicitors was unlikely to make such mistakes as writing “$480,000. Us Dollars” with the letter ‘s’ in lower case. Jonathan revealed that he was not familiar with UK solicitors. The court also drew to Jonathan’s attention that the letter purportedly sent by Dr Paul Smith of the British International Monitory Fund Tax Office Department dated 15 July 2002 could not possibly have been genuine because of the misspelling of the word “monetary” not to mention it was also chopped with a rubber stamp. Again, Jonathan admitted that it did not strike him as unusual that a person would sign and put a rubber stamp on the letter. Neither did Jonathan suspect that the word ‘monitory’ should actually be ‘monetary’.
61     I should point out that Jonathan was called to the local Bar in 1998 and his field of practice was in bread-and-butter areas such as family law and debt collection. Consequently, Jonathan had no experience of and would not be familiar with non-Singapore law firms or with international bodies and organisations let alone international financial institutions. He was certainly naïve but he was not dishonest.
62     Teresa’s demeanour, on the other hand, was far too dramatic and gave the impression that she was putting on an act for the court’s benefit. While she initially seemed genuinely aggrieved at Jonathan for his role in the scam, she ultimately seemed too eager to answer counsel’s questions at times to the point where she volunteered many unnecessary details. Teresa’s oral testimony was also reflective of her AEIC; it was embellished to the extent that it no longer sounded believable. Teresa might have said a lot more than Jonathan but ultimately she left too many important questions unanswered.
Teresa’s email of 17 February 2004
63     I pause here to deal with one of the few documents that actually supported Teresa’s case. In her email dated 17 February 2004 to one Johnson Wong (who was her witness), Teresa wrote:
Actually, until I got involved with Michael’s deal, life was a breeze for me. No worries except for the passion of practising law to help people get the justice they want. Then came Michael’s deal. I got involved merely out of the good heartedness of mine to help release the funds of those who had already sunk all they had in it, and had been awaiting desperately for a long time. I was thus convinced by Jonathan and [Pastor John] to get involved to help. I trusted them cos [
sic
] I thought I was dealing with Christians, pastors, and church money and since they needed help and it was supposed to be for a short period only (one month was what Michael and gang told me!!!), that I lent them all I got [
sic
] !!! Never realize [
sic
] how foolish it was of me to trust people so much. Then when I got into trouble with UOB, Michael kept telling me not to worry ...he would do something to help me. That promise went by for one and a half years!!! And he never delivered. That’s why I am so cross with him. He broke my trust over and over again, until now I worry whether the deal is a scam or not.
64     Although Teresa’s email did give some credence to her story that she got involved with Michael’s scheme at Jonathan’s persuasion and without any intention of profit, this alone was not enough to tip the scales to her side given the other overwhelming evidence in favour of Jonathan. It was possible that by the time she wrote this email, she was having doubts about the entire scheme but still refused to accept, emotionally, that she might have been fooled by the prospect of a quick profit. She may have wanted to help Michael, Jonathan and Pastor John along the way but this was certainly not the only or even the primary reason for her agreeing to participate in the scheme. It is also noteworthy that even in this email, Teresa was blaming only Michael and not Jonathan for breaking her trust.
65     I have no doubt that Jonathan and Pastor John did play 
some
 part in convincing Teresa to participate in Michael’s scheme as this was borne out by some of the emails Teresa wrote. I also note that both of them had a vested interest in convincing Teresa to invest her monies because if Michael was able to retrieve the US$45.8m from First Merchant Bank, he would then be able to pay them the returns from their previous investment with the diplomatic courier boxes. Nevertheless, in the light of the other factors I have highlighted above, I find that Jonathan had neither given any assurance to Teresa that he would look out for her interests, nor did he assume any responsibility for whatever he told her about Michael’s scheme. I also find that Teresa in any event did not rely on Jonathan. She well knew that Jonathan was acting only as Michael’s solicitor and she placed her trust in Michael alone. Consequently, there was no duty of care owed by Jonathan to Teresa. He is therefore not liable to her for any negligent statements he might have made.
Conclusion
66     The fraud in issue was a very unfortunate episode for all the people who were involved in Michael’s scheme and is a stark reminder of the adage that if a deal looks too good to be true, it probably is. While the court is not unsympathetic to Teresa for the losses she has suffered, it was clearly disingenuous of her to attempt to blame those losses on Jonathan. It was unfair of Teresa to repeatedly accuse Jonathan in cross-examination of being a liar when the objective evidence showed otherwise.
67     For the reasons given earlier, I dismiss Teresa’s claim against Jonathan with costs on a standard basis to be taxed unless otherwise agreed.",2011-03-25 00:00:00,SG High Court

That scenario involves three potentially problematic features.  The first feature is the issue and utilisation of so called “three condition” search warrants which define the object of the search in a broad, non-specific fashion.  The warrants are often lengthy, overly complex and, regrettably, sometimes poorly drafted.  The second feature is that the execution of the warrants is frequently, and unavoidably, carried out by teams of officers, many of whom have had little or no past involvement in the relevant investigation.  The officers accordingly have little or no background knowledge or experience to assist them in the often complex and difficult task of executing the warrants.  That frequently results in the execution of the warrants in a manner which is apt to create the perception, at least, that the officers do not really know what they should be searching for or seizing, and are instead simply seizing anything that looks even remotely like it might be relevant to the investigation.  The third feature is that the execution of the warrants these days almost invariably involves the search and seizure of computer equipment and electronic data storage devices.  That circumstances requires the executing officers, or forensic officers who are assisting them, to navigate the labyrinthine statutory provisions that deal with the search and seizure of such items.  2    The confluence of these three features often results in a judicial review challenge, by the occupier of the premises that were the subject of the warrants, or persons otherwise affected by the execution of the warrants (usually the target of the criminal investigation), to both the issue and execution of the warrants in question.  Orders are generally sought for the return of the items said to have been unlawfully seized.  Frequently that comprises a vast quantity of material.3    That is what has occurred in this matter.OVERVIEW OF FACTS, ISSUES & CONTENTIONS 4    On 23 January 2015, a member of the Australian Federal Police applied for, and a magistrate issued, search warrants pursuant to s 3E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) in respect of five premises and two motor vehicles located in Western Australia.  A further search warrant was applied for and issued in respect of other premises on 4 March 2015.  The search warrants were applied for as part of a joint criminal investigation being undertaken by the AFP and the Australian Taxation Office.  That investigation focused on the activities of Mr Allen Caratti, Mr Carrati’s de facto partner, Ms Tina Bazzo, and various companies allegedly associated with them.  Those companies included Starbrake Pty Ltd, Whitby Land Company Pty Ltd, Westend Asset Pty Ltd, Mammoth Nominees Pty Ltd, Mammoth Investments Pty Ltd, Forest Hope Pty Ltd and Gucce Holdings Pty Ltd.  The premises and motor vehicles covered by the search warrants included residential premises linked to Mr Caratti, business premises associated with the relevant companies, and premises associated with lawyers and advisers who had apparently been retained by Mr Caratti to provide advice in relation to the transactions the subject of the investigation. 5    The search warrants issued on 23 January 2015 were executed by members of the AFP (or “Federal Agents” as they apparently like to be called), assisted by employees of the ATO (or “tax officers” as they tend to be called), on various days between 28 and 30 January 2015.  The 4 March 2015 search warrant was executed on 5 March 2015.  The Federal Agents who executed the warrants seized a very large number of documents and other items, mainly computers and electronic storage devices, that they believed fell within the terms of the warrants.6    Mr Caratti promptly commenced this proceeding against the Commissioner of the AFP, the magistrate who issued the warrants, the Commissioner of Taxation, a number of individual Federal Agents and a tax officer.  He challenged both the validity of the search warrants and the lawfulness of the actions of the Federal Agents and tax officers pursuant to (or purportedly pursuant to) the warrants.  The relief sought by Mr Caratti, pursuant to both the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) and s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), included various declarations as well as orders quashing the decisions to issue the search warrants.  It would be fair to say, however, that the principal relief sought by Mr Caratti was the return of the items seized under the warrants.  7    The proceedings were defended by the Commissioner of the AFP.  The magistrate who issued the search warrants filed a submitting appearance.  The claims against the individual officers were dropped.  Mr Caratti ultimately did not press any claims for relief against the Commissioner of Taxation.8    While Mr Carrati’s claims have at times lacked clarity and have undergone a somewhat dramatic metamorphosis over time (including during the hearing), they ultimately raised four broad categories of issues.  9    First, were the search warrants lawfully issued?  Was the information before the issuing officer (the magistrate) capable of establishing the criteria or conditions for the issue of a search warrant in s 3E of the Crimes Act?  Were there defects on the face of the warrants that meant that the warrants did not properly define the scope of the authorised search and seizure? Mr Caratti’s main arguments concerning the validity of the warrants related to, or arose from, what he contended were defective or deficient descriptions of the offences to which the warrants related.  10    Second, did the Federal Agents who executed the warrants, and the tax officers who assisted them, engage in conduct that was not authorised by the warrants or the relevant provisions of the Crimes Act?  In particular, did they intentionally or unintentionally search for or seize items that they were not authorised to seize under the warrants?  Did they otherwise act unreasonably, excessively or improperly?  Mr Caratti’s basic contentions were that the executing officers and the officers assisting them did not understand (and indeed could not understand) the warrant conditions, in particular the descriptions of the offences in the third condition of the warrants, and did not seize items by reference to the warrants.  Rather, they acted instead on the basis of instructions (written and oral) provided by certain tax officers which, in Mr Caratti’s submission, were based on a flawed understanding of the warrant conditions.  11    Third, were certain computers and other items of electronic equipment lawfully seized pursuant to the warrants and the specific provisions in the Crimes Act that deal with the search and seizure of such items?  In particular, did the executing officers properly turn their minds to whether only the data on the equipment, as opposed to the equipment itself, fell within the terms of the warrants?  Were the circumstances such that the executing officers should have copied the data on the equipment, as they were authorised to do under the relevant statutory provisions, rather than seize the equipment? 12    Fourth, if any of these questions are answered in the affirmative, with the result that some or all of the items seized under the warrants were not lawfully seized, what is the appropriate remedy?  In particular, should the Commissioner of the AFP be ordered to return all unlawfully seized items to Mr Caratti?  Does the Court retain the discretion to refrain from ordering the return of items found to have been unlawfully seized under a search warrant?UNCONTROVERSIAL FACTS 13    The parties read a large number of affidavits, some of them very lengthy.  They also tendered an equally large number of documentary exhibits.  Most of the evidence concerned the actions of the Federal Agents and tax officers before and during the execution of the warrants.  Many, if not most, of the deponents of affidavits were cross-examined, generally to little effect. At the end of the day, most of the evidence, and most of the cross-examination, was of little, if any, moment in resolving the key issues. 14    Following is a brief summary of the material facts established by evidence which was either uncontroversial or not substantially challenged.  The contentious facts will be considered later in the context of the grounds of Mr Caratti’s challenge to the execution of the warrants and the seizure of specific items.The joint investigation 15    In May 2014, the AFP and the ATO entered into an agreement, called a “Joint Agency Agreement”, to conduct a joint investigation into “suspected non-declaration of income, the deception of the ATO in order to refrain or limit the taxation paid by the CARATTI Group and the deception of the ATO in order to dishonestly obtain tax refunds”.  The joint investigation was to be called “Operation Caballus” (curiously, the Latin expression for “horse”).16    The agreement provided the following background to the investigation.  In 2008, Project CABALLUS was formed by the ATO to identify risks associated with the principal individuals of the CARATTI Group, primarily Allen CARATTI, born 24 February 1956 (CARATTI) and his de facto partner Tina BAZZO (BAZZO), born 24 February 1966.  The CARATTI Group has a history of non-compliance with the ATO dating back to the 1970’s and despite the continued scrutiny of the ATO and repeated audits they continue to operate in a highly non-complaint manner.  Operation CABALLUS will investigate the CARATTI group’s involvement in false or misleading lodgement of business income tax returns and business activity statements, the non-declaration of income, the provision of forged documents, the deception of the ATO in order to refrain or limit the taxation paid by their companies and the deception of the ATO in order to dishonestly obtain refunds from the ATO.It is estimated that the value of the alleged fraudulent activity is greater than $15 million. 17    The “mission” of Operation Caballus was said to include the investigation and prosecution of offences alleged to have been committed by members of the so-called “Caratti Group”, including Mr Caratti, Ms Bazzo and companies allegedly associated with them.  Those offences were said to include forgery, contrary to s 145.1 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), and fraud upon the ATO, contrary to various provisions in Part 7.3 of the Criminal Code.  The AFP’s “primary focus” was to lead the investigation and prosecution of any Criminal Code offences.  The ATO’s primary focus was to support the investigation and prosecution of those offences.  It was specifically envisaged that the AFP would apply for and execute search warrants with “support” from the ATO.  Federal Agent Alexander Nicholson was appointed senior investigating officer of Operation Caballus.  18    It is clear from the evidence of Federal Agent Nicholson, together with various operational documents prepared in the course of the investigation (including the Terms of Reference and Investigation Plan of Operation Caballus), that information concerning the suspected offences by Mr Caratti first emerged in the context of audits conducted by the ATO into the taxation affairs of Mr Caratti and companies allegedly owned, controlled or managed by him or Ms Bazzo.  The ATO had referred that information to the AFP for the investigation of suspected serious criminal offences.  The ATO was to assist the AFP in the investigation and possible prosecution of those offences.  The effect of the largely unchallenged evidence of Federal Agent Nicholson was that, while there was a nexus with the ongoing or past ATO audits, the criminal investigation was not intended in any way to assist the ATO in relation to that audit activity. To the extent that the purpose of Operation Caballus included any assistance to the ATO, the assistance was to be provided to the ATO’s criminal investigation arm in respect of possible offences under the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth).19    The evidence concerning the purpose and respective roles of the AFP and ATO in pursuance of Operation Caballus was initially of some importance.  That was because Mr Caratti’s challenge to the issue and execution of the warrants initially included a claim that the AFP applied for the warrants for improper and unlawful purposes.  The unlawful purposes were alleged to include the sharing of “financial information” with the ATO so as to assist the ATO in issuing assessments or amended assessments to Mr Carratti, Ms Bazzo or the companies associated with them.  It was also contended that any purpose of assisting the ATO to prosecute offences under the Taxation Administration Act would be unlawful.  It is, however, unnecessary to consider those contentions or the evidence that was led in relation to them.  That is because ultimately Mr Caratti did no pursue any claims involving the allegation of improper or unlawful purpose. 20    It would appear that of the various ATO “referrals” to the AFP, four specific groups of allegations or transactions became the main focus of the joint criminal investigation.  The following summary of the four groups of allegations is based largely on the affidavit sworn in support of the search warrant application.The Starbrake allegations 21    The first group of allegations concerned a company called Starbrake Pty Ltd.  At the relevant time Mr Caratti was a director of Starbrake and beneficially owned all of its shares.  In late 2004 Starbrake purchased land at 52 Callaway Street, Wangara, Western Australia.  In July 2008, Starbrake granted a company called Rocla Pty Ltd a lease and exclusive licence to extract sand from the Callaway Street property.  Rocla allegedly paid Starbrake $7,700,000 (inclusive of GST of $700,000) as either a royalty payment, payment for the grant of the licence, or as a prepayment for sand to be extracted from the land.22    On 17 October 2008 Starbrake lodged a Business Activity Statement (BAS) for the purposes of A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth) (GST Act).  The BAS was referrable to the period 1 July 2008 to 30 September 2008.  Starbrake did not declare, or otherwise bring to account in the BAS, the $700,000 portion of the payment received by it which represented the GST collected in relation to its supply of the licence (or extracted sand) to Rocla.23    In February 2012 Starbrake lodged its income tax return for the year ending 30 June 2009.  The income declared or disclosed in the return did not include the $7,000,000 payment (excluding GST) received from Rocla.24    The ATO conducted an audit of Starbrake.  In the course of that audit, the ATO ascertained that Starbrake’s general ledger recorded the $7,700,000 receipt by Starbrake as a loan from Mammoth Nominees Pty Ltd.  Mr Caratti was a director and sectary of Mammoth Nominees.  The registered office of Mammoth Nominees was Mr Caratti’s home address.  The ATO also obtained copies of emails sent to and received by Mr Joseph Catenacci, an accountant or tax agent who appears to have been retained by Starbrake.  Those emails suggested that the accounting classification of the $7,700,000 receipt by Starbrake was changed in about December 2011.  It was originally classified as income, however in December 2011 Mr Catenacci was allegedly instructed to classify the receipt as a loan from Mammoth Nominees.  25    The allegation being investigated was that Mr Caratti, as sole director of Starbrake, directed the reclassification of the receipt from Rocla so as to obtain a financial benefit.  That financial benefit was said to be the understatement of Starbrake’s income for the year ending 30 June 2009, as well as the non-remittance to the ATO of the GST collected by Starbrake (the GST portion of the payment) in relation to its supply to Rocla.  That remittance should have been included as part of the BAS for the quarter ending 30 September 2008. The Westend allegations 26    The second group of allegations concerned a company called Westend Asset Pty Ltd.  The sole director of Westend was Ms Bazzo’s mother, Ms Josephine Bazzo.  Beyond that somewhat indirect connection, there was apparently no evidence to suggest that Mr Caratti had any direct or indirect interest in Westend.  Despite this, it appears that the AFP alleged that Westend was controlled by Mr Caratti.   27    In 2002, Westend purchased land in Darch, Western Australia, for the purposes of undertaking a residential housing development.  It would appear that the land cost somewhere in the order of $7,600,000.  The residential development became known as the Ashdale Mews Estate development.  The development apparently proceeded and in due course Westend sold the developed parcels of land.  Those sales were said to have occurred between September 2003 and December 2008. 28    The ATO commenced an audit of Westend in 2009.  In the course of that audit it was ascertained that Westend had not reported or declared the land sales as part of its business operations for tax purposes.  It had not declared any before tax profits made from its sales of the developed land.  29    In the course of the audit, Westend provided the ATO with copies of tax invoices from Mammoth Nominees addressed to Westend for work supposedly carried out in relation to the development.  Those tax invoices totalled $5,400,000.  Presumably the invoices were provided for the purpose of demonstrating that the expenses reflected in the invoices reduced any pre-tax profit made by Westend from the development.30    During an interview conducted by the ATO in January 2010, Mr Caratti and his tax agent, Mr Hendricus Schokker, told the ATO that the development work reflected in the invoices was in fact carried out by a company called Mammoth Investments Pty Ltd, supposedly on behalf of Mammoth Nominees.  Mr Caratti and various members of his family were directors of Mammoth Investments.31    The allegation being investigated as part of operation Caballus was that the invoices totalling $5,400,000 were false.  An analysis conducted by the ATO from financial records and other information revealed that the cost of any work carried out by Mammoth Investments totalled just over $2,000,000; that Westend never paid Mammoth Investments (or Mammoth Nominees) $5,400,000 in respect of any works, but that the invoices were nevertheless treated as a loan expense; and that the invoices were created in June 2009, after the ATO’s audit had commenced.  Mr Caratti’s brother, Mr John Caratti, told the ATO in the course of an interview that the invoices were false and were created by Mr Caratti.  32    It was alleged, in short, that Mr Caratti created the false invoices to inflate Westend’s expenses in relation to the development and therefore reduce any tax liability in respect of profits earned by Westend from the development.Whitby Land Company allegations 33    The third group of allegations concerned a company called Whitby Land Company Pty Ltd.  Mr Caratti was a director of Whitby Land Company.  34    In January 2008, Whitby Land Company acquired land at 293 Nicholson Road, Forrestdale, Western Australia.  It would appear that Whitby Land Company subdivided and developed the Nicholson Road land into residential lots.  The lots were subsequently sold for a total amount of about $24,000,000.  Those sales appear to have occurred during 2011 and 2012.  35    Despite its involvement in the enterprise responsible for the development and sale of the Nicholson Road land, Whitby Land Company was never registered under the GST Act.  It follows that it never reported or remitted any GST payable and collected by it in respect of its supply of the developed lots.  The ATO assessed Whitby Land Company’s GST liability as being in the order of $1.5 million. 36    The allegation being investigated was that Mr Caratti, as a director of Whitby Land Company, deliberately failed to register Whitby Land Company for GST and deliberately failed to remit the GST portion of the consideration it received from the land sales.  The Gucce Holdings allegations 37    The fourth group of allegations concerned two companies:  Gucce Holdings Pty Ltd and Forest Hope Pty Ltd.  Ms Bazzo was a director of both companies.  Mr Caratti had been a director of Gucce Holdings, though at a time well before the events the subject of the relevant allegations.  He was a director of Forest Hope up to a time just before the most significant events the subject of the investigation.38    In December 2009, Gucce Holdings and Forrest Hope entered into a joint venture agreement in relation to the subdivision of land in Avery, Western Australia.  Gucce had a 50% interest in that land. 39    Gucce Holdings retained Mammoth Nominees to do civil and earth works in relation to the subdivision.  Mammoth Nominees issued forty invoices to Gucce Holdings and Forest Hope in relation to the works.  The invoices totalled $15,040,672.14, including GST of $1,367,344.  Each of the invoices was signed-off by an independent site supervisor.  Between August 2011 and December 2012, Gucce Holdings paid $14,153,499.33 to Mammoth in respect of the work.40    In May 2013, the ATO commenced an audit of Gucce Holdings.  During the audit it was ascertained that Gucce Holdings had claimed input tax credits under the GST Act in respect of the works carried out by Mammoth Nominees.  The input tax credits claimed by Gucce Holdings totalled $2,218,953.22.  In simple terms, the amount of the input tax credits to which Gucce Holdings was legitimately entitled to claim equalled the amount of the GST it paid in respect of Mammoth Nominee’s supplies: see s 11-25 and s 17-5 of the GST Act.  It appeared that Gucce Holdings had claimed more input tax credits than it was legitimately able to claim.41    In the course of the audit, Gucce Holdings endeavoured to support its entitlement to claim input tax credits referable to the supplies by Mammoth Nominees by providing detailed information, including invoices, suggesting that Gucce had in fact paid $22,847,181 to Mammoth Nominees for the works.  That was a considerably larger amount than the amount reflected in the 40 invoices signed off by the independent site supervisor. 42    The allegation being investigated was that Mr Caratti and Ms Bazzo colluded to overstate the input tax credits which Gucce was entitled to claim and created false invoices to substantiate that claim.  The search warrants 43    In January 2015, Federal Agent Nicholson decided that the criminal investigation of the four groups of allegations would be advanced if search warrants were obtained and executed in respect of premises associated with Mr Caratti, Ms Bazzo, the relevant companies and their advisers.  Those premises were:     44 – 48 Wickham Street, East Perth, being the registered business address of Gucce Holdings and Mammoth Nominees;    2 Duncraig Road, Applecross, Western Australia, being Mr Caratti’s residential premises and the registered office of Whitby Land Company;    7 Cornish Turn, Baldivis, Western Australia, being the residential address of Mr Schokker, Mr Caratti’s accountant or tax adviser;    517 Great Eastern Highway, Redcliffe, Western Australia, being the registered business address of Mammoth Investments;     3/14-16 Irvin Street, Perth, Western Australia, being the officers of a firm of solicitors that acted for Starbrake in relation to the purchase of the Calloway Street property;    Unit 4B/176 Main Street, Osborne Park, Western Australia, being the officers of Mr Catanecci, the accountant or tax agent that provided accounting services for Starbrake; and      Two motor vehicles apparently associated with Mr Caratti and Ms Bazzo.  44    Federal Agent Nicholson told the AFP case officer for Operation Caballus, Federal Agent Szolnoki, of the decision to apply for search warrants.  Federal Agent Szolnoki in due course swore an affidavit for the purposes of the application.  That affidavit was sworn on 23 January 2015.  Federal Agent Szolnoki’s evidence was that a draft of the affidavit was provided to Perth Magistrates Court on 22 January 2015.  The magistrate issued and signed search warrants in respect of each of the premises on 27 January 2015. 45    The content of Federal Agent Szolnoki’s affidavit is of some considerable significance.  That is because one of Mr Caratt’s grounds of challenge to the search warrant is that the search permitted by the warrants exceeded what was justified by the material that was before the magistrate.  As will be seen, the main basis for that argument was that the offences specified in the search warrants were, in Mr Caratti’s submission, broader than justified by the information in the affidavit.46    The search warrants the subject of the application were so-called “three condition” warrants.  A three condition warrant is a warrant drafted in such a way that the “evidential material” to be searched for and seized is defined by way of three conditions, each of which must be met.  The first condition is usually that the evidential material comprises “things” which are items of a particular description, such as a type of document or other item, such as a computer, mobile phone or hard-drive.  The second condition is ordinarily that the “things” relate to particular persons or companies.  The third and perhaps most important condition is that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the “things” will afford evidence as to the commission of particular offences specified in the warrant.  47    In his affidavit, Federal Agent Szolnoki deposed that he suspected “and an issuing officer may be properly satisfied” that evidential material which satisfied three conditions would be at the relevant premises.  The three conditions referred to in the affidavit were the three conditions specified in the warrants that were the subject of the application.  The warrants (including the three conditions) are extracted in full later in these reasons. 48    The affidavit then detailed information concerning each of the four groups of allegations that have just been summarised.  Federal Agent Szolnoki deposed that the information had been obtained by him and other AFP officers in the course of their duties and that he believed it to be true and correct.  49    After setting out the information relating to the four groups of allegations, Federal Agent Szolnoki deposed as follows:  I suspect that the things described above will provide evidence of the following: That Allen CARATTI, as sole director of STARBRAKE, reclassified income received by STARBRAKE, as a loan, in order to avoid paying lawful taxation, which resulted in him dishonestly obtaining a financial benefit from a Commonwealth entity, namely the Australian Tax Office.That Allen CARATTI and Hank SCHOKKER, through the entity WESTEND, engaged in criminal activity, by falsifying costs incurred by WESTEND, in order to avoid paying lawful taxation, attempting to dishonestly obtain a financial benefit from a Commonwealth entity, namely the Australian Tax Office.That Allen CARATTI, as director of WHITBY, deliberately withheld Goods and Service Tax payable to a Commonwealth entity, namely the Australian Tax Office, in order to dishonestly obtain a financial advantage, by failing to meet taxation obligations.  That Allen CARATTI and Tina BAZZO through their controlled entities MAMMOTH and GUCCE, formed an agreement to created false invoices, in order to attempt to claim Goods and Services Tax Credits, from a Commonwealth entity, namely the Australian Tax Office, in order to dishonestly obtain a financial benefit.  50    On 20 February 2015, Federal Agent Nicholson decided that a further search warrant should be applied for in respect of premises at 5 Wright Road, Harrisdale Western Australia.  That task was allocated to Federal Agent van Tooren, who in due course swore an affidavit for the purposes of the application.  That affidavit, which was sworn on 4 March 2015, annexed the affidavit earlier sworn by Federal Agent Szolnoki.  It also contained additional information linking the premises at 5 Wright Road Harrisdale to Mr Caratti, Ms Bazzo and companies associated with them.  51    Each of the warrants issued by the magistrate was in relevantly the same terms.  There are some differences in the list of persons or companies referred to in the second condition, though those differences ultimately do not bear in any material way on the issues raised by Mr Caratti in relation to either the validity of the warrants or the lawfulness of the search and seizure at particular premises.  It is sufficient to set out, by way of example, the main operative parts of the warrant (omitting the notes concerning legal professional privilege and the statutory definitions of expressions such as “evidential material”) that was issued in relation to Mr Caratti’s residential premises.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA CRIMES ACT 1914: Section 3ESEARCH WARRANT FOR PREMISESTO: Gary Geza Stephen SZOLNOKIa constable within the meaning of the Crimes Act 1914, who is the executing officer in relation to this warrant;AND TO any other constable whose name may be written on this warrant in accordance with section 3C(1) of the Crimes Act 1914, in which event that constable shall be the executing officer in relation to this warrant:WHEREAS I Kevin M.

or (iii)    evidential material (within the meaning of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002) or tainted property (within the meaning of that Act).if the executing officer or the constable assisting believes on reasonable grounds that seizure of the thing is necessary to prevent its concealment, loss or destruction or its use in committing an offence; and-seize any other thing found at the premises in the course of the search that the executing officer or the constable assisting believes on reasonable grounds to be a seizable item, in that it is a thing that would present a danger to a person or that could be used to assist a person to escape from lawful custody.AND THIS WARRANT AUTHORISES the executing officer or a constable assisting to conduct an ordinary search and a frisk search of any person who is at or near the premises when this warrant is executed if the executing officer or the constable suspects on reasonable grounds that the person has in his or her possession evidential material or any seizable item, in that it is a thing that would present a danger to a person or that could be used to assist a person to escape from lawful custody, and to seize any such evidential material or other thing that may be found;]Note that, by virtue of section 3ZR of the Crimes Act 1914, an ordinary search or a frisk search of a person under this warrant must, if practicable, be conducted by a person of the same sex as the person being searched.AND, by virtue of section 3G of the Crimes Act 1914, in executing this warrant:-    the executing officer may obtain such assistance as is necessary and reasonable in the circumstances;-    the executing officer, and any constable assisting in the execution of this warrant who is a police officer, may  use such force against persons or things as is necessary and reasonable in the circumstances;

First, the first condition is drafted in extremely broad terms.  It would encompass most electronic devices capable of storing documents or data in electronic form and almost every conceivable type of document.  It would include, for example, any document which could be considered to be a business record, taxation record, notebook, diary, handwritten note or banking record.  The documents and other things that are listed in the first condition are not limited or restricted by reference to any period of time. That is not to say that the first condition is necessarily impermissibly wide or oppressive: cf. Propend Finance Pty Ltd v Commissioner Australian Federal Police (1994) 35 ALD 25 at 31-33.  The first condition must be read together with the other two conditions.  The point is that, in practical terms, the first condition contains no effective limit on the types of documents or other items that could be searched for or seized pursuant to the warrant.53    Second, the second condition is also in very broad terms.  It comprises a very long list of not only persons and companies, but also bank accounts, email addresses and telephone numbers.  It is sufficient that the “thing” to be searched for and seized “relate to” any one or more of the persons, companies or other things included in the list.  The words “relate to” in that context are of potentially very wide import:  see Williams v Keelty (2001) 111 FCR 175 at 211-212 [158].  The result is that, like the first condition, the second condition does not significantly define or confine the types of documents or items that can be searched for and seized pursuant to the warrant.54    Third, given the apparent breadth of the first two conditions, it is really the third condition that does most of the work in terms of properly defining and confining the scope of the search and seizure pursuant to the warrant.  But for the third condition, the warrants would effectively authorise the seizure of just about any document, and just about any electronic device capable of storing files and data, that was likely to be located in the relevant premises.  55    Federal Agent Nicholson’s evidence was that the offences listed in the third condition accurately represented the allegations being investigated in respect of the conduct of Mr Caratti and Ms Bazzo.  He expressed the view that the descriptions of the offences were sufficiently specific to restrict the search and seizure under the warrants to the matters under investigation.  The main thrust of Mr Caratti’s challenge to the validity of the warrants was that, contrary to Federal Agent Nicholson’s view, the offences described in the third condition were so poorly drafted that they were not capable of properly defining or confining the scope of the search and seizure authorised by the warrants.  In Mr Caratti’s submission, the warrants therefore created no “intelligible search perimeter”, or such perimeter as was created was broader than was justified or warranted by the information that was put before the issuing magistrate.  Mr Caratti also contended that the poor drafting of the offences in the third condition of the warrants contributed to confusion and difficulties encountered by the Federal Agents and tax officers who were involved in the execution of the warrants. The execution of the warrants 56    Most of the contentious evidence related to what was allegedly said or done by certain Federal Agents and tax officers in preparation for, or in the course of, the execution of the warrants.  There was, however, no dispute about the basic facts and chronology concerning the execution of the warrants.  Following is a brief summary of some of the basic facts, though it does not purport to be comprehensive.  The affidavits filed by the parties contained excruciating, and in many respects largely unnecessary, detail in relation to the execution of the warrants.  Most of the detail turned out to be largely irrelevant to the issues and contentions ultimately pursued by Mr Caratti.57    Prior to the execution of the warrants, Federal Agent Nicholson decided that it would be beneficial to have tax officers who had some knowledge of the business and tax affairs of Mr Caratti, Ms Bazzo and their business interests to be present during the execution of the warrants.  Federal Agent Nicholson believed that tax officers with that knowledge would be able to provide assistance to the executing officers in ascertaining what documents were covered by the three conditions in the warrant.  He intended that the tax officers would be present under the direction and control of the executing officers and other Federal Agents who were involved in the execution of the warrants.  58    While that may have been Federal Agent Nicholson’s intention and belief, Mr Caratti contended that in reality the executing officers and Federal Agents needed to and did defer to the tax officers during the execution of the warrants, at least when it came to deciding whether or not a document could or should be seized.  He contended that it was probable, or there was at least a substantial risk, that the Federal Agents involved in the execution of the warrants simply accepted the advice of the tax officers and did not turn their minds to whether documents fell within the terms of the warrants.  That extensive reliance on the tax officers was said to be one aspect of the excessive and improper execution of the warrants.59    On 22 January 2015, Federal Agent Nicholson distributed a draft Standard Tactical Plan to Federal Agents who were rostered to participate in the execution of the search warrants.  That document relevantly contained background information concerning Mr Caratti and Ms Bazzo and summarised the four groups of allegations or transactions (the Starbrake, Westend, Whitby Land and Gucce Holdings allegations) in terms similar to, though shorter than, the search warrant affidavit.  It also included details of the “substantive offences” in terms relevantly identical to the terms of the third condition of the warrants.  The draft Standard Tactical Plan was emailed to some tax officers.  It also appears to have been discussed at a meeting between the tax officers who were to assist in the execution of the warrants.  That meeting, which was arranged by Mr Eastaugh of the ATO, was held on 22 January 2015.60    On 27 January 2015, Federal Agent Nicholson delivered a briefing to the Federal Agents and tax officers who were expected to be involved in the execution of the warrants.  The briefing utilised a “PowerPoint” presentation.  Much of the briefing concerned administrative and logistical arrangements.  There was, however, some attention given to the allegations and suspected offences.  That was no doubt because Federal Agent Nicholson was well aware that many of the Federal Agents and tax officers who were to be involved in the execution of the warrants had no previous knowledge of or involvement in the investigation concerning Mr Caratti and Ms Bazzo.  Federal Agent Nicholson asked a tax officer who had been involved in the ATO audits, Mr Peter Irvin, to provide some “background information” derived from the audit activity to those present at the briefing.  It would appear, however, that the treatment of the alleged offences at the briefing was fairly cursory.  The PowerPoint slides provided the following information concerning the allegations.  STARBRAKE:  •    A company owned by A. CARATTI •    Granted Rocla Pty Ltd (ROCLA) a lease and exclusive licence to carry out extraction of sand on land located at Wangara, WA•    ROCLA made payment of $7.7 million to STARBRAKE ($7,000,000 royalty and $700,000 GST) •    STARBRAKE reclassified the payment in its books to show a loan from Mammoth Nominees Pty Ltd (MAMMOTH) - A.CARATTI's primary company.FORRREST HOPE:•    FORREST HOPE is a registered company in Australia; BAZZO is recorded as a co-director. •    Part owned by GUCCE P/L which is BAZZO's primary company•    FORREST HOPE set up for a land development in Aveley, WA. GUCCE on behalf of FH engaged MAMMOTH to do development works  •    GUCCE and MAMMOTH overstated costs to support GUCCE claiming GST input credits WESTEND:•    WESTEND relates to a property development in Darch, WA (historical 2003)•    Legitimate work was completed on the WESTEND development totalling approximately $2,000,000•    WESTEND subsequently attempted to claim works for taxation purposes totalling $5,400,000WHITBY:•    Current land development in Armadale, Perth •    At 31 December 2013, total sales identified for WHITBY were valued at $96,279,500•    There is an existing GST debt of about $4,600,000•    No taxes (GST or income tax) with respect to WHITBY have been paid by A. CARATTI or associated entities.61    The oral briefing did not appear to add much of significance to the information in the slides.  No witness was able to recount any information of significance in relation to the alleged offences that was imparted during the briefing.62    There were apparently also “premises-specific” briefings conducted by certain “Team Leaders” prior to the execution of the warrants at some of the premises.  It does not appear, however, that those briefings dealt in any substantive way with the offences in the third condition of the warrants.  In that regard,  the evidence suggested that the team leaders did little more than read out the third condition offences and, perhaps, emphasise that only documents that satisfied the warrant conditions could be seized. 63    Mr Caratti contended that such briefings as were given by Federal Agents and tax officers in relation to the execution of the warrants were insufficient and provided a “distorted” picture of the allegations.  That was said to be another aspect of the excessive and improper execution of the warrants.  The evidence said to support those contentions is addressed later. Execution at the Wickham Street premises64    The warrant in respect of the premises at Wickham Street was executed over three days on 28, 29 and 30 January 2015.  It appears to have been the main warrant and the most complex search.  It certainly took the longest to execute and involved the largest number of people assisting.  Mr Caratti’s case concerning excessive or improper execution mainly focused on events that occurred during the execution of the warrant at the Wickham Street premises.65    The search warrant in respect of the Wickham Street premises was “signed-over” to Federal Agent Niranjan Jirasinha: which meant that Federal Agent Szolnoki, who was initially named as the executing officer in that warrant, wrote Federal Agent Jirasinha’s name on the warrant as the executing officer.  That process is permitted, or at least envisaged by, the definition of “executing officer” in s 3C of the Crimes Act.  66    More than 25 Federal Agents were involved at various times in the execution of the warrant at the Wickham Street premises.  Those that featured in the evidence included Federal Agents Wealands, Johnson, Joss, Fullerton, Rae, Leigh, Pluss and Mills.  Two employees of the AFP who specialised in computer forensics, Mr Keith Fell and Ms Casey Scott, assisted in respect of the search of computers and computer equipment and the copying of computer data.  67    A large number of tax officers also assisted in some way with the execution of the Wickham Street warrant.  Despite some initial suggestions to the contrary, it ultimately appeared to be accepted by Mr Caratti that the tax officers were authorised to assist in executing the warrant and were therefore  “constables assisting” for the purposes of Part IAA of the Crimes Act: see the definition of “constable assisting” in s 3C of the Crimes Act.  It would appear that upwards of 30 tax officers were involved in assisting in the execution of the Wickham Street premises.  The main tax officers who featured in the evidence included Mr Irvin, Ms Amanda Milner, Mr Michael Crawshaw, Ms Melissa Randhas, Mr Michael Dunstan, Ms Ingrid Simon and Mr Dave Koopu.  Up to 8 employees of the ATO who appeared to specialise in computer forensics also assisted.  They included Mr Steve Ilett, Mr Mohammed Khan, Mr Chris Andrews and Mr Octavian Grigore.68    The involvement of Mr Irvin and, perhaps to a lesser extent, Ms Milner, in the execution of the warrant at the Wickham Street premises was important to Mr Caratti’s case that the warrant was executed improperly.  Mr Caratti contended that Mr Irvin was effectively the “team leader” in relation to the execution of the warrant at the Wickham Street premises.  That was said to follow from the fact that he was apparently the person who possessed the most knowledge about the business and tax affairs of Mr Caratti, Ms Bazzo and their associated companies.  He was a senior auditor at the ATO and plainly had an extensive involvement with and knowledge of the ATO audit of Mr Caratti and companies associated with him. 69    Mr Caratti claimed that Federal Agent Jirasinha and the other constables assisting who were involved in the execution of the warrant at the Wickham Street premises invariably accepted and deferred to the advice of Mr Irvin.  Mr Caratti also contended that Federal Agents and tax officers involved in the execution also accepted, or at least had regard to, advice provided by Ms Milner and, perhaps to a lesser extent, Mr Crawshaw and Ms Ramdhas.  It followed, so Mr Caratti submitted, that Federal Agent Jirasinha and the constables assisting did not (or at least probably did not) turn their minds to the terms of the search warrant when deciding what documents to seize.  Rather, they treated Mr Irvin’s advice (and to a lesser extent the advice of Ms Milner, Mr Crawshaw and Ms Ramdhas) as a direction to seize.  The evidence said to support that contention is addressed later.70    Importantly (at least for Mr Caratti’s case), the evidence revealed that Mr Irvin created a document that was, according to Mr Irvin, intended to assist searchers by informing them of some of the background to the allegations that were the subject of the warrant.  Curiously, and perhaps regrettably, it appears that he created that document without having read the search warrant, or at least without having read it in any great detail.  Mr Irvin provided the document to Federal Agent Szolnoki who approved it for distribution to those who assisted in the execution of the warrant.  The document was distributed to at least some of the officers who assisted in the execution of the warrant at the Wickham Street premises.  Some reliance appears to have been placed upon it by those who were engaged in the search of those premises.  The extent of that reliance is important.  The evidence concerning that issue is dealt with later in the context of Mr Caratti’s challenge to the execution of the warrants.71    The content of the so-called “Search Relevances” document prepared by Mr Irvin and distributed to those responsible for the execution of the Wickham Street premises was of some relevance to Mr Caratti’s case that the search and seizure at those premises was excessive and outside the terms of the warrant.  He contended that the document was misleading and confusing and expanded the scope of the search and seizure beyond the terms of the warrant.  It is accordingly necessary to set out the terms of the document in full.1.    Whitby     (Whitby Land Company Pty Ltd & Whitby Trust) •    Subdivision of land known as Lot 22 Nicholson Road, aka 293 Nicholson Road, Jandakot/Canning Vale/Piara Waters.•    Previous owner was Maria Jabado.•    Purchaser was Whitby Land Company Pty Ltd in Nov-2007; $28M•    May be a bare trust deed, indicating land held for benefit or MN •    Client also maintained land held on trust for The Whitby Turst •    In-house contractor was Mammoth Nominees Pty Ltd.

The seizures are recorded in a property seizure record that was prepared by Federal Agents Pluss and Fullerton.  The property seizure record is over 70 pages long.  The items seized included a large number of documents (hard copy and electronic) and many items of computer and electrical equipment. Mr Caratti contended that a number of hard drives and other electronic storage devices that were seized at the Wickham Street premises were not lawfully seized under the warrant or in accordance with the specific provisions in the Crimes Act that deal with the seizure of electronic equipment.The Duncraig Road premises74    The search warrant in respect of the Duncraig Road premises was executed on 28 January 2015.  Federal Agent Szolnoki was the executing officer.  He was apparently assisted by Federals Agents Cook, Evans, Croft and Curavic and the computer forensics experts Mr Fell and Ms Scott.  For reasons that remained unexplained, it would appear that an AFP “canine team” also attended the premises.  75    The tax officers who assisted included Mr Crawshaw, Mr Dunstan, Ms Ramhdas, Ms Amanda Conway, Ms Shezah Arif, Mr Shane Comerford and Mr Rick Owen. It would also appear that Mr Shaun Ellis and Mr William Elliot, computer forensics officers from the ATO, were also present, though they did not feature at all in the evidence. 76    A number of documents and items of equipment were seized during the execution of the Duncraig Road premises warrant.  They are recorded in a property seizure record that was completed by Federal Agent Curavic and which runs to five pages.77    Mr Carratti specifically contended that some electronic storage devices and two Blackberry mobile devices were unlawfully seized from the Duncraig Road premises.The Cornish Turn premises78    The warrant in respect of the Cornish Turn premises was signed over by Federal Agent Szolnoki to Federal Agent Nicholas Joss.  It was executed on 28 January 2015.  Federal Agent Joss appears to have been assisted by Federal Agents Lassiter, Baum, Bryce, Jowers, Standing and Bruhn.  A computer forensics officer from the ATO, Mr Octavin Grigore, was apparently involved in or assisted the search.  It would appear that there were other tax officers involved in the execution of this warrant, including Mr Jared Needham, Mr Nicholas Khoo, Mr Phillip Ryan, Mr Anand Gokhani and MrGraeme Walker.  They did not, however, feature at all in the evidence.79    The items seized during the execution of the warrant in respect of the Cornish Turn premises were recorded in a property seizure record created by Federal Agent Standing. The items seized included a number of folders containing documents and two computers.  Mr Caratti contended that the two computers seized during the execution of the warrant were not lawfully seized under the warrant or in accordance with the specific provisions in the Crimes Act that deal with the seizure of electronic equipment.The Osborne Park premises80    The warrant in respect of the Osborne Park premises was signed over by Federal Agent Szolnoki to Federal Agent van Tooren.  It was executed on 28 January 2015.  Federal Agent van Tooren appears to have been assisted by Federal Agents Paynter, Stevens, Powers and Guarino, as well as three forensics officers from the ATO: Mr John Jensen, Mr Greg Thomas and Mr Ben White.81    A number of items, including documents and computer hard drives, were seized during the execution of the Osborne Park premises warrant.  They are recorded in property seizure records completed by Federal Agent Stevens.82    There was very little evidence concerning the execution of the Osborne Park premises.The Irvin Street premises83    The warrant in relation to the Irvin Street premises was executed on 29 January 2015.  The warrant was apparently signed over by Federal Agent Szolnoki to Federal Agent van Tooren.  Federal Agent van Tooren, as executing officer, was assisted by Federal Agents Cook, Curavic and Croft.  Two AFP computer forensic specialists, Mr Fell and Ms Scott, assisted in the search of computers and computer equipment and the copying of data during the execution of the warrant.  Two tax officers assisted in the search: Mr Crawshaw and Mr Michael Dunstan.84    The Irvin Street premises were the offices of a firm of solicitors, Birman & Ride.  It would appear that the solicitors were expecting a visit from the AFP.  Search and seizure pursuant to the warrant appeared to proceed in a cooperative fashion.  The solicitors facilitated access to the “information of interest”, which appeared to be in the form of electronic or computer documents.  The Federal Agents and tax officers considered each document and discussed whether it was inside or outside the terms of the warrant.  Federal Agent van Tooren’s evidence was that he generally accepted the views of the tax officers as to whether the documents were relevant.  The documents that he decided to seize were copied onto a USB device by the solicitors.  The property seizure record in relation to the Irvin Street premises (completed by Federal Agent Curavic) records that three USB devices containing files relating to Starbrake, Whitby Land Company and Mammoth Nominees were seized. The Wright Road premises85    Federal Agent van Tooren was the executing officer in respect of the warrant for the Wright Road premises.  The warrant was executed on 5 March 2015.  Federal Agent van Tooren was assisted by Federal Agents Perrot, Stevens, Sullivan, Mills and Evans and a computer forensics employee, Mr Thomas Waghorn.  There were also a number of tax officers involved in the warrant execution, including Mr Eastaugh, Mr Irvin, Mr Dunstan, Mr Koopu and Mr Rimkus.86    A number of documents were seized during the execution of the Wright Road premises warrant.  They are recorded in a property seizure record completed by Federal Agent Stevens which runs to 10 pages.Motor vehicles87    There was very little, if any, evidence concerning the execution of the search warrants in respect of the two motor vehicles.  Mr Caratti did not advance any specific complaints or claims concerning the execution of these warrants or any items seized from the two vehicles.The AFP’s undertaking88    On 30 January 2015, the AFP undertook not to inspect any of the material seized under the warrants pending the resolution of proceedings challenging the validity of the search and seizure.  That undertaking was later extended to cover the material seized at the Wright Road premises.GROUNDS OF CHALLENGE AND RELEVANT ISSUES89    Mr Caratti’s challenge to the issue and execution of the warrants was initially wide-ranging.  He initially alleged, for example, that the warrants were unlawful because they were sought for an ulterior purpose.  He alleged that one of the purposes for applying for the warrants was to assist the ATO in relation to their audit and assessment activities relating to Mr Caratti and companies associated with him.  He also appeared to allege that there was an ulterior and improper motive in executing the warrants.  He contended, amongst other things, that the AFP intended to disseminate to the ATO items that were seized and information that was obtained in the course of the execution of the warrants.  He also initially alleged that it was impermissible or unreasonable for the AFP to have tax officers present and assisting during the execution of the warrants. Those contentions were ultimately not pressed by Mr Caratti.  90    Mr Caratti amended his originating application and points of claim on a number of occasions.  Despite those repeated amendments, the scope and nature of aspects of Mr Caratti’s case continued to shift and remained somewhat unclear right up to the point of final submissions.  In his final submissions, Mr Caratti identified three grounds of challenge to the issue and execution of the warrants, though the first ground in fact comprised three separate grounds (grounds 1A, 1B and 1C).  Grounds 1A and 1B and 1C related to the validity of the search warrants.  Ground 2 to the execution of the warrants generally.  Ground 3 related specifically to the seizure of computer or electronic equipment.91    Mr Caratti’s final submissions summarised grounds 1A, 1B and 1C in the following terms:1A.    The search permitted by the warrants exceeded what was justified by the material before the issuing officer; the offences in condition 3 of the warrants (when taken together with other conditions) were broader than justified.1B.    No intelligible search permitter existed and the warrants did not sufficiently specify the perimeters within which materials were to be searched for and seized or to sufficiently inform the occupiers of the perimeters, because the descriptions of offences were ambiguous, unintelligible or not offences.1C.    The search permitted by the warrants exceeded what was justified by the material before the issuing officer, in that the three lines after the third condition purported to authorise that, wherever on a “storage medium or storage device” there exists a document or other information which is evidential material falling within the 3 conditions of the warrant, it follows that each such storage medium or storage device is itself evidential material.92    Grounds 1A and 1B were closely related.  Both effectively hinged on what Mr Caratti submitted was the defective and deficient wording of the offences that comprised the third condition in each of the warrants.  93    The crux of Mr Caratti’s submission in relation to ground 1A was that the information before the issuing officer (the magistrate) was not capable of satisfying the issuing officer that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that items located at the premises would afford evidence of the commission of the offences in the third condition of the warrant.  In Mr Caratti’s submission, the information before the issuing officer may have provided reasonable grounds for suspecting the commission of certain offences that involved discrete transactions and discreet timing.  The offences in the third condition, however, were drafted so broadly and ambiguously that they did not confine what could be searched for and seized to offences involving those discreet transactions and times.  In short, Mr Caratti submitted that the broad terms of the offences in the third condition of the warrants meant that the warrants were broader in scope than the material before the magistrate justified.  Mr Caratti also contended that the information before the magistrate suggested that the dates or date ranges specified in the alleged offences were incorrect.  The information suggested that if the offences were committed, they were committed on dates different to those particularised in the offences. 94    Mr Caratti’s basic contention in relation to ground 1B was to the effect that the warrants did not disclose the nature of the offences with sufficient clarity and particularity to define the permissible area of the search in terms capable of being understood by the occupier of the premises.  In short, he submitted that the offences as described in the third condition were so unclear and ambiguous that the warrants were unintelligible.  This was a challenge to the validity of the warrants on their face. 95    The critical issue in relation to both grounds 1A and 1B is the wording of the offences in the third condition.  Were the offences in the third condition described in terms that were sufficiently clear and unambiguous to satisfy the requirements for the issue of a search warrant under the Crimes Act, both from the perspective of the sufficiency of the information before the issuing officer, and from the perspective of the matters that are required to be stated on the face of a warrant?96    Ground 1C also appeared to raise issues concerning both the sufficiency of the information before the issuing officer and the validity of the warrants on their face.  Each of the warrants contained the following paragraph after the description of the offences in the third condition of the warrant:Together with any storage medium or storage device which contains any of the above things and any manual, instruction, password or other thing which is needed to gain access to or interpret or decode any of the above things.97    While somewhat unclear, the inclusion of this paragraph appeared to suggest that a storage device, such as a computer, which contained an item that was “evidential material”, as defined in the Crimes Act and having regard to the three conditions in the warrant, was itself evidential material.  The upshot of the inclusion of these words was, in Mr Caratti’s submission, that a computer containing an electronic file that might be evidence of any of the offences in the warrant could itself be seized, together with any manual or password needed to operate the computer.  That would be the case even if the possibly thousands of other files on the computer were entirely irrelevant or unrelated to the suspected offences, and even if there were no reasonable grounds to suspect that the computer hardware itself would afford evidence of the commission of the offences.  Was it open to the issuing officer to be satisfied that such a computer would itself be “evidential material”?  Was a warrant that authorised the seizure of a computer in such circumstances contrary to the specific provisions in the Crimes Act dealing with the seizure of electronic equipment? 98    Mr Caratti’s central contention in relation to ground 2, which challenged the lawfulness of the execution of the warrants, was that the warrants were executed unreasonably and excessively because the executing officers and the officers who assisted them acted outside the authority of the warrants: they searched for and seized documents outside the scope of the warrants.  Mr Caratti contended that the officers were in fact confused as to what the warrants authorised and did not understand enough about the entities listed in the warrants, or their affairs or functions, to know the appropriate scope of the search and seizure pursuant to the warrants.  He relied on evidence that he contended indicated that the officers involved in the search interpreted the third condition in the warrants differently; that the briefings given to the officers were deficient; that the Federal Agents relied extensively and excessively on the advice of tax officers (including the advice in Mr Irvin’s “Search Relevances” document) that was not apparently constrained by the terms of the warrants; and that the tax officers themselves misunderstood the scope of the warrants.99    On one level, the issues raised by this ground may be seen to be essentially evidential and factual: has Mr Caratti discharged his onus of proving that any or all of the executing officers and the officers who assisted them acted unreasonably, excessively or otherwise outside the authority conferred by the warrants?  Mr Caratti relied on some general allegations, such as inadequate briefings, as well as a number of specific allegations concerning the actions of individual officers?  The first question is whether any or all of those allegations has been made out.  100    There is, however, a more fundamental question.  The relief sought by Mr Caratti included a declaration that “the execution of each of the Search Warrants was beyond power”.  He also sought orders which would have the effect of requiring the AFP to return all seized items.  He contended that such orders would be warranted if the execution of the warrants was beyond power, even if the warrants themselves were valid.  The fundamental issue that arises in this context is whether, if Mr Caratti made out any, or even all, of the factual allegations advanced by him concerning the execution of the warrants, it necessarily followed that the execution of all of the warrants was beyond power such that the return of all items seized was warranted?  Or does Mr Caratti have to demonstrate that such failures that he was able to prove were so fundamental or systematic that they infected the execution of the warrants in their entirety?101    For example (and hypothetically), if Mr Caratti successfully demonstrated that some (but not all) Federal Agents who assisted in the execution of the Wickham Street premises warrant misunderstood the terms of the warrant, or relied on Mr Irvin or his Search Relevances document instead of the warrant, does it follow that the execution of the Wickham Street warrant in its entirety was beyond power?  That question must be considered in light of the fact that the execution of the Wickham street premises warrant involved many officers and took place over three days.  Can it be inferred from the actions of some officers that the actions of all, or even a substantial number of the other officers involved in the execution of the warrant were also unreasonable or excessive?  If not, why should the actions of only some officers effectively impugn the actions of all the officers?  102    An even more difficult question is whether, if only the execution of, for example, the Wickham Street warrant was successfully impugned, would it necessarily follow that the execution of warrants other than the Wickham Street warrant were also beyond power?  Would it follow that items seized under the authority of all warrants should be returned?103    Ground 3 related to the seizure of electronic items under the warrants.  Mr Caratti contended that electronic equipment, computer material and digital storage media, such as computers, hard disks and USB devices containing data, were unlawfully seized.  He contended that the devices (as opposed to the files or data stored on them) did not comprise evidential material as defined by the three conditions in the warrants and that the specific provisions of the Crimes Act that deal with the seizure of electronic items.  Mr Caratti’s case concerning the seizure of electronic equipment was initially put at a general level.  He appeared to contend that there was a general misunderstanding or failure to comply with the relevant provisions.  Ultimately, however, his contentions were directed to the seizure of specific items.104    Mr Caratti’s final written and oral submissions addressed only these three grounds (grounds 1A, 1B, 1C, 2 and 3).  To the extent that Mr Caratti’s originating application and points of claim (as amended) advanced grounds or contentions that extended beyond grounds 1A, 1B, 1C, 2 and 3, those grounds or contentions are taken to have been expressly abandoned.THE VALIDITY OF THE WARRANTS – GROUNDS 1A, 1B, AND 1C105    The main provision of the Crimes Act dealing with the issue of search warrants is s 3E.  As is common with most modern Commonwealth legislation, however, to make sense of s 3E it is also necessary to go to a number of definitional provisions.  Relevantly, ss 3E(1) and (5) of the Crimes Act are in the following terms:3E    When search warrants can be issued (1)    An issuing officer may issue a warrant to search premises if the officer is satisfied, by information on oath or affirmation, that three are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is, or there will be within the next 72 hours, any evidential material at the premises. …(5)    If an issuing officer issues a warrant, the officer is to state in the warrant: (a)    the offence to which the warrant relates; and (b)    a description of the premises to which the warrant relates or the name or description of the person to whom it relates; and (c)    the kinds of evidential material that are to be searched for under the warrant; and (d)    the name of the constable who, unless he or she inserts the name of another constable in the warrant, is to be responsible for executing the warrant; and(e)    the time at which the warrant expires (see subsection (5A)); and(f)    whether the warrant may be executed at any time or only during particular hours.106    The expression “evidential material” which is used in ss 3E(1) and (5)(c), is defined in s 3C as meaning “a thing relevant to an indictable offence or a thing relevant to a summary offence, including such a thing in electronic form”.  The expression “thing relevant to an indictable offence” is defined in s 3 in the following terms:Thing relevant to an indicatable offence means:(a)    either of the following:(i)    anything with respect to which an indictable offence against any law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory has been committed or is suspected, on reasonable grounds, to have been committed; (ii)    anything with respect to which a State offence that has a federal aspect, and that is an indictable offence against the law of that State, has been committed or is suspected, on reasonable grounds, to have been committed; or (c)    anything as to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it will afford evidence as to the commission of any such offence; or (d)    anything as to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it is intended to be used for the purpose of committing any such offence. 107    Perhaps not surprisingly, the expression “thing relevant to a summary offence” is defined in corresponding terms in s 3.108    In simple terms relevant to the warrants in question in this matter, it was open to the issuing officer to issue the warrants in question under s 3E(1) if the information on oath before him (being the affidavit sworn by Federal Agent Szolnoki) was capable of satisfying him that: (a)    there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that there was, at the relevant premises (the premises to which the warrants related, being the premises described in the warrants as required by s 3E(5)(b));(b)    anything with respect to which there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that those things would afford evidence as to the commission of the offences to which the warrants related (being the offences described in the warrant – relevantly in the third condition - as required by s 3E(5)(a) of the Act).  109    As already indicated, Mr Caratti contended that it was not open to the issuing officer to be satisfied of those two matters.  That contention was not based so much on the sufficiency of the information in Federal Agent Szolnoki’s affidavit in terms of providing reasonable grounds for suspecting the commission of offences by Mr Caratti, or reasonable grounds for suspecting the presence in the premises of documents or other items that would afford evidence of those offences.  It appeared to be accepted by Mr Caratti, if not expressly then certainly implicitly, that there was sufficient information in the affidavit to satisfy the issuing officer that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that there were things at the relevant premises which would afford evidence of the commission of certain offences by Mr Caratti.  Mr Caratti’s point was that those offences (the offences supported by Federal Agent Szolnoki’s affidavit) were not the same as the offences described in the third condition; or at least were offences materially narrower in scope than the offences described in the third condition.110    Before addressing that issue (which was, in effect, Mr Caratti’s ground 1A), it is convenient to consider Mr Caratti’s broader criticisms of the description of the offences in the third condition (Mr Caratti’s ground 1B).  Those criticisms amounted to, in effect, a contention that the description of the offences in the third condition did not satisfy the requirement in s 3E(5)(a) that the issuing officer state in the warrant the offence to which the warrant relates.  It is convenient to consider the issue concerning the sufficiency of the description of the offences first because that exercise will, to some extent, involve construing or interpreting the offences as described in the third condition.  It is only when the offences as described have been considered and construed that it is possible to consider whether it was open to the issuing officer to be satisfied of the matters required by s 3E(1) of the Crimes Act.Ground 1B — are the offences to which the warrants related sufficiently described to define the permissible area of the search?   111    Each warrant states that the offences referred to in the third condition of the warrants are the offences to which the warrant relates for the purposes of s 3E(5)(a).  Even if that was not expressly noted in the warrant, a description of offences in the third condition of a three condition warrant is capable of amounting to compliance with s 3E(5)(a): Harts Australia Ltd v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (1997) 75 FCR 145 at 151B-C.  112    The real issue is whether the descriptions of the offences in the third condition were sufficient to not only comply with s 3E(5)(a), but also sufficient to provide “real and meaningful perimeters as to the area of search”: Zhang v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (2009) 111 ALD 123 at 127 718 [13]. Were the offences described in such broad and vague terms that a person affected by the warrant, in particular the occupier of the premises to which the warrant relates, could not know the object or area of the search authorised by the warrant? 113    The principles to apply in considering the sufficiency of the description of offences in a warrant under s 3E of the Crimes Act are now relatively well-settled.  It was initially considered (in the context of the search warrant provisions in the Crimes Act that preceded s 3E) that a “warrant should state the description of the offence in question with a particularity sufficient to enable the person whose premises are being searched to know the exact object of the search” (emphasis added): Parker v Churchill (1986) 9 FCR 334 at 348 (Jackson J, with whom Bowen CJ and Black J relevantly agreed at 335); Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Cloran (1984) 4 FCR 151 at 153.  114    It is now generally accepted, however, that the test is not so exacting as to require the identification of the “exact object” of the search.  Nor should an overly technical view of the description of the offences be taken.  The statement of the offence in a search warrant need not be made with the precision of an indictment: Beneficial Finance Corporation v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (1991) 31 FCR 523 at 533 (Burchett J, with whom Sheppard J agreed at 525 and Pincus J relevantly agreed at 525-526).  115    In Beneficial Finance, Burchett J said (at 543):An approach which eschews overzealous technicality, while requiring the full measure of the substance to be observed, is also consistent with the fact that the legislature has entrusted to lay justices of the peace the task of issuing search warrants.  If the courts were to insist upon the invalidation of a warrant for a legally incorrect formulation of an offence, although the substance of the offence could plainly be understood, they would not be interpreting the will of the Parliament but subverting it.  For the Parliament cannot have intended lay justices to be held to such a standard, when it entrusted the task of issuing warrants to them.  See Parker v Churchill (at 323).I have discussed the authorities dealing with the true test, for the sufficiency of the statement of the offence in a search warrant, at considerable length, because of the importance of the principle, and the difficulty which has arisen from the conflicting statements of it.  In my opinion, the conclusion emerges clearly that there is no justification for an “exact object” test.  The matter should be viewed broadly, having regard to the terms of the warrant in the circumstances of each case.  The question should not be answered by the bare application of a verbal formula, but in accordance with the principle that the warrant should disclose the nature of the offence so as to indicate the area of search.  The precision required in a given case, in any particular respect, may vary with the nature of the offence, the other circumstances revealed, the particularity achieved in other respects, and what is disclosed by the warrant, read as a whole, and taking account of its recitals. See Re Church of Scientology (supra).116    This broad and practical approach to the particularity required in the statement of the offence in a search warrant has been repeatedly followed and applied: see for example New South Wales v Corbett (2007) 230 CLR 606 at 630-631 [97]-[102] (per Callinan and Crennan JJ, with whom Gleeson CJ agreed at 607 [1]); Harts (1997) at 152A-C; Chong v Schultz [2000] FCA 582; (2000) 112 A Crim R 59 at 60-61 (Heerey J); Williams v Keelty at 206-206 [135]-[139]; Different Solutions Pty Ltd v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police [2008] FCA 1686; (2008) 190 A Crim R 265 at 289-294 [98]-[118] (Graham J); Zhang at 718 [12].  117    In general terms, these authorities indicate that, in considering the sufficiency of the statement of the offence to which the warrant relates, the warrant as a whole must be read fairly and not perversely.  The fact that the language used may be infelicitous or inelegant, or may not display a fine appreciation of the legislation relevant to the offences, is largely immaterial so long as the substance of the offence is sufficiently disclosed so as to indicate the area of the search.  A warrant will not necessarily be invalidated even in circumstances where the description of the offence involves an error which would most likely invalidate an indictment (for example on the ground of duplicity: Williams v Keelty at 209 [142]; Chong v Schultz at 62 [11]); or a legally incorrect formulation of the offence (Chong v Schultz at 61 [9]; Ozzy Tyre & Tube Pty Ltd v CEO of Customs [2000] FCA 891, where the statement of the offence did not refer to the mental element); or an inaccurate statement of the general nature of the offence (Parker v Churchill at 340 per Jackson J, with whom Bowen CJ and Lockhart J agreed at 335; Different Solutions at 295-296 [124]-[137]); or the wrong citation of a section or incorrect description of the statute creating the offence (Parker v Churchill at 340; Different Solutions at 291 [104]).118    Mr Caratti contended that the description of the offences in the third condition of the warrants was, in each case, so ambiguous and so lacking in appropriate particularity that there was no intelligible search perimeter.  To address that contention it is necessary to closely consider the terms of the relevant offence provisions as well as the description of each of the offences in the third condition of the warrants.119    The offences described in the third condition are all said to be offences against either s 134.2(1) or 135.1(3) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).  Those offence provisions are in the following terms:134.2    Obtaining a financial advantage by deception (1)    A person is guilty of an offence if:(a)    the person, by a deception, dishonestly obtains a financial advantage from another person; and (b)    the other person is a Commonwealth entity.Penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years. ….135.1    General dishonesty (3)    A person is guilty of an offence if: (a)    the person does anything with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to another person; and (b)    the other person is a Commonwealth entity.120    The elements of the offence against s 134.2(1) of the Code may be summarised as follows:The person:(a)    acting intentionally (see s 5.6(1) of the Criminal Code)(b)    by a deception; (c)    dishonestly obtains a financial advantage;(d)    from a Commonwealth entity121    The elements of the offence against s 135.1(3) of the Code may be summarised as follows:The person:(a)    does something (anything);(b)    with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss;(c)    to a Commonwealth entity. The Starbrake offences122    The first two offences in the third condition in the warrants relate to the Starbrake allegations.  The offences are described in the following terms:In 2008 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI by a deception, in that he reclassified royalty income paid to Starbrake Pty Ltd into a loan from Mammoth Nominees Pty Ltd, dishonestly obtained a financial advantage by not paying income tax, from another person, namely the Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Section 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth).In 2008 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI did fail to pass on Goods and Services Tax collected by Starbrake Pty Ltd to the Australian Taxation Office, with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to another person, namely Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Section 135.1(3) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth). 123    In relation to the first Starbrake offence, Mr Caratti contended that the description of the offence was deficient in three respects.  First, he contended that the description of the offence lacked particularity because no royalty transaction (being the transaction that was alleged to have resulted in the royalty income) was specified.  Second, he contended that the description was ambiguous because it did not make it clear whether the date on which this offence was allegedly committed (2008) was the date on which the deception was employed, or the date on which the financial advantage was received.  Third, he contended that, whichever way the alleged ambiguity concerning the date of the offence was resolved, the information before the issuing officer indicated that neither the alleged deception nor the alleged obtaining occurred in 2008.124    There is some merit in these criticisms of the wording of the first Starbrake offence.  On just about any view, the description of the alleged offence was very poor having regard to the terms of the relevant offence provisions and the relevant provisions of the applicable tax legislation.  The language used was infelicitous. The particulars were imprecise if not ambiguous in some respects.  125    There are at least four potential problems with the description of the first Starbrake offence. 126    First, strictly speaking income tax is not paid to the ATO.  Generally speaking it is paid to the Commissioner of Taxation.  In any event, the ATO is not a Commonwealth entity as defined in the Criminal Code: see the definitions of “Commonwealth entity” and “Commonwealth authority” in s 4 of the Criminal Code; see also Different Solutions at 295 [125]-[128] and 296 [136]-[137], where Graham J held that this deficiency was not sufficient to invalidate a warrant.  127    Second, such tax as may have been payable in respect of any royalty income received by Starbrake was payable under the applicable tax legislation by Starbrake, not Mr Caratti.  There may accordingly be issues concerning the allegation that Mr Caratti obtained a financial advantage arising from the reclassification and non-payment of tax by Starbrake.  At most, any financial advantage that may have been obtained by Mr Caratti was an indirect advantage.128    Third, having regard to the terms of the applicable tax legislation, it would have been more appropriate to particularise both the alleged deceptive conduct and the alleged obtaining of a financial advantage in terms of a failure to include the royalty income in Starbrake’s tax return, rather than in terms of an accounting reclassification.  The ATO was relevantly deceived by Starbrake’s tax return, rather than the accounting reclassification.  Likewise, the alleged financial advantage to Mr Caratti arose from the non-declaration of the royalty income (on the allegedly false basis that it was a loan, not income) in Starbrake’s tax return, not from the reclassification.129    Fourth, there are potential issues with the date on which the offence is said to have been committed.  It is somewhat unclear whether the particularised date (2008) refers to the date on which the alleged deceptive conduct (the accounting reclassification of the royalty payment, or perhaps the lodging of a false tax return that did not declare the royalty income) occurred, or the date the financial advantage was allegedly obtained. That date would be the date on which the tax would, but for the deception, have been assessed as payable.130    There could be little doubt that an indictment containing a charge framed in these terms would either be struck down, or at the very least the prosecution would have been required to clarify and provide further particulars of the alleged offending conduct.131    The difficulty for Mr Caratti, however, is that the question of the sufficiency of the description of the offences in the warrant is not to be approached as if the warrant was an indictment and the issue was the legal sufficiency of the pleading. The exercise involved in determining whether the description of offences in a search warrant is sufficient is not to be approached as if it was a demurrer.  Nor is it a counsel of perfection.   Rather, as already indicated, the question is whether, viewed broadly and not perversely or with undue technicality, the general nature of the offences is sufficiently disclosed so as to indicate the authorised area of search.  132    When viewed in that way, these deficiencies with the wording and description of the first Starbrake offence are insufficient to invalidate the warrants.133    While the first Starbrake offence was poorly described, read fairly in the context of the warrant as a whole, and without overzealous technicality, the description was sufficient to enable an occupier to discern a search perimeter relevant to the offence.  The description of the offence identified the accused (Mr Caratti), the relevant offence provision (s 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code), the date (or date range) that the offence was alleged to be committed (2008) and the gist of the conduct said to constitute the offence (that the offence involved the dishonest non-payment of an amount of income tax by Starbrake resulting or arising from a deceptive reclassification by Mr Caratti of royalty income received by Starbrake).134    Mr Caratti’s argument that the information before the issuing officer was insufficient to establish reasonable grounds for suspecting that the first Starbrake offence was committed in 2008 is considered later in the context of the next ground (ground 1A).  For present purposes, however, it should be noted that while there may have been some ambiguity or uncertainty surrounding the date that the offence was alleged to have been committed (2008), it does not follow, as Mr Caratti submitted, that the search perimeter was effectively undefined as to date.  In any event, the executing officers were not necessarily constrained by the date or date range during which the offence was said to have been committed.  They could search for and seize documents bearing any date, so long as there were reasonable grounds to suspect that the documents would afford evidence of the commission of the offence suspected of having been committed in 2008.135    There are similar issues concerning the wording of the second Starbrake offence.  Mr Caratti contended that there were three specific deficiencies in the description of the second Starbrake offence. First, he contended that the description lacked particularity because it did not describe the transaction which led to the alleged collection of GST by Starbrake that should have been passed on to the ATO.  Second, he contended that the description was ambiguous because it did not specify how it was alleged that Mr Caratti failed to pass on GST.  Third, he contended that there was an error or deficiency in relation to the particulars of the date of the offence having regard to the information concerning this offence that was before the issuing officer.  In Mr Caratti’s submission, the information before the issuing officer was insufficient to establish reasonable grounds for suspecting that the offence was committed in 2008.136    The third of these complaints is addressed later in the context of ground 1A.  In relation to the first two complaints, those complaints would again no doubt have some considerable merit if the question was whether an indictment containing the second Starbrake offence was properly pleaded and adequately particularised.  The problem for Mr Caratti is that that is not the question.  The adequacy of the description of the offence should not be approached as if this was some form of demurrer.137    As was the case with the first Starbrake offence, there could be little doubt that the second Starbrake offence was poorly described.  The description displays a very poor appreciation of the terms and operation of the GST Act.  Strictly speaking the GST Act does not refer to GST being “collected”.  Nor does it create or refer to an obligation to “pass on” GST that is collected.  Rather, liabilities that arise under the GST Act arise upon the lodgement of a business activity statement that provides details of the GST payable in respect of taxable supplies less input tax credits.  Amounts payable under the GST Act are also payable to the Commissioner of Taxation, not the ATO (see, for example, s 33-5 of the GST Act) and, in any event, the ATO is not a Commonwealth entity for the purposes of s 135.1(3) of the Criminal Code.  138    There is also some merit in Mr Caratti’s complaint that the description of the offence, considered in isolation, provides no meaningful details of the circumstances in which it was apparently alleged that Starbrake had GST liabilities that it did not discharge.  There is, for example, no details of the taxable supplies made by Starbrake in respect of which GST was allegedly payable.  Nor are there any meaningful particulars as to why Starbrake’s failure to discharge any such GST liability in that regard involved dishonesty on the part of Mr Caratti.139    Nevertheless, the question is not whether the offence is pleaded and particularised in terms adequate to be included in an indictment.  In considering whether the nature or substance of the offence was sufficiently described for the purposes of identifying the search area, the description must be read broadly and in the context of the warrant as a whole.  It would be readily apparent to the occupier, or anyone else who read the warrant, that the first Starbrake offence was related to the second Starbrake offence.  The two offences involved the same persons and entities (Mr Caratti and Starbrake) and were both allegedly committed in 2008.  It would be readily apparent that the difference between the two offences was that the first offence related to the alleged non-payment of income tax and the second offence related to the alleged non-payment of GST.  Read in that way, it would be apparent to the reader of the warrant that the gist of the second offence was that Starbrake’s liability to remit GST was related to its receipt of royalty income, and that Mr Caratti’s dishonest intention arose from the alleged reclassification of the royalty income. 140    It would again clearly have been preferable for the second Starbrake offence to have been described in terms that clearly and accurately reflected the operation of the relevant tax legislation.  It would also have been preferable for the description to provide at least basic particulars of the key factual allegations that underlay the offence, so far as they were known,  so that it was unnecessary to read it in conjunction with the first Starbrake offence.  Nevertheless, while the second Starbrake offence was poorly drafted and lacked the clarity and particularity that would be necessary if it was to be  included in an indictment, read fairly and in context, and without overzealous technicality, it was adequate to define an area of search relevant to the offence.  It identified the accused (Mr Caratti), the relevant offence provision (s 135.1(3) of the Criminal Code), the date the offence was allegedly committed (2008) and the basic factual allegation: relevantly, that with the dishonest intention of causing loss to the ATO, Mr Caratti failed to pass on to the ATO GST that was properly payable by Starbrake.  When read in conjunction with the first Starbrake offence, it would have been tolerably clear to the reader that the alleged GST liability related to the royalty income received by Starbrake, and that the dishonesty arose from the alleged reclassification of that income. The Westend offence 141    The third offence in the third condition in the warrants related to the Westend allegations.  The offence was described in the following terms:In 2008 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI by a deception, in that he falsified costs incurred by Wesend Asset Pty Ltd, attempted to dishonestly obtain a financial advantage by not paying income tax, from another person, namely the Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Sections 11.1 and 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth).142    While again drafted in somewhat cumbersome and infelicitous terms, the substance and nature of the alleged offence was tolerably clear: it was alleged that Mr Caratti falsified costs incurred by Westend in an attempt to reduce the amount of income tax properly payable to the ATO by Westend.  It would have been readily apparent to the reader that the allegation was that the falsified costs would have reduced Westend’s taxable income and hence the amount of tax payable by it.  It was alleged that non-payment of income tax properly payable by Westend would result in a financial advantage to Mr Caratti.  That was said to constitute an offence pursuant to s 11.1 and 134.2(1) of the Code.  Section 11.1 of the Code provides, in essence, that a person who attempts to commit an offence is taken to be guilty of the offence of attempting to commit that offence.  The offence was alleged to have been committed in 2008.143    Mr Caratti contended that the description of the Westend offence lacked proper particularity, was ambiguous and included the wrong date.  The description was said to lack particularity because there were no particulars of the costs that were allegedly falsified.  It was said to be ambiguous because it was unclear whether the date on which the offence was alleged to have been committed was the date that Westend’s income tax return was lodged, the date that the costs were falsified, or the income year to which the falsified costs were said to be referable.  The date was in any event said to be wrong because the information before the issuing officer did not provide reasonable grounds for suspecting either that the Westend’s return was lodged in 2008, or that the costs were falsified in 2008.144    There is again some merit in these complaints of lack of particularity and ambiguity.  If this description of the offence was included in an indictment, the prosecution would undoubtedly be required to provide further particulars of the costs that were alleged to have been falsified.  It is also likely that the prosecution would be required to clarify exactly what was alleged to have occurred in 2008: the falsification of the costs, or the lodgement of the relevant income tax return, or whether 2008 simply referred to the relevant income year.  145    For the purposes of a search warrant, however, there was sufficient particularisation, and sufficient clarity, to define the area of search.  While it would clearly have been preferable for the description of the offence to include further and better particulars, the relevant offence provision was identified (ss 134.2(1) and 11.1 of the Criminal Code), as was the name of the accused (Mr Caratti) and the date (or date range) that the offence was allegedly committed (2008).  While the offence was particularised in broad, sparse and somewhat imprecise terms, nevertheless the gist or substance of the key factual allegations that underlay the offence were sufficiently apparent to identify the object or area of the search.146    Mr Caratti’s contention that the date on which it was alleged that the offence was committed (2008) was not supported by the information before the issuing officer is considered in the context of ground 1A.The Whitby Land Company offence147    The Whitby Land Company offence was described in the third condition of the warrants in the following terms:Between 1 July 2010 and 31 December 2013 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI by a deception, in that he caused the Whitby Land Company Pty Ltd to withhold Goods and Services Tax, dishonestly obtained a financial advantage from another person, namely the Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Section 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth).148    On just about any view, this statement of the relevant offence was very poorly drafted.  It is possible to discern, in very general terms, that the allegation against Mr Caratti was that in the period 1 July 2010 to 31 December 2013 he dishonestly and deceptively caused Whitby Land Company to “withhold” GST that was properly payable to the ATO.  There are, however, a number of difficulties and deficiencies in the offence description.  149    First, the description again shows a very poor appreciation of the terms of the underlying tax legislation.  It is not entirely clear what is meant by “withholding” GST.  As already briefly touched on, in very simple terms, the GST Act provides that an enterprise that makes a taxable supply of a good or service must pay GST on that supply.  The amount ultimately payable by the enterprise for a given period (the “net amount”) is determined by calculating the sum of the amounts of GST which the enterprise is liable to pay for that period, less input tax credits.  Input tax credits essentially comprise the GST paid by the enterprise in respect of creditable acquisitions.  Creditable acquisitions are, in general terms, acquisitions of things for the purpose of carrying on an enterprise.  While in a broad sense it might be able to be said that GST payable by an enterprise in respect of a taxable supply is withheld until it is factored into the calculation of the net amount for the relevant GST period, there is otherwise no relevant concept of “withholding” GST in the GST Act.  It may be, in the context of the description of the offence, the reference to “withholding GST” was intended to mean no more than not paying GST that should otherwise have been paid. 150    Second, and even accepting that “withholding” may be loosely taken to be a reference to Mr Caratti not paying to the ATO (and therefore “withholding”) GST properly payable by Whitby Land Company in respect of taxable supplies made during the relevant period, it is unclear what supplies were made.  How or why did Whitby Land Company become liable to pay GST?  Perhaps more significantly, there are no particulars of how or why Mr Caratti’s actions in not paying Whitby Land Company’s GST liability involved deception and dishonesty.  The link between Mr Caratti and Whitby Land Company and, more importantly, why the alleged non-payment of GST owed by Whitby Land Company was a financial advantage to Mr Caratti, is also not explained or otherwise apparent from the description of the offence. 151    Mr Caratti contended that the description of the Whitby Land Company offence lacked appropriate particularity, was ambiguous and included an incorrect date.  It lacked particularity because it did not describe how it was alleged that Mr Caratti caused Whitby Land Company to withhold GST.  It was ambiguous because it was unclear what “withholding GST” meant and unclear how it was alleged that the withholding of GST payable by Whitby Land Company was a financial advantage to Mr Caratti. 152    Mr Caratti’s contentions concerning lack of particularity and ambiguity in respect of the description of the Whitby Land Company offence have some merit for the reasons already given.  But is the description, poor and imprecise as it may be, sufficient to satisfy the requirement that it define or provide a meaningful or intelligible search perimeter?  153    The answer to that question is yes, though only barely so.   The description of the offence specifies the name of the accused (Mr Caratti), the relevant offence provision (s 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code), the date range during which the offence was alleged to have been committed (between 1 July 2010 and 31 December 2013) and the barest particulars of the factual allegations: that Mr Caratti deceptively and dishonestly caused Whitby Land Company to withhold GST properly payable by it and thereby obtained a financial advantage.  The absence of any, or any meaningful, particulars of how Whitby Land Company’s GST liability arose and why Mr Caratti’s withholding of amounts payable by Whitby Land Company was deceptive and dishonest is unfortunate and problematic.  On balance, however, that deficiency is insufficient to result in invalidity. 154    If, contrary to this conclusion, the statement of the Whitby Land Company offence was found to be deficient and defective, it would be necessary to consider whether that part of the warrants could properly be severed.  The applicable principles in relation to severing invalid portions of a warrant are considered later in these reasons in the context of ground 1C (the ground relating to the paragraph in the warrants relating to the seizure of storage devices).  Given the conclusion that has been reached, it is unnecessary to decide whether it would have been appropriate to sever this description of the Whitby Land Company offence from the warrants.  There is, however, much to be said for the proposition that an invalid statement of one offence in the third condition of the warrants could appropriately be severed without doing violence to the balance of the warrants.  Thus, even if it had been found that the statement of the Whitby Land Company offence was deficient, it would not necessarily follow that the warrants as a whole would be declared invalid.The Gucce Holdings Offence155    The final offence referred to in the third condition of the warrants related to the Gucce Holdings allegations.  The offence is described in the following terms:In December 2011 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI and Tina BAZZO, by a deception, in that they falsified costs incurred by Gucce Holdings Pty Ltd, attempted to dishonestly obtain a financial advantage by overstating Goods and Services Tax input credits, from another person, namely the Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Sections 11.1 and 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth). 156    It can readily be seen that the Gucce Holdings offence is again described in unfortunately broad, inelegant and somewhat opaque terms.  The essential allegation would appear to be that Mr Caratti and Ms Bazzo falsified costs incurred by Gucce Holdings and thereby attempted to obtain a financial advantage from the ATO.  No particulars of the falsified costs are provided.  Nor is it entirely clear how the falsification of costs incurred by Gucce Holdings could secure (or attempt to secure) a financial advantage for Mr Caratti and Ms Bazzo.  157    A reader of the warrant who had some familiarity with the GST Act and the concept of input tax credits would perhaps have been able to discern that the falsification of costs would, if the costs were said to relate to a creditable acquisition, ultimately result in an overstatement of input tax credits and a consequent reduction of the amount payable to the ATO by Gucce Holdings in respect of GST.  If the costs were dishonestly falsified, the consequent reduction in GST payable could then be seen to involve dishonesty.  That could conceivably be seen to amount to the dishonest obtaining of a financial advantage by Gucce Holdings.  158    The point is, however, that these links between falsified costs, overstated input tax credits and a reduced GST liability, would not necessarily be readily apparent to someone not familiar with the operation of the GST Act.  An occupier of promises who was not well-acquainted with the GST Act might encounter difficulties in understanding the offence.  There could be little doubt that an indictment containing this offence would be liable to challenge.  At the very least, it is likely that the prosecution would be required to provide further and better particulars of the offence.159    Nevertheless, as with the other offences, on balance there is sufficient particularity and clarity in the description of the Gucce Holdings offence to indicate the area of search permitted by the warrants, though again only barely so.  The description includes the name of the accused (Mr Caratti and Ms Bazzo), the relevant offence provision (ss 11.1 and 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code) the date (or date range) when the offence was alleged to have been committed (December 2011), and the general gist of the offending conduct (the falsification of costs resulting ultimately in the dishonest reduction of the amount payable to the ATO in respect of GST).  160    The Gucce Holdings offence clearly could have been described in clearer, fuller and more precise terms.  In all the circumstances, however, the description was sufficient, albeit only barely so, for the purposes of a valid warrant. Conclusion in relation to ground 1B161    To say the very least, the description of each of the offences in the third condition of the warrants left a lot to be desired.  In each case the language used was infelicitous, in some respects ambiguous or unclear, and generally showed a lack of appreciation of the terms of the underlying tax legislation.  The descriptions lack the particularisation that would be expected if the offences as described were included in an indictment.  Nevertheless, it is necessary to approach the description of the offences to which a search warrant relates broadly and without overzealous technicality.  The offence descriptions must be considered fairly and in the context of the warrant as a whole.  The question is whether in all the circumstances the nature of the offence to which the warrant relates is sufficiently disclosed so as to indicate the area of search.162    When considered in that light, the descriptions of the offences in the third condition of the warrants in question are sufficient to avoid a finding of invalidity, though perhaps only barely so in relation to some of the offences.  While the area of search defined by the offence descriptions (read together with the first two conditions) was undoubtedly very broad, nonetheless the degree of particularity was in all the circumstances adequate.  While the language used was less than ideal and in some respects vague and ambiguous, nonetheless the deficiencies were not such as to render the warrants invalid on the basis that the persons affected by them would be unable to know or ascertain the authorised area of search. Ground 1A - was the information before the issuing officer sufficient to ground the issue of the warrants?163    The issue to be resolved in the context of ground 1A is whether the information before the issuing officer (the affidavit of Federal Agent Szolnoki) was capable of satisfying the issuing officer (the magistrate) that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that there was or would be evidential material at the premises to which the warrants related.  Relevantly, the evidential material comprised things as described in the first and second conditions in the warrant and with respect to which there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that those things would afford evidence as to the commission of the offences referred to in the third condition of the warrants.  164    A suspicion in this context is a “state of conjecture or surmise” or a “slight opinion without sufficient evidence”: George v Rockett (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 115, citing Shaaban bin Hussien v Chong Fook Kam [1970] AC 942, 948 and Queensland Bacon v Rees (1966) 115 CLR 266, 303.  There must, however be some factual basis for the conjecture, surmise or opinion:  George v Rockett at 115.  Where a statute prescribes that there must be “reasonable grounds” for a state of mind, it requires the existence of facts which are sufficient to induce that state of mind in a reasonable person: George v Rockett at 112.  The requirement of “reasonable grounds for suspicion of guilt” has, albeit in a different context, been described as a very limited requirement:  Shaaban bin Hussien v Chong Fook Cam [1970] AC 942 at 949; Williams v Keelty at 213 [165].165    The issuing officer need not entertain the relevant suspicion; it is only necessary for the issuing officer to be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for entertaining the suspicion: Williams v Keelty at 213 [167].  The requirement of “reasonable grounds for a suspicion” imports an objective test, though a decision concerning whether grounds are reasonable invariably involves a value or normative judgment about which there may be legitimate differences of opinion:  Williams v Keelty at 213 [166].  An issuing officer’s finding that there were “reasonable grounds” for entertaining the relevant suspicion is only impeachable if the finding was one which could not lawfully be reached on the information before the issuing officer:   Williams v Keelty at 213 [166], 214-215 [172].166    An applicant who challenges an issuing officer’s decision to issue a warrant bears the onus of proving that the information before the issuing officer was not capable of establishing reasonable grounds for entertaining the relevant suspicion:  Williams v Keelty at 225 [236]; Wong v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police [2014] FCA 443 at [4].  That is a “difficult and exacting task”:  Wong at [4].  A court is not entitled to substitute its own opinion on whether there were reasonable grounds for the opinion of the issuing officer:  Williams v Keelty at 213 [166].  The applicant must establish that there was an absence of “foundational facts” from which the issuing officer might entertain the relevant suspicion on reasonable grounds:  Wong at [4]; Williams v Keelty at 213-215 [168]-[173].167    The relevant “foundational facts” before the issuing officer in this matter were the facts deposed to by Federal Agent Szolnoki in relation to the Starbrake, Westend, Whitby Land Company and Gucce Holdings allegations.  Those facts have already been summarised.  There could be little doubt that those facts were capable of establishing that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that Mr Caratti had committed certain offences and that there was, or would be, things at the premises to which the warrants related which would afford evidence of those offences.  So much so appeared to be conceded by Mr Caratti:  at least he did not expressly contend otherwise.  168    Mr Caratti’s contention that the information before the issuing officer was not capable of establishing reasonable grounds for entertaining the relevant suspicion focused on the description of the offences in the third condition of the warrants.  He advanced two related arguments for why the information was not capable of satisfying the issuing officer that there were reasonable grounds for entertaining the relevant suspicion in relation to the offences described in the third condition.  Mr Caratti’s first argument was based on the proposition that the offences in the third condition were broader than justified by the information before the issuing officer.  The second argument involved the contention that the information before the issuing officer could not support the dates included in the offences as drafted in the third condition.  Were the offences broader than justified by the information?169    Mr Caratti contended that the “foundational facts” in Federal Agent Szolnoki’s affidavit related to single or discreet transactions.  In Mr Caratti’s submission, while there may have been reasonable grounds for suspecting offences concerning those discreet transactions, the offences in the third condition of the warrants were expressed in very broad terms.  Mr Caratti contended that the warrants were in that respect “broader than justified”.  It was, he submitted, “wrong” to issue a warrant authorising a “general” search by reference to broad offences where the reasonable grounds for suspicion related to discreet transactions.170    In advancing that argument, Mr Caratti relied heavily on the obiter dicta of Fox J in The Queen v Tillett; Ex parte Newton (1969) 14 FLR 101.  In that case, Fox J quashed a warrant issued under the former s 10 of the Crimes Act on the basis that it suffered from a number of defects.  Having determined that the warrant should be quashed on the basis of those defects, his Honour went on to make the following observation as to the area of search permitted by the warrant (at 125);  As to the area of the search, I believe that the requirements are flexible.  If, as is now likely to be the case, the issue of the warrant rests on statutory authority, the content of the warrant is governed by the statute and must not only comply with the more specific requirements thereof, but it should not be wider than is necessary to carry out the manifest legislative purpose.  In a case under s 10 (b), for example, it would be wrong to issue a warrant which authorized a general search of bank premises, when the information pointed to one forged cheque.  Even a search for all documents relating to a particular account may be too wide.  There should be no limitation on an adequate search, but it is a function of the information to show how wide that search may have to be, and the function of the justice to ensure that his warrant does not authorize anything wider.  Each case must depend upon its own facts.171    It should be noted that the search warrant in question in Tillett purported to permit the search of bank premises and the seizure of “books, papers, documents or other things” as to which there were “reasonable grounds for believing that the same will afford evidence of the commission of an offence against the Commonwealth Crimes Act”.  No specific offence was specified.  There was effectively no limitation on the books, papers, documents and things that could be searched for and seized.  It is not surprising, in those circumstances, that the warrant was found to be defective.  The observations of Fox J should be considered in that context. 172    It is readily apparent that Fox J was not intending to lay down any rigid test concerning the issue of search warrants or the permitted area of search and seizure.  As his Honour said, the “requirements are flexible”, the “content of the warrant is governed by the statute” in question and that “each case must be governed by its own facts”.  His Honour’s reference to the warrant not being “wider than necessary”, and the issuing officer’s function being to ensure that the warrant does not authorise “anything wider”, must be read as meaning anything wider than permitted under the relevant statutory provision, properly construed.  Contrary to Mr Caratti’s submission, Tillet is not authority for the much broader proposition that the offence specified in a search warrant must be particularised in the narrowest possible terms supported by the information before the issuing officer.173    The question is whether the information before the issuing officer was capable of satisfying the officer, in simplified terms, that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that there were things at the premises that would afford evidence of the commission of the offences specified in the warrants.  It may readily be accepted that the more broadly that a warrant describes the kinds of evidential material to be searched for (including the description of the offences), the more difficult it may be for the information before the issuing officer to satisfy this requirement: George v Rockett at 117.  By the same token, it is not impermissible to describe the object of the search in a broad non-specific fashion: Dunesky v Elder (1994) 54 FCR 540 at 555E-F (per Lockhart, Beaumont and Hill JJ, with whom Black CJ agreed at 541F and Lindgren J agreed at 558D).  174    While the object of the search is unquestionably described in very broad terms in the warrants in question here, it cannot be concluded that there information before the issuing officer was not capable of satisfying the issuing officer that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that there were things at the premises that would afford evidence of the commission of the offences specified in the third condition of the warrants. 175    Mr Caratti’s characterisation of the information before the issuing officer as involving “discreet transactions” is neither fair nor accurate.  Each of the four allegations involved relatively complex facts and conduct that extended over a period of time.  There is no merit in Mr Caratti’s contention that the information before the issuing officer only supported the issue of search warrants that related to discreet transactions. 176    The Starbrake allegations and offences do not concern a single or discreet transaction.  While the focus of the allegations and offences may have been on the reclassification of the royalty income received by Starbrake, it was also necessary to have regard to a broader course of conduct relevant to the alleged offences.  That conduct allegedly included the receipt of the royalty payment, the initial accounting for that receipt, the subsequent direction by Mr Caratti to the accountant to change the accounting for the receipt and the subsequent conduct in lodging Starbrake’s income tax returns and business activity statement.  There is no basis for Mr Caratti’s apparent contention that the information before the issuing officer only permitted the issue of a warrant which specified an offence particularised in terms of a single or discreet transaction, being the reclassification of the royalty payment.177    It may be accepted, for the reasons already given, that the first Starbrake offence as particularised in the third condition of the warrant could have been drafted with a greater degree of particularity and clarity.  It does not follow, however, that the warrants authorised a “general search”, or a search which was wider than justified by the information that was before the issuing officer.178    Much the same can be said in relation to the other allegations and corresponding offences described in the third condition of the warrants.179    The Westend offence may at first blush appear to focus primarily on the falsification of costs supposedly incurred by Westend.  It does not follow that the offence related to a single transaction.  The offence also involved other conduct and circumstances that provided necessary context and background to the alleged falsification of costs.  The additional factual allegations included the development and subsequent sale of the land to which the costs allegedly related, the non-declaration of income derived from the sale of the land, the ATO audit and the provision to the ATO of allegedly falsified invoices.  There is no basis for the contention that, for the purposes of the warrants, the Westend offences were required to be particularised in terms of a single or discreet transaction.  While the Westend offences could have been drafted with more precision and particularity, it does not follow that the warrants permitted a general search, or a search that was wider than justified by the information before the issuing officer, or wider than permitted under s 3E of the Crimes Act.180    The Whitby Land Company allegations and offence also do not involve a single discreet transaction.  The description of the Whitby Land Company offence focused largely on the allegation that Mr Caratti caused Whitby Land Company to withhold GST that should have been paid to the ATO.  The information before the issuing officer included details of a course of conduct whereby Whitby Land Company allegedly became liable to pay GST in respect of supplies it made over a period of time which extended over three and a half years.  The alleged withholding of GST over that period was central to the offence.  The issuing officer was not required to issue a warrant which only authorised a search by reference to an offence particularised in terms of a single or discreet transaction. 181    The Gucce Holdings allegations and offence raise somewhat different considerations.  The allegations identified in Federal Agent Szolnoki’s affidavit revealed a course of conduct which apparently occurred over a period of time whereby Gucce Holdings overstated input tax credits.  There was no single or discreet transaction.  Indeed, if anything, the Gucce Holdings offence in the third condition was particularised in terms that were narrower than the allegations in Federal Agent Szolnoki’s affidavit would have warranted.  That is because the offence as drafted was limited to the date December 2011.  As will be seen, Mr Caratti’s second argument in support of ground 1A concerned the date in the Gucce Holdings offence.  For present purposes, it is sufficient to state that Mr Caratti’s submission that the Gucce Holdings offence was particularised in terms broader than justified by the information before the issuing officer has no merit.Were the dates in the offences wrong?182    Mr Caratti contended that the information on oath before the issuing officer was not capable of providing reasonable grounds to suspect that the offences in the third condition were committed on the dates or date ranges particularised in offences.  In short, he submitted that, on any proper interpretation of the offences as drafted, the foundational facts in Federal Agent Szolnoki’s affidavit suggested that the alleged offences were committed on dates different to those particularised.  It followed, in Mr Caratti’s submission, that the issuing officer could not lawfully have been satisfied in accordance with s 3E of the Crimes Act in respect of the offences in the warrant.183    When close consideration is given to the information in Federal Agent Szolnoki’s affidavit, together with the details of the offences in the third condition of the warrants, it can be seen that there are indeed a number of issues and ambiguities with the dates or date ranges particularised in the third condition offences.  The question is whether those issues and ambiguities are sufficient to impugn the issuing officer’s decision to issue the warrants.184    The first Starbrake offence as drafted alleges that the offence was committed in 2008.  It is permissible for an offence to be particularised by reference to a date range, even a broad date range, particularly for the purposes of a search warrant.  It might be alleged or suspected, for example, that the conduct constituting the offence occurred by a course of conduct over a period of time.  Equally, it may be difficult for the investigators, at that stage of the investigation, to pinpoint exactly when the relevant conduct constituting the offence occurred or was suspected of having occurred.  It was therefore not impermissible for the first Starbrake offence to be particularised in terms of having been committed either throughout, or on some day or days during, 2008.185    That said, there is a potential problem or difficulty with the particularisation of the date in the first Starbrake offence.  That difficulty is that the conduct constituting the offence appeared to be either the alleged deception (the reclassification of the royalty income, or perhaps the lodging of a false tax return) or the dishonest obtaining of an advantage (the non-payment of income tax properly payable by Starbrake).  The information in Federal Agent Szolnoki’s affidavit tended to suggest that the alleged reclassification occurred in late 2011 or early 2012, shortly before Starbrake’s income tax return for the relevant financial year was lodged.  As for the obtaining of an advantage, strictly speaking, Starbrake (and therefore Mr Caratti) could not be said to have obtained any financial advantage from the deception until the tax return that (by reason of the reclassification) did not include or disclose the income derived from the royalty was lodged.  Only then would Starbrake’s taxable income and liability for income tax be assessed on the allegedly false basis.  The only apparent relevance of the year 2008 would appear to be that the royalty payment occurred in July 2008, so any tax liability referable to it would have related to the financial year 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009.186    This analysis of the relevant information and offence is, however, overly technical and narrow where the issue is whether the information was capable of supporting the issue of a search warrant relating to the offence.  It is an analysis that would perhaps be appropriate if the relevant question was whether a charge in these terms had been made out on the evidence.  It might equally be appropriate if the question was whether an indictment containing this charge was properly pleaded and particularised.  Such a narrow and technical analysis of the first Starbrake offence is not appropriate in considering whether it was open to an issuing officer to issue a warrant under s 3E of the Crimes Act relating to that offence.187    As Burchett J pointed out in Beneficial Finance (at 543), in the passage extracted earlier, the legislature has entrusted the task of issuing search warrants not only to magistrates, but also to lay justices of the peace.  Also relevant is the fact that, in deciding whether or not to issue a warrant, an issuing officer is acting administratively, not judicially, although the discretion is to be exercised in a judicial fashion:  Baker v Campbell (1983) 153 CLR 52 at 70 (per Gibbs CJ).  Just as it would be inappropriate to insist upon the invalidation of a warrant for a legally incorrect formulation of an offence, even if the substance could be understood, so too would it be inappropriate to impose an overly technical or exacting standard on issuing officers in considering the particularisation of offences specified in search warrants. 188    That point was recently emphasised by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Polley v Johnson [2015] NSWCA 256.  In that case, Simpson JA (with whom Beazley P and McColl JA agreed at [1] and [2]) said (at [44], [46] to [49]): 44    In determining whether or not to issue a warrant, an eligible issuing officer is acting administratively, or ministerially, although the discretion to do so is to be exercised judicially: Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39; 153 CLR 52 at p 70, per Gibbs CJ (noting that his Honour was in dissent as to the principal issue in that proceeding). It is not the role of the eligible issuing officer to whom application is made to explore any fine legal points concerning the construction of the legislative provision that creates the searchable offence upon which reliance is placed by the police officer seeking the issue of a warrant.…46    I accept that, in this case, it was reasonably clear to Ms Smith, from the information in the application, that there was then no current relevant judicial proceeding. But it is not the role of the eligible issuing officer to consider the sufficiency of the supporting material to found a conviction for the searchable offence identified in the application. The question for that officer is whether that material provides “reasonable grounds” for the issue of a warrant, which may yield relevant evidence or information.47    Nor is it the role of the eligible issuing officer to engage in the construction of the legislation in question; particularly is that so, where, as here, there existed an unresolved (unresolved until the decision of the primary judge in this very case) issue of the construction of that provision. Ironically, it was the very absence of certainty about the construction of s 326(2) upon which the applicant relied to advance her claim for leave to appeal.48    In a very different context (the extent of the application of legal professional privilege) Mason J (as he then was) and others in the High Court have commented on the undesirability of committing the determination of complex legal issues to individuals exercising administrative functions: Baker v Campbell, at p 75-76; O’Reilly v The Commissioners of the State Bank of Victoria [1983] HCA 47; 153 CLR 1 at 26. A similar approach was taken by Brennan J (as he then was) in relation to s 155(1) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), which required the provision of information which might have exposed the person supplying the information to the risk of penalty: Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission; Dunlop Olympic Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9; 152 CLR 328 at 355. Yet that is the very nature of the exercise, it was implicit in the applicant’s argument, upon which Ms Smith ought to have embarked.49    The guidance to be obtained from these cases is limited, but not non-existent. In each case, the argument concerned an implicitly asserted obligation on a non-judicial officer to make decisions that are essentially judicial, and of some legal complexity.189    While it is not entirely clear, it would appear that the first Starbrake offence was particularised as having been committed in 2008 because the royalty payment was received in 2008.  If, as alleged, that payment comprised income and was not a loan, it should have been returned as forming part of Starbrake’s assessable income for the financial year 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009.  While an overzealous and technical analysis might suggest that the charge could or should have been particularised with different dates, it was nevertheless open to the issuing officer to be satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that the first Starbrake offence was properly particularised by reference to 2008.  It was open to the executing officer to be satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that at least some of the factual or legal elements of the alleged offence were referable to the year 2008.  It was not the role of the issuing officer to explore fine legal distinctions or arguments that might suggest that the offence could or should have been particularised by reference to different dates.190    Mr Caratti’s contention that the information before the issuing officer did not permit the issue of a warrant containing the second Starbrake offence has no merit for the same reasons.  The second Starbrake offence was also particularised as having been committed in 2008.  For the reasons already given, the second Starbrake offence should be read as relating to the non-payment of GST referrable to the royalty payment that was made in mid-2008.  Starbrake was required to lodge a business activity statement and pay GST referable to the supply to which the royalty payment related in 2008.  Accordingly, the alleged failure to “pass on” GST also arguably occurred in 2008.  Whilst it may have been possible (and perhaps even preferable) to particularise the offence by reference to a particular date (for example the date the business activity was in fact lodged, or was required to be lodged) that level of particularisation was not required for the purposed of a valid search warrant relating to the alleged offence.  It was open to the issuing officer to be satisfied in accordance with s 3E of the Crimes Act in relation to the second Starbrake offence as particularised. 191    The Westend offence concerned the allegation that Mr Caratti falsified costs in a dishonest attempt to reduce tax otherwise payable by Westend. The offence was particularised as having occurred in 2008.  The information before the issuing officer, however, suggested that the alleged falsification of costs involved false invoices that were allegedly created in 2009, not 2008. 192    It is unclear why the Westend offence was particularised by reference to 2008.  There are, however, some possible explanations.  The information before the issuing officer suggested, for example, that some of the work to which the false invoices related may have occurred during 2008.  That is because the developed land was sold between 2003 to 2008.  As land sales were made during 2008, it would also appear that some of the income earned by Westend, against which the allegedly “falsified costs” were presumably allocated for income tax purposes, was earned during 2008.  That might also provide a basis for suspecting that the offence was committed, at least in part, in 2008.193    That said, there is no doubt a degree of uncertainty and ambiguity concerning the date period during which it was alleged that the Westend offence was committed.  It no doubt would have been preferable for there to have been more clarity and particularity in relation to the date of the Westend offence.  The particularisation of the offence as having been committed in 2008 would no doubt have been problematic if the question was whether an indictment containing the Westend offence should be struck down or dismissed having regard to the evidence.  That, however, is not the question here.  Such a technical and narrow approach to the particularisation of the offence is unwarranted where the relevant question is the sufficiency of the information before an issuing officer for the purposes of issuing a search warrant.  It was at the very least open to the issuing officer to be satisfied that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that the Westend offence was referable, at least in part, to 2008.194    The Whitby Land Company offence was alleged to have been committed over a three and half year period between 1 July 2010 and 31 December 2013.  That would appear to be the period during which it was alleged that Mr Caratti caused Whitby Land Company to “withhold” GST that was properly payable to the ATO and thereby obtained a financial advantage.  It would appear from the information before the issuing officer that the relevant supplies in respect of which it was alleged Whitby Land Company was liable for GST, the sales of the Nicholson Road land, occurred at various times during the period 2010 and 2012.  The GST payable in respect of those supplies should have been brought to account in business activity statements lodged, or required to be lodged, during the latter part of 2010 and perhaps into 2013.  195    The dates in the Whitby Land Company offence would appear to relate to specific dates when business activity statements were required to be lodged, and GST paid, in respect of the taxable sales of land.  It may be, as Mr Caratti effectively contended, that strictly speaking this period was slightly broader than the period during which taxable sales were made and GST liabilities incurred based on the information before the issuing officer.  The information before the issuing officer concerning the dates of the relevant supplies was somewhat lacking in clarity and particularity.  Again, however, the narrow and technical analysis inherent in Mr Caratti’s contentions is, in all the circumstances, not the appropriate analysis to adopt in considering whether it was open to the issuing officer to issue the warrants.  In all the circumstances it was open to the issuing officer to be satisfied as required by s 3E of the Crimes Act in respect of the Westend offence particularised in terms of the period 1 July 2010 to 31 December 2013.  196    The central allegations in the Gucce Holdings offence were that Mr Caratti and Ms Bazzo falsified costs incurred by Gucce Holdings, with the result that Gucce Holdings overstated input tax credits properly claimable by it.  In so doing, it was alleged that Mr Caratti and Ms Bazzo obtained a financial benefit by deception.  The date on which the offence was alleged to have been committed was December 2011. 197    It is somewhat of a mystery why the offence was particularised by reference to December 2011.  On one view of the information before the issuing officer, it would have been open to suspect, on reasonable grounds, that overstated input tax credits were or may have been claimed over a much longer period.  The relevant works in respect of which the costs were allegedly falsified extended from about July 2011 to about November 2012.  The apparently legitimate invoices in relation to the works extended over the period August 2011 to December 2012.  There appears to have been a reasonable basis to suspect that the allegedly false invoices (and corresponding overstated input tax credits) covered the same periods.198    Despite this apparent disjunct between the information, which suggested a broad offence period, and the offence, which was particularised in terms of a relatively narrow period, it was open to the issuing officer to issue warrants containing the Gucce Holdings charge as particularised.  The particularised date, December 2011, was within the broader period during which the offences might reasonably have been suspected of having been committed.  Conclusion in relation to ground 1A199    Mr Caratti’s contention that the search and seizure authorised by the search warrants in question exceeded what was justified by the information before the issuing officer is rejected.  The warrants were not in any relevant sense wider than justified on the basis that the offences in the third condition could possibly have been drafted in narrower terms.  Nor can it be concluded that the information before the issuing officer required the offences in the third condition to contain different dates or date ranges.  While there was again a certain lack of clarity and particularity in the third condition offences, the information before the issuing officer was nevertheless capable of satisfying the officer that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that there was or would be evidential material at the relevant premises in respect of the offences specified in the third condition of the warrants.Ground 1C – the “storage medium” paragraph 200    Ground 1C concerns the following paragraph which appears immediately after the third condition in each of the warrants.Together with any storage medium or storage device which contains any of the above things and any manual, instruction, password, or other thing which is needed to gain access to or interpret or decode any of the above things.201    Mr Caratti contended that this “storage medium” paragraph had the result that the warrants as a whole “exceeded what was justified by the material before the issuing officer”.  In Mr Caratti’s submission, the information before the issuing officer did not provide reasonable grounds for suspecting that a “storage medium or storage device” comprised evidential materials simply because a “thing” stored on or in the device may otherwise have fallen within the terms of the warrant.  He also contended that the storage medium paragraph impermissibly subverted the requirements of s 3L of the Crimes Act.  202    There is merit in Mr Caratti’s contentions concerning the operation and validity of this paragraph in the warrants.203    It would appear that the storage medium paragraph was intended to deal with the seizure of computers and computer related devices, such as hard drives and USB storage devices.  Section 3L of the Crimes Act contains detailed provisions that concern, in general terms, the use of electronic equipment during the execution of a warrant to access data on the equipment to determine if the data constitutes evidential material.  Perhaps more significantly, it provides for the copying of the data and specifies the circumstances in which, instead of copying the data, the equipment itself can be seized.  Section 3L (1), (1A), (2) and (3) are of particular relevance to this ground.  Those subsections provide as follows:  (1)    The executing officer of a warrant in relation to premises, or a constable assisting, may operate electronic equipment at the warrant premises to access data (including data not held at the premises) if he or she suspects on reasonable grounds that the data constitutes evidential material. Note:    A constable can obtain an order requiring a person with knowledge of a computer or computer system to provide assistance: see section 3LA. (1A)    If the executing officer or constable assisting suspects on reasonable grounds that any data accessed by operating the electronic equipment constitutes evidential material, he or she may: (a)    copy any or all of the data accessed by operating the electronic equipment to a disk, tape or other associated device brought to the premises; or (b)    if the occupier of the premises agrees in writing--copy any or all of the data accessed by operating the electronic equipment to a disk, tape or other associated device at the premises; and take the device from the premises.(2)    If the executing officer or a constable assisting, after operating the equipment, finds that evidential material is accessible by doing so, he or she may: (a)    seize the equipment and any disk, tape or other associated device; or(b)    if the material can, by using facilities at the premises, be put in documentary form--operate the facilities to put the material in that form and seize the documents so produced. (3)    A constable may seize equipment under paragraph (2)(a) only if: (a)    it is not practicable to copy the data as mentioned in subsection (1A) or to put the material in documentary form as mentioned in paragraph (2)(b); or (b)    possession by the occupier of the equipment could constitute an offence.204    The meaning of the storage medium paragraph, read as it must be in the context of the warrant as a whole, is somewhat obscure.  Like other parts of the warrant, it is poorly drafted.  The reason for including it in the warrant is unclear given that the first condition of the warrant specifically referred to “computers and peripheral devices” and specifically adverted to documents and things “stored on a computer, or on a computer storage device, or on any other type of storage medium or storage device”.  The need for including this additional paragraph is also questionable given the detailed provisions in the Crimes Act relating to the search and seizure of electronic equipment. 205    There are at least two available interpretations of the paragraph.  One interpretation would be potentially problematic in terms of the validity of the warrant (subject to questions of severance), the other would not.  206    The interpretation embraced by the Commissioner was, in effect, that the storage medium paragraph does no more than clarify or confirm that an item falling within that paragraph, for example a “storage medium or storage device”, such as a USB device or “memory stick”, can be seized if it otherwise satisfies all three conditions in the warrant.  If that was the extent of the operation of the paragraph, it would not be problematic.  The question is, however, whether that is the extent of the intended and actual operation of the paragraph.  207    There is no reason to doubt that an electronic device containing data could itself constitute evidential material and therefore be seized under the warrant.  That would be the case even without the storage medium paragraph.  A hypothetical example of such an item would be if a searching officer located a USB storage device which was labelled “Starbrake accounts, tax returns and BAS-2008 to 2012”.  Such an item would appear to satisfy each condition in the warrant.  It would satisfy condition one because it could be considered to be an “electronic storage medium” in respect of which there were reasonable grounds to suspect that it contained “business records” and “tax returns”, all of which are things referred to expressly in condition one.  It would satisfy condition two because it would be reasonable to suspect that it related to Starbrake, one of the listed entities in the second condition.  Most importantly, it would be likely to satisfy condition three because there would most likely be reasonable grounds for suspecting that the device itself would afford evidence of the commission of the two Starbrake offences in the third condition.208    The important point to emphasise in respect of this hypothetical example is that the device itself, not just the data on it, could constitute evidential material.  Given the label on the USB device, there would be reasonable grounds to suspect that all of the data stored on it would be potentially relevant to the offences in the warrant.  It would also be reasonable to suspect that the physical item itself (as distinct from the data on it) might be relevant.  For instance, the label on the USB device itself might be evidence of the nature and provenance of both the device and its contents.  It might be open, for example, to an executing officer to suspect that the handwriting on the label would assist in identifying who was responsible for compiling the data on the device.  That scenario is analogous, in some respects, to the situation where a search officer located a single relevant document within a larger book, file or folder.  If it was reasonable to suspect that the book, folder or file would assist in establishing the nature, authorship or provenance of the single document within it, the book, file or folder itself could be seized as evidential material: Harts Australia v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (2002) 117 FCR 358 (Harts (2002) (First instance)) at 370 [39]; Adler v Gardiner [2002] FCA 1141; (2002) 43 ACSR 24 at 29-20 [21]-[22].  209    In such circumstances, it would be unnecessary to utilise any of the provisions in s 3L of the Act.  There would be reasonable grounds to suspect that the device itself would comprise evidential material as defined by the three conditions in the warrant, even without the storage medium paragraph.  Section 3F(1)(c) of the Crimes Act provides that an executing officer or constable assisting is authorised to seize “the kinds of evidential material specified in the warrant”.  The hypothetical USB device itself could therefore be seized under the terms of the warrant and s 3F without resort to s 3L(2)(a) of the Crimes Act.  That would be the case even without the storage medium paragraph.210    The difficulty for the Commissioner is that the interpretation of the storage medium paragraph advocated by him is not supported by either the text of the paragraph or the context in which the paragraph appears in the warrants.  A fair reading of the storage medium paragraph in context suggests that it purports to authorise more than the seizure of items, like the hypothetical USB device, that would otherwise meet each of the three conditions in the warrant and be able to be seized under s 3F(1)(c).  The words “together with” at the beginning of the paragraph suggest that the paragraph purports to operate outside of, or in addition to, the three conditions in the warrant.  It would also be unnecessary to add a paragraph to simply confirm or clarify that computers or other electronic equipment or devices that otherwise meet all conditions in the warrant could be seized.  As indicated earlier, computers and storage devices are already expressly included in the first condition of the warrant.  211    When read in context, what the paragraph in fact purports to do is to authorise the seizure of an item (for example a storage device) if it contained anything which met the three conditions in the warrant, even if the storage device itself, as distinct from its contents, did not meet or satisfy each of the three conditions.  It also purports to authorise the seizure of the storage device itself in circumstances which would not necessarily be permitted by s 3L of the Crimes Act.  Another hypothetical example might serve to illustrate how the impugned paragraph purports to extend the authority to seize storage devices, such as computers, beyond what would otherwise be permitted by s 3F(1)(c) and the three conditions in the warrant or s 3L of the Act.212    If a searching officer located an unlabelled laptop computer in the television room of Mr Caratti’s residential premises, it is doubtful that the officer could reasonably form a view, absent further information, that the computer fell within all three conditions of the warrant.  Arguably it would satisfy the first condition because it was a “laptop computer”, which is amongst the long list of items in the first condition.  Perhaps more contentiously, given that the computer was located in Mr Caratti’s house, it could possibly be said to “relate to” Mr Caratti, who is listed in the second condition.  As an aside, this serves to demonstrate the breadth of the first two conditions in the warrants.213    It is, however, difficult to see how it could reasonably be concluded that the computer would satisfy the third condition.  There would not appear to be any reasonable grounds to suspect that it would afford evidence of any of the offences listed in the third condition.  For all the officer knew, the computer might contain nothing more than recordings of Mr Caratti’s favourite episodes of “The Simpsons”.  That might be evidence of an offence under the Copyright Act.  It could not reasonably be suspected of being evidence of any of the third condition offences.  Without more the computer could not be seized.  214    If however, there was something to suggest that the computer contained data that might be relevant to the third condition offences, the officer could operate the equipment pursuant to s 3L(1) of the Act.  Let it be assumed that the officer had reasonable grounds to suspect that there may be data stored on the computer that might constitute evidential material and that, upon operating the computer, the officer found that thousands of documents (in the Microsoft “Word” electronic format) were saved to the computer’s hard drive.  Those documents comprised personal correspondence that, with one exception, had nothing whatsoever to do with any of the condition three offences.  Assume that the exception was a letter that contained admissions relevant to one of the offences.  Assume also that there was nothing to suggest that the position, location or provenance of the relevant “Word” version of the letter as stored or saved on the computer was relevant, or that the computer itself would assist in proving the authorship or provenance of the electronic version of the letter.  215    In such circumstances, the officer could take one of two courses of action under s 3L.216    First, the officer could utilise the provisions of s 3L(1A) of the Crimes Act and copy the data stored on the computer onto another disk, tape or associated device and then take that device (the device containing the copied data) from the premises.  Second, the officer could utilise the provisions in s 3L(2) and either seize the computer itself (s 3L(2)(a)) or, using a printer at the premises, print the data in documentary form and then seize the printed document (s 3L(2)(b)).  Section 3L(3) provides, however, that the computer can only be seized in such circumstances if either it was not practicable to copy the data on the computer to a device as provided for in s 3L(1A), or possession of the computer by the occupier could constitute an offence. 217    The important point is that, in this hypothetical scenario, the officer would have no authority to seize the computer other than as provided for in s 3L(2)(a) and (3).  That is because, as already indicated, without more the officer would have no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the computer itself, as opposed to any data stored on it, would satisfy all three conditions of the warrant.  The computer could therefore not be seized pursuant to s 3F(1)(c).  At the very least the officer would have to turn his or her mind to the question whether it was or was not practicable to copy the data pursuant to s 3L(1A).  If it was practicable to copy the data, the computer could not be seized.218    The storage medium paragraph in the warrants would, however, appear to authorise the executing officer to seize this hypothetical computer (as a storage medium or storage device) on the basis that it contained a “thing” (the data file containing the relevant letter) because that data file or letter satisfied each of the conditions in the warrant.  It would appear to authorise the seizure of the computer in the circumstances where there were no reasonable grounds to suspect that the computer itself, as distinct from the single relevant data file stored on it, satisfied the third condition of the warrant and therefore comprised evidential material.  It would also appear to purport to authorise the seizure of the computer even if the conditions or circumstances in s 3L(3) were not satisfied.  219    In these circumstances, the impugned storage medium paragraph would appear to have the capacity to subvert or override the operation of s 3F(1)(c) and s 3L(2)(a) and (3) of the Act.  It purports to permit the seizure of electronic equipment and storage devices that would otherwise not be able to be seized.  220    The Commissioner’s submissions concerning the operation of this paragraph of the warrant appeared to proceed on a false premise.  The Commissioner submitted, in effect, that if a computer contained a file (even a single file) relevant to an offence in the warrant, the computer itself could be seized, without recourse to s 3L, if the first condition of the warrant included computers amongst the list of “things” that satisfied that condition.  This submission appeared to be based on the premise that if a single file saved on the computer might be relevant to the offence, and would therefore satisfy the third condition, it necessarily followed that there would be reasonable grounds to suspect that the computer itself, as distinct from the single file, would afford evidence of the commission of the offence.  That is wrong.  Of course, there may be cases (such as the hypothetical labelled USB device considered earlier) where there computer or device itself could reasonably be suspected of comprising evidential material.  That may be because the device itself may assist in proving the nature, identity or provenance of the files stored on it.  There may, for example be labels or identification marks on the computer hardware itself which might be potentially relevant because they might tend to prove who used the computer.  But that is not every case.  The impugned paragraph purports to authorise seizure of a computer in any case where a relevant file is saved on the computer. 221    The Commissioner also contended that s 3L was facultative, not limiting, and simply supplemented the broader search and seizure powers in s 3F.  That may be so.  If a computer or other storage device satisfies the conditions in the warrant that define the relevant evidential material, it may be seized pursuant to s 3F(1)(c) of the Act.  It does not need to be seized under s 3L(2)(a).  That is the case even where it may have only became apparent that the computer itself satisfied the conditions in the warrant, and was therefore able to be seized under s 3F(1)(c), after the procedure provided for in s 3L(1A) was utilised and the computer was operated and the data stored on it examined.  In circumstances where the computer is able to be seized under s 3F(1)(c), the question whether or not the condition or circumstance specified in s 3L(3) was satisfied does not arise.  In this sense, s 3L(2)(a) provides an additional or alternative basis for seizing a computer.222    However, the Commissioner’s submission that s 3L was facultative also proceeded on the premise that the mere presence of a relevant saved file on a computer would necessarily mean that the computer itself, as opposed to that relevant file, would satisfy the conditions in the warrant and could therefore be seized under s 3F(1)(c).  For the reasons already given, that is not always the case.  The computer in the hypothetical example just discussed provides an example of a case where the presence of a file on a computer would not necessarily justify seizure of the computer under s 3F(1)(c).  223    The Commissioner’s construction of the operation of ss 3F and 3L would effectively denude s 3L(2)(a) and (3) of any operation.  On the Commissioner’s construction, an executing officer would almost never have to turn his or her mind to whether it was practicable to copy the data on a computer, as opposed to seizing the computer, other than perhaps in circumstances where the first condition of the warrant does not include computers or electronic equipment in the list of “things” that might be seized.  Having regard to the way search warrants are almost invariably drafted these days, that will almost never be the case.   224    Contrary to the Commissioner’s submissions, the impugned storage medium paragraph impermissibly authorises seizure in circumstances not otherwise permitted by either s 3F or s 3L.  The impugned paragraph purports to authorise seizure of a computer or other electronic device, which may not itself be evidential material, simply because it contains a file that may constitute evidential material.  The very point of s 3L(2)(a) is to permit the seizure of such a computer (one that is not otherwise able to be seized under s 3F(1)(c) or any of the other paragraphs of s 3F), but only if the circumstances provided in s 3L(2)(a) and (3) are satisfied.  The impugned paragraph purports to permit seizure even if those conditions are not satisfied.225    It follows that there is merit in Mr Caratti’s contention that the storage medium paragraph (the paragraph immediately after the third condition in the warrants) operated, or purported to operate, so as to authorise the seizure of items that did not comprise evidential material and were not otherwise able to be seized under the relevant provisions of the Crimes Act.  To the extent that it authorised seizure of items not otherwise able to be seized under s 3F or s 3L of the Crimes Act, it was beyond power and invalid.  It was not open to the issuing officer to issue warrants containing the storage medium paragraph. 226    It does not necessarily follow, however, that the warrants (or the decisions to issue them) were void and of no effect and should be quashed.  That is because in certain circumstances parts of a search warrant that have been found to be invalid may be severed from the balance of the warrant.  The question is whether severance of the offending paragraph in the warrants is, in all the circumstances, warranted.Severance 227    In Parker v Churchill, Jackson J found that significant parts of a search warrant that purported to describe the offences to which the warrant related were invalid.  His Honour declared those parts of the warrant to be invalid, but ordered that the invalid parts could be severed from the warrants.   His Honour declared the warrants to be otherwise valid.  His Honour said (at 350): There is no reason why a search warrant granted under s 10 may not include in respect of the same place a number of quite different matters and there is nothing in the section itself to suggest that if one of the matters so included exceeds the powers conferred by s 10, the warrant necessarily fails as to the other matters. It is possible, of course, that the good and bad parts of the warrants may be so interlinked that one cannot stand without the other but that would usually mean no more than that the parts, as a matter of construction of the warrant, were not truly separate. Further, as the primary judge said, the authorities suggest that a search warrant, being an order of a justice is divisible and when good in part and bad in part, the good may be divided from the bad, and the good affirmed and the bad quashed: see R v Johnson & Franklin Wholesale Distributors Ltd (1971) 3 CCC (2d) 484; Adler v Attorney-General of Alberta (supra) at 139-140; Abou-Assale v Bourden JSP (1978) I CR (3d) 213 at 231; Coward v Allen (1984) 52 ALR 320 and Brewer v Castles (No 3) (1984) 52 ALR 581.228    Bowen CJ and Lockhart J agreed with Jackson J, other than in respect of one part of the warrant that Jackson J had declared invalid.  It is readily apparent that Bowen CJ and Lockhart J agreed with Jackson J in relation to the question of severance.  They declared that certain parts of the warrant were invalid, but that the warrants were otherwise valid.229    In Beneficial Finance, Burchett J (with whom Sheppard J agreed at 525) considered that it was open to sever parts of a warrant which incorrectly recited the language of the former s 10(1)(a) of the Crimes Act.  His Honour said (at 545).The severability of a search warrant has some importance for the present case because of the argument, further consideration of which I deferred earlier in these reasons, that the warrants contain an inaccurate reproduction of the language of s 10(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, and thus purport to authorise inappropriately the seizure of things ""in respect to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that [the suspected offences] have been committed"". In my opinion, if this portion of the warrants is invalid, it is readily severable. As there has been no suggestion that any particular document has been, or is likely to have been, seized in reliance upon this portion of either of the warrants, it is unnecessary to decide whether the failure to follow precisely the wording of the statute did have any vitiating effect. I am unable to imagine anything in this case which could be a thing ""in respect to which"" the offence had been committed, yet would not fall within the terms of that part of the warrant which accurately reflects s 10(1)(b). That has already been made clear in the discussion of the true meaning of the word ""and"" in this very special context. The reflection of s 10(1)(a) in the drafting of the document cannot, in the circumstances, have made any practical difference to the search or the seizure. It would be an apotheosis of pedantry to refuse to sever the warrant, and to invalidate it on this ground.230    Pincus J agreed “substantially” with the reasons of Burchett J, including that severance of invalid portions of a warrant is appropriate in some circumstances.  His Honour took issue, however, with Burchett J’s view that it was relevant, in the context of severance, that there had been no suggestion that documents had been seized in reliance on the invalid parts.  Pincus J expressed the view (at 526) that it “cannot be incumbent upon the party challenging an executed warrant to show which documents were seized in reliance on particular parts of it”.231    In Peters v Attorney-General for New South Wales (1988) 16 NSWLR 24, McHugh JA followed Parker v Churchill and held that the doctrine of severability applied to warrants that were issued in excess of power.  His Honour noted (at 41D-E), however, that “it is not possible to sever a warrant where the invalid provision forms part of an inseparable context, or would operate differently or produce a different result from that which was intended”.  Perhaps even more importantly, his Honour found that, because warrants are instruments for the purposes of provisions such as s 32 of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW), they are to be read and construed to the extent that they can be read as valid instruments.  The result was to throw the burden upon the person attacking an entire warrant to prove, in effect, that if the invalid part of the warrant was severed, the warrant would have operated differently, or would have produced a different result to that intended.232    In all of the circumstances of this case, it is appropriate to sever the storage medium paragraph.  That is so for a number of reasons.  233    First, the invalid storage medium paragraph forms only a very small part of the warrants.  As already noted, properly construed, the paragraph purports to operate independently of the three conditions in the warrants.  It is not at all intertwined with, or inseparable from, any other part or parts of the warrants.  It only purports to authorise the seizure of storage media, storage devices and associated items.  It only operates impermissibly in respect of devices that would not otherwise satisfy the three conditions of the warrant or be able to be seized pursuant to s 3L(2) of the Act.  It does not impact at all on the authority to seize any other items under the warrant.234    Second, since the paragraph could only operate to impermissibly authorise the seizure of a very narrow category of items (storage media and storage devices that would not otherwise be able to be seized under the warrant or s 3L(2)), it is readily apparent that the vast bulk of items that were seized under the authority of the warrants could not have been seized under the purported authority of the storage media paragraph.  That is apparent irrespective of which, if any, party bore the onus, in this context, to prove which documents were seized in reliance on which particular parts of the warrants (cf. Pincus J in Beneficial Finance at 526).  235    Mr Caratti contended that if the paragraph in question was invalid, it invalidated the entire warrant and all items seized under the warrant should be returned.  That submission is rejected.  It would not, in all the circumstances, be appropriate to order the return all of the seized items in circumstances where the vast bulk of the seized items could not on any view have been seized under the authority of the impugned paragraph and were therefore validly seized.236    Third, to the extent that Mr Caratti submitted, based on the observations of Pincus J in Beneficial Finance, that the invalid portion should not be severed if the Commissioner did not prove that no items were seized pursuant to the invalid portion, that submission is rejected.  While it may not have been incumbent on Mr Caratti, in opposing severance, to prove that items were seized pursuant to the invalid portion, it does not follow that the Commissioner bore the onus of proving that no items were seized under that part of the warrant.  The observations of McHugh JA in Peters suggest that Mr Caratti bore the onus of showing, at the very least, that if the invalid portion was severed, the warrant would have operated differently, or would produce a different result to that intended.  Mr Caratti has not discharged that onus.237    Fourth, Mr Caratti claimed that executing officers seized certain computers and hard disks without complying with the procedures mandated by the Crimes Act.  Evidence was led specifically to make good that contention.  Tax officers and employees of the AFP who were involved in seizing computer equipment were called by the Commissioner and cross-examined by Mr Caratti about the seizure of computer related items.  That evidence and Mr Caratti’s contentions concerning the seizure of computer equipment is considered later in the context of Mr Caratti’s ground three.  The appropriate and preferable course is to sever the storage medium paragraph and consider the lawfulness of the seizure of the computer related items in the context of ground three. Conclusion in relation to the validity of the search warrants 238    The search warrants are not invalid on the basis that the offences to which they related did not sufficiently define, or permit the occupiers of the premises to comprehend, the authorised search perimeter.  Nor are the warrants invalid on the basis that it was not open to the issuing officer to be satisfied that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that evidential material referable to the third condition offences would be at the premises.  The storage medium paragraph is invalid, but is severable and does not invalidate the balance of the warrants.  239    While it follows that the Commissioner has successfully defended the validity of the warrants in question, other than the storage medium paragraph, something more should be said about the drafting of the warrants in question.  It should not be thought for a moment that, by upholding these warrants, the Court has somehow sanctioned, let alone encouraged, broad and poorly drafted “three conditions” warrants like those in question in this matter.  240    Search warrants under s 3E of the Crimes Act are now almost invariably drafted and issued in the “three conditions” format.  The origins of the three condition warrant are somewhat unclear.  It appears to have been adopted as a drafting device or tool since about 1994 when s 3E (and associated provisions) were inserted in the Crimes Act to replace the former s 10.  It may be accepted that a warrant framed in terms of three conditions is not, for that reason alone invalid: see generally, Dunesky v Elder; Grollo v Macauley (1995) 56 FCR 533; Harts (1997) at 154B; Williams v Keelty at 211 [155].  That said, nothing in s 3E, or the previous s 10, of the Crimes Act, compels or requires warrants to be drafted in such terms. 241    If carefully and thoughtfully drafted, a three condition warrant may be an appropriate and useful vehicle pursuant to which a search warrant may be applied for and issued under s 3E of the Crimes Act.  Such a warrant may be particularly appropriate at the early stages of an investigation involving complex and technical offences, particularly offences relating to commercial and taxation matters, when it is not known precisely what types of evidential material may be at the subject premises.  A three condition warrant may in such cases appropriately meet the requirements of s 3E and still permit a broad and extensive search.  Considerable care must, however, be taken when drafting a three condition warrant.  As was pointed out in Harts (1997), a three condition warrant will more readily be open to attack on the basis that the issuing officer did not (or could not have had) the relevant satisfaction than would a warrant more carefully and less broadly framed.  The Commissioner appears intent on ignoring this warning.  The warrants issued in this matter clearly reveal the issues and difficulties that may arise if appropriate care is not taken in the drafting of three condition warrants.  242    There appears to be an unfortunate tendency, in the drafting of three condition warrants, to draft the first condition in such broad terms that it provides no effective filter or guide to the search.  The warrants in this case are a good example of this tendency.  Often the first condition contains an extensive and broadly drafted list of just about every type of document or electronic device that could possibly exist.  When it comes to executing a warrant drafted in such terms, there would be little point in executing officers having regard to the first condition when making search and seizure decisions.  That is because, whatever item is located, it will almost inevitably fall within the extensive list in the first condition.  243    Equally, there is a tendency to draft the second condition so as to include the longest possible list of persons, entities, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers and bank accounts that it is possible to compile.  “Things” will meet the condition if they “relate to” any one or more of the persons or entities or address included in that long list.  As already indicated, the expression “relate to” in this context is not only extremely wide, but also potentially vague and indefinite:  Williams v Keelty at 211-212 [158].  It follows that often the second condition is also not a particularly effective filter or guide to what may constitute evidential material.  In most cases, just about everything located at the subject premises is likely to relate to one or more of the persons, entities or other things listed in the second condition. 244    What that means is that frequently the third condition of the warrant is the only effective filter in the warrant.  That may not be a problem in circumstances were the third condition is drafted with care and the greatest degree of precision and particularity that is possible at the stage that the investigation may be at.  In the past, the AFP frequently sought the advice and assistance of experienced lawyers and prosecutors at the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to the drafting of search warrants in complex matters.  Regrettably that no longer seems to be the case.  It does not appear to have happened in this case.  If it had, many of the issues that have arisen in relation to the issue and form of the warrants in question would probably not have arisen.245    If appropriate care is not taken in the drafting of the third condition in a warrant, one likely result is a challenge to the warrant, similar to the challenge that has occurred in this case.  While the warrants in question in this case have been found to be valid (other than the one severed paragraph), for the reasons already given, the third condition offences were very poorly drafted.  Mr Caratti’s complaints concerning the drafting of the warrants were by no means frivolous or entirely baseless.246    Throughout the proceedings the Commissioner maintained a stoic and somewhat blinkered position that there was no problem with the drafting of the third condition in the warrants.  Mr Caratti’s complaints concerning the third condition were met by the constant refrain that the statement of the offence in a warrant need not meet a “high bar”.  The Commissioner’s suggestion that there was no problem with the drafting of the warrants was unrealistic, if not fanciful.  While a warrant must be approached in a practical and common sense way, and not with overzealous technicality, that does not mean, as the Commissioner effectively suggested, that s 3E created only a “low bar”.247    Poorly drafted three condition warrants serve only to invite controversy and judicial review challenges.  As these proceedings show, such challenges can end up being long, complex and drawn out affairs.  They result in an unfortunate fragmentation and delay of criminal investigations. 248    The second likely result of poorly drafted warrants is that the execution of the warrants is almost invariably rendered more difficult.  To determine if an item is able to be seized, executing officers are required to consider and comprehend the offences listed in the third condition of the warrant.  As executing officers and constables assisting are unlikely to be legally trained, that may not always be an easy task, particularly where the offences relate to complex commercial or tax-related affairs.  The task is rendered even more difficult where, as is often the case, the executing officers and persons assisting have not had any or any extensive involvement in the relevant investigation.  The task is rendered more difficult still where the third condition offences are not drafted with appropriate care, precision and particularity.  249    There was some evidence that suggested that some of the officers involved in the execution of the warrants may have had an imperfect appreciation of the meaning and scope of the search warrants.  Perhaps not surprisingly, Federal Agents who had not been involved in the investigation appeared to have sought the assistance of tax officers and, in some instances, appeared to use extrinsic aids to assist them to make appropriate search and seizure decisions.  Mr Caratti’s contentions concerning the execution of the warrants are the subject of grounds 2 and 3 of his application.  The validity of the warrants is to be determined on the basis of the contents of the warrants in question and the information before the issuing officer.  The evidence of what occurred during the execution of the warrants is not relevant or admissible in relation to Mr Caratti’s challenge to the validity of the warrants:  Williams v Keelty at 211 [157].  Nevertheless, the evidence concerning the execution of the warrants in issue in this matter serves to illustrate the difficulties and complexities that may arise where warrants concerning complex investigations are not drafted with sufficient care and precision. GROUND 2 - WERE THE WARRANTS LAWFULLY EXECUTED?250    Mr Caratti claimed that, even if the search warrants were found to be valid, the execution of the search warrants was nevertheless beyond power.  He sought a declaration to that effect, as well as a writ of mandamus or order that the Commissioner deliver up all of the items seized pursuant to the warrants. 251    As with other aspects of Mr Caratti’s case, his claims concerning the lawfulness of the execution of the warrants have shifted markedly over time.  In general terms he contended that the executing officers were confused as to what the warrants authorised.  He claimed that the officers did not understand enough about the entities listed in the warrants, their affairs, or their functions, to be able to ascertain the appropriate scope of the searches that were permitted, or to make informed decisions about what items fell within the terms of the warrants.  He claimed, in effect, that executing officers abdicated their duties in relation to the making of seizure decisions to tax officers.252    More specifically, Mr Caratti relied on evidence that he contended demonstrated the following matters.253    First, the briefings given to the executing officers and constables assisting were insufficient.  In particular, insufficient information was given about the third condition to enable the officers to understand the warrants.  In any event, not every searching officer attended the briefings.254    Second, executing officers and constables assisting had inconsistent and incorrect understandings as to what the conditions in the warrants meant.255    Third, some executing officers and constables assisting did not have copies of the warrant, or copies of the whole warrant. 256    Fourth, executing officers and constables assisting relied heavily on the advice of four tax officers who had knowledge of or involvement in the audit of Mr Caratti and companies associated with him.  Those tax officers were Mr Irvin, Ms Milner, Mr Crawshaw and Ms Ramdhas.  A procedure was adopted whereby documents were seized if one or other of those tax officers said it was relevant.  As a result, decisions to seize documents were made on the basis of what the tax officers believed might be relevant to the investigation, not by reference to the terms of the warrants.  257    Fifth, the tax officers who did give advice about the relevance of documents had a “misguided understanding” of the offences in the third condition of the warrants.  This was said to flow, amongst other things, from an early briefing provided by a tax officer about the referral of the investigation to the AFP.258    Sixth, executing officers and constables assisting relied on Mr Irvin’s “Search Relevances” document.  That document was not based on, or prepared by reference to, the warrants.  In Mr Caratti’s submission, it was misleading and confusing and, in any event, broader than the warrants. 259    Seventh, some executing officers and counsel assisting took photos of some documents. 260    Eighth, at some stage “sniffer dogs” were used by the AFP for purposes outside the warrants.261    Ninth, at one of the premises, AFP “proceeds of crime” officers gave directions to executing officers and constables assisting about the seizure, or possible seizure, of items pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth).  Those items may not have fallen within the terms of the warrants.262    Before addressing the question whether the evidence established all or any of those matters, a number of points can and should be made concerning the way Mr Caratti advanced his case concerning the execution of the warrants.  Mr Caratti’s case was very much put on a global basis.  He generally made little attempt to distinguish between the execution of the different warrants.  A total of eight warrants were executed.  Mr Caratti’s case seemed to proceed on the basis that if some unauthorised or improper conduct occurred during the execution of a warrant at one of the premises, that could somehow have a bearing on the lawfulness of the execution of the warrants at other premises.  It is however, somewhat difficult to see how that could be the case unless it could be demonstrated that the improper conduct was the product of systemic problems or directions that applied in respect of all of the warrant premises.263    Mr Caratti’s case was also advanced on a global or general level in another respect.  It appeared to proceed on the basis that if it could be shown that, for example, two or three officers had an incomplete or inadequate understanding of the warrant conditions, it necessarily followed that other officers must also have had the same inadequate understanding.  Again, however, it is difficult to see how or why that inference would necessarily be available, unless perhaps the evidence showed that this was a systemic problem.264    At times Mr Caratti’s case also appeared to proceed on the basis that if he established that the execution of the warrants was deficient or excessive in one respect, it would necessarily follow that the warrants as a whole were unlawfully exercised.  For example, Mr Caratti appeared to proceed on the basis that if he proved that some officers relied on Mr Irvin or his Search Relevances document on some occasions during the execution of the Wickham Street warrant, it necessarily followed that the execution of that warrant in its entirety was excessive.  Indeed, he appeared to argue that this would support a finding that the execution of all of the warrants was excessive.  Ultimately, however, Mr Caratti appeared to accept that it was necessary for him to prove that the evidence as a whole demonstrated that the execution of the warrants was excessive.  265    In what appeared to be an alternative argument, albeit one advanced effectively for the first time in closing submissions, Mr Caratti contended that if one aspect of the execution of the warrants was found to be unreasonable or excessive, the burden of proof shifted to the Commissioner.  That contention appeared to be based on the observations of Pincus J in Beneficial Finance, albeit that those observations were made in the context of severance.  In Mr Caratti’s submission, the Commissioner was, in those circumstances, effectively required to prove that no documents were seized pursuant to the aspect of the execution that had been found to be wanting.  For example, if it was found that some executing officers searched for or seiz",2016-09-15 00:00:00,Federal Court of Australia

Note:    Entry of orders is dealt with in Rule 39.32 of the Federal Court Rules 2011.REASONS FOR JUDGMENTMCKERRACHER J:TWO APPLICATIONS1    Citation Resources Ltd (ACN 118 710 508) sues Mr Landau for breach of director’s duties and related relief.  The proceedings are in a relatively early stage, and these reasons address two applications.  The first is by Citation for limited discovery and the other is by Mr Landau for an indefinite stay of the proceedings.  Each of the applications needs to be seen against a background of investigation of Mr Landau by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) in relation to alleged offences, some of which are also the subject of these civil proceedings.  Mr Landau opposes giving that discovery as it may add to his jeopardy in the investigation.  For similar reasons, namely, that criminal prosecution is ‘on the cards’, he seeks an indefinite stay of the proceedings.  For the following reasons, these proceedings should continue for now but without further discovery of documents by Mr Landau.  Both applications will be dismissed.  BACKGROUNDPleaded issues2    It is accepted that Mr Landau was a director of Citation until January 2016.  He owed various duties as a director.  (There is a minor debate between the parties as to the nature of those duties.  It does not need to be resolved at this point.)  Mr Landau was also the sole director of Okap Ventures Pty Ltd.  Notably, Ms Hannah Cabatit was an employee of Okap.  Ms Jane Flegg was company secretary of Okap.  The ultimate holding company of Okap was Doull Holdings Pty Ltd.  Mr Landau was the sole director and majority shareholder of Doull and Ms Flegg was the company secretary.  Mr Landau was also a director of ICBC Capital Pty Ltd, to which a liquidator was appointed on 18 March 2016.  Ms Flegg was the company secretary of ICBC and Mr Landau was a shareholder of ICBC.3    Claiming privilege against self-incrimination, Mr Landau does not plead to the following matters asserted by Citation.  Citation contends that on or about 1 April 2015, Mr Landau caused a bank account to be opened with Westpac Banking Corporation in the name of ‘Citation Resources Limited’ (Westpac account).  Citation contend that Mr Landau caused, procured, authorised, or acquiesced in the opening of the Westpac account for and in the name of Citation, but with Mr Landau and no other Citation director to be a signatory to the Westpac account.  Ms Flegg and Ms Cabatit were the signatories.  Ms Flegg and Ms Cabatit were authorised to make online banking transactions on the Westpac account.  Ms Flegg, as administrator of the Westpac account, had authority to:(a)    set up an online business banking account for the Westpac account;(b)    determine who could access the Westpac account and what tasks they could perform;(c)    set daily payment limits for online banking transactions by authorised account users on the Westpac account;(d)    set the number of people required to approve payments and other tasks with respect to the Westpac account; and(e)    manage security devices with respect to online banking transactions on the Westpac account.  4    It is further claimed that the Westpac account was, in effect, opened by Mr Landau and Mr Anthony Eastman, a former director of Citation.  Citation relies on an email of 31 March 2015 from Ms Flegg informing an identified banker at Westpac that the type of account required for Citation was ‘a transaction account and a cash reserve account’ and that she would be the administrator of the Westpac account, while Ms Cabatit and Mr Landau would be signatories.  Ms Flegg was then listed as ‘administrator’ and ‘approver’ for the Westpac account, with a daily payment limit of $1 million and Mr Landau was listed as ‘approver’ for the Westpac account with a daily payment limit of $1500.5    Citation also contends that Mr Landau caused, procured, authorised or acquiesced in the following payments being made from the Westpac account:(a)    $1,709,500 to Okap between 15 June 2015 and 11 February 2016;(b)    $3,000 to Okap on 11 February 2016;(c)    $7,000 to Okap between 14 February 2016 and 19 February 2016;(d)    $101,237 into an account entitled ‘International Goldfields’ on 31 December 2015;(e)    $150,000 to an unknown transferee on 12 June 2015, 15 June 2015 and 2 November 2015, described by Mr Landau in the books of Citation as ‘transfer/replenishment by authority’; and (f)    $174,000 to ICBC on 3 November 2015 and 5 November 2015.6    Citation says the payments were made to third parties: who had no lawful entitlement to be paid the amount; without Citation having any legal liability to make the payments; for which Citation received no consideration; and without any authority from Citation.7    Citation also says the payments: were not in its best interest; not made for a proper purpose, caused detriment to it; gained an advantage for those to whom the payments were made; and gained an advantage for Mr Landau as a shareholder of Doull and ICBC.  Evidence8    In support of the discovery application, Citation relies on its solicitor’s affidavit deposing on information and belief from Mr Turco, director of Citation, that Mr Landau used his personal or other non-Citation related email addresses for the purposes of his communication on behalf of Citation with Citation staff and third parties.  On that basis, it was believed that Mr Landau would hold documents in his control that had been created or received by him in his capacity as an officer of Citation.  On that basis, and because of the involvement with opening and operation of the Westpac account, it is believed that documents were, or have been, in Mr Landau’s possession, custody or control.  The belief is also supported by Mr Landau’s involvement in Okap, Doull and ICBC.  9    Citation also relies upon an affidavit from Mr Turco in support of the originating process, who swears that on 23 October 2015, Citation issued a prospectus offering to issue 123,360,894 fully paid ordinary shares to existing shareholders and, to the extent those shares were not taken up, an offer of the balance to the public to raise in total $6,168,045.  In addition to that, in June and July 2015, Citation raised funds by way of share placement.  The prospectus closed on 6 November 2015, with the public offer under the prospectus being fully subscribed.  Mr Turco, relying on information from Mr Eastman, secretary of Citation, believes that investors wishing to pay the subscription money to Citation by way of electronic funds transfer, and who inquired of Citation as to the appropriate account for the transfer, were each advised details of a bank account operated by Citation with Bankwest (Bankwest account).  Bank statements for the Bankwest account disclosed $4,542,089 in share subscription funds being deposited to that account following 10 November 2015.  10    In late 2015, Mr Turco discovered that there existed another bank account in the name of ‘Citation Resources Ltd’, namely the Westpac account.  He made inquiries of Westpac and obtained copies of bank statements on the Westpac account.  On information from Westpac, Mr Turco swore to his belief that the signatories for the Westpac account were, until March 2016, Mr Landau, a former director of Citation and Ms Flegg.  Ms Flegg has no role, position or connection with Citation and, to the best of Mr Turco’s knowledge, never has.  However, Ms Flegg is a director of Okap.  On 29 February 2016, he obtained a copy of the Westpac account statements from Westpac and became concerned that as much as $1.8 million may have been misappropriated from the Westpac account.  The Westpac account is now depleted and contains less than $1000.  Mr Turco says that from his search of the books and records of Citation, he can find no evidence of any decision or authorisation concerning the Westpac account, including with respect to any withdrawal and application of any funds from it.  He swears that on numerous occasions he has requested Mr Landau to provide, amongst other things, the details of the transactions of the Westpac account.  On 8 January 2016, Mr Turco received an email from Mr Landau attaching a reconciliation spreadsheet, recording, amongst other things, the deposit of funds by investors in Citation in two tranches in June and July 2015 totalling over $1.7 million and a deposit by the underwriter of the Public Offer, Pac Partners in the sum of $1.3 million.  11    Mr Turco met with Mr Landau on 8 January 2016.  At that meeting he says Mr Landau told him that there was still approximately $485,000 in the Westpac account as indicated in the reconciliation statement which he had provided earlier that day.  Mr Turco sought verification of this.  Mr Landau informed him that he would transfer the $485,000 into the Bankwest account or Turco and Co’s trust account, so that Mr Turco could deal with the various people demanding money from Citation.  Mr Landau also told Mr Turco that he would provide him with the bank statements for the Westpac account.12    On 12 January 2015, Mr Turco sent Mr Landau an email in which he asked him to attend to, amongst other things, the supply of the bank statements for the Westpac account and to confirm that there were no other liabilities or unresolved transactions in relation to Citation.13    On 13 January 2016, Mr Turco received from Mr Landau an ‘Outgoing Director’s Disclosure Letter’ in which he represented to the Board of Citation in relation to the transactions between Citation and Pearl Global Pty Ltd that:(a)    all schedules, documents and information relating to funds received, share options, etc had been accurately provided to Mr Turco;(b)    all financial commitments, loans, etc had been settled in full as disclosed in a due diligence process conducted by Pearl; and (c)    there were no other liabilities or unresolved issues relating to Citation.  14    Mr Turco swears that on 14 January 2016, he had a discussion by telephone with Mr Landau in which:(a)    Mr Landau confirmed that all debts had been paid, and all issues with shareholders queries were sorted or taken care of and settled;(b)    Mr Turco suggested that they meet so that he could receive the bank account statements for the Westpac account; and (c)    Mr Landau requested Mr Turco’s trust account details so that he could deposit the $485,000, which he had previously promised to remit.  Those details were forwarded.  15    On 16 January 2016, Mr Landau resigned from the Board of Citation, confirming to Mr Turco in conversation there were no outstanding issues.  16    Mr Turco refers to the reasons for decision of Barker J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Continental Coal Limited [2016] FCA 416, in which the evidence filed on behalf ASIC was to the effect that ASIC suspects that the funds used to pay creditors of Continental Coal Limited may have been funds misappropriated from Citation by Okap and/or Mr Landau.  17    Mr Turco swears to the fact that there has been no deposit of monies held in the Westpac account into the Bankwest account or Turco & Co trust accounts.  Investigations continue.18    From the perspective of Mr Landau, there are two affidavits relied upon.  His own affidavit of 5 July 2016, as with an affidavit of his solicitors, is essentially in support of the stay application, but is also relevant to the discovery application.  Mr Landau makes clear that he applied for a stay on the basis that the subject matter of the proceedings is the same subject matter of an investigation being conducted by ASIC in respect of him, amongst others.  He produces a copy of the notice requiring him to attend an investigation to be conducted by ASIC, issued on 26 May 2016 and a further notice on 23 June 2016.  The notices list numerous suspected contraventions of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and of the Criminal Code Act Compilation Act 1913 (WA).  He attended examinations on 26 May 2016, which took about four hours, and 23 June 2016, which took about three hours.  The examinations were conducted under a direction of confidentiality.  He was represented by Mr Lemonis at the examinations.  The confidentiality direction was varied to enable him to disclose in these proceedings the nature of the investigation in relation to the establishment of, operation of and payments made from the Westpac account.  19    His solicitor produces an ASIC notice of 14 April 2016 requiring Mr Landau to attend an examination on 26 May 2016, which notice was replaced by the notice annexed by Mr Landau to his affidavit.   20    Mr Landau swears to his financial situation, the details of which are unnecessary to record, but suffice it to say, that the information disclosed does not suggest any surplus of assets over liabilities.  Okap and Doull have no funds to contribute to legal costs.  Doull owns a Volkswagen Amarok vehicle which he drives.  It is valued at between $40,000 and $50,000, but there is $37,588 owing on it.  21    Freezing orders have been made by Barker J in relation to Mr Landau’s assets and income and the companies in Federal Court proceedings WAD 717 of 2015.22    An important part of Mr Landau’s case is the fact that in WAD 717, ASIC, by one of its officers swore an affidavit on 13 April 2016 to the fact that Mr Landau was ‘potentially facing criminal action’ as a result of ASIC’s investigation.  That factor was relied upon by ASIC in support of an application for travel restraint orders against Mr Landau.  23    Mr Landau seeks a stay of the proceedings on the basis that:(a)    absent a stay, his right of silence will be infringed;(b)    the continuation of the proceedings may result in the disclosure of the responses available by him to the matters the subject of the ASIC investigation; and(c)    Mr Landau has only limited financial resources available to him and would be substantially prejudiced if required to attend to the defence of this proceeding at the same time as addressing the investigations which ASIC has in place pertaining to him in relation to the same matters.DISCOVERYArguments24    Citation seeks discovery in electronic format or otherwise of limited specific categories of documents, being the following:(1)    All documents relating to the opening of the Westpac account;(2)    All documents to relating to the operation of the Westpac account;(3)    All documents relating to payments referred to in particular paragraphs of the amended statement of claim; and(4)    All documents relating to any agreement, transaction, service or other matter to which any of the payments in the third category relate.  There can be no debate that the categories are directly relevant to the pleaded matters.  25    The application is pursued pursuant to r 20.14 of the Federal Court Rules (Cth) (FCR), which relevantly provides as follows (emphasis added):20.14    Standard discovery(1)    If the Court orders a party to give standard discovery, the party must give discovery of documents:(a)    that are directly relevant to the issues raised by the pleadings or in the affidavits; and(b)    of which, after a reasonable search, the party is aware; and(c)    that are, or have been, in the party’s control.(2)    For paragraph (1)(a), the documents must meet at least one of the following criteria:(a)    the documents are those on which the party intends to rely;(b)    the documents adversely affect the party’s own case;(c)    the documents support another party’s case;(d)    the documents adversely affect another party’s case.(3)    For paragraph (1)(b), in making a reasonable search, a party may take into account the following:(a)    the nature and complexity of the proceeding;(b)    the number of documents involved;(c)    the ease and cost of retrieving a document;(d)    the significance of any document likely to be found;(e)    any other relevant matter.(4)    In this rule, a reference to an affidavit is a reference to:(a)    an affidavit accompanying an originating application; and(b)    an affidavit in response to the affidavit accompanying the originating application.Note:    Control is defined in the Dictionary.26    Mr Landau stresses that it is necessary for Citation to establish that the order for discovery sought will facilitate the just resolution of the proceedings quickly, inexpensively and efficiently as possible (see r 20.11 FCR).  Mr Landau emphasises the just resolution.  27    The real issue is self-incrimination or related prejudice.  In that regard, Citation acknowledges that Mr Landau has asserted self-incrimination privilege in his defence, but submits that such a claim does not prevent the Court from imposing a discovery order against Mr Landau.  It relies, for example, on Sunland Waterfront (BVI) Ltd v Prudentia Investments Pty Ltd (No 4) [2010] FCA 863 (at [61]) where Logan J said (at [62]-[64]) (emphasis added):62    The privilege against self-incrimination can extend to the protection of a person not only against being required to produce particular documents but also to identifying particular documents or explaining their whereabouts: Controlled Consultants Pty Ltd v Commissioner for Corporate Affairs (1985) 156 CLR 385 at 393. In circumstances in which an ability to claim the privilege arises it protects against even a seemingly innocuous requirement which may nonetheless provide a link in a chain of investigatory inquiry. That counsels a cautious approach both to the imposition of a discovery requirement or its enforcement in circumstances where the basis for a claim of privilege may exist.63    A requirement to file a verified list of documents for the purposes of discovery does not carry with it a denial of any valid self-incrimination privilege claim. Rather, it is for the person subject to the requirement to point to facts which enable that person to refuse to give discovery in respect of certain documents. The following observations made by Isaacs J in R v Associated Northern Collieries (1910) 11 CLR 738 at 742-743 are pertinent:The test whether an order for discovery can be made is whether the Court can see that the discovery may expose the party to a penalty or not. Very often that depends upon whether the action itself is a penal proceeding. It does not rest upon the fact that it is a civil action. An action is none the less civil merely because it is penal ...There is an inherent distinction between a civil action to prevent or redress a civil injury on the one hand, and a civil action to recover a penalty on the other. In the latter case the whole and avowed object of the proceedings is the infliction of the penalty, and the discovery sought of documents relevant to the claim can therefore have no other intended consequence. It does not require in such a case the oath of the defendant to establish the fact that the production of the documents would tend to penalize him. The Court can see the effect of discovery from the nature of the proceeding. In the former case there is no such necessary consequence, and whether the objectionable tendency exists or not has to be otherwise ascertained, and claiming immunity upon oath in the course of making discovery is the most usual, but not the only other means of establishing it. [Emphasis added]64    The requirements in respect of making of a claim for self-incrimination privilege were described by Gibbs CJ in Sorby v The Commonwealth of Australia (1983) 152 CLR 281 at 288 in the following way:It has been a firmly established rule of the common law, since the seventeenth century, that no person can be compelled to incriminate himself. A person may refuse to answer any question, or to produce any document or thing, if to do so ""may tend to bring him into the peril and possibility of being convicted as a criminal"": Lamb v. Munster (1882) 10 QBD 110, at p 111. The mere fact that the witness swears that he believes that the answer will incriminate him is not sufficient; ""to entitle a party called as a witness to the privilege of silence, the Court must see, from the circumstances of the case and the nature of the evidence which the witness is called to give, that there is reasonable ground to apprehend danger to the witness from his being compelled to answer"": R v. Boyes [1861] Eng R 626; (1861) 1 B & S 311, at pp 329-330 [1861] Eng R 626; (121 ER 730, at p 738) .28    The analysis by Ashley JA (with whom Neave JJA and Almond AJA agreed) in Gemmell v Le Roi Homestyle Cookies Pty Ltd (in liq) (2014) 46 VR 583 is also helpful (particularly at [100]-[106] and [112]) where his Honour said (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added):100    It is only necessary to consider the position of the individual respondent. Lindgren J held that the provision against self-incrimination is not available when it is clear that the taking of the step in question will not add to the individual’s jeopardy. In the event, he ruled that the individual respondent must give discovery and comply with the notice to produce. 101    His Honour said this:The true scope of the privilege against self-incrimination must be understood. It cannot, without qualification, be identified simply as a privilege against being compelled to do something which may tend to show that the person has committed an offence. Assume, for example, that [the party] had been already convicted or acquitted of all the offences referred to in [the provisions of the Copyright Act and the Trade Marks Act]. Would he subsequently, in a civil proceeding such as the present one, be excused from the obligation to give discover or to answer a notice to produce? Clearly not, because the privilege operates to prevent a person from being compelled “to answer any question or to produce any document or thing, if to do so ‘may tend to bring him into the peril and possibility of being convicted as a criminal’”.…Consistently with the understanding of the nature of the privilege against self-incrimination just adumbrated, the privilege has been held to be not available where it is clear that the taking of the step in question will not add to the individual’s jeopardy.102    Lindgren J cited BTR, Sociedade Nacional de Combustiveis de Angola UEE v Lundqvist (‘Sociedade’) and Marcel v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis (‘Marcel’) in support of his statement of principle.103    In Sociedade, Staughton LJ cited Brebner and Westinghouse for the proposition that:… the privilege is not available where the witness is already at risk, and the risk would not be increased if he were required to answer …104    In Marcel, Dillon LJ referred to the privilege against self-incrimination. His Lordship referred to Sociedade, in the first place with respect to the standard of proof for a claim to the privilege. He then referred to the passage in the judgment of Staughton LJ which I have cited above, and referred also, in support of the proposition, to Khan (Mohammed Krim) v Khan (Iqbal Ali).105    His Lordship then said:In the present case the production in evidence by the police pursuant to the subpoena of the plaintiffs’ documents already in the possession of the police cannot, in the words of Griffiths LJ, add a pennyweight to the strength of the criminal case against  any of the plaintiffs. Therefore, the privilege against self-incrimination is not available to the plaintiffs …106    In Westinghouse, Denning MR, having referred to the concept of appreciable risk, identified the situations where a witness had been given a pardon, and where an offence had become obsolete. He then added:… in the Australian case of Brebner v Perry, where he had already given a like statement to the police – and by giving evidence there was no increase in risk by his being made to answer – he was made to answer. But where there is a real and appreciable risk – or an increase of an existing risk – then his objection should be upheld.…112    It does not follow, however, that the appellants may not successfully raise some claims to privilege. To the extent that the appellants would be obliged to go outside their answers on examination in order to plead their defences, or in giving discovery, it cannot be baldly concluded that the appellants would not be at increased risk of jeopardy were the privileges not successfully invoked. It has been consistently said that, once it appears that a witness is at risk, then great latitude should be allowed to him in judging for himself the effect of any particular question. In the present matter, therefore, the appellants may successfully invoke the privilege against potential self-incrimination if there is a real and appreciable risk that a pleading or the giving of discovery might expose them to increased jeopardy of criminal prosecution, and may successfully invoke the privilege against exposure to a penalty if a pleading or the giving of discovery would tend to subject them to increased jeopardy of exposure to a penalty. To be clear, the concept of increased jeopardy has a role to play in this context.Consideration29    Two matters are of particular importance.  The first is to appreciate precisely what the Citation case is.  In substance, it is that Mr Landau established a bank account without authority from Citation into which Citation’s money was banked and from which substantive payments were made to Mr Landau’s benefit or the benefit of others without any authority from Citation.  And, secondly, against Citation’s case, it is hardly surprising that privilege against self-incrimination has been claimed.  The requirement to give discovery should be approached in the manner discussed by Ashley JA in Gemmell (at [112]). 30    As the submissions made for Mr Landau point out, an affidavit of discovery would be significant both in terms of the documents it discloses Mr Landau has or has had and also those documents that do not exist and/or have not ever existed.  Speaking entirely hypothetically, as an example, if the affidavit disclosed that there were never any substantive documents authorising the relevant payments, or identifying the services to which the payments related, in a real sense, that could increase Mr Landau’s jeopardy.  31    By way of another example, in relation to category 1 concerning the opening of the Westpac account, if the answer is that there are no documents which relate to the opening of the Westpac account, then Mr Landau’s jeopardy could be increased because the Westpac account would be opened without any written approval or authority from Citation.  If there are documents, which Mr Landau has or has had, and if these documents identify him in the manner in which the case is pleaded, then this may also increase his jeopardy.32    A similar process of analysis pertains to documents in category 2 relating to the operation of the Westpac account, as well as documents relating to category 3 and category 4.  Whether the answer on oath is that there are not documents or never were any documents, or that there are certain documents, unless such documentation falls within the parameters of a legitimate act duly authorised by Citation, then Mr Landau’s jeopardy is inevitably increased as there is no basis on which his affidavit would be privileged as against authorities seeking to rely upon it for implied or express admissions it may contain. 33    I am unable to see a suitable mid-way house in this particular dilemma, although it was put to me by counsel for Citation that orders might be framed in a way that precluded any increase in jeopardy.  No specific examples were given as to how such orders might be crafted and having regard to what appears in [112] of Gemmell, it seems to me that in a circumstance such as the present where at least on its face it appears that the increase in jeopardy is relatively obvious, the claim to that privilege should be respected.  34    Although Citation relies upon the Harman v Secretary of State for the Home Department [1983] 1 AC 280 implied undertaking obligations, there is a significant difference between the protection afforded by that implied undertaking on the one hand, and that afforded to a participant who has attended examinations conducted pursuant to s 19 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (ASIC Act).  It is clear that under s 68(3) of the ASIC Act, Mr Landau has been entitled and has claimed privilege before answering any questions, such that those answers cannot then be used against him in criminal proceedings or proceedings for a penalty, except in respect of false answer proceedings as identified in s 1349(4) of the Corporations Act.  No such protection would be afforded by the implied undertaking.  35    For these reasons, I decline at this stage to make orders in relation to discovery of the categories sought by Citation.  It would not preclude further consideration of reframed orders at some later stage, depending on how the ASIC investigation unfolds.  STAY APPLICATIONArguments36    Mr Landau applies for an order for the stay of the proceedings on the basis that there is a real prospect of criminal charges being laid against him arising from the same facts and matters which are the subject of the proceedings.  37    The principles applicable in the determination of an application for the stay of civil proceedings, when there is such a real prospect, are set out by Wootten J in McMahon v Gould (1982) 7 ACLR 202 where his Honour said (at 206-207), in effect, that:(a)    prima facie the plaintiff is entitled to have his action tried in the ordinary course of the proceeding and business of the court; (b)    it is a grave matter to interfere with this entitlement by way of a stay of proceedings, which requires justification on proper grounds;(c)    the burden is on the defendant in a civil action to show that it is just and convenient that the plaintiff’s ordinary rights should be interfered with;(d)    neither an accused nor the Crown is entitled as of right to have a civil proceeding stayed because of a pending or possible criminal proceeding;(e)    the court’s task is one of ‘the balancing of justice between the parties’, taking into account all relevant factors;(f)    each case must be judged on its own merits and it would be wrong and undesirable to attempt to define in the abstract what are the relevant factors;(g)    one factor to take into account where there are pending or possible criminal proceedings is what is sometimes referred to as the accused's ‘right of silence’, and the reasons why that right, under the law as it stands, is a right of a defendant in a criminal proceeding;(h)    however, the so-called ‘right of silence’ does not extend to give such a defendant as a matter of right the same protection in contemporaneous civil proceedings. The plaintiff in a civil action is not debarred from pursuing action in accordance with the normal rules merely because to do so would, or might, result in the defendant, if he wished to defend the action, having to disclose, in resisting an application for summary judgment, in the pleading of his defence, or by way of discovery or otherwise, what his defence is likely to be in the criminal proceedings; (i)    the court should consider whether there is a real and not merely notional danger of injustice in the criminal proceedings;(j)    in this respect factors which may be relevant include:(i)    the possibility of publicity that might reach and influence jurors in the civil proceedings;(ii)    the proximity of the criminal hearing;(iii)    the possibility of miscarriage of justice, for example, by disclosure of a defence enabling the fabrication of evidence by prosecution witnesses, or interference with defence witnesses;(iv)    the burden on the defendant of preparing for both sets of proceedings concurrently;(v)    whether the defendant has already disclosed his defence to the allegations;(vi)    the conduct of the defendant, including his own prior invocation of civil process when it suited him;(k)    the effect on the plaintiff must also be considered and weighed against the effect on the defendant, in which regard it may be relevant to consider the nature of the defendant’s obligations to the plaintiff; and(l)    in an appropriate case the proceedings may be allowed to proceed to a certain stage, that is, setting down for trial, and then stayed at that point.38    As Mr Landau has acknowledged, it was accepted in Re AWB Ltd (2008) 222 FLR 240 (at [19] and [48]) that the principles in McMahon should be refined in light of the High Court’s decision in Reid v Howard (No 2) (1995) 184 CLR 1.  In Reid (at 11-12) a majority of the High Court reaffirmed the importance of the privilege against self-incrimination which cannot be abrogated, other than by statute.  In the joint judgment of Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ, their Honours said (at 11) that privilege which has been ‘described as a “fundamental … bulwark of liberty”, is not simply a rule of evidence, but a basic and substantive common law right.’ 39    Justice Deane observed in Reid (at 6) that the protection which the privilege confers extends, not only to the risk of incrimination by direct evidence, but also by indirect or derivative evidence, that is, evidence obtained by using the disclosed material as basis of investigation.  So in Sorby v Commonwealth (1983) 152 CLR 281 (at 310), Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ said: … the privilege protects the witness not only from incriminating himself directly under a compulsory process, but also from making a disclosure which may lead to incrimination or to the discovery of real evidence of an incriminating character.40    In Re AWB, Robson J acknowledged (at [58]) that he was bound to follow the McMahon line of authorities, noting that an appellate court may consider that the right of silence should not only be recognised, but protected by the courts by preventing a defendant from being effectively compelled to waive his right of silence and thereby help those who seek to prove an offence by requiring him to defend civil actions relating to the same or similar conduct, the subject of existing or potential criminal proceedings before those civil proceedings are completed.  41    Those principles are not in dispute in the debate between the parties on this aspect of the application.  Although Citation also relies upon the recent consideration of the principles by Middleton J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2016] FCA 504 (at [46]-[51], [68]-[72] and [81]-[100]) (CFMEU).  See also the discussion by Gordon J, as a member of this Court, in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v ActiveSuper Pty Ltd (No 5) [2013] FCA 369 (at [10]-[15]).42    The real point of dispute is whether there is anything like sufficient evidence that it is ‘on the cards’ that Mr Landau will face criminal prosecution.  43    Mr Landau contends that the matters which the pleaded issues seek to ventilate raise the same topics being investigated by ASIC and which could give rise to criminal prosecution.  It is not being argued by Mr Landau that a declaration pursuant to s 1317E of the Corporations Act as to contravention of ss 180, 181 or 182 could be used against him in any direct way in criminal proceedings.  However, what is stressed is that under s 1317N of the Corporations Act, civil proceedings for a declaration of a contravention are automatically stayed if criminal proceedings are commenced against a person for an offence and the offence is constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention.  Citation, however, rely on the same section for the argument that the legislature has made it very clear when a proceeding will be stayed, that is, on the actual institution of criminal proceedings, and that it is a reasonable inference that until that point has been reached, the legislature did not consider that it was appropriate that there should be any stay.  Indeed, that argument is expressly reflected in s 1331 of the Corporations Act which provides that ‘no civil proceedings under this Act are to be stayed merely because the proceeding discloses, or arises out of, the commission of an offence’.  44    Nevertheless, it is clear that the words ‘merely because’ in s 1331 of the Corporations Act leave open the possibility of a stay in appropriate circumstances.  Mr Landau stresses that the subject matter of these proceedings is exactly the same subject matter of the ASIC examinations attended by Mr Landau.  The suspected contraventions referred to in the ASIC notice of 26 May 2016 and the notice of 23 June 2016 refer to contraventions of the Corporations Act and the Criminal Code that are offences.  Emails from the ASIC officers disclose that the ASIC examination includes investigation into Mr Landau’s involvement in;(a)    the establishment and operation of the Westpac account; and (b)    the authorisation of payments from the Westpac account.Those matters are all directly reflected in the pleaded case.45    Mr Landau also relies upon the fact that an officer of ASIC, by affidavit sworn on 13 April 2016, in WAD 717 of 2015 swore that Mr Landau was potentially facing criminal action as a result of ASIC’s investigations.  46    Citation argues that a mere potentiality falls well short of prosecution being ‘on the cards’, being the expression used, for example, in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v HLP Financial Planning (Aust) Pty Ltd (2007) 164 FCR 487 (at [59]), also referred to and adopted in CFMEU (at [57] and [59]) by Middleton J.  This has been the primary focus of the debate.  47    In support of that contention, Citation point to the fact that:(a)    there is no evidence that ASIC has delivered any brief of evidence to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), let alone relating to matters the subject of these proceedings;(b)    although ASIC examinations have occurred and a freezing order has been made, this will not constitute sufficient evidence, without more, to support a conclusion that ASIC or the DPP will prosecute Mr Landau in relation to matters the subject of these proceedings;(c)    the mere potentiality referred to by the ASIC officer (in an affidavit that has not been disclosed to the plaintiff or the Court in these proceedings) is not sufficient to establish that there is a ‘reasonable possibility’ of a prosecution; and(d)    the notices requiring Mr Landau to attend the ASIC investigations with respect to the suspected contravention also relate to suspected contraventions by others, including Mr Landau, both with respect to Citation and also in relation to other companies, which are not the subject of these proceedings, such that it would not be possible to be satisfied that the statement made by the ASIC officer was referable to a potential prosecution of Mr Landau with respect to the matters the subject of these proceedings, as against proceedings in connection with other companies.  (In this regard, supplementary evidence filed by Mr Landau appears to make it clear that the topic of focus of ASIC is entirely commensurate with the pleaded case for Citation, but none of this changes the question of whether there is sufficient evidence that a prosecution is ‘on the cards’.)48    As to a claim by Mr Landau that he may be required in these proceedings to disclose his hand prior to any criminal proceedings going to trial, Citation point out that in ActiveSuper Gordon J held (at [20]) that (citations omitted):The Courts have rejected as a relevant consideration the possible loss by the defendant of any tactical advantage that might flow from their so-called ‘right of silence’ …  It is not [harsh] because in civil proceedings a defendant retains the power to decide what evidence to adduce and what submissions to make in response to allegations [against him or her].  Consideration49    The expression ‘on the cards’ appears to be interpreted as meaning ‘reasonably possible’ or a ‘reasonable possibility’:  see, for example, Websyte Corporation Pty Ltd v Alexander (No 2)  [2012] FCA 562 per Dodds-Streeton J (at [117]); and see also CC Containers Pty Ltd v Lee (No 2) [2012] VSC 149 per Ferguson J (at [15]).  It is not the position that for a prosecution to be ‘on the cards’ a decision must have been made to recommend prosecution or that a decision has already been made to send a brief to the relevant prosecuting authority.  In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Craigside Company Limited [2013] FCA 201, Jagot J considered whether a prosecution was ‘on the cards’ where ASIC has brought proceedings for declarations for contraventions of certain provisions of the Corporations Act against, amongst others, two individuals, one of whom was not the subject of an investigation and one of whom had been investigated.  In relation to the person who had not been investigated, ASIC refused to rule out the possibility of his being prosecuted.  In those circumstances, the Court took the view that a prosecution of both men was ‘on the cards’.  As a matter of commonsense, one reason for ASIC continuing to investigate the first person was to enable it to determine whether or not to prosecute him.  In relation to the second person, it was clear that his conduct was related to the first person and the Court concluded that ASIC must already have believed it had a sufficient basis to establish the civil standard of proof that the second person had contravened a provision of the Corporations Act, and even though no steps of investigation had taken place, it was sufficient for a prosecution to be ‘on the cards’.  50    I have referred to HLP above.  In that case, ASIC sought a declaration that a director operated an illegal managed investment scheme and carried on a financial services business without an Australian financial services licence.  Finkelstein J noted that ASIC’s investigation into the person’s activities was not confined to determining whether he committed merely regulatory offences, but, rather, what was also under consideration was whether he should be charged with any criminal offences.  Again, ASIC did not identify the relevant offences.  It indicated that if charges were laid, its preliminary view was that they would be tried in a Victorian court, probably the County Court.  In those circumstances, Finkelstein J considered that a criminal prosecution was ‘on the cards’.  51    In these cases, decisions to prosecute had not been made and a brief had not been sent to the relevant prosecuting authority.  Moreover, in Craigside, the second person was not even the subject of investigation, albeit that ASIC did not rule out the possibility of his being prosecuted. 52    The prospects of criminal prosecution in relation to Mr Landau would appear to be more advanced than these examples.  I am entirely unable and expressly make no comment whatsoever about the prospects in relation to such a prosecution.  But, in this instance, while any one particular matter may not, taken alone, be sufficient to constitute formation of an opinion that criminal prosecution is ‘on the cards’, the totality of the following matters support such a possibility.  Those factors are:(a)    ASIC has pursued and maintained a freezing order;(b)    ASIC has applied for travel restraint orders and, in doing so, indicated that Mr Landau was potentially facing criminal charges;(c)    ASIC has conducted a detailed investigation into Mr Landau, amongst others, relating to the same subject matter as these proceedings (as well as other matters).  That investigation is into a number of suspected contraventions constituting criminal offences, not mere regulatory offences; and(d)    examinations in relation to those topics have consumed some seven hours;(e)    the allegations made in these proceedings, as with the investigations by ASIC, are serious allegations; and, above all(f)    a relevant ASIC officer has sworn to the fact that Mr Landau may potentially be facing criminal charges.  53    There are two other factors in favour of Mr Landau’s application.  The first is that his apparently limited financial resources are unlikely to extend, at least on their face, to being able to substantially contribute both to the defence of these proceedings and to resisting criminal proceedings.  The other factor is that, in light of his apparently scarce financial resources, it is not apparent that Citation would suffer substantial prejudice if civil proceedings were stayed.  These proceedings could be resurrected if the criminal proceedings do not eventuate, but in the meantime, the claim for compensation of sums in excess of $2 million could not possibly be met, at least on the face of the assets and liabilities disclosed by Mr Landau.  Obviously, that contention would warrant much closer examination and further investigation, but there has been no objection to reliance on that financial material for present purposes.  Conclusion54    Despite these factors, I consider it is premature to conclude that criminal prosecution in relation to the matters the subject of the pleaded case is ‘on the cards’ for at least four reasons:(1)    The previous reference to the potentiality was in the context of activities involving two other companies in addition to Citation.  (2)    I am mindful that discovery sought by Citation has been refused by the ruling I have made in these reasons so that in the absence of any positive defence having been pleaded by Mr Landau, and in the absence of giving discovery, it is not apparent at this stage what additional risk he would face if these civil proceedings continue, at least, say, until the time of commencing trial.  At that point, if criminal proceedings have commenced in relation to the pleaded matters, then a stay will be automatic.  There may, at a later time, also be additional evidence as to the possibility of the specifically pleaded issues being the subject of a criminal prosecution.  (3)    I am mindful that it is unlikely that Mr Landau would be exposed to significant further costs prior to trial, given the nature of his defence, which, in substance, puts Citation to proof.  (4)    Finally, it seems to me that whatever decision has been taken in all these cases, a significant factor is the entitlement of Citation to brings its case to court.  Should circumstances change, the question of a stay can be revisited, but at present I consider it to be premature. CONCLUSION 55    In those circumstances and for the reasons discussed, each of the applications will be dismissed.  Each has consumed a similar amount of time, so it is convenient that there be no order as to costs.

A secondary issue concerns an order for indemnity costs that the primary judge made against the applicant.2    The application for leave to appeal and the appeal were heard together.  If the primary judge was right to summarily dismiss the proceeding, leave should be refused.  If the primary judge erred and, in considering the matter, we conclude that the applicants’ case as disclosed in the proposed pleading had a reasonable prospect of success, leave should be granted and the appeal allowed.3    For the reasons set out below, we consider that the primary judge’s conclusion was right.The circumstances leading up to the judgment4    It is first necessary to describe the circumstances in which the primary judge was required to consider the proposed pleading.  This is because to summarily dismiss a proceeding, and thereby preclude a person from having their case determined on its merits at a final hearing, is a serious step taken only with great care and if it is possible to conclude with confidence that there is no reasonable prospect of success; this is so despite the fact that under s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the Court Act) the power to summarily dismiss a proceeding is not dependent on the case being “hopeless” or “bound to fail” for it to have no reasonable prospect of success (Spencer v Commonwealth of Australia [2010] HCA 28; (2010) 241 CLR 118 at [17]-[26]).  5    The applicant (in fact, two applicants at the time, the additional one being a company controlled by the applicant) filed an originating application and statement of claim on 30 November 2011.  The applicants sought damages, including exemplary damages, from the Commonwealth and employees of the Commonwealth on the basis of allegations of breach of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the TPA), negligence, conspiracy, and misfeasance in public office.  The claims, insofar as they could be understood, arose from the (then) first applicant’s position as the principal of companies (one being the then second applicant) engaged by a contractor to the Commonwealth to provide information technology services to the Commonwealth’s Department of Defence.6    On 3 January 2012 the applicants filed and served an amended statement of claim.  The solicitors for the respondents advised the solicitors for the applicants of various deficiencies in the pleading and that, if not remedied, an application to strike out the pleading and for indemnity costs would be filed.  On 11 May 2012 the primary judge ordered the applicants to file and serve a proposed further amended statement of claim by 1 June 2012, with all affidavits in chief to be filed and served by 22 June 2012.  On 6 June 2012 the applicants served a proposed further amended statement of claim.  On 15 June 2012 the solicitors for the respondents advised that they did not consent to the filing of that document as it did not address many of the deficiencies set out in the original correspondence, but said the respondents would be prepared to consider another redraft if received by 22 June 2012.  Instead, the applicants filed and served an application seeking leave to rely on the proposed further amended statement of claim.  Amongst other things, the applicants pleaded a conspiracy, misfeasance in public office, negligence occasioned by the Commonwealth breaching a duty of care to avoid exposing the first applicant to a risk of injury from the acts of the Commonwealth’s employees, and misleading and deceptive conduct in breach of the TPA, and a right to exemplary damages.7    On 6 July 2012 the primary judge granted the applicants leave to rely on the proposed further amended statement of claim but on the basis that all of the respondents’ arguments to resist the grant of leave could be made in respect of an application to strike out the revised pleading.  As a result, and on 7 August 2012, the respondents filed a defence and an application seeking to strike out the further amended statement of claim and for summary dismissal.  This application came before the primary judge on 5 September 2012.  The hearing of the application remained incomplete on that day and the hearing was adjourned to 11 October 2012.  Further submissions were also submitted on 2 November 2012.  8    The primary judge gave judgment on 28 May 2014 (Danthanarayana v Commonwealth of Australia [2014] FCA 552 (Danthanarayana v Commonwealth of Australia (No 1))).  He struck out the whole of the statement of claim and summarily dismissed the claims for damages and exemplary damages for the torts of conspiracy, misfeasance in public office and under the TPA, and otherwise gave the applicant alone leave to “endeavour to replead a case in negligence against the first respondent, the Commonwealth of Australia” by 27 June 2014.  In his reasons for judgment in respect of the pleading of negligence which was struck out, his Honour said:112 Mr Danthanarayana has not pleaded any facts which identify who, for present purposes, was the directing mind of the Commonwealth and has failed to plead facts which, if proved, could show that the Commonwealth as a legal entity separate from its employees and officers, knew or ought to have known of the alleged risks to Mr Danthanarayana.113 Senior Counsel for the applicants did not come to grips with these difficulties. At times I thought that he was, contrary to the pleading, arguing that the Commonwealth was, in fact, vicariously liable.114 Counsel for the respondents went on to submit that the imposition of the alleged duty directly on the Commonwealth would conflict with other duties owed by the Commonwealth. 115 There is considerable force in these submissions but, in the view which I take of the negligence case sought to be run by Mr Danthanarayana, it is not necessary to traverse the respondents’ submissions in any more detail. 116 As presently pleaded, Mr Danthanarayana’s case in negligence does not, in my view, rely upon vicarious liability as a basis for attributing liability to the Commonwealth.117 Notwithstanding that Senior Counsel for Mr Danthanarayana disavowed any application that his clients should be given leave to replead, I think that Mr Danthanarayana should be given an opportunity to articulate more precisely the negligence case which he intends to take to trial. As matters presently stand, I think that there are difficulties with a case based upon a duty of care being owed by the Commonwealth directly to Mr Danthanarayana although I am inclined to think that such a case would not be impossible for Mr Danthanarayana to plead and run. In the circumstances, I think that it may well be possible for him to plead and conduct a case in negligence against the Commonwealth as being vicariously liable for the conduct of its employees. 118 I will, therefore, strike out the negligence case as currently pleaded but give leave to Mr Danthanarayana to endeavour to replead that case in conformity with these Reasons for Judgment.9    On 27 June 2014 the applicant filed and served an amended originating application and second further amended statement of claim which pleaded negligence against the Commonwealth, including a new claim based on vicarious liability, and a new cause of action under the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) (the Fair Work Act) involving an allegation of unlawful adverse action against the applicant by reason of a workplace right (the right to complain).  The application for leave to rely on these documents came before the primary judge for hearing on 1 August 2014 but the applicant was not ready to proceed.  The Commonwealth made submissions in full against any grant of leave and the primary judge adjourned the application for leave until 8 and then 26 August 2014.  In the course of the hearing on 26 August 2014 the applicant conceded that the pleading remained deficient and sought further time to replead the case.  The primary judge, amongst other things, directed the applicant to file and serve his “final proposed Amended Originating Application and Second Further Amended Statement of Claim” and written submissions in support of the grant of leave by 19 September 2014, and ordered that the application be determined on the papers.  10    On 22 September 2014 the applicant filed and served the (New Proposed) Second Further Amended Statement of Claim which is the subject of the application for leave to appeal, with written submissions in support of the grant of leave.  The Commonwealth filed and served written submissions opposing leave on 24 October 2014, with the applicant’s submissions in reply being filed and served on 31 October 2014.  Both parties filed supplementary submissions in April 2015 as a result of the decision in Melbourne Stadiums Ltd v Sautner [2015] FCAFC 20; (2015) 229 FCR 221 dealing with costs under the Fair Work Act.  The judgment11    The primary judge gave reasons for judgment in Danthanarayana v Commonwealth of Australia (No 2) [2016] FCA 157 explaining why he considered the case in the proposed pleading had no real prospect of success, as a consequence of which his Honour summarily dismissed the proceeding as a whole under s 31A of the Court Act.12    After recording the history of the application for leave to amend the pleading (in large part, reflected above) at [1] – [15] the primary judge identified the causes of action now raised by the applicant against the Commonwealth as follows (referring to the proposed pleading as ASC Version 2 and the amended originating application as OA Version 2):17 By his OA Version 2, the applicant claims damages for loss and damage suffered by him caused by:(a) Breaches of alleged duties of care owed directly by the Commonwealth to him (pars 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 and 46 of ASC Version 2); and(b) Wrongful conduct on the part of Commonwealth employees working in the Department of Defence for which the Commonwealth is vicariously liable (pars 5 to 23, 32 to 39 and 46 of ASC Version 2).…19 By his OA Version 2, the applicant also claims statutory compensation pursuant to s 545(2) of the FWA for a contravention of the FWA constituted by the Commonwealth’s conduct in taking adverse action against the applicant in breach of s 340(1)(a)(i) of the FWA (pars 40 to 46 of ASC Version 2).13    The primary judge then described the relationships between the applicant and the Commonwealth, about which there is no material dispute.  Relevantly:29 In 2005, PCIT [the applicant’s company] entered into a contract with a service provider known as M & T Resources. That contract ran from 9 November 2005 until 24 October 2006. Pursuant to that contract, M & T Resources engaged PCIT to provide IT consultancy services to Defence Chief Information Officer Group (CIOG), a division of the Department of Defence. The work itself was to be carried out by the applicant. 30 By a formal contract in writing made on 6 November 2006 between PCIT, the corporation, and Icon [a company contracting to the Department of Defence], PCIT agreed to provide the services of the applicant to Icon for the period 7 November 2006 up to and including 30 June 2007. Under that contract, the applicant was required to report to an appointed nominee of the Department of Defence and thereafter to attend the premises of that Department in order to provide IT consulting services in consultation with that Department. 31 Clause 7 of that contract provided that the relationship between PCIT and Icon should be that of an independent service provider and neither PCIT nor Icon had any power, right or authority to bind the other or assume or create any obligation or responsibility, whether express or implied, on behalf of the other or in the other’s name. The clause went on to provide that nothing in the contract should be construed as constituting PCIT and Icon as partners or creating the relationship of employer and employee, master and servant, or principal and agent between PCIT and Icon. 32 In 2007, PCIT’s contract with Icon was extended until 30 September 2008. 33 In the period from 1 October 2008 to 25 October 2009, the applicant’s services were provided to the Department of Defence under a contract in writing between that Department and Frontier Group Australia Pty Ltd (Frontier) which, in turn, had procured the provision of those services pursuant to a contract between it and PCIT. 34 In the period from 30 October 2009 to 20 December 2009, the applicant’s services were provided to the Department of Defence pursuant to similar multi-party arrangements. On this occasion, the service provider which held the formal written contract with the Commonwealth was Talent International (ACT) Pty Ltd (Talent). That company had, in turn, contracted with PCIT to provide the services of the applicant to it for the purpose of enabling it to provide his services to the Commonwealth. In that contract, there were express provisions governing the nature of the relationship (cl 12) between Talent and PCIT. PCIT was said not to be an employee, servant or agent of Talent. 35 On 2 February 2010, the applicant caused to be incorporated a company called Nirvana Consulting Pty Ltd (Nirvana). Since its incorporation, the applicant has been the sole director and shareholder of Nirvana.36 In the period from 3 February 2010 to 30 September 2010, the applicant’s services were provided to the Department of Defence by a service provider called Peoplebank Australia Ltd (Peoplebank) pursuant to a formal written contract between Peoplebank and the Commonwealth. That corporation had, in turn, entered into a contract with Nirvana whereby Nirvana undertook to provide the applicant’s services to Peoplebank for the purpose of having those services provided to the Department of Defence by Peoplebank.37 In the period from 4 October 2010 to 30 June 2011, the applicant’s services were provided to the Department of Defence by a service provider called Whizdom Pty Ltd (Whizdom) pursuant to a formal written contract between Whizdom and the Commonwealth. Whizdom had, in turn, entered into a contract with Nirvana whereby Nirvana was to provide the applicant’s services to Whizdom for the purpose of allowing Whizdom to provide the applicant’s services to the Department of Defence.38 As noted at [26] above, the applicant resigned his employment as an APS employee for the last time in 2005. 39  Thus, throughout the period from about November 2005 until 30 June 2011, one of Icon, Frontier, Talent, Peoplebank or Whizdom, each of which was a service provider corporation separate and independent from the applicant, entered into a formal written contract with the Commonwealth pursuant to which the particular service provider undertook to provide specified IT consultancy services to the Department of Defence. Different projects were involved but all of the work was in IT, the area of the applicant’s expertise. Each of those service providers, in turn, entered into a contract with either PCIT or Nirvana pursuant to which either PCIT or Nirvana (as the case may be) promised to provide the services of the applicant to the service provider in question and thus ultimately to the Department of Defence.…41 None of PCIT, Nirvana or the applicant had any express contractual arrangements with the Commonwealth or any of its departments of state or agencies at any time after November 2005. The contracts for the provision of consultancy services were always entered into between the Commonwealth, on the one hand, and the relevant service provider, on the other hand. Those contracts were supported by the back-to-back arrangements constituted by the contracts between the service providers and PCIT or Nirvana. 42 The period of time during which the alleged wrongful conduct on the part of the Commonwealth and its employees took place was from about June 2009 to about mid-May 2011.14    The primary judge then identified the causes of action as pleaded (at [43]-[58]), followed by a summary of the competing submissions (at [59]-[85]).  His Honour then concluded as follows.Direct liability of the Commonwealth – negligence (1)    Because the applicant was: in every sense of the word, an independent contractor whose services were provided to the Commonwealth by a service provider which, in turn, had contracted with PCIT to provide the applicant’s services…. (at [86]), the negligence claim directly against the Commonwealth must fail as this was: fatal to the imposition of either of the direct duties relied upon by the applicant at pars 24 and 25 of his proposed pleading… and, in any event, the pleading: lacks the crucial factor of a need to co-ordinate activities which were inherently dangerous and which, absent co-ordination, gave rise to a foreseeable risk of injury… (at [87] citing, in support, Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Fox [2009] HCA 35; (2009) 240 CLR 1 (Leighton)).(2)    Further, the duties of care said to be directly owed by the Commonwealth to the applicant would be inconsistent with other obligations of the Commonwealth, which was a further reason to conclude that the duties did not exist (at [88]).(3)    In addition, when: considering whether the Commonwealth itself had knowledge of facts relevant to establishing a duty (including a duty of care), or must be taken to have known those matters, it is necessary to consider whether those persons said to have the relevant knowledge can be said to be the directing mind and will of the Commonwealth… (at [89]), but the applicant has not pleaded any facts which identify who, for present purposes, was the directing mind of the Commonwealth and has failed to plead facts which, if proved, could show that the Commonwealth as a legal entity separate from its employees and officers knew or ought to have known of the alleged risks to the applicant… (at [90]).(4)    “In any event, the failures said to give rise to a breach of the claimed direct duties are pleaded in a way which is impossibly general and vague. The applicant has not undertaken the task of specifying in the pleading the reasonable steps that the Commonwealth should have undertaken in order to fulfil the alleged duties” (at [91]).Vicarious liability of the Commonwealth - negligence(5)    The pleaded duty is: an absolute duty to avoid exposing the applicant to the risk of injury. No such duty is known to the law. As submitted by the Commonwealth, the difficulties caused by pleading an absolute duty is brought into sharp focus when it is appreciated that the pleaded breaches by Messrs Sykes and Pope relate to matters where they had conflicting duties to the Commonwealth. This is yet another reason why the pleaded absolute duty cannot be allowed to stand…. (at [92]).The Fair Work Act claim(6)    Section 342 of the Fair Work Act, as pleaded, requires adverse action to be taken by:a person (the principal) who has entered into a contract for services with an independent contractor against the independent contractor, or a person employed or engaged by the independent contractor.  However, the applicant was not “engaged by the Commonwealth as an independent contractor within the meaning of Item 3 of s 342 of the FWA”.  Specifically (at [97]):The evidence speaks with one voice on this matter. There was no express contractual arrangement between the Commonwealth and the applicant at any time in the period 2009–2011.  The applicant was not engaged directly by the Commonwealth nor was he employed or engaged by any service provider (such as Icon) with whom the Commonwealth had a contract.  The alleged implied contract for services is completely inconsistent with the express contractual arrangements pursuant to which the applicant did work at the Commonwealth’s premises.(7)    The applicant’s case based on the Fair Work Act was thus “hopeless” (at [100]).(8)    Further, the Commonwealth’s submissions, including that the “proposed Fair Work Act pleading fell wholly outside the grant of leave to attempt to replead” (at [81]) were “sound and I accept them” (at [99]).Direct liability of the Commonwealth – negligence15    It is appropriate to record that we do not necessarily agree with the primary judge’s observations at [87] and [88].  16    First, it was not necessarily “fatal” to the Commonwealth owing a duty of care to the applicant that he was present in a workplace the Commonwealth controlled under a series of contractual arrangements between the Commonwealth and an independent contractor and between the independent contractor and a company providing the services of the applicant.  Nor was the primary judge’s conclusion that there could be no implied contract between the applicant and the Commonwealth necessarily fatal to the existence of such a duty of care.  This is because the existence of a duty of care in a novel case (assuming, for this purpose, the asserted duty was novel) depends upon an examination of all salient features of the relationship between the parties (see, for example, New South Wales v Spearpoint [2009] NSWCA 233 at [21]-[23] and Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258; (2009) 75 NSWLR 649 at [102]-[104]).17    Second, we do not understand Leighton to decide that the only case in which a party (for example, a person in control of a site or, in this case, a workplace) might owe a duty of care to an independent contractor is where the activities in question are inherently dangerous, thereby giving rise to a foreseeable risk of injury if activities are not co-ordinated.  Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 1; (1986) 160 CLR 16 (Stevens v Brodribb) was such a case, but there is no suggestion in it that the duty which might exist at law is confined by the particular factual circumstances of that case.  Leighton also does not decide that Stevens v Brodribb is confined to its facts.  In Leighton the alleged negligence involved an activity of one independent contractor harming another.  In the present case, the allegation was of employees of the Commonwealth harming the applicant.  Leighton was not necessarily fatal to the applicant’s case.18    Third, the asserted inconsistent obligations of the Commonwealth were not amenable to resolution on a summary dismissal application.  They were fact and context dependent at least in large part.  Sullivan v Moody [2001] HCA 59; (2001) 207 CLR 562, a strike out case, involved an inconsistency between the alleged duty and the applicable statutory regime which meant that the duty could never exist.  The inconsistencies on which the Commonwealth relied in the present case were of a different character, not suited to summary disposal outside of the context set by knowledge of all of the relevant circumstances.19    Because the primary judge did not identify which of his conclusions were necessary or sufficient to justify his decision to strike out the proposed pleading and summarily dismiss the proceeding, these conclusions must mean that, insofar as we are concerned, it must be taken that the primary judge erred so that this Court is required to decide the issues for itself.  On that basis, we are satisfied not only that the primary judge was right in the views expressed at [89]-[91] and that, of themselves, each such conclusion was sufficient to justify the striking out of the causes of action in negligence, but that the duties as pleaded at paragraphs 24 and 25 of the proposed pleading were unintelligible and incapable of founding a claim with any reasonable prospect of success.20    In dealing with paragraphs 24 and 25 of the proposed pleading, what must be recalled is that this was the applicant’s final opportunity to attempt to plead his case.  So much was clear from the order the primary judge made on 26 August 2014 (and even then, in the face of the order, describing the re-pleading as “final”, the applicant was granted the further indulgence of yet another attempt).  The primary judge had given the applicant multiple opportunities to plead the case.  In coming to the proposed pleading the primary judge could not be expected to read in words that do not appear or to undertake a complicated process of construction of the pleading on the basis that any ambiguity ought to be resolved in the applicant’s favour.  Nor, for that matter, can we be expected to do so.  Yet this is what the applicant’s case involves.21    Paragraph 24 pleads that at all times “during the Engagement” the Commonwealth owed the applicant a duty of care to avoid exposing the applicant to unnecessary risks of injury.  In common with his Honour, we are prepared to overlook the lack of any definition of the Engagement and to take it as a reference to the work the applicant performed under the contracts referred to in paragraph 4 of the pleading.  Yet the applicant had to go further.  No material facts are pleaded which are said to give rise to this duty of care.  The applicant submitted that we should read the words “during the Engagement” as meaning something like “during and in the circumstances of the Engagement as pleaded in paragraph 4”.  It is not possible to read paragraph 24 in this way.  As the Commonwealth submitted, the proposed pleading is replete with what appear to be immaterial facts relating to events which pre-date the so-called Engagement by many years.  Why paragraph 24 should be read as invoking the circumstances in paragraph 4 relating to the contracts, let alone only paragraph 4, is not apparent.  The pleading thus fails to disclose any material facts capable of supporting the duty of care asserted in paragraph 24.  22    Paragraph 25 is particularised but, again, it was said that the paragraph should be construed as invoking the circumstances in paragraph 4 (but not, presumably, the many other paragraphs containing apparently immaterial facts).  For the same reasons as for paragraph 24, we consider this an inappropriate exercise in the particular circumstances which confronted the primary judge.  For a final attempt to plead a claim in negligence (after what, in truth, should be described as the third attempt to do so), paragraph 25 is patently inadequate as it does not identify all of the material facts on which the applicant relies to support the alleged duty; the Commonwealth would thus be left to guess that it is intended to invoke paragraph 4 and paragraph 4 alone as the relevant facts, apart from those particularised under paragraph 25.  23    In any event, as the primary judge appreciated, the existence of a duty of care is only part of a cause of action.  This was the applicant’s final chance to plead a complete cause of action in negligence.  The attempt to plead breach in paragraph 26 is a series of generalised assertions by reference to another series of generalised allegations defined as the Complaints Investigation, the Security Breach Allegations, and the Security Breach Investigation.  When regard is then had to how the pleading identifies those defined terms, the problems are compounded.  For example, the Complaints Investigation is said to be attended by features, each of which might or might not be said, of itself or perhaps cumulatively, to involve a breach of the duty.  Those features include the length of time the investigation took, the changes in personnel within the Commonwealth involved in the investigation, the involvement of a named person which caused the applicant to “feel that the investigation was not being conducted impartially”, failing to keep certain things confidential and not providing the applicant with “ongoing feedback” about the investigation.  It is impossible from the pleading to know how these features, individually or cumulatively, are said to involve breach of the duty of care.  The same observations apply to the Security Breach Allegations as identified in paragraph 18 and the Security Breach Investigation as identified in paragraph 20.  24    The primary judge’s description of the pleading of breach of the duties of care as “impossibly general and vague” at [91] is amply supported by the terms of the pleading.  As such, no complete cause of action is pleaded, by reason of which the case in negligence had no reasonable prospects of success.25    The primary judge was also right at [90] to identify the manifest inadequacy of the pleading in respect of identifying the persons said to have knowledge attributable to the Commonwealth which would make the Commonwealth directly, as opposed to vicariously, liable for harm said to have been suffered by the applicant (see Western Australia v Watson [1990] WAR 248 at 267-271).  In submissions on the appeal it was said for the applicant that two employees of the Commonwealth had been identified in paragraphs 28 to 30 (Mr Mountstephen and Mr Slattery) and they were the relevant “agents to know” (adopting the phrase referred to in Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Naidu [2007] NSWCA 377; (2007) 71 NSWLR 471 at [43], in a discussion about imputing knowledge to a corporation at [38]-[43]).  But the pleading is hopelessly confused and confusing.  One particular refers to an email to Mr Mountstephen but at a time before the alleged bullying in the workplace which caused the injury is said to have commenced.  Another refers to an email to Mr Mountstephen but after his relevant role is said elsewhere in the pleading to have ceased.  The third communication to Mr Slattery is well after the alleged bullying.  In any event, it is not apparent from the face of the pleading that the applicant relies only on the communications to Mr Mountstephen and Mr Slattery as the basis for the imputation of the relevant knowledge to the Commonwealth.  Numerous other employees are referred to and, as noted, the proposed pleading contains many allegations the relevance of which is unable to be discerned.  26    For these reasons the primary judge was right to conclude that the causes of action in negligence as pleaded had no reasonable prospect of success.  Vicarious liability of the Commonwealth – negligence27    The duty of care alleged against certain employees of the Commonwealth in paragraph 33 is also fraught with difficulty.  The allegation begins with the words “In the premises”.  We are prepared to accept that this refers back to the circumstances of reasonable foreseeability of harm to the applicant set out in the immediately preceding paragraph.  But, said the applicant, it should also be construed as a reference back to all of the relevant “premises”, including paragraphs 4 and 28 to 31.  We do not consider it open to construe the pleading in this way.  And as we have said, it was not for the Commonwealth, at this stage of the debate about the pleading, to attempt to identify for itself which of the “premises” were considered by the applicant to be relevant and which were not.  How the Commonwealth was meant to do so is also not apparent.  Further and as the Commonwealth said, it is not possible to read this paragraph as asserting a duty to take reasonable care to avoid reasonably foreseeable harm to the applicant.  This limitation cannot be read into paragraph 33 which, as the primary judge said at [92], asserts an absolute duty, unknown to the law, to not engage in conduct that would expose the applicant to a risk of injury.  This pleading is hopeless on its face.28    The pleading of breach is also hopeless.  It cannot be that the employees breached the duty of care alleged against them merely by engaging in the so-called Security Clearance Cancellation Conduct.  That conduct is identified at paragraph 14 as bringing about the cancellation of the applicant’s security clearance without justifiable cause, but it is particularised by reference to actions taken, not by the employees, but by an independent contractor to the Commonwealth who is said to have asked the applicant to sign a form, which the applicant did, and it is that action which is then said to result in the cancellation of the applicant’s security clearance.29    It follows that the primary judge was also right to conclude that this cause of action could not be permitted to proceed to hearing.Fair Work Act claim30    There is a fundamental impediment to the success of this claim as pleaded.  It relies upon an allegation, unsustainable on the material facts pleaded, that the applicant was engaged by the Commonwealth as an independent contractor pursuant to an implied contract for services.   31    Relying upon s 340(1)(a)(i) of the Fair Work Act, the applicant claims that the Commonwealth took adverse action against him because he had a workplace right.  The meaning of “workplace right” is given by s 341 of the Fair Work Act.  The circumstances in which one person may take “adverse action” against another are set out in a table to s 342 of the Fair Work Act.  The proposed pleading relies upon those circumstances described in Item 3 of the table to s 342.  As set out at [14(6)] above, Item 3, column 1 provides that adverse action is taken by:a person (the principal) who has entered into a contract for services with an independent contractor against the independent contractor, or a person employed or engaged by the independent contractor.32    Paragraph 2(e) pleads that the Commonwealth was a principal for the purposes of Item 3 and that a contract of services was made between the Commonwealth and the applicant.  That contract is described at paragraph 1(e) as an implied contract made by reason of the circumstances set out at what is referred to as paragraph 5 but which is an intended reference to paragraph 4 of the proposed pleading.  Paragraph 4 is the pleader’s attempt to set out the material facts relied upon to establish an implied contract for services between the applicant and the Commonwealth.  Broadly stated, the material facts relied upon are these:(1)    Under contracts (defined as “Contracts”) made between the Commonwealth and other identified entities (in each case, a service provider providing personnel) and, in turn, between the service provider and a partnership or entity controlled by the applicant, the applicant performed specific work at the direction and control of the Commonwealth “in all respects as though he were engaged directly” by the Commonwealth. (2)    The applicant relied upon the Commonwealth to provide computer hardware and software in order to perform his duties under the Contracts.(3)    The Commonwealth provided the applicant with regular training in relation to workplace conduct and security. (4)    The applicant was bound by policies and procedures that applied to employees of the Commonwealth.(5)    The Commonwealth made arrangements for the applicant to travel in the performance of his duties under the Contracts and reimbursed him for travel costs. (6)    The applicant was not permitted under the Contracts to delegate his duties under the Contracts to another person. 33    The implied contract contended for by the pleading is co-extensive in time with the Contracts.  There is no allegation pleaded that the Contracts were a sham, a pretence, or were ineffectual or inoperative.  To the contrary, the pleading proceeds on the basis that the services provided by the applicant to the Commonwealth were provided pursuant to the Contracts.  The material facts pleaded do not allege conduct or circumstances from which a contract made between the applicant and the Commonwealth for the provision of services by the applicant could be implied.  To the contrary, the pleading leaves no room for the implication of such a contract in circumstances where the pleading itself alleges that the services provided by the applicant were provided pursuant to the Contracts (see Fair Work Ombudsman v Quest South Perth Holdings Pty Ltd [2015] FCAFC 37; (2015) 228 FCR 346 at [132]-[234], especially at [167]-[171] and [187]-[188].34    As the applicant’s counsel correctly accepted, the absence of a contract for services between the applicant and the Commonwealth, whether express or implied, is fatal to the applicant’s reliance on Item 3 of the table to s.342 and thus the Fair Work Act claim.  35    There are other difficulties with the Fair Work Act claim but, in the circumstances, it is not necessary for those to be addressed other than to express our agreement with the primary judge’s acceptance of the Commonwealth’s submission that the Fair Work Act claim was outside the leave which the primary judge gave to the applicant to re-plead the case in negligence against the Commonwealth, which provided a further, and in our view sufficient, reason to reject this part of the proposed pleading.Conclusions on summary dismissal36    The primary judge was right to characterise the proceeding, as disclosed in the proposed pleading, as one which had no real prospect of success.  He was thus right to strike out the pleading and, in the circumstances of this case, to summarily dismiss the proceeding.  It is unnecessary, given these conclusions, to deal with each of the alleged errors by the primary judge in the draft notice of appeal.  The application for leave to appeal must be dismissed with costs to this extent, subject to the remaining issue about the indemnity costs orders below.Costs37    The primary judge ordered the applicant to pay the Commonwealth’s costs on an indemnity basis up to 28 May 2014, from 28 May to 26 August 2014, and from 26 August 2014 onwards.  His Honour explained:THE INDEMNITY COSTS ORDER MADE ON 26 AUGUST 2014 (ORDER 2)102 On 26 August 2014, I ordered that the applicant and Nirvana pay all of the respondent’s costs of and incidental to this proceeding up to 28 May 2014 on an indemnity basis.103 My reasons for making that order were that, in the period from the commencement of this proceeding up to 28 May 2014, when I delivered Danthanarayana No 1 [Danthanarayana v Commonwealth of Australia (No 1)], the applicants had had many opportunities to address the respondents’ concerns about the form of their pleading but had steadfastly refused to take heed of the many warnings given to them by the solicitors for the respondents. In her affidavit sworn on 6 August 2014, Ms Harvey traversed the entire history of the respondents’ efforts to secure a sensible pleading from the applicants. The affidavit disclosed a sorry history indeed. It is not necessary for present purposes to traverse in detail the history of the dealings between the parties. 104 The substance of the matter is that, apart from the slim possibility that the applicant in his individual capacity might be able to bring a claim for breaches of a duty of care owed directly to him by the Commonwealth, the case pleaded by the applicants throughout the period 2011 and 2012 was a case which had no reasonable prospects of success. In my judgment, it was a case which should never have been brought.105 It was for these brief reasons that I considered that an indemnity costs order for the entire case up to 28 May 2014 was justified.COSTS FOR THE PERIOD AFTER 28 MAY 2014106 At [2]–[8] above, I set out the steps that were taken in this proceeding between late May 2014 and 26 August 2014.107 In my view, the applicant should have been ready to make his submissions in support of the DSFASOC [draft Second Further Amended Statement of Claim] on 1 August 2014. He was not then in a position to do so. Although the time in Court on 1 August 2014 was not completely wasted, the fact that the applicant was not ready to proceed on that occasion caused further delay in the disposition of his Application for Leave to Amend. In the end, of course, he chose to propound a further draft of his proposed claim which first became available on 22 September 2014.108 Against that background, and having had 25 days to consider the Commonwealth’s oral submissions made on 1 August 2014, the applicant was still not ready to proceed on 26 August 2014. The applicant’s lack of preparedness to proceed on 26 August 2014 became apparent soon after the commencement of the hearing on that day. The applicant’s defaults were made more serious by the circumstance that, not only was he not ready to proceed on that day, but Senior Counsel then appearing for him sought yet a further indulgence. Counsel had formed the view that the DSFASOC would need to be amended yet again and he sought time within which to consider and propound further amendments. This was most unsatisfactory since the whole purpose of adjourning the matter at the request of the applicant on 1 August 2014 was to have his Application for Leave to Amend finally resolved on 26 August 2014.109 The above history amply demonstrates that the total waste of time and money incurred by the Commonwealth in relation to the aborted hearing on 26 August 2014 was the direct result of the failure on the part of the applicant and his lawyers to consider submissions made by the Commonwealth on 1 August 2014 and to prepare themselves for the hearing on 26 August 2014. The applicant and his lawyers should have realised that further work needed to be done on the DSFASOC long before 26 August 2014. The inutility of that fixture was entirely the fault of the applicant and his lawyers.110 These were my reasons for making the second indemnity costs order which I made on 26 August 2014 (Order 7 made on that day). 111 It seems to me that the current applicant, Mr Danthanarayana, also conducted his case in the period after 28 May 2014 up to and including 26 August 2014 in the same manner as he had conducted it in the period prior to 28 May 2014. He brought forward a pleading (the DSFASOC) which was defective. He took no steps to remedy it prior to 26 August 2014 and left the Commonwealth with no choice but to persist with its opposition to the applicant’s endeavour to plead a sensible case.112 For these reasons, I think that the applicant should be ordered to pay indemnity costs in respect of this proceeding for the period from 28 May 2014 to 26 August 2014. 113 Finally, there are the costs for the period after 26 August 2014. 114 In light of the fact that I have refused leave to amend upon the basis that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of succeeding in any of the causes of action which he has sought to maintain, I think that he should also pay indemnity costs in respect of costs incurred after 26 August 2014.38    The applicant submitted that these reasons are: sparse, do not engage any of the features that ordinarily would be present in order to permit the making of a costs order on an indemnity basis and would appear to visit upon the applicant an inappropriately harsh penalty for having attempted to rectify his pleading, in accordance with the leave granted to him by the Court on 28 May 2014.39    No error of principle is apparent from the primary judge’s reasons.  Nor are the reasons inadequate given the nature of the issue and the fact that his Honour expressly referred to the history of the proceeding at [106].  There was a proper basis for orders for indemnity costs as made by his Honour.  In particular, although his Honour gave the applicant leave to re-plead on 28 May 2014, this was done on the express basis that his Honour accepted that it: may well be possible for [the applicant] to plead and conduct a case in negligence against the Commonwealth as being vicariously liable for the conduct of its employees.(Danthanarayana v Commonwealth of Australia (No 1) at [117]).  40    This observation is sound. Such a pleading may well have been possible.  The problem is that despite repeated attempts the applicant was incapable of making such a pleading.  Instead, the applicant persisted in versions of pleadings which were hopeless.  This is a well-recognised category in which an order for indemnity costs might be appropriate.  No error in the exercise of discretion is identified, and this ground must thus also fail.I certify that the preceding forty (40) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justices Jagot, Bromberg and Murphy.Associate: Dated:    30 August 2016",2016-09-02 00:00:00,Federal Court of Australia

The Minister may exercise that power personally or delegate its exercise to someone else.  In the present case the Minister exercised the power personally.  The visa holder contends that in so doing the Minister made a decision which was so unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker would have made it.  In Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v Eden [2016] FCAFC 28 at [103] a Full Court (Allsop CJ, Griffiths and Wigney JJ) observed:Where the Minister exercises that power personally, Parliament has expressly provided for no merits review of that decision, unlike the situation which prevails if the decision is made by the Minister’s delegate.  In such circumstances, the Court must be astute to ensure that it is not seen to engage in a form of impermissible merits review under the guise of the legal unreasonableness ground of judicial review.  In such circumstances, one would expect (consistently with the observation of Gageler J in [Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Li (2013) 249 CLR 332] at [113]) that in the case of decisions made by the Minister personally, intervention on the ground of legal unreasonableness would be fairly rare and would only occur in relatively clear cases. …2    The fundamental question in the present case is whether this is such a case. Section 5013    Section 501 relevantly provides:(2)    The Minister may cancel a visa that has been granted to a person if:(a)    the Minister reasonably suspects that the person does not pass the character test; and(b)    the person does not satisfy the Minister that the person passes the character test.…    Character test(6)    For the purposes of this section, a person does not pass the character test if:(a)    the person has a substantial criminal record (as defined by subsection (7)); ……Otherwise, the person passes the character test.    Substantial criminal record    (7)    For the purposes of the character test, a person has a substantial criminal record if:    …(c)    the person has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more; ………    Pardons etc.(10)    For the purposes of the character test, a sentence imposed on a person, or the conviction of a person for an offence, is to be disregarded if:    (a)    the conviction concerned has been quashed or otherwise nullified;…    …… Relevant facts4    The applicant, Tammie Parker, now in his mid-30s, was born in New Zealand but has lived in Australia since infancy.  He never took out Australian citizenship.5    On 2 January 2006 Mr Parker was granted a Class TY Subclass 444 Special Category (Temporary) visa.  6    On 24 September 2010 he was convicted in the Local Court of New South Wales sitting at Penrith of the following offences, each of which was described by the sentencing magistrate as “serious”, and sentenced to 13 months’ imprisonment on each of the three charges, to be served concurrently:      demanding property with menaces with intent to steal;    being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence; and     threatening a person with intent to influence a witness.7    At the same time he was convicted of two counts of failing to appear in accordance with a bail undertaking (for which no penalty was imposed), use intimidation/violence to unlawfully influence person (for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 10 weeks and 6 days, backdated to 27 September 2009) and common assault (for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 5 months, backdated to 17 March 2010).  8    On 21 November 2013 Mr Parker was notified that his visa may be liable for cancellation under s 501(2) of the Migration Act on account of his substantial criminal record.  9    On 3 February 2014, however, the Minister’s Department wrote to Mr Parker advising him that his visa would not be cancelled and at the same time issuing him with a formal warning, which he acknowledged in writing on 7 March 2014, in the following terms:Please note that visa cancellation may be considered if you commit further offences or otherwise breach the character test in future.  Disregard of this warning will weigh heavily against you if your case is reconsidered.(Emphasis in original.)10    On 19 June 2014 Mr Parker was convicted in his absence at the Local Court of New South Wales sitting at Waverley of the charge of “Possess or Use A Prohibited Weapon Without Permit” and fined $700 (“the 2014 conviction”).  The prohibited weapon in question was a capsicum spray. He did not lodge any appeal and on 24 July 2015 the Minister’s Department wrote to him, reminding him of the warning given to him in March 2014, and advised that “new consideration” was being given to cancelling his visa under s 501(2) of the Migration Act.  He was invited to comment or provide information on whether he passed the character test and, in the event that the decision-maker suspected he did not, whether the decision-maker’s discretion should be exercised against him.11    On 25 August 2015 Mr Parker acknowledged receipt of the notice, consented to the release to the Department of information on his criminal, psychiatric, medical and parole history and completed a “Personal Details Form”.12    On 19 October 2015 Mr Parker was interviewed by a Departmental officer.  The stated purpose of the interview was to give him an opportunity to make known any personal or other issues he wished the decision-maker to take into account.  But the interviewer also questioned him about the circumstances leading to the 2014 conviction and various other matters touching on the prospect that he might reoffend.  The first question was in these terms:You previously underwent a character assessment on account of your substantial criminal record and the department notified you on 3 February 2014 of the decision not to cancel your visa.  However, you were also formally warned, in writing, about the consequences of further offending, in terms of your migration status, which you acknowledged, in writing, on 7 March 2014.  Less than three months later you re-offended, resulting in this current character assessment.  Can you describe the circumstances of your offending on 23 May 2014 that led to the conviction of Possess Or Use A Prohibited Weapon Without Permit on 19 June 2014?13    Mr Parker’s answer was:“I was still a member of the Comanchero’s then and that is why I was pulled over by the police that led to the conviction. The police were pulling everyone over on the street.  The vehicle I was in was Ritta’s [Spouse] and she had a peppers spray in the car.  I got it for her for protection but I didn’t tell the police that it was hers because I didn’t want to get her into trouble.  I realise that was wrong.  I told the police it was mine.  They charged me and they gave me the option there and then to take an early guilty plea.  They said I would not need to attend court and I would be issued with a fine and so I did.  They confiscated the spray as well.  There was no intention for me to use the spray as it was for Ritta’s protection and I had forgotten it was even in the car.”(Italics in original.)14    The decision to cancel Mr Parker’s visa was made by the Minister personally on 2 March 2016.  I was informed that he has been held in detention since 11 March 2016 (this also being the date he acknowledged receipt of the Minister’s decision).15    A month after the Minister made his decision, however, Mr Parker applied to have the 2014 conviction annulled and on 13 April 2016 a Local Court magistrate granted Mr Parker’s application, whereupon he entered a plea of not guilty and is awaiting trial.  16    Mr Parker now applies, amongst other things, to have the Minister’s decision quashed.  Section 477A of the Migration Act, however, provides that any application to this Court be filed within 35 days from the date the decision was made.  This application was filed five days after the period had lapsed.  So in order to proceed, Mr Parker required an extension of time.  On 6 June 2016 I granted him an extension. The Minister’s decision17    In deciding that Mr Parker did not pass the character test the Minister relied on the three sentences of 13 months of imprisonment imposed on 24 September 2010.18    The Minister then proceeded to consider whether to exercise his discretion to cancel the visa.  To that end he had regard to Mr Parker’s criminal history, including his 2014 conviction.  He assessed the risk Mr Parker would be to the Australian community, balancing a number of factors he considered afforded evidence of Mr Parker’s rehabilitation against his history of repeated offending.  On that issue, the Minister said (at [50]–[51]):50.    On the other hand, in considering whether Mr PARKER is likely to re-offend, I note his history of repeat offences in Australia, which has spanned a number of years despite the imposition of various penalties including fines, custodial sentences and disrespected judicial orders. Mr PARKER received a formal warning from the department about the visa consequences of re-offending which he acknowledged in writing. This warning did not deter him from re-offending and he was convicted of another offence some three months later.51.    Having regard to his criminal record, I consider that there remains an ongoing likelihood of Mr PARKER re-offending. This likelihood is increased as he continues to be affiliated with a member of the Comanchero outlaw motorcycle criminal gang who, as he has acknowledged, introduced him to the criminal group in the first instance. If Mr PARKER re-offends in a similar manner, the harm to the Australian community would be high and may result in serious psychological and/or physical injuries to members of the Australian community.The grounds of the application19    By an amended originating application, filed on 14 June 2016, Mr Parker alleges that the Minister erred in two respects:  first, “by making a decision for which there is no jurisdiction and/or which took an irrelevant consideration into account due to the operation of section 501(10) of the Migration Act”; and secondly, because the decision was “so unreasonable that no reasonable person would have made it”.20    The basis for the allegation that the Minister had no jurisdiction to make his decision is that he took into account the 2014 conviction which was subsequently annulled.  The basis for the allegation that the decision was so unreasonable that no reasonable person would have made it is the Minister’s failure to have regard to the possibility that Mr Parker might make a successful application to annul the conviction. 21    It is not in dispute that Mr Parker did not pass the character test.  It is unarguable that Mr Parker has a “substantial criminal record” within the meaning of s 501(7) of the Migration Act, even if the conviction which was annulled is ignored.  The challenge to the Minister’s decision concerns the exercise of his discretion.Was the decision made without jurisdiction?  Did the Minister take into account a matter he was bound to disregard?22    Section 4 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) permits a person who has been convicted and sentenced in the Local Court to apply for an annulment of a conviction or sentence if the person did not appear before the court when the conviction or sentence was made or imposed.  The application must be made within two years of the conviction or sentence.23    Section 10(1) provides that: [o]n being annulled, a conviction or sentence ceases to have effect and any enforcement action previously taken is to be reversed. 24    Mr Parker submitted that, in considering the now-annulled 2014 conviction, the Minister took into account a matter that, by reason of s 501(10) of the Migration Act he was bound to disregard.  If the submission were correct, then there is no dispute that this would constitute a jurisdictional error.25    Without doubt, the Minister took into account the 2014 conviction.  He referred to it several times in his reasons.  In particular, he took it into account in considering the important question of whether Mr Parker was likely to reoffend.  But he was not bound to disregard it.  26    There are two problems with Mr Parker’s argument.  27    First, the conviction had not at that time been quashed or otherwise nullified.  28    Second, the Minister is only bound to disregard a conviction answering that description “for the purposes of the character test”.  It is abundantly clear from the Minister’s reasons that for those purposes he ignored the 2014 conviction.  He only took it into account once he was satisfied that Mr Parker did not pass the character test.  He did so for the purpose of deciding whether he should exercise his discretion to cancel the visa.  29    It seems odd that a conviction which has been quashed or otherwise nullified is not to be taken into account for the purposes of the character test but can be taken into account on the exercise of the discretion.  On the face of things, however, that is the course sanctioned by the Parliament.  Otherwise, the opening words of s 501(10) would be unnecessary.  In construing any statutory provision a court must strive to give meaning to every word in it:  Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [71].  Mr Parker’s contention was not supported by authority.  Indeed, a similar argument was propounded in Ngaronoa v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2007] FCA 1565 (“Ngaronoa”) and rejected.30    In Ngaronoa the Minister had cancelled a residency visa on character grounds.  In exercising his discretion to cancel the visa, he took into account certain matters going to three charges of which the visa holder had been acquitted.  Counsel for Mr Ngaronoa submitted that, in the exercise of his discretion, the Minister was precluded from considering matters upon which a visa holder has been acquitted.  The submission was rejected.  Jacobson J held at [56]:What must be borne in mind is that the present case is concerned with the exercise of the discretion, not the determination that Mr Ngaronoa failed to satisfy the character test.  Whilst it would not have been open to the Minister to determine that Mr Ngaronoa had a substantial criminal record on the basis of charges on which he was acquitted, that was not the question which fell for determination:  cf s 501(10).31    An appeal from this judgment was dismissed:  Ngaronoa v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 244 ALR 119; [2007] FCAFC 196.  32    Mr Parker also submitted that the 2014 conviction should not have been considered because of the terms of “ANNEX A” to Direction No. 65 — “Visa refusal and cancellation under s501 and revocation of a mandatory cancellation of a visa under s501CA” (“the Direction”), being a direction issued by the Minister under s 499 of the Act and, in particular, the following statement in Section 1, dealing with “[d]iscretionary visa cancellation or refusal”:(4)    In considering a person with unresolved criminal matters, decision-makers should note:a)    Where a person already fails the character test, any other outstanding criminal matters would not generally prevent consideration of their case under section 501;b)    A person who does not already fail the character test, and is the subject of criminal charges in Australia, which have not yet been finalised before the relevant court, would not generally be considered under section 501 until the charges have been finally determined; …33    Mr Parker relied on paragraph b).  34    This submission must also be rejected. 35    First, Mr Parker did not have “unresolved criminal matters” at the time of the decision.36    Secondly, he is not a person who did not already fail the character test.37    Thirdly, and in any event, the Direction does not bind the Minister personally “in any legal way”: Ngaronoa v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 244 ALR 119; [2007] FCAFC 196 at [16] (Bennett and Buchanan JJ).  38    There was no representation to the contrary, as Mr Parker suggested.  In its letter of 24 July 2015 the Department informed Mr Parker that “[i]f the decision-maker is a delegate of the minister, they must follow [the Direction]” but that “[i]f the minister makes a decision personally, he or she is not required to give consideration to [the Direction], though it provides a broad indication of the types of issues that he or she may take into account”.  39    Mr Parker further submitted that in every case where a visa holder is convicted in the Local Court the Minister is bound to inquire into how the conviction was entered and, where the conviction is entered in the absence of the accused, the Minister is not empowered to make a decision on whether or not to exercise his discretion to cancel the visa unless the statutory two-year period in which to apply for an annulment has lapsed.  He cited no authority for the proposition and I cannot accept it.  Quite apart from the absence of any express constraints on the exercise of the Minister’s discretion, there is nothing in the subject matter, scope and purpose of the legislation which would oblige him to wait for two years on the off-chance that the person might apply for an annulment.40    For these reasons, the first ground of appeal must fail.Was the decision so unreasonable that no reasonable person would have made it?41    Mr Parker contends that the Minister acted unreasonably in disregarding the “representation” that he would not reconsider whether or not to cancel his visa unless he re-offended when the basis for the Minister’s decision was the 2014 conviction which has been annulled “and/or where the Minister was aware that the Local Court had powers to annul the conviction”.  42    This contention must also be rejected.43    First, s 10 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act states that a conviction ceases to have effect “[o]n being annulled”.  Apart from the question of enforcement of convictions or sentences, it says nothing about the legality of administrative decisions made before annulment in reliance on a later-annulled conviction or sentence.  None of the authorities to which Mr Parker referred dealt with such a situation.  44    Secondly, the Minister did not renege on any representation, if that is an appropriate way to characterise the warning given in the 3 February 2014 letter.  Rather, he did precisely what the Department indicated he might do.  He reconsidered the question on the basis that he had learned that Mr Parker had been convicted of another offence.  That was true.  Mr Parker had been convicted.  The conviction had not then been annulled and, at the time, there was no indication that it might be.  What was unreasonable about that?  How was the Minister to know that it would later be annulled?45    Thirdly, there is no evidence to suggest that the Minister was aware that the Local Court had the power to annul the conviction.  Certainly, neither Mr Parker nor anyone on his behalf drew the matter to the Minister’s attention.  46    It can scarcely be unreasonable for the Minister to make a decision on the evidence before him.  Like any administrative decision-maker, the Minister was required to have regard to “the best and most current information available” at the time he made his decision:  Shi v Migration Agents Registration Authority (2008) 235 CLR 286 at [41].  In this case that included the 2014 conviction.  The Minister is not cast with the responsibility of making decisions based on hypothetical considerations.47    The position might have been different if, before the decision was made, Mr Parker had notified the Minister that he was proposing to apply to have the conviction annulled, but he did not.  Indeed, the obvious inference from the sequence of events is that Mr Parker only considered making the application while he was in immigration detention after he learned that his visa had been cancelled.  Conclusion48    Neither ground is made out.  The application should therefore be dismissed.  Costs should follow the event.I certify that the preceding forty-eight (48) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Katzmann.Associate:  Dated:    12 August 2016",2016-08-12 00:00:00,Federal Court of Australia

Note:    Entry of orders is dealt with in Rule 39.32 of the Federal Court Rules 2011.REASONS FOR JUDGMENTBROMWICH J:1    This is an application under s 476A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) for judicial review of a decision made by the respondent, the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection (the Minister), to cancel the applicant’s Class AH Subclass 101 Child visa on character grounds.  That class of visa allowed the applicant to remain in Australia indefinitely.  The decision was made under s 501(2) of the Migration Act.2    For the reasons that follow, the application must be dismissed with costs.Background3    On 18 December 2001, the applicant arrived in Australia with his family from Lebanon.  At that time he was 15 years old.  He has not left Australia since arriving and is now 29 years of age, turning 30 at the end of this year.4    The applicant and his family are of Palestinian origin.  He does not hold the citizenship of any country.  It is common ground that he is stateless.  A consequence of the visa cancellation decision is that so long as it stands and there is no other change in the applicant’s circumstances, he is likely to remain in immigration detention indefinitely.5    The Minister’s decision to cancel the applicant’s visa was based on him failing the “character test” by reason of having a “substantial criminal record”, as detailed below: see ss 501(2), 501(6)(a) and 501(7)(c) of the Migration Act.  The details below as to the offending are drawn from the remarks on sentence which were part of the material before the Minister.6    The prosecution case on sentence in the Sydney District Court for the offences giving rise to the applicant’s substantial criminal record was that in 2010 – 2011, the applicant was a member or associate of an outlaw motor cycle gang known as Notorious, which was in conflict with another such gang called the Comancheros.  However, the sentencing court was unable to be satisfied that the applicant was personally a member of Notorious, although it does not appear to be disputed that the applicant’s brother was a member of a different motorcycle gang.  7    In November 2010, the applicant was shot and seriously injured by people he believed to be associated with the Comancheros.  The applicant sustained a broken femur, and perforated bowel, which for some six months required the use of a colostomy bag.8    While the applicant was in hospital following the shooting, police recorded a conversation using an authorised listening device during which the applicant said that the person who shot him should have killed him and made a big mistake by not killing him.  9    On 21 February 2011, the applicant attempted a home invasion in company of one or two other persons.  He was armed with a 12-guage pump-action shotgun.  He had this in his possession for the purposes of intimidating the occupants of the house or causing them to fear physical violence.  It seems there were at least two other offenders with him, both of whom were armed, one with a pistol and the other with a knife.  10    At the time of the attempt, a woman and two children of unstated age were at the house.  The occupants were awakened by the noise and the son went to the front door and confronted the applicant who ran away.  The son followed the applicant through the courtyard and into the street.  The applicant then turned and pointed the shotgun in the direction of the house and discharged it twice, hitting the front wall of the house both times.  One of the gunshots hit the wall below the height of the son, missing him by about a metre.  The son is apparently the person referred to as the victim of the attempted home invasion.11    The applicant and his co-offenders then left the area in a car.  Apparently later the same day, police stopped a car driven by a co-offender and found the shotgun in the boot of that car with three unfired cartridges of the same brand as those found at the victim’s house.  The applicant was not authorised to be in possession of firearms.  12    On 28 March 2011, police executed search warrants at a storage unit rented in the name of someone else because the applicant did not have a licence.  Various firearms and related items were found that were linked to the applicant and resulted in charges against him as detailed below.13    On 3 May 2011, the applicant had a conversation with another person, which was lawfully recorded by police.  During that conversation the applicant admitted going to the victim’s house, admitted that he was armed with a shotgun, and recounted the events of the incident.  According to the facts tendered on sentence, the victim was a member of the Comancheros.14    On 30 June 2011, the applicant was arrested.  As was his right, he declined to be interviewed.  He was apparently in possession of some vials of testosterone at that time.  The applicant must have been in custody, bail refused, from the time of his arrest because his later jail sentence was backdated to 30 June 2011, rather than reduced to take into account broken periods in custody prior to sentence.15    On 24 July 2012, as his trial was about to begin, the applicant pleaded guilty to two offences in a first indictment for offences committed at the time of the attempted home invasion, being:(1)    a specially aggravated attempt to enter a dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence, namely intimidation – maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment and no standard non-parole period; and(2)    firing a firearm at a dwelling house with disregard for the safety of other persons – maximum penalty of 14 years’ imprisonment and no standard non-parole period.(A standard non-parole period is a legislative guidepost provided for some offences in NSW required to be considered in deciding what should be the minimum period of a sentence of imprisonment to be spent in custody, along with the maximum penalty and other considerations: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at 132 [27].)16    On sentence for the first offence in the first indictment above, the sentencing court took into account on a “Form 1” schedule an offence of damaging property, which on indictment had a maximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment.  Scheduling offences under s 32(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) is a means by which usually lesser offences can be finalised to the mutual benefit of the prosecution and defence, usually resulting in a longer sentence for the more serious offence on the indictment, but fewer convictions and no unresolved charges: see Attorney-General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 at 155 [18].17    On 21 August 2012, again as his trial was about to begin, the applicant pleaded guilty to two more offences on a second indictment, being the following offences committed on 28 March 2011, as a result of the police search warrant executed that day:(1)    possession of a self-loading rifle without the authority of a licence or permit – maximum penalty of 14 years’ imprisonment, standard non-parole period of three years; and(2)    possession of a pump-action shotgun without the authority of a licence or permit – maximum penalty of 14 years’ imprisonment, standard non-parole period of three years.18    On sentence for the second offence in the second indictment (possession of the shotgun), the court took into account 10 offences on a schedule.  Nine of the offences in the schedule also took place on 28 March 2011, being:(1)    three offences of not storing a firearm safely;(2)    four offences of possession of a prohibited weapon, namely silencers;(3)    one offence of possession of a .22 calibre firearm; and (4)    one offence of possession of ammunition (525 rounds of .22 calibre, 224 rounds of 9 mm, 37 boxes of .223 calibre, 38 boxes of 7.62 mm, a further box containing 20 rounds of 7.62 calibre and some other unspecified ammunition).  The remaining offence on the schedule took place on 30 June 2011, being possession of a prescribed restricted substance, namely testosterone, at the time of the arrest of the applicant.19    Because the applicant did not plead guilty until his trial was due to begin for each indictment, the reduction of his sentence for that reason was confined to a utilitarian discount of about 10 per cent.  The sentencing court was also satisfied that the applicant was genuinely remorseful and further reduced his sentences to reflect that remorse.20    The sentencing judge observed that the applicant did not have the benefit of prior good character due to a number of previous convictions.  The court was satisfied that the applicant’s reason for the attempted home invasion in February 2011 was to exact revenge as a consequence of being shot in November 2010.  The court was also satisfied that the attempted home invasion offence in February 2011 was premeditated.21    The sentencing judge also had evidence before him of the applicant having mental health issues and substance abuse issues, but was not satisfied that there was any causal connection between those issues and any of the offences.  His Honour considered the attempted home invasion offence carefully, taking into account that no one was physically hurt, but that offences like that had the capacity to engender fear in the individuals which can be long term in nature.22    The sentences imposed for the offences were structured in a way that involved a degree of consecutiveness and a degree of concurrency.  The precise breakdown of the sentences is not of significance, save to note that the shortest head sentence was two years and three months and the longest head sentence was three years and two months, the shortest non-parole period was 12 months and the longest non-parole period was 18 months.  The significance of this is that none of the sentences was less than 12 months, be it as a head sentence or non-parole period.  The overall head sentence was for four years and eight months with a non-parole period of two years and eight months, leaving a period on parole of two years if the applicant was released when eligible (as in fact happened).  The applicant therefore had a “substantial criminal record” as defined in s 501(7)(c) of the Migration Act both in respect of each of the four individual sentences imposed, and overall.23    The applicant’s period in prison commenced on 30 June 2011 and concluded when he was released on parole at the first opportunity on 28 February 2014.  (On 11 December 2014, well after the applicant’s release on parole, s 501(3A) of the Migration Act commenced, which now provides for mandatory cancellation for a person in the applicant’s position if still in custody at the time of the decision).24    On 21 January 2014, just over a month before the applicant’s release on parole, he was sent a letter by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, providing him with a notice of intention to consider cancellation of his visa.25    On 29 February 2016, two years after the applicant’s release on parole, his head sentence (and therefore parole period) expired.  A report from his parole officer indicated that he had been compliant with reporting and his response to supervision had been satisfactory.  His reporting frequency had been reduced by that time from fortnightly to six-weekly.  The applicant was not convicted of any further offences during his period on parole.  He had obtained full-time employment as a plumber.  He was assessed as having a medium to low risk of reoffending.26    On 3 March 2016, the Minister decided to cancel the applicant’s visa.  On 11 March 2016, after more than two years in the community on parole, the applicant was taken into immigration detention.27    The applicant has two children aged eight and nine.  Although he is separated from his former partner and the mother of his children, he has been in continuous contact with and periodically looked after his children over more than two years between the time of his release on parole and the time he returned to immigration detention.  The material before the Minister indicated that during the applicant’s time in correctional centres he spoke to his children daily and saw them frequently, even though he was located outside of Sydney for part of his sentence.  After release he continued to have daily contact with his children and spent his weekends with them.  He has remained in daily contact with them since being detained on 11 March 2016.28    The Minister was provided with a detailed submission by the Department for consideration of cancellation of the applicant’s visa under s 501(2) of the Migration Act.  The submission was 17 pages long and 117 paragraphs.  It was accompanied by some 34 attachments, many with further attachments, comprising 165 pages.  Included amongst the material were the following documents which have assumed some importance in the context of this application for judicial review:(a)    judgment of his Honour Judge Arnott on bail of 3 May 2012;(b)    remarks on sentence of his Honour Judge Sides of 11 February 2013;(c)    personal details forms completed by Mr Murad recording details of his contact with his children and health conditions; and(d)    letters written by Mr Murad, his ex-partner and his mother.29    As noted above, on 3 March 2016, the Minister decided to cancel the applicant’s visa.  The record of the decision signed by the Minster recorded the following:VISA CANCELLATION UNDER S501(2) OF MIGRATION ACT 1958 – DECISION BY THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATIONI have considered all relevant matters including an assessment of the character test as defined by s501(6) of the Migration Act 1958, and all evidence before me provided by, on behalf of, or in relation to Mr Saber Naser MURAD in connection with the possible cancellation of his Class AH, Subclass 101 Child Visa.…Cancellation outcome… I reasonably suspect that Mr MURAD does not pass the character test and Mr MURAD has not satisfied me that he passes the character test.  I have decided to exercise my discretion under s501(2) of the Migration Act to cancel Mr MURAD’s visa.  I hereby cancel Mr MURAD’s Class AH, Subclass 101 Child Visa.  My reasons for this decision are set out in the attached Statement of Reasons.30    The attached statement of reasons was just over five pages in length and ran to 55 paragraphs.  It will be necessary to return to some particular components of those reasons, but for present purposes it suffices to indicate that the Minister’s statement of reasons:(a)    set out the applicant’s convictions and then stated:9.    As a result of these sentences of imprisonment, Mr MURAD has a substantial criminal record.  I find that he does not pass the character test by virtue of s501(6)(a) of the Migration Act with reference to s501(7)(c) of the Migration Act and that he has not satisfied me that he passes the character test.(b)    addressed the exercise of discretion, having found that the applicant did not pass the character test, stating:10.    Having found that Mr MURAD does not pass the character test and having assessed the information set out in the Issues Paper and attachments, I considered whether to exercise my discretion to cancel Mr MURAD’s visa, taking into account factors that I considered weighed against and in favour of cancelling Mr MURAD’s visa.  In making my decision I was mindful that Australia has a sovereign right to determine whether non-citizens who are of character concern are allowed to remain in Australia.(c)    stated reasoning in relation to the issues of:(i)    criminal conduct;(ii)    risk to the Australian community;(iii)    best interests of minor children;(iv)    expectations of the Australian community;(v)    international non-refoulement obligations;(vi)    ties to Australia; and (vii)    health, followed by a conclusion outlining the ultimate reasons for cancellation.31    The application for review focuses on two aspects of the Minister’s decision, namely the consideration of the offences described above by which the applicant acquired a substantial criminal record, and the consideration given to the best interests of the applicant’s minor children.32    In relation to the issue of criminal conduct, the Minister’s reasons record the following:Criminal conduct11.    In making my decision I considered the Government’s commitment to protecting the Australian community from harm as a result of criminal activity by non-citizens.  I took into consideration that remaining in Australia is a privilege that Australia confers on non-citizens in the expectation they are, and have been law abiding.12.    In considering the nature and seriousness of Mr MURAD’s criminal offending I note that violent offences are viewed very seriously.13.    I had regard to the circumstances of Mr MURAD’s recent offending, as set out above, noting that the court sentenced Mr MURAD to a term of fifty six months imprisonment.14.    I find that the sentence Mr MURAD received is a further indication of the seriousness of the offending.  Dispositions involving incarceration of the offender are the last resort in the sentencing hierarchy and I have considered that the court viewed the offending as serious.15.    I considered the nature and seriousness of Mr MURAD’s criminal offending or other conduct to date, factors including the frequency of the offending, whether there is a trend of increasing seriousness and the cumulative effect of repeat offending.16.    I note that Mr MURAD has a long criminal history in Australia, punctuated with episodes of violence and disregard for the law.  I took into account Judge Sides statement of 11 February 2013, who was of the view that Mr MURAD does not have the benefit of prior good character.17.    Despite the Court’s measures of deterrence, Mr MURAD has continued to reoffend, incurring a range of convictions. In particular, I find Mr MURAD’s convictions associated with weapons are very serious offences.18.    I find that Mr MURAD has a long criminal history in Australia characterised mostly by dishonesty, drugs, driving, weapons and offences of violence, which have resulted in terms of imprisonment.19.    I have taken into account the offences that resulted in terms of detention or imprisonment, as a further indication of the seriousness of the offending. I have considered that the court viewed the offending as serious.20.    I have taken into consideration that, Mr MURAD’s repeated offending has had a cumulative effect on the Australian community.  Members of the community who were subjected to Mr MURAD’s offences against the person are likely to have suffered emotional harm, in addition to the physical harm. Community resources have also been expended on Mr MURAD on multiple occasions, including in relation to policing, court and prison resources.33    In relation to the best interests of minor children, the following paragraphs of the Minister’s reasons are relevant:Best interests of minor children26.    I gave primary consideration to the best interests of any children who are less than 18 years of age and whose best interests are affected by cancellation of Mr MURAD’s visa.27.    Mr MURAD states that he has two children, Mariah Murad and Aycer Murad, whom he has a close relationship with.  The children currently reside with their mother and Mr MURAD has care of the children on the weekend.28.    Given that MR MURAD continues to have an active role in the care and upbringing of the children, I find that it is in the best interests of Mariah Murad and Aycer Murad not to cancel Mr MURAD’s visa.29.    Taking this into consideration, I accept that Mr MURAD’s children would be emotionally affected by a visa cancellation and that this would deprive the children from having the opportunity to have close and direct personal contact with him.  Although, this would be limited to an extent as Mr MURAD does not have full time daily care or full time responsibility of the children.34    Under the heading “Ties to Australia”, along with references to the applicant’s age, migration, residential, work, family and social history and circumstances, the Minister’s reasons also stated:44.    I have considered the effect of visa cancellation upon Mr MURAD’s immediate family in Australia and accept that those persons would experience emotional hardship.  I have taken this into account and also recognised the effect of visa cancellation for his two minor children and family members in Australia.35    In the conclusion component of the statement of reasons, the Minister’s reasons contain the following paragraphs:49.    I considered all relevant matters including (1) an assessment against the character test as defined by s501(6) of the Migration Act, (2) Direction 65 and (3) all other evidence available to me, including evidence provided by, or on behalf of Mr MURAD.50.    I find that the Australian community could be exposed to great harm should Mr MURAD re-offend in a similar fashion. I could not rule out the possibility of further offending by Mr MURAD.  The Australian community should not tolerate any further risk of harm.51.    I found the above consideration outweighed the countervailing considerations in Mr MURAD’s case, including the best interests of his two children, his statelessness, the prospect of indefinite detention if his visa was cancelled and the impact on family members.  I have also considered the length of time Mr MURAD has made a positive contribution to the Australian community and or the consequences of my decision for minor children and other family members.52.    I am cognisant that where great harm could be inflicted on the Australian community even strong countervailing considerations are insufficient for me not to cancel the visa.  This is the case even applying a higher tolerance of risk of re-offending by Mr MURAD, than I otherwise would, because he has lived in Australia for most of his life.53.    I found the above consideration outweighed the countervailing considerations in Mr MURAD’s case, including the impact on family members.  I have also considered the length of time Mr MURAD has made a positive contribution to the Australian community and the consequences of my decision for family members.54.    In reaching my decision I concluded that Mr MURAD represents an unacceptable risk of harm to the Australian community and that the protection of the Australian community outweighed any countervailing considerations above.55.    Having given full consideration to all of these matters, I decided to exercise my discretion to cancel Mr MURAD’s Class AH Subclass 101 Child visa under s501(2) of the Migration Act.36    It was not argued or suggested other than that the Minster had, as stated, personally made the decision relying on the stated reasons but also relying upon all of the evidence that was before him.The relief sought and grounds37    The relief sought in an amended originating application is as follows:1.    An order in the nature of certiorari setting aside the purported decision of the respondent of 3 March 2016 to cancel the applicant’s Class AH Sub-Class 101 Child Visa (“the applicant’s visa”).2.    An order in the nature of prohibition or injunction restraining the respondent, the officers of his Department, delegates or agents from giving effect to the purported decision of 3 March 2016.3.    A declaration that the detention of the applicant is unlawful.4.    An order in the nature of habeas corpus releasing the applicant from detention by the respondent, his delegate or an officer as defined in the Migration Act 1958.5.    An order that the respondent pay the applicant’s costs.38    The grounds relied upon in support of the relief sought are as follows:1.    The Assistant Minister failed to afford procedural fairness to the applicant in that he did not notify the applicant that he would not treat the best interests of the applicant’s children as a primary consideration in the exercise of his discretion and did not provide him with the opportunity to present a case against such a course.2.    The Assistant Minister failed to give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to the best interests of the applicant’s children in that the Assistant Minister failed to take into account the following matters:a.    The nature and duration of the relationship between the child and the applicant;b.    The extent to which the applicant is likely to play a positive parental role in the future taking into account the length of time until his children turn 18;c.    Whether there are other persons who already perform a parental role; andd.    Known views of the child.3.    The Assistant Minister failed to consider or failed to give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to the offences in respect of which the applicant has a substantial criminal record under s. 501(7) of the Migration Act 1958 in that he did not consider:a.    The applicant’s pleas of guilty on 24 July and 21 August 2012;b.    The objective seriousness of the offences;c.    Genuine remorse; andd.    The reasons for the decision of the New South Wales State Parole Authority to grant the applicant parole on 28 February 2014.4.    The Assistant Minister misconstrued ss. 189, 196 and 198 of the Migration Act 1958 in that he found that as a stateless person the applicant would not be removed from Australia.5.    Sections 189 and/or 196 of the Migration Act 1958 do not permit the detention or continued detention of the applicant where he is stateless and will not be removed from Australia or it is not reasonably practicable to remove him for the foreseeable future.39    I address each of the above grounds in turn.Ground 1 – denial of procedural fairness40    The applicant’s counsel, who appeared pro bono for him, relied upon the seminal decision of the High Court in this area, Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh (1995) 183 CLR 273, especially at 291-2.  Reliance was also placed on a Full Court decision applying Teoh, Wan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 568; (2001) 107 FCR 133, especially at 142 [32], and two single Judge decisions applying Wan, Nweke v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2012] FCA 266; (2012) 126 ALD 501 especially at 507 [15] and [18] and Lesianawai v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2012] FCA 897; (2012) 131 ALD 27 especially at 33 [35] and 35 [45]. 41    The above authorities were submitted to establish the following, I think undeniable, propositions:(1)    if a decision-maker is making a migration decision affecting children, there is a legitimate expectation that their interests will be a primary consideration, and will not be treated otherwise without an opportunity to be heard: Teoh;(2)    a mere statement that primary consideration has been given to the best interests of a child does not mean that this is what has in fact happened, such that the reasons given may require closer and critical analysis: Lesianawai;(3)    where children may or will be affected, a decision-maker is required to identify what the best interests of any such affected child are and then assess whether that is outweighed by any other consideration, whether individually or in combination: Wan, as also applied in Lesianawai and Nweke; and(4)    if a decision-maker has not in fact treated the interests of affected children as a primary consideration, and has not given notice of that intended approach with an opportunity to be heard, that is a denial of procedural fairness.42    The question for determination on this ground was whether there was a departure from the above principles by the Minister in making the impugned decision to cancel the applicant’s visa, amounting to jurisdictional error by reason of denial of procedural fairness.43    The applicant asserts that the Minister did the opposite of what the Full Court in Wan held was required.  It was argued that the predominant consideration identified and relied upon by the Minister was the exposure of the Australian community to the risk of the applicant reoffending.  This, it was argued, was stated in the reasons to outweigh the countervailing considerations, including the best interests of the child, concluding at [52] of the Minister’s reasons that “where great harm could be inflicted by the Australian community even strong countervailing considerations are insufficient for me not to cancel the visa”.  44    The applicant argued that the Minister considered that harm to the community constituted not only a primary consideration, but the predominant consideration, against which the other considerations could be weighed.  This was said to constitute a failure to consider the interests of the children as a primary consideration, and consequently a failure to notify the applicant that this would not be so regarded in denial of a legitimate expectation that this would occur.45    Developed further in oral argument, counsel for the applicant noted that the Full Court in Wan had said (at 142 [32]) that “[p]rovided that the Tribunal did not treat any other consideration as inherently more significant than the best interests of [the appellant’s] children, it was entitled to conclude, after a proper consideration of the evidence and other material before it, that the strength of other considerations outweighed the best interests of the children”.  This meant that the decision-maker was required to identify what the best interests of the children were, and only then to assess whether the strength of any other consideration, or considerations taken together, outweighed the consideration of the best interests of the children.46    The substance of the case advanced for the applicant was that the Minister in this case had in fact treated the consideration of the risk of harm to the community as inherently more significant and had failed to identify the best interests of the children first before measuring them against any other considerations.  The core of the applicant’s case is that the primacy of the interests of the children must be unequivocal, not just a mere weighing of competing considerations.  It was submitted that notwithstanding formal words of primacy of the children’s interests at [26] of the reasons, at the point of decision in those reasons the Minister had not in fact treated the interests of the children as a primary consideration.47    In response, counsel for the Minister said that in considering all of the information before him, the Minister had weighed up the competing considerations, including the best interests of the children as a primary consideration, but had concluded that all considerations favouring not cancelling the visa were outweighed by those supporting that course, dominant among them being the possibility of harm to the Australian community flowing from even a low risk of reoffending.48    Counsel for the Minister submitted that Nweke and Lesianawai should be distinguished because in both of those cases the Minister had only given hypothetical consideration to the children in question being adversely affected, in each case referring to the effect of cancellation as being something that “may” not be in the best interests of the children.  That was not the situation here, where the Minister’s reasons expressly stated at [28], reproduced above at [33]:“Given that [the applicant] continues to have an active role in the care and upbringing of the children, I find that it is in the best interests of [the named children] not to cancel [the applicant’s] visa”.  It was submitted that this was an unequivocal acceptance by the Minister that not cancelling the applicant’s visa was in the best interests of his children.49    The reasons for the Minister’s decision identify only one consideration as a “primary” consideration, being the best interests of the applicant’s children.  Other considerations are listed, but none of them are described as “primary”.  The word “primary” is used only once, and relevantly not at the point of the weighing of competing considerations.  At that point of the Minister’s reasons ([49] – [56]), there is only a reference to the competing considerations, not their relative importance.  What is therefore required is a decision as to whether the Minister’s reasons sufficiently meet the requirement set out in Wan, or not.50    I have concluded that the reasons do sufficiently meet the process described, and required, by Wan.  At [26] – [29] of the reasons, under the heading “Best interests of minor children”, it is expressly stated that it is in the best interests of the children not to cancel the applicant’s visa because of his active role in their care and upbringing, and that cancellation would deprive them of the opportunity to have close and direct personal contact with him.  This meets the requirement identified in Wan of first identifying the best interests of the children, prior to carrying out the weighing exercise.  Moreover, at [44] of the reasons, reproduced at [34] above, further express recognition was given to the impact of visa cancellation on his children, albeit without any further reference to this being a primary consideration. 51    While it may have been clearer and better to repeat, at the point of weighing up the competing considerations, that the interests of the children were a primary consideration, I am unable to accept that this repetition was indispensable in the context of the Minister’s reasons as a whole.  There was nothing hypothetical or equivocal in the assessment of the children’s best interests in the Minister’s reasons at [26] – [29], cf Wan, Nweke and Lesianawai.  52    Importantly, none of the authorities require that the best interests of children be the only primary consideration, or the predominant consideration.  That could virtually entail such a consideration having to prevail, no matter what else was to be taken into account.  The legitimate expectation which grounds the obligation, as identified in Teoh, was to ensure that a first or primary matter to be taken into account in all migration decisions affecting a child would be the best interests of that child.  I consider that this requirement has been met, such that there could not have been a failure to give notice that the best interests of the children would not be a primary consideration.  53    This ground of review must therefore fail.Ground 2 – failure to give “proper, genuine and realistic consideration” to the best interests of the applicant’s children54    The argument advanced on behalf of the applicant was that even if the reasons for the Minister’s decision disclosed that the best interests of the applicant’s children had the form or appearance of being treated as a primary consideration, more was required.  It was argued that the consideration given to the best interests of the children of the applicant was required to be a practical reality, in the sense of being “proper, genuine and realistic”.  That phrase was apparently coined by Gummow J when a Judge of this Court in Khan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1987] FCA 457; (1987) 14 ALD 291 (referring to the full case report published in the electronic copy of the Administrative Law Decisions reports, rather than the extract case report contained in volume 14 of the paper publication).55    Whenever reliance is placed on the phrase from Khan of “proper, genuine and realistic” consideration, it is important to have regard to the factual and legal context in which it arose, namely an application under the wider regime of judicial review created by ss 5 and 6 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) (the ADJR Act).  The statutory ground of review under s 5(1)(e) of the ADJR Act was at the time Khan was decided (and is now) “an improper exercise of the power”.  That in turn was then, and is now, defined in s 5(2)(f) of the ADJR Act to include a reference to exercising “a discretionary power in accordance with a rule or policy, without regard to the merits of a particular case”: see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZJSS [2010] HCA 48; (2010) 243 CLR 164 at 174-5 [26].  It may be accepted that an obligation to consider the merits of the case at hand is likely be at least an implied jurisdictional requirement in most if not all administrative decision cases.  But that does not mean that Gummow J’s phrase, arrived at in the context of the above ADJR Act provisions, the statutory regime then existing when the decision under challenge was made and the facts of that case, can be readily applied in the same way as his Honour did in Khan in a different context.56    The Khan test may be useful in a general sense in helping to focus attention on the particular decision-making process under challenge, but just as the decision-maker cannot safely rely on formulas alone, nor can those who seek to overturn a decision.  The failure to consider something that was required, as a matter of the exercise of jurisdiction, to be taken into account must be identified with some precision if merits review is to be avoided.57    The applicant relied on several Full Court decisions dealing with the fact that perfunctory or formulaic references to what has been taken into account may not suffice, echoing Khan.  In Ayoub v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2015] FCAFC 83; (2015) 231 FCR 513, importantly a s 501 case, it was observed at 527-8 [46] – [47] that mere advertence to a matter required to be taken into account may be insufficient to establish that it has been properly considered; that ritualistic incantations, such as the serious or unacceptable nature of a risk, may not be sufficient to protect a decision; and that the reasons must be considered by reference to the facts in each case in a practical way, but not with “an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error” (relying on Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 271-2).  Applied to this case, the relevant question is whether it can be said that the reasons disclose that the Minister did not in fact treat the best interests of the applicant’s children as a primary consideration.  To my way of thinking, cases like Ayoub and the reasoning of their Honours referred to above provide a more useful way of approaching at least the adequacy of reasons for s 501 cancelation decisions than the Khan formula.58    It was a principled approach akin to that later suggested in Ayoub that led Jagot J in Nweke and Katzmann J in Lesianawai to conclude that the treatment of the best interests of the applicant’s children as a primary consideration had not occurred as required.  In both of those cases, the language used in the Minister’s reasons revealed the failure, because the best interests of the children were described in a way that was hypothetical, so as not to have in truth been considered as a primary consideration at all.  The stated reasons revealed a failure to take into account a consideration that could only be departed from with notice and an opportunity to be heard, which was not provided.  That in turn led to jurisdictional error by way of denial of procedural fairness.59    The applicant relied on four particulars listed above at [38], and repeated here for convenience, by which it was asserted the Minister failed to take into account and thereby failed to take into consideration the primary consideration of the best interests of the applicant’s children:(1)    the nature and duration of the relationship between the child [here children] and the applicant;(2)    the extent to which the applicant is likely to play a positive parental role in the future taking into account the length of time until his children turn 18;(3)    whether there are other persons who already perform a parental role; and(4)    the known views of the child.60    The above grounds were drawn from clauses 9.2(4)(a), (b), (e) and (f) of Direction no. 65 issued pursuant to s 499 of the Migration Act, which was before the Minister at the relevant time.  That Direction was binding on other decision-makers, but not binding on the Minister.  Direction no. 65 was provided to the applicant under cover of a letter from the Department dated 16 March 2015, which made it clear that while it was not binding on the Minister when making the decision in person, it provided a broad indication of the issues that may be taken into account.61    The problem with each of the above particulars to this ground is that it has at least the appearance of elevating certain matters that the Minister might have decided to take into account in deciding what was in the best interests of the applicant’s children into mandatory relevant considerations that he was bound to take into account.  Unlike decision-makers who were delegates, the Minister was not, as a matter of the exercise of jurisdiction, required to take into account or be bound by the terms of Direction no. 65.  I cannot see any warrant for finding such a requirement existed, nor even for the matters listed in the particulars to this ground, necessarily to be considered at all.  Unlike other decision-makers bound by Direction no. 65, there was no requirement at all, let alone a jurisdictional requirement, that the Minister reach the conclusion that he did that cancelling the applicant’s visa was not in the best interests of the children by any particular pathway or process of reasoning, or by reference to any particular intermediate considerations such as those particularised.62    Each of the numerous passages in the material before the Minister identified at the hearing by counsel for the applicant could be seen to be pertinent to the particulars he relied upon.  Each, in different ways, served to reinforce the nature, extent and importance to the applicant and his children of their continued contact, and in particular the importance of the applicant retaining his visa.  However, that conclusion, as opposed to the particular facts by which that conclusion might be reached, did not appear to be doubted by the Minister.  This was expressly acknowledged by way of the conclusion at [29] of the reasons that the “children would be emotionally affected by a visa cancellation and that this would deprive the children from having the opportunity to have close and direct personal contact with him”.63    In my view, with the greatest respect to counsel for the applicant, it has not been established that there was some fact or consideration penultimate to the consideration of the best interests of the applicant’s children that was not expressly referred to that the Minister was bound to address in his reasons.  For that reason, omission of any reference in the reasons to such considerations could not vitiate the decision.  64    This ground of review must therefore fail.Ground 3 – failure to consider or give “proper, genuine and realistic consideration” to the offences65    This ground, as developed at the hearing, was an issue of relevant, in the sense of mandatory, considerations.  The particulars to this ground reproduced above at [38] are again repeated for convenience and ease of reading, namely that the Minister failed to consider or failed to give “proper, genuine and realistic consideration” to the offences in respect of which the applicant has a substantial criminal record under s 501(7) of the Migration Act 1958, in that he did not consider:(1)    the applicant’s pleas of guilty on 24 July and 21 August 2012;(2)    the objective seriousness of the offences;(3)    genuine remorse; and(4)    the reasons for the decision of the New South Wales State Parole Authority to grant the applicant parole on 28 February 2014.66    As with the second ground, this third complaint is factually grounded in the absence of reference to the above listed matters in the Minister’s reasons.  However, this time reliance is placed on the reasoning of the plurality on this point in the judgment of Rangiah J in Moana v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2015] FCAFC 54; (2015) 230 FCR 367 at 378 [47] and following, with whom North J agreed at 368 [1], and Jessup J disagreed at 370 [7], albeit that it was agreed by all three Judges that the appeal by the visa applicant should be dismissed.67    Rangiah J in Moana at 378 [48] agreed with prior single Judge authority, referred to in greater detail below, to the effect that risk to the community is a matter that a decision-maker, including the Minister when making the decision personally, is bound to take into account in the exercise of discretion to cancel a visa on character grounds under s 501(2).  That was said to be so in the prior single Judge authority because such an assessment of risk was a necessary part of exercising the power for the purpose for which it had been conferred, namely protection of the Australian community.  The reasoning supporting that conclusion by Rangiah J appears to be, at least, that:(1)    under s 501(1), the Minister (in person or by delegate), may refuse to grant a visa to a person if the person does not satisfy the Minister that the person passes the “character test”, as defined in s 501(6);(2)    under s 501(2), the Minister (in person or by delegate) may cancel a visa that has been granted if:(a)    the Minister (or delegate) reasonably suspects that the visa holder does not pass the character test; and(b)    the visa holder does not satisfy the Minister (or delegate) that he or she does pass the character test;(3)    a person with a “substantial criminal record” as defined in s 501(7) does not pass the character test by reason of s 501(6)(a);(4)    it is implicit that the presence of someone in Australia with a substantial criminal record poses, or may pose, some risk of harm to the Australian community or a segment of it – the risk being that the person will reoffend;(5)    each of the criteria for determining whether a person does or does not pass the character test involves protection of the community in the sense of protection against some kind of harm, disadvantage, or unacceptable or undesirable consequence arising from allowing a person to enter or remain in Australia;(6)    the various other paragraphs of s 501(6) after (a) address various risks associated with reoffending; and(7)    therefore such risks are required to be taken into account as a relevant mandatory consideration to be derived from the text of s 501 in accordance with  Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39-40 and evaluated by the decision-maker in deciding whether or not to grant or cancel a visa under ss 501(1) or (2) respectively.68    In reaching that conclusion, Rangiah J followed the decision in Tanielu v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2014] FCA 673; (2014) 225 FCR 424, albeit by somewhat different reasoning as partially summarised above.  In Tanielu at 443-4 [87]-[88], 449 [118] and following, the Court rejected a submission made by the Minister in that case that the discretion in s 501 was unfettered in express terms and broad in scope, such that no mandatory considerations should be implied as conditions on the valid exercise of the power bestowed.  The Court relied upon Peko-Wallsend and subsequent authority on the topic to infer a mandatory consideration of risk to the Australian community.69    Many years earlier, the majority in the Full Court decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Huynh [2004] FCAFC 256; (2004) 139 FCR 505 held at 523 [74] that to construe s 501(2) to require consideration of factors such as the level of involvement of a visa holder in the offences in question would cut across the broad scope of the Minister’s discretion, which was able to be exercised by reference, for example, to the national interest, divorced from consideration of specific factors personal to the visa holder.  However, Huynh was not read by the Court in Tanielu as excluding taking into account risk to the community as a mandatory relevant consideration.70    Jessup J in dissent on this point in Moana at 370 [7] said that, contrary to the view expressed in Tanielu, Peko-Wallsend did not require consideration of whether implied restrictions applied to a discretion that was expressed in terms that were ostensibly unfettered.  Rather, his Honour considered Peko-Wallsend was authority for the more limited proposition that if a discretion was unconfined in terms, a Court cannot find that a particular matter must be taken into account unless an implication to that effect can be found in the subject matter, scope and purpose of the statute in question.  His Honour therefore considered, at 370 [9], that the power to cancel a visa under s 501(2) might be exercised taking into account no consideration other than that set out in the provision, namely that the Minister reasonably suspected that the visa holder did not pass the character test and did not satisfy the Minister that he or she did pass the character test.  His Honour concluded at 370-1 [10] that there was nothing in s 501(2) or elsewhere in the Migration Act that has the effect that the cancellation power may not be validly exercised unless the Minister takes into account the risk posed to the Australian community.71    In light of the Full Court decisions in NBMZ v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2014] FCAFC 38; (2014) 220 FCR 1 and NBNB v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2014] FCAFC 39; (2014) 220 FCR 44, both of which concluded that refusal of the grant of a visa under s 501(1) could not be made without regard to the legal consequences of the decision in each of those cases, it is perhaps too sweeping to suggest that in all cases consideration of a refusal or cancellation on character grounds need have regard only to the terms of s 501(1) or (2) respectively.  There may be particular legal consequences of a decision that must be considered in the particular circumstances of a given case.  72    Similar reasoning to that in NBMZ and NBNB was applied by the Full Court in Cotterill v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2016] FCAFC 61; (2016) 330 ALR 617.  In Cotterill it was found that there was a requirement in that case to take into account a practical, rather than legal, consequence of indefinite detention if a visa was cancelled (noting that the ALR headnote appears, incorrectly, to broaden the basis for the plurality’s decision beyond this single ground).  73    In my view, none of NBMZ, NBNB or Cotterill are authority for the proposition that the legal or practical consequences of a cancellation decision must always be considered, but rather that this may be required in a given case, depending on the circumstances, although I think it likely that the prospect of indefinite detention would always be of such importance that it is hard to see how consideration of such an outcome could avoid being required to be considered.74    Earlier this year, the Full Court in Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v Stretton [2016] FCAFC 11; (2016) 237 FCR 1, revisited the breadth of the Minister’s discretion to cancel a visa on character grounds under s 501(2) of the Migration Act.  Griffiths J, with whom Allsop CJ and Wigney J agreed, noted at 22 [64] that the discretion is substantially unfettered in that there is no express list of factors which the Minister is required to take into account in deciding whether or not to exercise the power.  However, that did not mean the power was without limitation.  At 22 [65] to 25 [71], Griffiths J identified a number of categories of limitation, which may be listed in a summary way as follows:(1)    the express preconditions in s 501(2) pertaining to the character test;(2)    an implied obligation not to act arbitrarily, capriciously or legally unreasonably [the last point repeated below – legal unreasonableness being the focus of the decision];(3)    considerations implied by the operation of the principles in Peko-Wallsend, such as the legal consequences of the cancellation decision [of the kind noted above];(4)    a presumption that Parliament intended the Minister’s discretion would be exercised reasonably in the limited legal sense discussed earlier in the decision;(5)    the Migration Act provides additional indicators which assist in evaluating a cancellation decision with a view to determining whether the decision is beyond the authority conferred upon the Minister and is unreasonable in the legal sense, with the following, non-exhaustive, indicators being identified as indicative of the broad nature of the discretion:(a)    the lack of any explicit list of considerations;(b)    the “national interest” object in s 4 of the Migration Act, being itself a broad concept informing many of the provisions in that Act involving a wide range of potentially relevant matters, some of which relate to the interests of the visa-holder and his or her family and others relate to broader community and policy issues;(c)    the fact that the discretion is conferred upon the Minister, who holds political office and is accountable to Parliament, coupled with the power under s 499 to make directions which are binding on delegates and then subject to merits review (whereas when the power is exercised personally by the Minister, it is without binding considerations and without merits review);(d)    the obligation on the Minister under s 501G(1)(e) to provide written reasons for a decision under s 501(2), enabling it to be ascertained, including by a judicial review court, whether there is an “evident and intelligible” justification for the decision (while remaining mindful of the constrained nature of such review); and(6)    the power to refuse to grant or to cancel a visa is a substantive power, to be contrasted with powers of a procedural nature which are more amenable to review (because they more readily give rise to questions of procedural fairness).75    The judgment of Griffiths J in Stretton, agreed with by Allsop CJ and Wigney J, suggests that, while Peko-Wallsend still has work to do in supporting limited inferred mandatory relevant considerations, the language and context of s 501(2) (and for that matter, s 501(1)), provides for higher level and overarching mandatory relevant considerations of the type identified in NBMZ, NBNB and Cotterill, such as any obvious or very likely significant legal or practical consequences for a visa holder in cancelling his or her visa.  Even the mandatory relevant consideration of treating the best interests of an affected child as a mandatory relevant consideration identified by the High Court in Teoh was drawn from the fact of Australia entering into a treaty, giving rise to a legitimate expectation.  76    All of those factors suggest that an inference cannot readily be drawn of a requirement to take into account in all cases specific considerations such as a risk to the community, especially in a case such as this in which the substantial criminal record basis for failing the character test was entirely met by the length of the sentences imposed and, per ss 501(6)(a) and 501(7)(c), required on their face no risk assessment at all (cf eg, s 501(6)(d)).77    In Ayoub at 524 [36] to 525 [41], the Full Court expressed doubt about the correctness of the decision in Moana on this issue, although it was elsewhere accepted that their Honours were  correct in holding that the evaluation of the risk factor did not have to be carried out in a particular way (at 527 [44]).  Their Honours in Ayoub at 525 [37] noted that it may be difficult to conclude that an exercise of the power to cancel a visa by reason of a “substantial criminal record” within the meaning of s 501(6)(a) is subject to an implicit constraint expressly provided for in s 501(6)(d), being a provision not relied upon by the Minister in that case, or in this case.78    The foregoing casts doubt on the correctness of the reasoning of the majority in Moana on this point.  Without the majority decision to the contrary on this point in Moana, I would agree with Jessup J in that case that there is insufficient basis for inferring, by Peko-Wallsend reasoning, an obligation to take into account risk to the community in making, as relevant here, a cancellation decision on character grounds.  One needs to go no further than the circumstances of this case to see why that is so.  In this case, the applicant failed the character test by reference to no more than the duration of each of his four sentences, each of which was equal to or above the threshold of 12 months imprisonment in s 501(7).  The threshold test in s 501(6)(a) was therefore met without any regard to the risk factors expressly referred to in s 501(6)(d), or even any risk factors that might be inferred in relation to any of the matters listed in s 501(6)(aa) and following, noting that each paragraph is separated by a disjunctive “or” so as to operate independently and not collectively.79    In the circumstances of this case, without the binding authority of Moana, I would conclude that the Minister was entitled to rely on no more than the fact that the applicant had, undeniably, failed the character test, and indeed had done so by way of each of four separate offences.  Consideration of other matters, including risk to the Australian community, was certainly permitted, as in fact took place, but it was not required in the circumstances of this case.  I therefore cannot see why the power to cancel (or for that matter, refuse to grant) a visa in all cases requires consideration of risk to the Australian community, especially when the visa holder has a clearly established “substantial criminal record” for the purposes of s 501(6)(a) of the Migration Act.80    If the Minister had not in fact had regard to risk to the community, I would have been bound to follow the majority decision in Moana and conclude that this was a jurisdictional error.  However in this case there is no question but that the Minister did have regard to the risk to the community of the applicant reoffending.  The Minister’s reasons at [24] – [25] identify a low risk of reoffending, but that this was still a risk of significant harm, including serious physical injuries to a member of the Australian public, if offending of a similar kind was to happen again.  When the competing considerations were weighed and assessed, [50] of the Minister’s reasons recorded that as the possibility of further offending could not be ruled out, “[t]he Australian community should not tolerate any further risk of harm” and concluded at [52] that where “great harm could be inflicted on the Australian community even strong countervailing considerations [were] insufficient for me not to cancel the visa”.81    Even if, as it seems I am probably bound to conclude, the Minister was required to have regard to risk of harm to the community, following the reasoning in relation to the second ground, I am unable to accept that the pathway to reaching a conclusion on that inferred mandatory consideration is similarly prescribed.  That would entail taking the inference-drawing process identified in Peko-Wallsend to an entirely new and unprecedented level of detail.  It is one thing to say that a particular consideration must be taken into account; but it is quite another for the Court to presume to dictate what particular facts and circumstances must be had regard to in meeting that obligation.  82    I cannot see any basis for preferring the particular factors asserted by the applicant over other factors that might be relied upon.  In particular, I am unable to see why the Minister could not have regard to the (admittedly low) risk of reoffending and the possibly dire consequence if such reoffending was of the same kind as the attempted home invasion, which could result in serious injury to a member of the Australian community.  While this may be a hard and even merciless way to look at the equation of risk and consequences, it cannot be said that this was a reasoning process forbidden to be adopted.  It was a reasoning process and conclusion that was open to the Minister.Particulars83    In case I am wrong about the absence of the need to consider the offences further than was done in the reasons, I will separately refer to the particulars relied upon.84    The first of the particulars refers to the guilty pleas, which were not referred to in the Minister’s reasons.  In my view, the significance of not referring to the guilty pleas in the reasons should not be overstated, especially in the circumstances of this case.  First, the fact of the guilty pleas was before the Minister in the remarks on sentence.  Secondly, in aid of the conclusion that it was not of such importance to refer to them, each of those guilty pleas was only entered at the time of trial.  They attracted only a utilitarian discount for saving the time and expense of the trials proceeding.  Moreover, any plea that is entered says nothing about the character of the offences.  Rather, they are only relevant in any mandatory risk assessment process if they indicate an elevated, or reduced, risk of reoffending.  85    Given that it was accepted in the Minister’s reasons that the risk of reoffending was low, it is difficult to see what more a reference to the guilty pleas could have contributed to any different conclusion on risk.  Even if a risk assessment was required to be conducted, I am unable to accept that, on the facts of this case, reference to the guilty pleas was required to assess that risk.86    The second of the particulars refers to the objective seriousness of the offences, and takes issue with the reference in the reasons to the offences committed by the applicant being “very serious”.  Having regard to the maximum penalties, each of the offences committed was objectively serious.  In relation to the most serious offence relating to the attempted home invasion, the maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment made it inherently very serious indeed: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at 272 [30]-[31]; see also Stretton at 31 [100] per Wigney J.  87    While the sentencing judge was satisfied that the instance of offending was in the low range for an attempted home invasion, his Honour was not persuaded that it was at the bottom of that range.  A low range instance of offending in relation to a very serious offence remains serious.  It is a question of degree, as to which the Minister was entitled to form his own view.  Each of the offences was inherently serious, so that the particular instance of offending had to be assessed by the sentencing judge as to where it fell in the range of possible seriousness.  I am unable to accept that there was any error, let alone jurisdictional error, in the characterisation of the offences in the Minister’s reasons, or in the part they played in the risk assessment that was carried out.88    The third particular, concerning a lack of any reference to remorse has similar problems to the guilty plea particular.  This finding by the sentencing judge appears to have been reached without any express reliance on the fact of the guilty pleas, and without any specific identification of the reasons for reaching that conclusion.  In those circumstances it is difficult to see how that would have affected the low risk assessment that was made, let alone made it a jurisdictional error not to refer to it.89    The fourth particular concerning taking into account the reasons for granting parole, had they been obtained by the Department and put before the Minister, would perhaps have had some greater role to play in risk assessment.  Had there been any significant risk of reoffending it is reasonable to infer that parole would not have been granted at the earliest eligible date.  However, as with the other particulars, it is difficult to see how that would have made the assessment of a low risk of reoffending different.  It has not been suggested that the parole reasons, or indeed any of the other particulars sought to be relied upon, could have supported a conclusion of no risk at all.90    It follows that this ground of review must also fail.Ground 4 – misinterpretation of ss 189, 196 and 198 of the Migration Act91    This ground is based on the Minister’s reasons at [37] at which it was said:I have taken into account that while Mr MURAD will not be removed from Australia if his visa is cancelled, because he is stateless, he would face the prospect of indefinite immigration detention due to the operation of s189 and s196 of the Migration Act.92    The applicant contends that this paragraph reveals a misinterpretation of ss 189, 196 and 198 of the Migration Act, because, notwithstanding that he is stateless, it could not be said that he would not ever be removed because the obligation to remove under s 198(5) continues even if the circumstances for removal have not yet arisen (and may never arise).  It was said that taking this erroneous position into account was a jurisdictional error.93    The Minister submits that [37] of the reasons did not involve a question of statutory construction, but rather a statement of factual practicalities.  That is because, at the time of the Minister’s decision, there was (and still is) no prospect of the applicant being able to be returned to any other country because he is stateless.  That was why there was a reference to the “prospect” of indefinite immigration detention, a fact that the Minister was bound to take into account, per Cotterill referred to above.  Counsel for the Minister also submitted that the impugned paragraph should not be read too closely in order to find legal error, which I accept and find is particularly applicable to such a factually-based comment or conclusion.94    I agree with the Minister’s submissions on this point.  I do not consider that [37] was doing more than recording the practical reality of the applicant’s present predicament.  It follows that no misinterpretation was involved, and no jurisdictional error has taken place.  This ground of review must therefore fail.Ground 5 – ss 189 and 196, Migration Act do not permit continued detention95    The final ground is raised formally to provide a possible vehicle for revisiting the High Court’s decision in Al-Kateb v Godwin [2004] HCA 37; (2004) 219 CLR 562.  The applicant contends that ss 189 and 196 of the Migration Act should be read so as not to permit indefinite detention as a matter of statutory construction and in the absence of express statutory authority to detain indefinitely.  The applicant asserts that the dissenting conclusions of Gleeson CJ, and Gummow and Kirby JJ in Al-Kateb should be preferred, but necessarily accepts that I am bound by the majority decision to conclude that this ground must fail.Conclusion96    As all five grounds have failed, the amended originating application must be dismissed.  I can see no reason why costs should not follow the event.I certify that the preceding ninety-six (96) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Bromwich.Associate: Dated:    4 August 2016",2016-08-04 00:00:00,Federal Court of Australia

and(2)    the CFMEU contravened s 45D(1) of the CCA by engaging in certain conduct in concert with shop stewards at 12 construction sites in Melbourne – in summary, it is alleged that the CFMEU gave instructions to shop stewards and organisers not to allow Boral to supply concrete to construction sites and certain shop stewards implemented the ban against Boral at those sites (‘s 45D conduct’).3    This proceeding was commenced on 20 November 2014.4    Relevantly in relation to the April meeting conduct, it is alleged at [63]–[65] of the Replacement Statement of Claim filed on 13 February 2015 (the ‘Statement of Claim’) that:63.    On the morning of 23 April 2013, [Paul] Dalton telephoned [Shaun] Reardon and requested a meeting with him; and Reardon agreed to meet with Dalton and [Peter] Head.64.    At about 10am on 23 April 2013, Dalton and Head met with [John] Setka and Reardon at the Auction Rooms cafe in Errol Street, North Melbourne (April Meeting).65.    During the April Meeting:65.1    Setka, in the presence of Reardon, said to Dalton and Head words to the effect that:65.1.1    the CFMEU was “at war with Grocon”;65.1.2    the CFMEU wanted to cut off Grocon’s concrete supply;65.1.3    if Boral did not cooperate, the CFMEU would:(a)    target Boral’s concrete delivery trucks;(b)    target Boral’s concrete hatchers for membership;65.1.4    the  CFMEU would be prepared to facilitate Boral stopping supply to Grocon by blockading Boral’s plants.65.2    Reardon, in the presence of Setka, said to Dalton and Head words to the effect that:65.2.1    the CFMEU was going to focus on Boral;65.2.2    all Boral had to do was to stop supply for Grocon for two weeks(collectively, the April meeting conduct).65.3    Dalton said to Setka and Reardon words to the effect that Boral would continue to supply Grocon.5    Relevantly, in relation to the s 45D conduct, allegations still relied upon are to be found at [3]-[4], [52]-[53], [55], [57]-[62] and [72]-[209] of the Statement of Claim.6    Taking [57]-[60] as an example, allegations are made by reference to the individual respondents as follows:57.    On or about 14 February 2013, a CFMEU Shop Stewards' Meeting occurred at Trades Union Hall in Carlton, Victoria (February Trades Hall Meeting).58.    The February Trades Hall Meeting was:58.1    addressed by Setka;58.2    addressed by Reardon; and58.3    attended by about 200 CFMEU members comprising Shop Stewards and CFMEU organisers.59.    During the February Trades Hall Meeting:59.1    Setka said words to the effect that Boral was a “Grocon friendly supplier”; and59.2    the CFMEU gave an instruction to Shop Stewards and CFMEU organisers to not allow Boral to supply concrete to commercial construction sites in Metropolitan Melbourne (Ban Against Boral).Particularsa.    The Ban Against Boral instruction can be inferred from:i    the existence of the dispute with Grocon referred to in paragraph 52 above at the time;ii.    the fact that Setka said words to the effect alleged in paragraph 59.1 above;iii.    the fact that the CFMEU subsequently engaged in the conduct referred to in paragraph 61 below; andiv.    the fact that Shop Stewards and CFMEU organisers subsequently engaged in the conduct referred to in paragraphs 75.2, 76.2, 86.2, 97.2, 107.2, 119.2, 121.2, 131.3, 132.2, 142.2, 142.4, 152.3, 163.2, 173.2, 173.3, 174.2, 184.2, 196 and 197 below.60.    At all material times following the February Trades Hall Meeting:60.1    the CFMEU intended and expected that Shop Stewards and CFMEU organisers should implement the Ban Against Boral until further notice; and60.2    Shop Stewards and CFMEU organisers understood that they should implement the Ban Against Boral until further notice.Particulars a.    The above matters can be inferred from:i.    the matters referred to in paragraphs 58 to 59 above;ii.    if a Shop Steward did not follow instructions given by the CFMEU, the Divisional Branch Management Committee could remove the endorsement of that Shop Steward;iii.    Shop Stewards understood that once decisions were announced at CFMEU Shop Stewards’ Meetings, the CFMEU expected that all Shop Stewards would act consistently with those decisions;iv.    the fact that Shop Stewards and CFMEU organisers subsequently engaged in the conduct referred to in paragraphs 75.2, 76.2, 86.2, 97.2, 107.2, 119.2, 121.2, 131.3, 132.2, 142.2, 142.4, 152.3, 163.2, 173.2, 173.3, 174.2, 184.2, 196 and 197 below.7    In the originating application various declarations are sought based upon the grounds stated in the Statement of Claim.  No declaration is sought by reference to the individual respondents in relation to the s 45D conduct.  8    So for instance, in relation to the Deer Park conduct, a declaration is sought as follows:Deer Park Conduct3.    A declaration that, by:3.1    the CFMEU's introduction of the Ban Against Boral in circumstances where at all material times thereafter:3.1.1    the CFMEU intended and expected that Shop Stewards and CFMEU organisers should implement the Ban Against Boral until further notice; and3.1.2    Shop Stewards and CFMEU organisers understood that they should implement the Ban Against Boral until further notice; and3.2    Shop Steward Travers informing Anglo Italian that:3.2.    it should not have been using Boral; and3.2.2    the CFMEU was not happy for Anglo Italian to use Boral at the Deer Park Site,the CFMEU engaged in conduct in concert with Shop Steward Travers that hindered or prevented the acquisition of concrete by Anglo Italian from Boral Resources for the purpose, and would have had or would be likely to have had the effect, of causing substantial loss or damage to the business of Boral in contravention of section 45D(1) of the Act.The criminal proceeding9    On 6 December 2015, the individual respondents were charged with one count of blackmail contrary to s 87 of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic).  The charge-sheet alleges that the accused, at North Melbourne in the State of Victoria, on Tuesday 23 April 2013, with an intent to cause a loss to another, made an unwarranted demand with menaces of Mr Dalton and Mr Head.  The meeting referred to in the charge-sheet is the same meeting which is the subject of the April meeting conduct in this proceeding.  Undoubtedly, evidence will be led by the prosecutor of various matters other than the events of 23 April 2013 to prove the necessary element of intent.Stay already made in civil proceeding10    By consent order made on 3 February 2016, the Court ordered that the part of the proceeding for the relief sought in respect of the April meeting conduct be stayed until further order.  This order broadly reflects the principle in s 225(2) of the ACL which provides:Proceedings for an order under section 224 against a person in relation to a consumer protection breach are stayed if:(a)    criminal proceedings are started or have already been started against the person for an offence; and(b)    the offence is constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct alleged to constitute the consumer protection breach.The proceedings for the order may only be resumed if the person is not convicted of the offence. Otherwise, the proceedings are dismissed.11    The consent order made on 3 February 2016 had the effect that the ACCC’s case against the individual respondents in the proceeding is now stayed.  The balance of the ACCC’s case in the proceeding that is not stayed by that consent order is the s 45D conduct, which is only brought against the CFMEU.12    The trial of this proceeding was initially listed to commence on 21 September 2015 with an estimated duration of six weeks.  On the application of the respondents, the trial date was vacated and relisted, firstly for 10 November 2015 and then for 1 March 2016.  On 3 February 2016, the trial date was again relisted to 26 September 2016 on an estimated duration of six weeks.13    Since 30 June 2015, the ACCC has filed and served 23 outlines of evidence and the respondents have filed and served six outlines of evidence.  Only two of the ACCC’s outlines deal with the April meeting conduct – being the outlines of Mr Dalton and Mr Head of Boral who attended the April meeting with the individual respondents.  The balance of the ACCC’s outlines concern the s 45D conduct.  The respondents’ outlines of evidence do not include outlines from any employee or officer of the CFMEU, or from Mr Setka or Mr Reardon.  This does not mean they may not be called to give evidence by the CFMEU.14    All the respondents now seek a stay of the remainder of the proceeding against the CFMEU.  The stay is sought on two grounds:(1)    that the Court should not make declarations of contravention in respect of issues that are to be determined in the criminal jurisdiction of the County Court or Supreme Court of Victoria, unless the failure to do so would result in irreparable injury, in accordance with the principles set out in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v HLP Financial Planning (Aust) Pty Ltd (2007) 164 FCR 487 (‘HLP’); and(2)    that the balancing of justice between the parties favours a stay of the civil proceedings, in accordance with the principles set out in McMahon v Gould (1982) 7 ACLR 202 (‘McMahon’).15    The respondents also seek to have the hearing listed for 26 September 2016 adjourned, relying on general case management principles, to which I will return.SERVICE OF HAND-UP BRIEF IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDING16    It is necessary to describe the criminal proceeding.  The hand-up brief in the criminal proceeding was served on the individual respondents on 2 February 2016.17    The Prosecution’s Statement of Material Facts Relevant to the Charge (‘Prosecution Summary’) in the criminal proceeding, when compared with the Statement of Claim in the civil proceeding, reveals that there is a very substantial overlap in the alleged facts that the ACCC will now rely on in the civil proceeding, and that the Prosecution will rely on in the criminal proceeding.

This would finish some four days before the committal hearing begins, although the ACCC considers that the estimate of six weeks for the remainder of the civil proceeding is perhaps generous.STAY AND ADJOURNMENT APPLICATIONIntroduction22    At a hearing of the stay application on 29 April 2016 (which was adjourned until 9 May 2016), I indicated to the parties that irrespective of any stay application, I was concerned about bifurcating the hearing of the proceeding concerning liability.  23    This concern arises because at the conclusion of the criminal proceeding (no matter what the outcome) the ACCC would or could seek to pursue its case against the CFMEU for the April meeting conduct.  Whilst this conduct is not the same as the s 45D conduct, they are inter-related contraventions.24    It seemed to me very undesirable to have effectively two separate hearings in these circumstances.  Similar considerations arose in Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Zhao (2015) 255 CLR 46 (‘Zhao’) where, of the two civil proceeding respondents, only one was subject to a criminal charge.  The High Court (at [48]) said (where the first respondent was not subject to a criminal charge):So far as concerns the first respondent, the Court of Appeal was correct to identify as relevant that to permit the forfeiture proceedings to proceed against her would produce two sets of proceedings, rather than one.  The principle of the common law that seeks to prevent a multiplicity of actions has a long history and cannot be ignored.(Footnotes omitted.) 25    In response to the Court’s indication, the ACCC has undertaken that it will permanently abandon its allegations of contraventions concerning the April meeting conduct against all respondents, so that the only civil proceeding that will continue will be against the CFMEU, and only in relation to s 45D conduct.26    This undertaking was conditional, as set out in a letter from the ACCC dated 3 May 2016 (the terms of which I do not need to recite).  However, the effect of the ACCC’s undertaking is that so long as the civil trial proceeds to hearing before the end of March 2017 without any stay being granted, and provided the individual respondents remain subject to criminal proceedings, I can now consider the merits of the stay application on the basis that there will only be one (liability) hearing, that hearing being in respect of s 45D conduct against the CFMEU solely.  27    In considering the stay application, I have proceeded on this basis.  28    I should mention the respondents did criticise the effectiveness of the ACCC’s undertaking, on the basis that the undertaking may not reflect the actual proceedings the ACCC would seek to bring in the future, depending on appeals and the hearing of the matter before the end of March 2017.29    However, I should deal with the stay application on the basis of the probability of future events as I see them, and on the basis of the known present position.  The content of the allegations against the respondents in the civil proceeding and in the criminal proceeding is set out in the Statement of Claim and the charge.  The extent of overlap is apparent.  Witness statements have been filed in this proceeding as mentioned above.  A trial in the civil proceeding has been set down, commencing on 26 September 2016, and was listed some time ago (in February 2016).  The parties have, or should have been preparing, on the basis the trial will proceed on that date.  The committal proceeding commences on 2 November 2016.  The respondents have known for some time of the committal date, as have their legal representatives.  The parties have known that the civil proceeding, to be heard on 26 September 2016, will not proceed against the individual respondents.  The parties now know that if the trial proceeds to hearing on 26 September 2016, there will only be one hearing on liability, at least on the assumption that the charges against the individual respondents are not withdrawn prior to that hearing.  No party suggested to me this was likely or “on the cards”, to use an expression used in a similar but different context.  We can expect that if committed, or directly presented, the criminal trial of the individual respondents will not occur until the end of 2017, but more likely the beginning of 2018.30    The respondents suggest that I should consider allowing time for any appeal process and a number of suggestions were raised as to appropriate courses of action to adopt to facilitate an orderly process for a hearing at a later date.  However, I do not consider that I should decide the question of a stay by trying to assess the likelihood of any appeal or the appeal process in this Court or in the High Court of Australia.  Any appeal court will consider the position it faces when the appeal is being heard, and assess the position in light of the circumstances that pertain at that time.31    The reality is that any stay would be for a potentially extensive period, and even if the Court tentatively listed the civil proceeding for some time next year, this may eventuate in another stay application.  If the Court simply adjourned the hearing on 26 September 2016, without making any other listing, awaiting more information of the date of the criminal trial, this would involve further substantial delay.  Nevertheless, I accept that if the respondents persuade me that the stay or adjournment is otherwise in the interests of justice and is needed to ensure a fair trial to all the respondents, both in this proceeding and in the criminal proceeding, then extensive delay in the hearing and determination of the civil proceeding may well be the price to pay.General observations32    Before going to the contentions of the parties, I make these general observations.33    First, as I have said, if the trial is to proceed in September and October 2016, then on the basis of the ACCC’s undertaking, the only liability hearing that will take place will be that currently scheduled to commence on 26 September 2016 and then only in relation to s 45D conduct allegedly undertaken by the CFMEU.  34    Secondly, whilst apparent, it is important to recall that the CFMEU itself is not subject to the criminal proceeding confronting the individual respondents.  Therefore, any principles of law concerning protection of the accused’s forensic advantages in not having to disclose his or her defence or approach to defending a criminal trial have no direct relevance to the CFMEU.  Therefore, for instance, the principle that an accused person cannot be required to assist in the discharge of the onus of proof the prosecutor always bears has no direct relevance to the CFMEU as it is not subject to criminal proceedings.  This is so even if one accepts at its highest the fundamental principle of the adversarial trial and its companion rule, as set out for example in Lee v R (2014) 308 ALR 252 at [32]–[33]:Our system of criminal justice reflects a balance struck between the power of the State to prosecute and the position of an individual who stands accused.  The principle of the common law is that the prosecution is to prove the guilt of an accused person.  This was accepted as fundamental in X7.  The principle is so fundamental that ""no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained"" albeit its application may be affected by a statute expressed clearly or in words of necessary intendment.  The privilege against self-incrimination may be lost, but the principle remains.  The principle is an aspect of the accusatorial nature of a criminal trial in our system of criminal justice .The companion rule to the fundamental principle is that an accused person cannot be required to testify.  The prosecution cannot compel a person charged with a crime to assist in the discharge of its onus of proof.  Recognising this, statute provides that an accused person is not competent to give evidence as a witness for the prosecution, a protection which cannot be waived.  (Footnotes omitted.)35    Thirdly, the concern of the individual respondents is that in the course of the civil trial, with the giving of evidence or with the conduct of the trial by the CFMEU, the individual respondents will be at risk of disclosing their defences or tactical position.  In this regard reliance was placed upon the comments of Kirby P in Yuill v Spedley Securities Ltd (in liq) (1992) 8 ACSR 272 at 274–5, and Hayne and Bell JJ in X7 v Australian Crime Commission (2013) 248 CLR 92 at [124]–[125].  In considering the individual respondents, the position needs to be addressed in circumstances where the individual respondents are going to give evidence, and in circumstances where they are not going to give evidence.  Both of these circumstances raise different considerations.36    Again assuming that only the CFMEU is being proceeded against in the civil proceeding, and at one liability hearing commencing on 26 September 2016, the Court has many mechanisms at its disposal to protect the interests of the individual respondents.  If either Mr Setka and Mr Reardon were to be called to give evidence, putting aside the powers of the Court to control its own proceedings and to control the manner and form of questions, protection is given under s 128 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) (‘Evidence Act’) where a witness objects to giving particular evidence, or evidence on a particular matter, on the ground of self-incrimination.  Depending on the circumstances, the individual respondents may not need to give the objected to evidence in any event (see s 128(3) of the Evidence Act), or if required to do so by the Court, are protected under s 128(7).  It may well be that at the trial the Court will not require the individual respondents to give evidence.  I accept that the protection under s 128(7) (if evidence is in fact given) will not prevent the provision of information about the individual respondents’ defence or evidence in the criminal trial, but the Court could prevent that information from reaching the prosecutor in the criminal proceeding.  This civil proceeding is brought by an independent Commonwealth regulator, not an emanation of the Crown.  The criminal proceeding is brought by the prosecutor in the State of Victoria.  Orders could be made suppressing specific evidence of the individual respondents until after the criminal trial so that the prosecuting authorities do not become aware of it.  I will return to comments made by the High Court in Zhao at [44] relating to the open court principle.  Of course, the principles of Harman v Secretary of State for the Home Department [1983] 1 AC 280 will apply to information obtained in the course of the civil proceeding that is not otherwise disclosed in open court.37    However, be this as it may, if the individual respondents do not give evidence, I do not accept that there is any real risk that the manner in which the CFMEU defends the alleged s 45D conduct is likely to otherwise disclose potential defences of the individual respondents so as to interfere with the administration of justice in the criminal proceeding.  Whilst the substantial overlap is apparent as described previously, the criminal charges and civil proceedings are quite different in nature and focus.  The CFMEU will only be responding to the allegations made against it in the civil proceedings.  The CFMEU is a corporate entity, and its controlling mind does not include the individual respondents.  The CFMEU will decide the manner in which it runs its defence of this proceeding in relation to the s 45D conduct.  I do not regard its decisions as being imputed to the individual respondents relevantly to disclosing their tactical approach or to defences they may seek to run in the criminal trial.38    In light of what I have said above, it seems very remote to assume that either the CFMEU or the individual respondents (even if they give evidence) will reveal to the prosecutor a potential defence (or tactical position) in the course of the civil proceeding against the CFMEU, being brought solely in relation to the s 45D conduct.  In any event, this Court has all the mechanisms at its disposal to prevent this from occurring, if in fact there is any revealing in the first place of such information during the course of the civil trial.  39    Fourthly, it is convenient to mention certain comments of the High Court in Zhao referred to and relied upon by the respondents.40    This was a case where proceedings were brought by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (the ‘Commissioner’) for the forfeiture of property of the respondents as proceeds of crime, at a time when charges were pending against the second respondent.  The offence and the circumstances pertaining to it which are relevant to the forfeiture proceedings were substantially identical to what was in issue in the criminal proceedings.  The second respondent’s defence of the criminal proceedings could have been affected if he was obliged to defend the forfeiture proceedings before his criminal trial was held.  The question before the court was whether the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria applied a correct approach in deciding that the forfeiture proceedings should be stayed pending the finalisation of the criminal proceedings.41    The facts were that the second respondent, Xing Jin, was charged with aiding and abetting another, one Mae Ja Kim, to deal with money or property that was the proceeds of crime contrary to the Criminal Code (Cth).  The substantive offence from which the proceeds were said to have been derived was living on the earnings of sex workers contrary to s 10 of the Sex Work Act 1994 (Vic).  The second respondent had been committed to stand trial for the offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime.  The first respondent, Qing Zhao, was the second respondent's wife.  She had not been charged with any offence, but was registered as the proprietor of a residential property which was the family home of the respondents and was a subject of the forfeiture proceedings.42    At [35] the Court (French CJ, Hayne, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ) said:The assumptions upon which the POC Act is founded in this regard are not novel. They are reflected in s 319, but a provision of this kind is strictly unnecessary. Courts will not grant a stay of civil proceedings merely because related charges have been brought against a person and criminal proceedings are pending. More is required. To warrant a stay of the forfeiture proceedings, it must be apparent that the person whose property is in question is at risk of prejudice in the conduct of his or her defence in the criminal trial.(Emphasis added.)43    At [39] the Court said:It may be accepted that forfeiture proceedings should not be unduly delayed. No litigation should be delayed except for good cause, especially criminal proceedings. On the other hand nothing in the POC Act or in the nature of forfeiture proceedings under the Act suggests that they must proceed at all costs. It could hardly be said, from any point of view, that they are more important than criminal proceedings and should be given priority.(Emphasis added.)44    Then, at [42] the Court said:The risk of prejudice to the second respondent if a stay is not granted in the forfeiture proceedings and the exclusion proceedings is plain. It is not necessary for the second respondent to say any more than he did on the application for a stay in order to identify that risk, given that the offences and the circumstances relevant to both proceedings are substantially identical.45    However, on this last aspect referred to at [42] of the High Court’s reasons, it is important to recall that there was affidavit evidence to which the Victorian Court of Appeal referred which set out in some detail the accused’s own position whether to go into evidence in the forfeiture proceedings.  The High Court was obviously aware of this evidence when it said the second respondent did not have to say ‘any more’.  No evidence is before me as to the position of the individual respondents, nor any indication as to whether Mr Setka or Mr Reardon would be giving evidence in any event.  The CFMEU, in its submissions, indicated that the individual respondents would seek to be excused from answering questions on the grounds of the privilege against self-incrimination.  Apparently, the individual respondents have indicated that they cannot give instructions in relation to any of the overlapping facts between the civil proceeding and criminal proceeding.  Significantly though, the CFMEU has not indicated whether it proposes to call either of the individual respondents to give evidence at the hearing to commence on 26 September 2016 in respect of s 45D conduct and the conduct of the CFMEU.  From the CFMEU’s point of view, it will need to make a decision whether to call the individual respondents, even against their will, or otherwise contest this proceeding without these witnesses.  Whether this is unfair to the CFMEU can only be determined in the course of the civil trial, taking into account many factors.  It may be that if the individual respondents are called, they may be required to give evidence under s 128(4) of the Evidence Act, and the CFMEU would then have the opportunity to put a contradictory version of the ACCC’s case directly through the evidence of the individual respondents.Legal principles46    I now turn to briefly outline some relevant legal principles.  I will resist the temptation to discuss whether or not any or some of these principles as outlined in the cases need re-considering by an appeal court. The parties before me agree that the principles, whilst providing assistance, are for guidance only and no case sets down an exhaustive list of relevant considerations.47    The Court’s power to grant a stay of the proceeding is an incident of its general power to control its own proceeding for which s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (‘Federal Court Act’) provides statutory support: see, eg, Websyte Corporation Pty Ltd v Alexander (No 2) [2012] FCA 562 (‘Websyte’) at [53] per (Dodds-Streeton J). 48    Whether to grant or refuse a stay requires the making of a discretionary balancing judgment.  It is an essential attribute of justice in a community that similar decisions should be given in similar cases.  The only way of achieving this is for the courts to set out the considerations which should guide the judges in the normal exercise of their discretion, and that is what has been done in the many cases where a discretion has been entrusted to the judiciary.49    The authorities dealing with an application for a stay of civil proceedings in which the subject matter is, or might be, the subject of a criminal proceeding, such as McMahon, ML v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2013) 276 FLR 1 (‘ML’) at [23]–[26], Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Craigside Company Ltd (2013) 93 ACSR 176 (‘Craigside’) at [15]–[25] and Websyte at [113]–[116], provide useful guidance as to the considerations to take into account in the exercise of the discretion. 50    The guidelines set out in McMahon (at [206]) were as follows:  (a)    Prima facie a plaintiff is entitled to have his action tried in the ordinary course of the procedure and business of the Court; (b)    It is a grave matter to interfere with this entitlement by a stay of proceedings, which requires justification on proper grounds;(c)    The burden is on the defendant in a civil action to show that it is just and convenient that the plaintiff's ordinary rights should be interfered with;(d)    Neither an accused nor the Crown are entitled as of right to have a civil proceeding stayed because of a pending or possible criminal proceeding;(e)    The Court's task is one of ‘the balancing of justice between the parties’;(f)    Each case must be judged on its own merits, and it would be wrong and undesirable to attempt to define in the abstract what are the relevant factors;(g)    One factor to take into account where there are pending or possible criminal proceedings is what is sometimes referred to as the accused's ‘right of silence’, and the reasons why that right, under the law as it stands, is a right of a defendant in a criminal proceeding;(h)    However, the so-called ‘right of silence’ does not extend to give such a defendant as a matter of right the same protection in contemporaneous civil proceedings.  The plaintiff in a civil action is not debarred from pursuing action in accordance with the normal rules merely because to do so would, or might, result in the defendant, if he wished to defend the action, having to disclose, in resisting an application for summary judgment, in the pleading of his defence, or by way of discovery or otherwise, what his defence is likely to be in the criminal proceeding;(i)    The Court should consider whether there is a real, and not merely notional danger of injustice in the criminal proceedings;(j)    In this regard, factors which may be relevant include:(i)    the possibility of publicity that might reach and influence jurors in the civil proceedings;(ii)    the proximity of the criminal hearing;(iii)    the possibility of miscarriage of justice e.g. by disclosure of a defence enabling the fabrication of evidence by prosecution witnesses, or interference with defence witnesses;(iv)    the burden on the defendant of preparing for both sets of proceedings concurrently;(v)    whether the defendant has already disclosed his defence to the allegations;(vi)    the conduct of the defendant, including his own prior invocation of civil process when it suited him;(k)    The effect on the plaintiff must also be considered and weighed against the effect on the defendant; and(l)    In an appropriate case the proceedings may be allowed to proceed to a certain stage, eg, setting down for trial, and then stayed.51    However, as I have alluded to, the matters that might individually, or in combination, be relevant to the exercise of the discretion are not rigid or closed.  The factors identified in the authorities, including McMahon, are a useful starting point.  They are not a prescriptive or exhaustive statement of all the considerations, or of the weight to be attached to them, and each case must be decided on its own merits: see, eg, ML at [31] and Websyte at [114]–[115].  As has been said on many occasions, the central consideration in determining whether to grant a stay is what the interests of justice require: see, eg, Websyte at [109].Parties’ contentions52    I now turn to the contentions of the parties, and to a specific consideration of them with the background of my earlier observations.53    Throughout the hearing for the stay application, it is fair to say the respondents refined their submissions, but did not abandon any of their written submissions.  It is appropriate I deal with each of the contentions of the respondent to the extent necessary.  54    The respondents relied upon HLP and various comments of Finkelstein J therein.  However, it is important to put that decision and his Honour’s comments in context, remembering also the CFMEU in this civil proceeding is not standing in the shoes of an accused facing a criminal trial.55    In HLP the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (‘ASIC’) sought a declaration that the second defendant, Mr Berlowitz, operated an illegal unregistered managed investment scheme contrary to the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (‘Corporations Act’), and that he carried on a financial services business without the requisite licence. ASIC also sought an injunction permanently restraining Mr Berlowitz from operating a financial services business or from seeking funds from investors in connection with the operation of an unregistered managed investment scheme.56    Counsel for ASIC informed the Court that also under consideration was whether Mr Berlowitz should be charged with criminal offences in relation to the same conduct in respect of which proceedings had been brought. In addition, the evidence that ASIC intended to rely upon in the civil proceeding included statements made by Mr Berlowitz during coercive examinations conducted under provisions under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth).  Those statements could not be tendered as evidence in the contemplated criminal proceeding. 57    In HLP Finkelstein J made the following observations at [58]-[59]:[58]    I would sum up the position as I see it as follows. The English and Australian authorities that warn of the dangers of a civil court becoming involved in criminal conduct continue to apply in an appropriate company case. The general rule in a company case is that a civil court will usually be the appropriate court to deal with a contravention of the Corporations Act. But the court should be wary of granting relief, including the grant of a declaration or an injunction, if the case is likely to end up before a criminal court. Ordinarily, a civil court should not intervene in those circumstances unless its failure to do so will result in irreparable injury. That strict rule need not be applied if the case involves undisputed facts and the issue raised gives rise to a question of pure law. Then a declaration can be a very useful remedy. As Barwick CJ said in Commonwealth v Sterling Nicholas Duty Free Pty Ltd (1972) 126 CLR 297 that is the kind of case “which contributes enormously to the utility of the jurisdiction.”[59]    The case at bar is a particularly good example of one in which the court should not interfere. First of all, a criminal prosecution is on the cards. Second, the facts are not agreed. On the contrary, if there is to be a trial, the Crown would be put to its proof on most issues and some of the “facts” to be asserted by the Crown are likely to be in contest. Third, there is potential for an adverse impact on the jury. The civil case will be decided on evidence that, for the most part, will not be available to the prosecutor in a criminal trial. Imagine what would happen if a jury discovers that a civil court has ruled that Mr Berlowitz’ conduct is illegal. The judge presiding over the criminal trial will be obliged to tell the jury to leave that out of account. It is axiomatic in our courts that jurors can be trusted to leave out of their consideration things that they are instructed to leave out. Yet many regard this kind of instruction as little more than wishful thinking. Perhaps the jurors will have explained to them that the judge who made the ruling acted on evidence not before the jury and that in any event a lower standard of proof was required in the civil court. Whether those instructions will result in a fair criminal trial may be strongly doubted. Last, but by no means least, is the falsification point made by Fryberg J which, if it occurs, will bring the law into disrepute.58    On the basis of the principles in HLP, the respondents submitted that the remainder of the present civil proceeding should be stayed against the CFMEU.  They contended this for the following reasons.59    The criminal proceeding against the individual respondents is not just ‘on the cards’ as before Finkelstein J, but have been commenced.  There is practically a complete overlap in the facts in issue in the civil and criminal proceedings.  Hence, the respondents submitted that in these circumstances, the hearing of the civil matter prior to the conclusion of the criminal matter will raise each of the issues that were considered problematic in HLP.60    Then it was submitted by the respondents that any adverse finding or conclusion of this Court in the civil matter would be likely to prejudice the criminal trial: if the jury in the criminal matter was aware or discovered that a Judge of the Federal Court of Australia had made factual findings in favour of the ACCC, and had ruled that a contravention had occurred, that jury would find it difficult not to take this into account, notwithstanding any directions from the trial judge in the criminal matter.61    In considering these submissions of the CFMEU, it is important to recall that the issue considered in HLP was whether the Court should make declarations against an individual respondent (Mr Berlowitz) that he had contravened s 601ED(5) of the Corporations Act as sought by ASIC, in circumstances where ASIC was still considering whether or not to seek to charge him with a criminal offence in respect of the same subject matter as the declarations sought by ASIC (at [15]–[17]).  This was the ‘real debate’ in the case before Finkelstein J.62    It can immediately be observed that the principle referred to in HLP (at [58]) has no direct application in this proceeding as the declaratory relief sought by the ACCC in respect of the s 45D conduct is to be made (if at all) in respect of the CFMEU, and not against the individual respondents.  As is apparent from the nature of the relief sought, the declarations the ACCC continues to press in respect of the s 45D conduct are sought against the CFMEU only and do not include any statement that the individual respondents committed any offence or engaged in any improper conduct.63    Further, whilst there is an overlap of the sub-stratum of facts, the elements of the criminal charge against the individual respondents are different to the elements of the alleged s 45D contraventions:(a)    section 45D requires that: (i)    a person (CFMEU) has engaged in conduct in concert with a second person (shop stewards) that hinders or prevents a third person (Boral customers) from acquiring goods or services from a fourth person (Boral); and (ii)    the conduct is engaged in for the purpose and would have or be likely to have the effect of causing substantial loss and damage to the business of the fourth person (Boral); and(b)    in contrast, the criminal charge of blackmail under s 87 of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) requires that a person (either or both of the individual respondents) makes an unwarranted demand with menaces to another person (Messrs Dalton and Head) with intent to cause loss to another (Grocon);64    Undoubtedly, the s 45D conduct overlaps with the conduct that may be the subject of evidence relating to the criminal charge in the sense that some of the elements of the s 45D conduct will be put forward by the prosecution as part of the circumstances surrounding the alleged criminal offence of blackmail.  However, the elements of the s 45D conduct could not determine the result of the criminal proceeding, without also recourse to what occurred at the April meeting and whether what occurred meets the elements of the alleged offence of blackmail.  Whilst the prosecutor will need to prove the requisite intent, this is in the context of the criminal charge, and not in the context of the s 45D conduct as prescribed by Commonwealth law.65    Accordingly, the relief sought by the ACCC in respect of the s 45D conduct, assuming it is granted, would not be falsified by any acquittal of the individual respondents in the criminal proceeding, and the granting of the relief could not supplant the function of the jury or the court in the criminal proceeding, as was one of the issues in HLP.  66    The other matter to observe is that the Court in HLP dealt with the issue of the making of declarations of contraventions in the face of criminal prosecutions in respect of the same matter, rather than an application for a stay.  I will return to this aspect of HLP, but note now that Finkelstein J, having effectively determined the case, decided not to make the declarations as requested.  His Honour said (at [60]):For the foregoing reasons I decline to entertain, on a final basis, the application for declaratory and injunctive relief against Mr Berlowitz. I am, however, prepared to stand the matter over until a final decision is taken as regards a criminal prosecution. If Mr Berlowitz is to be charged I would dismiss this proceeding against him and leave it to the criminal court to decide his fate. On the other hand, if the decision is made not to lay charges, this case can be brought back on.67    I will return to the issue raised by Finkelstein J as to instructions to the jury and the jury’s ability to discard irrelevant material.  As Finkelstein J observed, it seems axiomatic that jurors can be trusted to leave out of their consideration things that they are instructed to leave out.  Whether this is ‘wishful thinking’ or not, I do not know.  Instructions to this effect in criminal trials are frequently given by judges.  However, I should proceed on the basis that these instructions are not given without good cause, and are given in the anticipation that they will be acted upon by the jurors.  Of course, there may be instances where an instruction to disregard irrelevant material will not be given, where the Court considers (for example, in well publicised cases) that any such instruction will have no real practical effect and so would be of no practical utility.68    The respondents also seek a stay based on the application of the McMahon guidelines.  69    Again, it should be observed that the McMahon line of authority is not directly applicable to this stay application.  The CFMEU has not been charged with a criminal offence, the ACCC’s case in respect of the conduct the subject of the criminal proceeding against the individual respondents is already stayed, and the balance of this proceeding (which is the subject of the respondents’ application for a stay) is against the CFMEU and in relation to s 45D conduct only.70    Nonetheless, I accept that the principles underlying the McMahon guidelines do provide relevant assistance to the exercise of the discretion in this proceeding.  71    For the sake of completeness, as to how those guidelines may incorporate the ‘principles’ laid down in HLP, I note this was discussed in Craigside.  72    In Craigside, ASIC commenced a proceeding against a company and two of its directors.  The directors sought a stay of the proceeding until ASIC decided whether it would prosecute them in respect of the same subject matter, and if so, until the final determination of the prosecutions.  The directors submitted that there was an inconsistency between the McMahon line of authority and the approach of Finkelstein J in HLP: see Craigside (at [11]).  Justice Jagot noted (at [13]) that HLP did not deal with an application for a stay but held that the analysis nonetheless involved:consideration of the underlying principles of the potential problems of hearing and determining civil proceedings when the subject matter of the civil proceedings is or may be the subject of criminal proceedings. Her Honour then proceeded (at [19]–[20]) to decide the application by reference to the McMahon principles.73    At the outset in their written submissions, the respondents noted two important matters in relation to the McMahon principles.First, the McMahon principles were developed in the context of civil proceedings brought by private plaintiffs, where the protection and preservation of the rights of private plaintiffs were emphasised.  The principles derived from these authorities are not well formulated to deal with proceedings brought by an emanation of the State, being the ACCC, as opposed to a private individual  seeking private redress  for a private wrong.  Where the proceeding is brought by the State, there is no private right to be protected or preserved.  Rather the proceedings are brought in the public interest.  However where two different State entities bring public interest proceedings, there is a potential for abuse of process.  Recently, judges in the Federal and  State  Courts  have  been  alive  to  this  issue.  In Wide Bay Conservation Council Inc v Burnett Water Pty Ltd Logan J, in the application of the McMahon principles, observed that:What is required is a balancing of the interests of the applicant and respondent in a civil proceeding having regard to any statutory context relevant to that civil proceeding and to any impending or prospective criminal proceeding. A separate but not unrelated consideration is whether the civil proceeding or at least its then prosecution might be regarded as an abuse of the process of the court. Such considerations will especially loom where the applicant in a civil proceeding is an emanation of the Crown and seeks declaratory relief and the imposition of pecuniary penalties in circumstances where a respondent is or is in jeopardy of facing criminal proceedings in respect of substantially the same conduct. I note that such a prospect particularly influenced Robson J [in Re AWE (No 1) (2008) 21 VR 252] in his suggestion that McMahon v Gould may need to be reconsidered by an appellate court. (emphasis added)The respondents therefore submit that the McMahon principles may not be an appropriate set of guidelines to apply in civil proceedings brought by a federal regulator, or, alternatively, that the fact that no individual rights are prejudiced by the stay of the proceedings should be given significant weight in the balancing process of determining whether a stay should be granted.Second, if the McMahon principles do apply, the respondents submit that they fail to give sufficient recognition to the right to silence and the accusatorial system of criminal law.  As stated by Robson J in AWB:the right of silence should not only be recognised but protected by the courts by preventing a defendant from being effectively compelled to waive his right of silence and thereby help those who seek to prove an offence by requiring him to defend civil actions relating to the same or similar conduct the subject of existing or potential criminal proceedings before those civil proceedings are completed. Compelling the defendant to defend civil proceedings, particularly those which impose a penalty, may assist the Crown in its prosecution by putting the Crown onto a train of inquiry or enable it to adjust its case to meet the anticipated defence in advance. It might be thought that such a circumstance denies the defendant his or her basic common law right to have the Crown establish its case against him or her without any assistance from the defendant.    (Emphasis in original. Footnotes omitted.)74    The respondents then submitted that the balancing of justice between the parties requires a stay of the civil proceedings against the CFMEU.  They put the following reasons for applying the McMahon guidelines:(1)    There is no individual plaintiff whose private right to bring the proceeding will be interfered with;(2)    The CFMEU will be exposed to real prejudice in the civil proceeding if the civil proceeding against it is not stayed.  This is because the individual respondents have indicated that they cannot give instructions in relation to any of the overlapping facts between the civil and criminal proceedings.  The respondents instruct that, were the CFMEU to seek to call the individual respondents to give evidence regarding the alleged November 2012 phone call, the alleged CFMEU meetings at Trades Hall in February and March 2013, the Auction Rooms meeting,  or in relation to other alleged dealings with CFMEU stewards on the relevant sites or with other relevant CFMEU or non-CFMEU persons, both individual respondents would seek to be excused from answering on the grounds of the privilege against self-incrimination.  Without the ability to contradict the ACCC’s case regarding the alleged November 2012 phone call, the alleged CFMEU meetings at Trades Hall in February and March 2013, or the Auction Rooms meeting, the capacity for the CFMEU to defend the proceedings is severely compromised, because the CFMEU will be hampered in or unable to cross-examine the ACCC’s witnesses, or put a contradictory version of the ACCC’s case on these matters.  It was submitted that to the extent that this is considered a consequence of a strategic choice made by the individual respondents, it fails to give proper weight to their right to silence;(3)    The individual respondents will also be prejudiced in the criminal proceeding if the civil proceeding is not stayed.  There is a real risk that the jury will become aware of the evidence, findings or orders in the civil proceeding and that they will be unable to put this information out of their mind in coming to a verdict in the criminal proceeding, regardless of any judicial direction to ignore such evidence, findings or orders;(4)    If the civil proceeding is not stayed against the CFMEU, there will be a burden on the individual respondents insofar as they are required to prepare for the civil and criminal proceedings concurrently.  Although the civil proceeding has been stayed against them in respect of the declarations and pecuniary penalties sought against them as individuals, they are still required to provide instructions in the matter on behalf of the CFMEU;(5)    The ACCC will suffer no great prejudice by reason of the delay occasioned by a stay, as the evidence in this matter has been prepared and witness outlines have been filed.75    Finally, the respondents submitted that the open court principle weighs in favour of a stay, rather than proceeding in a closed court and subsequent suppression orders.  They rely on an observation of the High Court in Zhao (at [44]):The Commissioner suggests that protective orders could be made, which might maintain the confidentiality of evidence, and that evidence could be given in closed court. In the latter regard, the open court principle, to which the law adheres, now finds expression in s 28 of the Open Courts Act 2013 (Vic). The rationale of the open court principle is that court proceedings should be subjected to public and professional scrutiny, and courts will not act contrary to the principle save in exceptional circumstances. Closing the court so that the Commissioner might progress forfeiture proceedings and receive the second respondent’s evidence does not qualify as a proper reason for departing from the principle.(Footnote omitted.)76    I now turn to consider each of the relevant considerations raised by the parties for determination of the stay application brought by the respondents.  Some aspects have been alluded to previously in my general observations.  77    The fact there is no individual plaintiff seeking to vindicate a private right is of no real significance.  There are other relevant considerations to be weighed up in favour of a regulator which brings civil penalty proceedings.   78    A regulator, like any other applicant, is entitled to have the action tried in the ordinary course of the procedure and business of the Court.  The same principle of the balancing of justice between the parties applies, which will of course place appropriate weight on the interest of a respondent.  Nevertheless, there is a burden on the respondent to persuade the Court to grant the stay.  How that burden is discharged will depend on the circumstances, including the rights of a respondent to a fair criminal trial that may be pending.79    Looking to the position of the ACCC, this proceeding is brought in the public interest, and should be heard and determined in the ordinary course of the business of the court.  As the High Court reminded us in Zhao (at [39]), no proceeding should be delayed except for good cause.  This is a proceeding brought by a regulator under Commonwealth legislation, pursuant to various statutory responsibilities placed upon it.  The regulator and the courts have functions to perform in the bringing and the determining of civil penalty proceedings.  The criminal proceeding is brought by a state prosecutorial authority in reliance on state legislation.  Whilst the context may be different in the weighing up of various factors, as I have said the issues remain the same in determining the question of a stay balancing the interests of justice between the parties.  Relevantly in this proceeding, this involves looking at the risk of prejudice to the respondents and the risk of prejudice to the regulator, having regard to its legislative responsibilities.  Just as a private litigant is entitled to pursue his or her litigation in the normal course, so should the regulator.  There also may be flow on consequences upon a regulator being successful against a respondent in civil penalty proceedings, including the impact a successful case may have on those affected directly by the allegations made by the regulator.80    I do not see the mere fact that there is a regulator on the one hand and a respondent who stands accused of a crime on the other as a separate factor to take into account, other than to the extent it impacts upon the content of the relevant prejudice a regulator may face if a stay is granted as opposed to the prejudice a private litigant may face.81    I then turn to consider matters relevant to all proceedings, whether brought by a private litigant or regulator.  The stay orders sought by the respondents in this application will likely effect a long delay in the hearing of the allegations concerning the s 45D conduct until the criminal proceeding against the individual respondents is determined (assuming they are committed for trial), and then, possibly longer if there are appeals.  I accept that if a stay is otherwise justified, the fact that a civil proceeding will be delayed for a long period of time may be the price to pay for ensuring a fair trial.  82    There are also the interests of the witnesses to consider.  In any litigation, the prospect of giving evidence naturally generates substantial stress and anxiety for potential witnesses.  There is also the prospect of memories fading over the period of delay given that the events occurred in 2013 and 2014, and the orders sought by the respondents in this application will likely result in the trial of this proceeding not occurring until late 2017 at the earliest, probably though in 2018.  83    If a stay were granted, there would thus be a significant lapse of time between the relevant events and the trial of this proceeding.  Undoubtedly, ‘[w]here there is delay the whole quality of justice deteriorates’: R v Laurence [1982] AC 510 at 517 per Lord Hailsham LC.  As McHugh J commented (in circumstances where there was a delay in commencing proceedings) in Brisbane South Regional Health Council v Taylor (1996) 186 CLR 541 at 551:As the United States Supreme Court pointed out in Barker v Wingo “what has been forgotten can rarely be shown”. So, it must often happen that important, perhaps decisive, evidence has disappeared without anybody now “knowing” that it ever existed. Similarly, it must often happen that time will diminish the significance of a known fact or circumstance because its relationship to the cause of action is no longer as apparent as it was when the cause of action arose. A verdict may appear well based on the evidence given in the proceedings but if the tribunal of fact had all the evidence concerning the matter, an opposite result may have ensued. The longer the delay in commencing proceedings, the more likely it is that the case will be decided on less evidence than was available to the parties at the time that the cause of action arose.(Footnotes omitted.)84    Whilst there has been no delay in commencing the proceeding, the comments of McHugh J still have a relevance to the position that may arise if this proceeding is further adjourned or stayed.  85    Whilst examinations have been conducted under s 155 of the CCA (‘s 155 examinations’), which may assist witnesses later in giving evidence, these examinations do not relate to all witnesses who may or are likely to give evidence at the trial in this proceeding.  In any event, witnesses will undoubtedly be subject to cross-examination, and be tested on their independent recollections.86    I should interpolate that some suggestion was made that the s 155 examinations of the individual respondents could be put into evidence, and subsequently sought to be used in the criminal trial.  This may be so.  If they are to be tendered in this proceeding, then this will be dealt with in the ordinary course of this proceeding.  As I have indicated, there are mechanisms the Court has to protect the individual respondents in relation to their criminal trial.  At the criminal trial, the court will have the ability to preclude any evidence that is unfairly prejudicial to the accused (see s 137 of the Evidence Act).87    I then turn to the issue raised by the CFMEU that they may have difficulty in obtaining the co-operation of the individual respondents.  This is a matter which I do not place too much weight upon.  All litigation has the potential for parties (here relevantly only the CFMEU) to have difficulty in obtaining the co-operation of witnesses – for all sorts of reasons.  It may or may not be the case that the individual respondents will be called to give evidence, but I accept that their co-operation in preparing the CFMEU case would be very useful, although not essential having regard to the fact that other personnel observed the events critical to the allegations concerning the s 45D conduct.  It will occur from time to time that a party will desire to call a witness who is uncooperative.  Court processes allow for a witness to be brought before a court to give evidence against their will.  If a witness does not wish to give information or instructions to a party prior to being called to give evidence, in the absence of any coercive power, that is the choice of the potential witness.  Section 128 of the Evidence Act seems to envisage there will be civil proceedings in which a witness may be called who objects to answering questions contrary to the desire of the party questioning that witness.  The fact the witness does not provide an answer (if not required to do so by the court) would not necessarily be a basis for a stay of the civil proceedings, although a party may be disadvantaged by the failure of the witness to give the evidence.  Of course, the court may, in the circumstances, consider that it was in the ‘interests of justice’ to require the witness to give evidence (see s 128 (4)), and then of course, the evidence would be before the court.  It is of relevance to recall that if a witness claims the privilege against self-incrimination and is not required to give evidence by the Court, or if the Court is persuaded that a party does not even have the opportunity to call a witness who claims the privilege and is subject to criminal prosecution, the Court cannot make any adverse inferences in that regard against that party (in this case the CFMEU).88    In addition to the above, I am not in any event persuaded on the evidence before me that I should assume that the individual respondents would be likely to give evidence at all, or alternatively that their evidence would assist the CFMEU’s defence (and this is so even if the trial was adjourned until after the conclusion of the criminal proceeding).  I come to this view taking into account the material the Court is now aware of, namely the pleadings, the s 155 examinations, the witness statements, and the fact that there are other potential witnesses from whom instruction can be taken and evidence adduced.  89    The assertions made that the CFMEU’s ability to defend this proceeding is ‘severely compromised’ because the individual respondents are apparently refusing to give instructions or will object to give evidence at the trial as a consequence of the criminal proceeding are not substantiated.  Undoubtedly, the individual respondents are significant players at the various meetings and sites, but this does not mean that evidence from them will be adduced at the trial of the civil proceeding.  This depends upon the approach taken to defending this proceeding by the CFMEU, a matter upon which the CFMEU has not yet disclosed to the Court.90    I then turn to the issue of the jury becoming aware of the allegations, the hearing itself, and of the eventual findings and orders of the Court in the civil proceeding.91    The prejudice asserted by the respondents in respect of the criminal proceeding is the risk of the jury becoming aware of evidence, findings or orders in this proceeding and being unable to put this information out of their minds in coming to a verdict in the criminal proceeding.  I do not consider this a real risk, particularly if the civil proceeding is heard in September/October 2016, and a criminal trial, at its earliest, will be heard in late 2017, but probably in early 2018.  92    In General Manager of the Fair Work Commission v Thomson [2013] FCA 380, Jessup J refused to assume that the media and the public would not readily be able to make a distinction between the different contraventions alleged in the criminal and civil penalty proceedings in that case and relevantly said (at [20]):… At the purely factual level, the conduct with which the balance of the present proceedings is concerned is quite different from that which forms the basis of the charges which have been laid against the respondent. It is true, perhaps, that there are some threads of legal principle which run through all of the presently relevant matters, but those threads would, in my view, be much more apparent to the legal practitioner than to members of the public. Furthermore, if, as I  presume will be the case, the media will report the present proceeding in an accurate and responsible way, the risk that reasonable members of the public would fail to appreciate that there are two proceedings against the respondent, each with its own factual allegations, is a negligible one. Doubtless the circumstance that the respondent is also facing the criminal charges will be commented upon from time to time, but this puts the respondent in a position no different from any person who has the misfortune to be involved in separate legal proceedings within what is broadly the same time frame. Even if one of those proceedings is to be determined by way of a jury trial, the fact that the respondent has recently been (or is still being) sued in another proceeding is, in my view, no basis to stay the latter.93    The situation is analogous here.  Even assuming that jurors were to learn of the evidence, findings or orders made in this proceeding in respect of the s 45D conduct (which is remote in any event), I do not accept the respondents’ assertion that jurors will be unable to put this information out of their mind in deciding the criminal charge, regardless of judicial direction, putting aside the lapse of time anyhow.  The information provided out of this proceeding would only be relevant to a limited extent and then only by way of context or background.  94    Moreover, as Mansfield J observed in Guglielmin v Trescowthick (No 3) (2005) 220 ALR 535 (at [48]):It should not readily be assumed that a duly selected jury, properly instructed, should be unable to hear and determine the criminal charges purely on the evidence adduced despite any (or even extensive) publicity about the allegations made in civil proceedings such as the present, and the progress of those proceedings at interlocutory stages, where the factual issues to be addressed can be seen to significantly overlap.I have already mentioned the comments of Finkelstein J in HLP and do not need to repeat them.95    Further, in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v ActiveSuper Pty Ltd (No 5) [2013] FCA 369, Gordon J said (at [23]) that:[t]he possibility of adverse media publicity does not provide grounds for a stay, nor is it a matter of any significant weight in determining whether to grant a stay.96    If a trial judge in a civil proceeding could (by appropriate court processes) relieve against any unfair interference with the criminal trial, then this is a relevant matter to consider in any application for a stay.  In my view, any legitimate risk of prejudice to the criminal proceeding which arises from the risk of jurors learning about the evidence, finding or orders of the Court in this proceeding could be addressed in a number of ways, including through non-publication orders under s 37AF of the Federal Court Act.  This matter can more appropriately be considered at the point in time when the Court is considering making such orders.  It is true the High Court in Zhao said that closing the Court so that the Commissioner may progress the forfeiture proceedings and receive the evidence from the person also accused does not qualify as a proper reason for departing from the open court principle.  However, I do not consider the High Court intended by that comment to limit the discretion given to a trial judge, to be exercised in a wide variety of circumstances, to suppress particular evidence for relevant and proper reasons, having regard to the nature of the evidence sought to be suppressed, the identity of the witness giving that evidence, and possible prejudice to an accused in any imminent criminal trial.97    I turn to the burden of preparing for trial, and the possibility of an adjournment based on case management principles.98    I do not consider that the proximity of the committal in the criminal proceeding and the trial of this matter in September 2016 should present difficulty for the CFMEU or the individual respondents.  The individual respondents are apparently refusing to provide instructions to the CFMEU’s legal representatives for the purpose the civil proceeding.  On that basis, they do not need to prepare for and attend the trial on 26 September 2016.  There is also no evidence that other CFMEU officers cannot adequately assist with the conduct of this proceeding.  The respondents have had ample notice of the forthcoming trial in September 2016, and presumably a great deal of preparation has been undertaken already.  Whilst the legal representation is common to both the civil and criminal proceedings, this is the choice of the CFMEU and the individual respondents.  The trial does not commence until 26 September 2016, and other arrangements can be made if necessary.  This is not a case where there is any evidence, nor do I assume, that the CFMEU or the individual respondents are without financial resources to appropriately contest this proceeding and prepare for the criminal proceeding.  99    I am mindful of the position of the potential witnesses to be called.  However, if, as it seems to be accepted, there is a significant overlap in the facts relating to the civil proceeding and criminal proceeding, then this may well facilitate the preparation for the hearing of the civil proceeding and the committal hearing.  In any event, at the moment I do not have any evidence to suggest that the proximity of both the civil proceeding and committal hearing will cause any injustice to any or all of the respondents.CONCLUSION100    In my view the respondents have not discharged the burden upon them to succeed in being granted a stay or adjournment of this proceeding.  I propose to dismiss the application for a stay.  101    I make this final observation.  The final hearing of the civil proceeding has not been commenced.  The form and content of the appropriate final relief (and the form and content of publication of reasons for judgment) in this civil proceeding is not presently able to be addressed nor resolved.  It may be that it is appropriate, depending on the circumstances, to delay the publication of reasons or declarations.  The result may be that the application of the ACCC is dismissed and no declarations would be made in that event.  102    If during the course of the civil trial any unfairness or potential unfairness arises, either to the CFMEU or to the individual respondents, this can be considered and addressed.  Nothing in these reasons precludes any respondent from making an adjournment application during the trial if the interests of justice require such an adjournment, for whatever legitimate reason and upon proper evidence.COSTS103    There were three extant costs issues between the parties:(a)    The costs of and incidental to the orders made on 4 April 2016;(b)    The costs of and incidental to the respondents’ interlocutory application dated 11 April 2016; and(c)    The costs of and incidental to the respondents’ interlocutory application for a stay dated 4 April 2016.104    Brief submissions from the parties have been received in relation to these costs issues.  No party has requested in these submissions that any cost order to be made in its favour be paid forthwith.  Each party has had mixed success and the Court has intervened to cause the parties to reflect upon certain interlocutory steps.  It may be that the most appropriate order is that each party bear their own costs in relation to all the extant issues, being a pragmatic way to achieve the appropriate level of justice in dealing globally with the costs incurred in relation to the above matters.105    Nevertheless, I propose to reserve the costs in relation to each of the extant issues, and consider the question of costs at the determination of the proceedings.  No party will be prejudiced by leaving the question of costs to be determined in this way, as costs in the normal course would not be paid until a final taxation upon the determination of this proceeding. I certify that the preceding one hundred and five (105) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Middleton.Associate: Dated:    11 May 2016",2016-05-11 00:00:00,Federal Court of Australia

The applicant in SAD 186 of 2015 was served with a summons to appear before an examiner of the Australian Crime Commission issued under s 28 of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) (“the Act”) on 17 June 2015.  The summons was accompanied by a copy of the Australian Crime Commission Special Investigation Authorisation and Determination (Highest Risk Criminal Targets No 2) 2013 (“the 2013 Determination”).  The applicant in SAD 186 of 2015 claims orders pursuant to s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), and ss 5 and 6 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) restraining the examiner from examining him pursuant to the summons and declarations that the summons and the 2013 Determination are invalid.  The applicant in SAD 187 of 2015 was served with a summons to appear before an examiner of the Australian Crime Commission issued under s 28 of the Act on 16 June 2015.  The summons was accompanied by a copy of the 2013 Determination.  The applicant in SAD 187 of 2015 claims similar relief and on the same grounds as the applicant in SAD 186 of 2015.  I heard the trial in SAD 186 of 2015 and then immediately thereafter the trial in SAD 187 of 2015.  The submissions made by the applicants and the respondents were the same in both proceedings.  The result in both proceedings will be the same.  In those circumstances, it is sufficient for these reasons to address the arguments in SAD 186 of 2015.2    The summons required the examinee to appear before an examiner:(b)    to give evidence of or about the following federally relevant criminal activity:i)    serious drug offences contrary to Part 9.1 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (Criminal Code); andii)    dealing with money or property contrary to sections 400.3, 400.4, 400.5, 400.6(1), 400.6(2), or 400.7(1) of the Criminal Code.3    The applicant claims that the 2013 Determination is invalid.  He claims that the invalidity of the 2013 Determination means that the summons is also invalid.  When he issued his application for judicial review, the applicant also advanced separate grounds upon which he contended that the summons was invalid.  Those separate grounds are no long pressed.  The application turns on whether the 2013 Determination is valid.The Relevant Provisions of the Act and the 2013 Determination4    The 2013 Determination was made by the Board of the Australian Crime Commission.5    The Australian Crime Commission (“ACC”) is established by s 7 of the Act, and the Board of the ACC is established by s 7B of the Act.  Section 7B(2) provides for the constitution of the Board of the ACC and is in the following terms:Board members (2)    The Board consists of the following members: (a)    the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police; (b)    the Secretary of the Department; (c)    the Chief Executive Officer of Customs; (d)    the Chairperson of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission; (e)    the Director-General of Security holding office under the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979; (f)    the Commissioner or head (however described) of the police force of each State and of the Northern Territory; (g)    the Chief Police Officer of the Australian Capital Territory; (h)    the CEO; (i)    the Commissioner of Taxation. 6    Section 7C of the Act provides that the functions of the Board include to authorise, in writing, the ACC to investigate matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity (s 7C(1)(c)) and to determine, in writing, whether such an investigation is a special investigation (s 7C(1)(d)).  Section 7C(3) and (4) deal with special investigations and they provide as follows:Special Investigations(3)    The Board may determine, in writing, that an investigation into matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity is a special investigation.  Before doing so, it must consider whether ordinary police methods of investigation into the matters are likely to be effective.Note 1:    See also subsection 7G(4) for the voting rule that applies in relation to such a determination.Note 2:    See also Division 2 for the examination powers available if there is a special investigation.Further details(4)    A determination under subsection (2) or (3) must:(a)    describe the general nature of the circumstances or allegations constituting the federally relevant criminal activity; and (b)    state that the relevant crime is, or the relevant crimes are or include, an offence or offences against a law of the Commonwealth, a law of a Territory or a law of a State but need not specify the particular offence or offences; and(c)    set out the purpose of the operation or investigation.7    The Act also establishes an Inter-Governmental Committee which consists of a member to represent the Commonwealth, being the Commonwealth Minister and, in the case of each participating State, a member to represent that State, being a Minister of the Crown of that State nominated by the Premier of that State (s 8(1)).  The Inter-Governmental Committee must be given a copy of a determination that an investigation is a special investigation (s 7C(5)), and the Inter-Governmental Committee has the power to revoke a determination (s 9(7)).8    The power of the Board of the ACC to authorise an investigation and determine that it is a special investigation is with respect to investigations into matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity.  The concept of federally relevant criminal activity is defined by a number of definitions in s 4 of the Act and by s 4A of the Act.  For present purposes, the following are relevant:federally relevant criminal activity means:(a)    a relevant criminal activity, where the relevant crime is an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory; or(b)    a relevant criminal activity, where the relevant crime:(i)    is an offence against a law of a State; and(ii)    has a federal aspect.relevant criminal activity means any circumstances implying, or any allegations, that a relevant crime may have been, may be being, or may in future be, committed against a law of the Commonwealth, of a State or of a Territory.relevant crime means:(a)    serious or organised crime; or(b)    Indigenous violence or child abuse.Note:    See also subsection (2) (which expands the meaning of relevant crime in certain circumstances).9    Section 4A of the Act sets out the circumstances in which a State offence has a federal aspect for the purposes of the Act.  The object of the section is to identify State offences that have a federal aspect because they potentially fall within Commonwealth legislative power because of the elements of the State offence or the circumstances in which the State offence was committed (whether or not those circumstances are expressed to be elements of the offence), or either the ACC investigating them or undertaking an intelligence operation relating to them is incidental to the ACC investigating or undertaking an intelligence operation relating to an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory.  In terms of the submissions in this case, the relevant provisions of s 4A are as follows:(2)    For the purposes of this Act, a State offence has a federal aspect if, and only if:(a)    …(b)    …    (c)    assuming that the Parliament of the Commonwealth had enacted a provision that created an offence penalising the specific acts or omissions involved in committing the State offence – that provision would have been a valid law of the Commonwealth; or …(3)    For the purposes of (2)(c), the specificity of the acts or omissions involved in committing a State offence is to be determined having regard to the circumstances in which the offence was committed (whether or not those circumstances are expressed to be elements of the offence).10    Part II Division 2 deals with examinations, and s 24A provides that an examiner may conduct an examination for the purposes of a special ACC operation/investigation.  Subsections (2) and (3) of s 28 provide as follows:(2)    A summons under subsection (1) requiring a person to appear before an examiner at an examination must be accompanied by a copy of the determination of the Board that the intelligence operation is a special operation or that the investigation into matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity is a special investigation.(3)    A summons under subsection (1) requiring a person to appear before an examiner at an examination shall, unless the examiner issuing the summons is satisfied that, in the particular circumstances of the special ACC operation/investigation to which the examination relates, it would prejudice the effectiveness of the special ACC operation/investigation for the summons to do so, set out, so far as is reasonably practicable, the general nature of the matters in relation to which the person is to be questioned, but nothing in this subsection prevents an examiner from questioning the person in relation to any matter that relates to a special ACC operation/investigation.11    The 2013 Determination is dated 4 September 2013.  As its title indicates, it involves an investigation into federally relevant criminal activity relating to High Risk Criminal Targets.  The definition of High Risk Criminal Targets or HRCTs in the 2013 Determination is as follows:means entities, including those entities identified within the (classified) National Criminal Target List (NCTL), which an authorised ACC officer has reasonable grounds for suspecting:(a)    may be engaged in specified criminal activity in one or more jurisdiction;(b)    may have a high level of intent and ability to commit specified criminal activity; and(c)    may have one or more of the following attributes:(i)    a high degree of resilience to disruption by law enforcement;(ii)    a thorough understanding of law enforcement methodology and its limitations and employ counter-strategies;(iii)    access to law enforcement or regulatory information;(iv)    a willingness and capacity to corrupt officials;(v)    a willingness and capacity to pervert the course of justice through the intimidation of witnesses and officials and the use of violence;The term “specified criminal activity” is defined in the 2013 Determination to mean the federally relevant criminal activity described in Schedule 1.  12    Clause 4 of the 2013 Determination provides for the authorisation by the Board of the ACC to investigate specified criminal activity until 30 June 2016.  Clause 6 is entitled “Determination” and is in the following terms:Pursuant to paragraph 7C(1)(d) and subsection 7C(3) of the Act, the Board:(a)    has considered whether ordinary police methods of investigation into specified criminal activity are likely to be effective;(b)    determines that ordinary police methods of investigation into specified criminal activity are not likely to be effective; and(c)    determines that the investigation authorised by this instrument is a special investigation.13    Clauses 7, 8 and 9 of the 2013 Determination purport to address the matters identified in s 7C(4) of the Act.  Clause 7 provides that the general nature of the circumstances or allegations constituting specified criminal activity are set out in Schedule 1.  Clause 8 provides that specified criminal activity includes offences against a law of the Commonwealth, a law of a State, or a law of a Territory.  Clause 9 sets out the purposes of the investigation and each of the relevant purposes relates to the specified criminal activity of HRCTs and, in one case, associated entities.14    Schedule 1 to the 2013 Determination is entitled “Authorised Investigation”.  Clause 1 deals with matters to be investigated and is in the following terms:The matter to be investigated is whether, in accordance with the allegations mentioned in clause 3 and in the circumstances mentioned in clause 2, federally relevant criminal activity:(a)    was committed before the commencement of this Instrument; or(b)    was in the process of being committed on the commencement of this Instrument; or(c)    may in future be committed;and, if so, the nature and extent of that activity and the identity and roles of entities involved in it.15    Clauses 2 and 3 in Schedule 1 to the 2013 Determination are in the following terms:2    Circumstances The general nature of the circumstances constituting federally relevant criminal activity that may have been, may be being, or may in future be, occurring are those implied or suggested from information available to the ACC and other Australian law enforcement agencies indicating that:(a)    HRCTs are responsible for a significant proportion of serious and organised crime, and represent a serious risk to Australia’s economy, business and institutions and thereby Australia’s national interests;(b)    HRCTs are typically involved in the trade of illicit commodities such as drugs and firearms but may be enablers of criminal activity (e.g. through the provision of money laundering services or secure communications).  HRCTs are increasingly involved in cyber and technology enabled crime and have international linkages; or (c)    HRCT criminal activity is resilient to traditional law enforcement investigations and ACC experience with the investigation of such HRCT activity indicates that, to be effective, ACC and partner bodies need to adopt a collaborative approach encompassing each of the following elements:- (i)    the development of more comprehensive intelligence in relation to the nature and extent of HRCT criminal activity (including evaluation of persons not currently listed on the NCTL or whose impact on Australians or Australia’s national interests is not yet fully assessed);(ii)    preventing, disrupting, disabling and dismantling identified HRCT criminal enterprises through enforcement, regulation, policy and other action; (iii)    enhanced collaboration with international bodies and private sector bodies; and (iv)    the use of ACC coercive powers to facilitate the collection of intelligence and evidence in relation to HRCT criminal activity not available through other information collection methods.  3    AllegationsThe general nature of the allegations constituting federally relevant criminal activity that may have been, may be being, or may in future be, committed is that HRCTs may be engaged, in concert with one another or with other entities, in one or more of the following activities: (a)    serious drug offences contrary to Part 9.1 of the Criminal Code which are punishable by imprisonment for a period of three years or more; (b)    the unlawful importation, possession or conveyance of, or dealing in, illegal drugs within the meaning of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) or the Customs Act 1901 (Cth); (c)    cross-border firearms trafficking contrary to Part 9.4 of the Criminal Code;(d)    offences involving violence punishable by imprisonment for a period of three years or more;(e)    tax evasion constituted by activity contrary to section 29D or section 86 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), or sections 134.1, 134.2, 135.1, or 135.4 of the Criminal Code; (f)    money laundering, within the meaning of section 81 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (Cth); (g)    dealing with money or property contrary to sections 400.3, 400.4, 400.5, 400.6 (1), 400.6 (2) or 400.7 (1) of the Criminal Code;(h)    theft;(i)    identity crime, including offences against Part 10.8 of the Criminal Code; (j)    offences contrary to section 474.14 of the Criminal Code (using a telecommunications network with intention to commit a serious offence), which are serious and organised crime as defined in the Act; (k)    criminal associations and organisation offences contrary to sections 390.3, 390.4, 390.5 or 390.6 of the Criminal Code;Connected offences (l)    any of the following activities, where those offences may have been, or may be, connected with a course of activity involving the commission of any of the offences referred to in paragraphs (a) to (k);(i)    perverting the course of justice;(ii)    corruption or improper interference with the due administration of justice within the meaning of section 33 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth);(iii)    intimidation of or interference with a witness or proposed witness in a judicial proceeding within the meaning of section 36A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth);(iv)    bribery of a Commonwealth public official, within the meaning of section 141.1 of the Criminal Code;

and (b)    the insertion of sections 134.1, 134.2, 135.1, 135.4, 141.1, 142.1 and 142.2 in the Criminal Code.The Grounds upon which the 2013 Determination is Challenged16    Two provisions of the Act form the foundation of the applicant’s challenge to the validity of the 2013 Determination.  First, the applicant relies on s 7C(3) which provides that before the Board of the ACC determines that an investigation is a special investigation, it must consider whether ordinary police methods of investigation into the matters are likely to be effective.  Secondly, having regard to s 4A, the 2013 Determination authorises an investigation into State offences with a federal aspect where it will not be known until the circumstances in which the offence was committed are ascertained whether there is a State offence with a federal aspect.17    The grounds of challenge to the 2013 Determination as set out in the applicant’s Amended Statement of Claim are as follows:Invalidity of the 2013 DeterminationThe subject matter of the 2013 is not a “special investigation”8.    By necessary implication arising from:8.1    the requirement in s 7C(3) of the Act that the Board determine that, in respect of an investigation which is proposed to be authorised as a special investigation, ordinary police methods of investigation into the matters are not likely to be effective; and8.2    the provision in s 4A(3) of the Act which is to the effect that the question whether a State offence may involve a federal aspect so as to give rise to federally relevant criminal activity may turn upon the specific acts or omissions involved in particular offending (whether or not constituting elements of the offending);a special investigation must be defined by reference to criminal activity (having occurred, presently occurring, or occurring in the future) with a degree of specificity likely to permit an accurate answer to be given to the inquiry required by s 7C(3) and likely to permit an assessment of whether the criminal activity has a federal aspect (necessary degree of specificity).9.    The 2013 Determination9.1    extends to State offences which may or may not have a federal aspect, it being impossible to say one way or the other by reference to the terms of the determination;9.2    applies to federally relevant criminal activity involving so-called “HRCT’s” without any case-specific temporal limitation, having the consequence that, in respect of any offending within the scope of the determination, it could not reasonably be expected to be able to be said with accuracy that, for the period of the determination, ordinary police methods of investigation are not likely to be effective;and therefore lacks the necessary degree of specificity and is ultra vires and invalid.Breadth of subject matter discloses unreasonableness10.    The nature and scope of the investigation purportedly authorised by the 2013 Determination is so varied and broad that it can be inferred that:10.1    the Board’s determination expressed in cl 6(b) (that ordinary police methods of investigation into the specified criminal activity are not likely to be effective) is so  unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have so determined; and10.2    consequently, the resulting determination was an improper exercise of power.11.    Further, or in the alternative, in so far as the nature and scope of the investigation purportedly authorised by the 2013 Determination turned upon the identity of so-called “HRCT’s”, from time to time, or upon matters suspected by the head of the ACC from time to time, it can be inferred that:11.1    the Board’s determination expressed in cl 6(b) (that ordinary police methods of investigation into the specified criminal activity are not likely to be effective) is so unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have so determined; and11.2    consequently, the resulting determination was an improper exercise of power.X7 v Australian Crime Commission (2013) 248 CLR 92 (“X7”) and XCIV v Australian Crime Commission (2015) 234 FCR 274 (“XCIV”)18    Before addressing the applicant’s arguments, there are two cases to be addressed.19    In X7, Hayne and Bell JJ considered the requirement in s 7C(3) of the Act that before the Board determines in writing that an investigation into matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity is a special investigation, it must consider whether ordinary police methods of investigation into the matters are likely to be effective.  Their Honours said that in the context of the Act, this meant that the Board of the ACC was required not only to consider the question, but also, to determine that ordinary police methods are not likely to be effective to permit the laying of charges against offenders before making the relevant determinations.  Their Honours said (at 150 [146]):It is to be recalled that the examination powers which are in issue in this case are powers that relate expressly to a “special ACC operation/investigation”, which, in the context of this case, refers  to “an investigation into matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity that the ACC is conducting and that the Board has determined to be a special investigation”.  Although s 7C(3) provides that a “special investigation” cannot be undertaken without the Board of the ACC first considering “whether ordinary police methods of investigation into the matters are likely to be effective”, it must be read as requiring the Board of the ACC not only to consider this question, but also to determine that ordinary police methods are not “likely to be effective”.  In the context of the ACC Act, “effective” can and must be understood as meaning “effective to permit the laying of charges against offenders”.  The word “effective” cannot and should not be read, in the context of the ACC Act generally, or in the particular context of s 7C(3), as embracing any larger task of deciding whether individual criminal guilt is demonstrated.  It is only by the engagement of judicial power consequent upon the laying of a charge that individual criminal guilt will be determined.  (Citations omitted).20    As to the Determination in issue in that case, their Honours said that the better view may well be that the phrase “to determine whether”, when read in context, meant that it did not encompass the criminal activity of any person which was activity the subject of pending charges against that person, or activity which that person had admitted or been proved to have undertaken (at 151-152 [153]).  21    In XCIV, Wigney J addressed a challenge to the validity of the 2013 Determination.  His Honour identified the four grounds upon which the applicant in that case challenged the validity of the determination (other than the constitutional point) at paragraphs 35 to 39, and his reasons for rejecting each ground at paragraphs 91 to 139.  22    The grounds upon which the 2013 Determination was challenged in that case were as follows:(1)    The Board did not consider whether ordinary police methods of investigation were likely to be effective before making the determination.(2)    The determination did not describe the general nature of the circumstances or allegations constituting the federally relevant criminal activity as required by s 7C(4)(a).(3)    The determination was so broad in its scope that it was not a proper exercise of power under s 7C.(4)    The determination was invalid because it amounted to an impermissible delegation of the Board’s power under s 7C to an officer or officers of the ACC.  The applicant in XCIV relied on the definition of “High Risk Criminal Targets” in clause 3 of the Determination to support this argument.23    I will address his Honour’s reasons for disposing of some of these arguments later in these reasons.The Issues on the Application24    The Board of the ACC has a statutory power to authorise the ACC to investigate matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity.  The investigation must be limited to matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity.  The Board then has the statutory power to determine that an investigation relating to federally relevant criminal activity is a special investigation.  Before it takes this latter step, it must be satisfied that ordinary police methods of investigation into the matters (relating to federally relevant criminal activity) are not likely to be effective to permit the laying of charges against offenders.  As a convenient form of shorthand, I will call this the ordinary police methods of investigation issue.  The determination of the issue is a pre-condition to the exercise of the statutory power to determine that an investigation is a special investigation.25    The composition of the Board of the ACC suggests a body well-placed in terms of experience and expertise to address the ordinary police methods of investigation issue.  The assessment to be made by the Board of the ACC is an assessment of likelihood not of certainty.  26    With these opening remarks in mind, I turn to identify the applicant’s submissions.  The applicant’s first submission is that the 2013 Determination is invalid because it is too broad.  In other words, it did not satisfy the statutory requirements for an authorised investigation which has been determined to be a special investigation.  The applicant’s principal contention in support of this submission is that the ordinary police methods of investigation issue provides a limitation on the breadth of a permissible investigation.  In other words, “the matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity” must be identified with sufficient particularity to permit of an answer to the ordinary police methods of investigation issue.  I think that the applicant also advanced a more general contention that the 2013 Determination is too broad irrespective of the ordinary police methods of investigation issue.  The submission seemed to be that the ambulatory nature of the investigation is fatal to its validity.  The ambulatory nature of the investigation was said to arise from the fact that the matters to be investigated could not be identified at the outset (i.e., at the time the 2013 Determination was made), but only from time to time as the authorised ACC officer formed the reasonable suspicion identified in the definition of HRCTs in the 2013 Determination.27    The applicant’s alternative submission is that the 2013 Determination is invalid because the decision by the Board of the ACC with respect to the ordinary police methods of investigation issue was legally unreasonable.28    In one sense, this is another way of approaching the same issue.  If the ordinary police methods of investigation issue does not operate directly on the permissible breadth of an investigation, nevertheless, the issue must be addressed by the Board of the ACC and if the 2013 Determination is so broad that that cannot be done, then a decision purporting to do so, is legally unreasonable.  The applicant’s submission is that the decision of the Board of the ACC on the ordinary police methods of investigation issue lacked an evident and intelligible justification and was legally unreasonable (Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Li and Another (2013) 249 CLR 332 at 367 [76] per Hayne, Kiefel and Bell JJ; see also Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v Singh and Another (2014) 231 FCR 437 and Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v Stretton [2016] FCAFC 11).29    In National Crime Authority v A1 (1997) 75 FCR 274 (“A1”) and AB v National Crime Authority (1998) 85 FCR 538 (“AB”), the Full Court of this Court considered the validity of a reference of a matter relating to a relevant criminal activity to the National Crime Authority for investigation.  The relevant Act was the National Crime Authority Act 1984 (Cth).  30    The applicant submitted that authorities under that Act were of very limited relevance to the Act.  It seems to me that the general principles identified in A1 and AB are relevant to special investigations under the Act.  The general principles about the nature of investigations under the National Crime Authority Act identified by von Doussa and Sundberg JJ in A1 apply with equal force to special investigations under the Act.  Their Honours said (at 294):… An NCA investigation starts with no specific issues or charges.  It has only its terms of reference, which may be extremely wide.  Its function is inquisitorial, not adversarial.  It must pursue lines of inquiry, and in doing so may find that other lines of inquiry appear profitable (cf Douglas v Pindling at 901). The NCA should not be regarded as outside its charter so long as it bona fide seeks to establish a relevant connection between certain facts and the subject matter of the reference, and that connection is one that is reasonably capable of being related to the purpose for which the power is conferred (cf Ross v Costigan at 200-201; 334, Melbourne Home of Ford at 175 at Douglas v Pindling at 905). Because the NCA is an investigative body, it must necessarily embark on a fishing expedition (cf McGuinness v Attorney-General (Vic) at 92 and Douglas v Pindling at 904).  Given the nature of an NCA investigation, to say that it is a function of the notice of reference to enable the NCA to ascertain the extent or limits of its powers does not mean that a notice must possess the particularity insisted upon by the primary judge.31    Furthermore, the similarities between a key section in the National Crime Authority Act, s 13(2), and s 7C(4) are obvious.  Section 13(2) of the National Crime Authority Act was in the following terms:A notice under subsection (1) referring a matter to the Authority for investigation:(a)    shall describe the general nature of the circumstances or allegations constituting the relevant criminal activity;(b)    shall state that the relevant offence is, or the relevant offences are or include, an offence or offences against a law of the Commonwealth or a law of a Territory but need not specify the particular offence or offences; and(c)    shall set out the purpose of the investigation.32    In A1, von Doussa and Sundberg JJ considered whether, in order to be valid, a reference under s 13 of the National Crime Authority Act needed to identify four matters and held that a reference did not need to do so.  Those matters were as follows:(1)    the criminal activities in precise terms;(2)    a precise time-frame in which it is said that the criminal activities occurred;(3)    the persons or entities who were said to be or may be engaged in the criminal activities; and(4)    the conduct of any persons or any transactions the subject of the allegations.Their Honours referred to a case wherein the Minister became aware of a vast increase in the amount of heroin being trafficked in Sydney.  He could refer to the National Crime Authority for investigation the question whether the offence of heroin importation has been or is being committed, and if so by whom because this would be “a matter relating to a relevant criminal activity”.  The reference would be valid even though the identity of the offenders was unknown and even though “no particular conduct or precise transaction is known” (at 290).33    In AB, there was a reference by the Minister under s 13 of the National Crime Authority Act and a claim that the notices of reference were invalid.  The Full Court followed the decision in A1 (see 551-553 especially at 553).34    Wigney J in XCIV considered the approach taken by von Doussa and Sundberg JJ in A1 to be relevant to the approach to be taken under the Act (at [105]-[113]).35    It is true that the subject of the 2013 Determination are the activities of HRCTs and that they may be identified from time to time during the life of the Determination.  That comes about because it is the reasonable suspicion of an authorised ACC officer about the attributes of an entity that bring it within the definition of a HRCT.  In that sense, the scope of the investigation may vary over the life of the Determination.  However, I would think that that would be a feature of almost all investigations and I do not think it means that the 2013 Determination itself is ambulatory in an impermissible way.  The relevant parameters of the investigation authorised by the 2013 Determination are fixed by reference to the terms of the power.36    I note that the applicant in this case did not advance the argument advanced in XCIV that the 2013 Determination impermissibly delegated power to an officer or officers of the ACC.  That argument was rejected by Wigney J (at [135]-[139].  I also note that at least some aspects of the argument now advanced were considered by Wigney J and rejected by him.  His Honour said (at [123]):It is unclear exactly how or why this is said to mean that the description of the circumstances or allegations in the Determination fails to satisfy the requirement in s 7C(4)(a) of the Act.  As already indicated, a determination under s 7C can be valid even if it does not identify any suspected offenders at all, or only identifies them in a very general way:  NCA v A1 at 289-290.  If follows that a determination that describes suspected offenders in a limited way, for example that they possess certain specified characteristics or attributes, is not invalid.  That is the case even if the question whether persons or entities possess those attributes is left up to the judgment of officers of the ACC.  That is all the more so when that judgment is required to be on objectively reasonable grounds.  37    I come now to the main arguments advanced by the applicant.  The applicant pointed to the list of offences in clause 3 of Schedule 1 to the 2013 Determination and highlighted, by way of example, offences involving violence punishable by imprisonment for a period of three years or more (cl 3(d)) and theft (cl 3(h)).  As I understood the submission, it was that there was nothing about the nature of these offences which suggested that ordinary police methods of investigation were not likely to be effective in the relevant sense.  That had to be found elsewhere and that could only be in the description of HRCTs.  When one then considered the definition of HRCTs, what was notable (so the applicant submitted) was that the group was defined by reference to a reasonable suspicion of an authorised ACC officer that the entity may have the attributes identified in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).  The applicant submitted that even if it is assumed that the group whose activities are the subject of the investigation can be defined by reference to attributes which in themselves indicate that ordinary police methods of investigation are not likely to be effective and even if it is assumed that that is what has been done in the definition of HRCTs, nevertheless the use of the word “may” means that some entities may not, in fact, have the relevant attributes and so it cannot be said that ordinary police methods of investigation were not likely to be effective in the relevant sense with respect to such entities.  I reject this submission.38    I think that a Determination could define the group to be investigated by reference to attributes or characteristics which in themselves justify a conclusion that ordinary police methods of investigation are not likely to be effective in the relevant sense.  In my opinion, this Determination does just that.  It is not only paragraph (c) in the definition of HRCT’s which is relevant in this respect, but also paragraphs (a) and (b).  For example, paragraph (b) refers to a high level of ability to commit specified criminal activity.  Another aspect of the definition which is important is that the authorised ACC officer must not only have a suspicion, but must also have reasonable grounds for that suspicion.  In other words, there must be circumstances which would create in the mind of a reasonable person a suspicion that the entity may have the relevant attributes or characteristics (Queensland Bacon Proprietary Ltd v Rees (1966) 115 CLR 266 at 303 per Kitto J; George v Rockett and Another (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 115-116).39    There are two obvious matters to be noted about the requirement that the Board of the ACC be satisfied that ordinary police methods of investigation are not likely to effective in the relevant sense.  First, it is not necessary that the Board of the ACC be satisfied that ordinary police methods of investigation will not be effective.  Secondly, the issue will not always be an easy one to answer and there are questions of degree involved.  40    Considering all of these matters together, I do not think that the 2013 Determination is invalid because the definition of HRCTs means that the Board of the ACC could not address and answer the ordinary police methods of investigation issue.41    The applicant put a further argument in support of the submission that the 2013 Determination was invalid because the Board of the ACC could not answer the ordinary police methods of investigation issue.  It concerned State offences having a federal aspect.  In XCIV, Wigney J decided that the offences identified in clauses 3(d) and 3(h) of Schedule 1 to the 2013 Determination were Commonwealth offences or State offences having a federal aspect (at [131]).  State offences having a federal aspect are also covered when they fall within the circumstances identified in clause 3(m) of Schedule 1.  As I understood the applicant’s argument, it was that with respect to some State offences having a federal aspect, it will not become apparent that it is within the investigation until the circumstances in which the offence was committed are ascertained and, in those circumstances, it is difficult to see how the ordinary police methods of investigation issue could be addressed at the time of the 2013 Determination.  I would make the observation that if that is a difficulty it appears to be a difficulty within the Act, rather than the Determination.  In any event, I do not think the point succeeds because the circumstances relate to HRCTs and the Board of the ACC is able to address the ordinary police methods of investigation issue in relation to them.42    The other way the applicant put his argument about the ordinary police methods of investigation issue was that the decision of the Board of the ACC was legally unreasonable.  In XCIV, Wigney J rejected an argument that the Board of the ACC had not determined the issue (at [91]-[98]) and he said that the Board of the ACC had stated in clause 6 of the 2013 Determination that it had determined the issue.  The applicant submitted that, assuming it had done so, nevertheless its decision was legally unreasonable.  This submission focused on the breadth of the 2013 Determination.  For the reasons I have given, I think it was open to the Board of the ACC to conclude (as it did) that, with respect to the specified criminal activity identified in the 2013 Determination, ordinary police methods of investigation were not likely to be effective in the relevant sense.  Conclusion43    None of the grounds of challenge have been made out in this case and the application in SAD 186 of 2015 must be dismissed.  The application in SAD 187 of 2015 must also be dismissed.I certify that the preceding forty-three (43) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Besanko.Associate:    Dated:    29 April 2016",2016-04-29 00:00:00,Federal Court of Australia

They arise in a context where I have just delivered reasons for judgment in the principal proceedings, which involved appeals by a number of taxpayers against assessments which had been issued to them by the Commissioner of Taxation. The first application is brought by the Commissioner and seeks the revocation of orders which were made by me on 8 April 2014 which had the effect of requiring the suppression of the reasons for judgment for a period of 14 days after their publication. The second application is brought by the taxpayers and seeks that I recuse myself from hearing the first application. Also before the Court was Ms Dixon, who helpfully appeared for Mr Gould and Mr Leaver, the latter of which gave evidence in the course of the proceedings. 2    The basis upon which Mr Hyde Page for the taxpayers seeks that I should recuse myself turns upon, as I apprehend it, the contents of the last paragraph of the reasons for judgment, which are at paragraph 485, and in which I direct a copy of my reasons be provided to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Federal Police, and in the last sentence of which I describe the behaviour revealed in this case as having been ‘disgraceful’. He says that, in those circumstances, a reasonable person would apprehend that I would not be able to bring a fair mind to bear upon the disposition of the Commissioner’s application for the revocation of the orders made on 8 April 2014. 3    We have it on the authority of Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (2000) 205 CLR 337 that where an application based upon apprehended bias is made, it is necessary to delineate a rational connection between the matter which is said to generate the apprehension of bias and a belief or supposition that the judicial officer in question may not bring an even-minded contemplation to the disposition of the proceeding before him or her. Here, the substantive question which arises for judicial determination is whether I should, in the exercise of the powers under s 37AF of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), revoke orders which I have already made. 4    In the reasons for judgment in Hua Wang Bank Berhad v Commissioner of Taxation [2014] FCA 1392, I have made adverse findings as to the credit of the people for whom Ms Dixon appears, and a number of officers and persons involved in the administration of the entities for whom Mr Hyde Page appears. As I understand the logic of the argument, it is that those findings reveal an animus on my part towards those particular persons and therefore it is to be expected, or at least anticipated, that I will not bring a fair mind to the resolution of the issue of whether I should revoke the orders made by me on 8 April 2014. I do not think that apprehension reasonably arises. 5    The making of adverse findings of credit by judges against witnesses in proceedings is not unusual. Whilst I would accept that, in a case where I had to assess the credit of those witnesses again, a person may have a reasonable apprehension that I might not bring a fair mind to bear on it as I had already concluded that they were discreditable in certain respects, no question about the credit of these witnesses arises on the disposition of the Commissioner’s application. The question which arises is whether the interests of justice require publically published reasons of the Court to be suppressed. 6    That is not a debate which in any way centres upon the credit or otherwise of the individual persons who are named in the judgment. Accordingly, I decline to disqualify myself from hearing the first application.  7    Turning then to the first application, I made orders on 8 April 2014 in the following terms: 1.    Pursuant to s 37AF of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 and subject to order 2, the reasons for decision relating to the final judgment in these proceedings (""the reasons"") are not [to] be published except to the following persons and agencies: 1.1    the parties to these proceedings; 1.2    Mr Vanda Gould; 1.3    Mr Peter Borgas; 1.4    Mr John Leaver; 1.5    the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions; 1.6    the Australian Crime Commission;  1.7    the Australian Federal Police and the legal representatives of any of the above. 2.    Notwithstanding order 1, the Commissioner of Taxation (""the Commissioner"") may provide the reasons to the following further persons and agencies: 2.1    courts and tribunals in proceedings in which the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner of Taxation is a party where, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the reasons may be relevant to those proceedings; 2.2    mediators and other persons involved in alternative dispute resolution procedures in which the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner of Taxation is a party where, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the reasons may be relevant to the dispute; and 2.3    taxpayers and their authorised representatives who are or were the subject of audit or review by the Commissioner of Taxation in circumstances where, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the reasons may be relevant to the audit, review or assessment of those taxpayers on the condition that the Commissioner provide a copy of these orders to anyone who is provided with the reasons. 3.    Pursuant to s 37AJ of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 the above orders are to remain in force for a period of 14 days after delivery of the final judgment in these proceedings. 8    Those orders were made in a particular context: the trial before me of these matters proceeded for many weeks and involved serious allegations made by the Commissioner against individuals named in the judgment. 9    During the course of the proceedings, three of the witnesses in the case were arrested and charged, as I understand it, with serious criminal offences. Whilst the Court was reserved on the reasons for judgment, an application was made by Mr Gould, and I think Mr Leaver as well, that the reasons of the Court should be suppressed for at least a period of 14 days after their publication, so that they could give consideration to applying for further suppression of those reasons if so advised. There was a rational basis for that application and indeed a certain air of common sense about it. The Court unquestionably has the power to control its processes so as not to prejudice the outcome of pending criminal proceedings. 10    On occasions, that power is exercised to stay civil proceedings when criminal proceedings are pending: see, for example, Cassaniti v Tax Agents’ Board of New South Wales (2009) 179 FCR 1, where this Court restrained certain disciplinary proceedings against a tax agent because of pending criminal proceedings. It was rational, in that context, at least to permit the opportunity to consider whether there might be some risk if a jury were empanelled that the Board’s reasons may be prejudicial if published.  11    However, in this case the criminal proceedings which were brought against Mr Gould and Mr Leaver were withdrawn on 13 May 2014 and there has been, since that time, no direct possibility of risk to the administration of justice posed by the publication of the Court’s reasons. 12    There are two complicating matters, however. The first is that it appears, from evidence which was placed before me this morning by Mr Gould’s representatives, that there is an ongoing criminal investigation into him. Secondly, consistent with that, there is my recommendation in paragraph 485 that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions be provided with a set of the reasons, along with certain other regulatory authorities, for consideration as to what, if any, steps they might take. Those two matters form the basis for a submission that although there are no criminal proceedings on foot at the moment, there is at least the possibility in a practical sense that criminal proceedings might be forthcoming. 13    It seems to me that that is a reasonable supposition. It is quite plain from the evidence that Mr Gould continues to be investigated by authorities and I do not think that paragraph 485 of my reasons for judgment, or the reasons taken as a whole, are likely to retard that activity. But the question is whether the fact that there are possible criminal proceedings likely to be laid in the future is sufficient to provide a proper basis for suppressing the reasons for judgment. The administration of justice, it is well established, is something which is to take place in public. The Court’s ability to suppress proceedings, which I assume at least for present purposes includes its ability to suppress its own reasons for taking a particular step, is one which is to be only exercised where it is shown to be necessary. See, for example, Hogan v Australian Crime Commission (2010) 240 CLR 651. 14    Here, there are a number of contingencies which seem to arise before there would be any risk to the administration of justice. It is possible that the charges will never be laid. It is certain that they are unlikely to be laid, if they are laid, any time soon. It is inevitable that if they are laid, the committal proceedings will take at least a year, possibly longer. If any of these matters are to come before a jury, whether of the Supreme Court or of the District Court, it seems to me very unlikely that that will happen within a period of at least two years from today. Then there is the fact that prejudicial pre-trial coverage of matters is a well-known phenomenon in the criminal justice sphere, confronted on a daily basis and dealt with, usually, by appropriate warnings and directions to the jury to confine themselves to the consideration of the evidence which is before them. 15    There is also the well-established jurisdiction of the criminal courts to stay proceedings which are before them on the basis of an impossibility of a fair trial. I do not think, in the light of the existence of that jurisdiction and the contingencies to which I have referred, that there is a substantial risk to the administration of justice. Accordingly I am not satisfied, to the very high standard required of me under section 37AF of the Federal Court of Australia Act, that I should keep in force the exceptional order of suppressing the Court’s published reasons. In those circumstances, I propose to set aside the orders I made on 8 April 2014. 16    I should say for completeness that Mr Hyde Page submitted to me that the application by the Commissioner had not been made with sufficient time. I am not satisfied that any prejudice arose from any such late making of the application, and I note that the application was in any event foreshadowed by the Commissioner to Mr Gould’s solicitors on 11 December 2014. The taxpayers, I should also say, submitted that they also wished to see the reasons suppressed. I do not consider that the taxpayers have any interest in that question whatsoever. There are no pending criminal proceedings against them nor are there likely to be criminal proceedings against companies which are not incorporated in Australia. 17    In those circumstances, I will set aside the orders of 8 April 2014. I order the third parties, Mr Gould and Mr Leaver, to pay the Commissioner’s costs of the application to set aside the orders of 8 April 2014.

IN THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA     NEW SOUTH WALES DISTRICT REGISTRY     GENERAL DIVISION  NSD 508 of 2014      BETWEEN:  UNILEVER AUSTRALIA LIMITED (ACN 004 050 828) Applicant/ Cross-Respondent    AND:  REVLON AUSTRALIA PTY LIMITED (ACN 095 360 731) Respondent/ Cross-Claimant       JUDGE:  GLEESON J   DATE:  19 AUGUST 2014   PLACE:  SYDNEY  REASONS FOR JUDGMENT  1    The applicant/cross-respondent (“Unilever”) and the respondent/cross-claimant (“Revlon”) are competitors in the supply of products including “clinical” anti-perspirant deodorant products (“clinical protection products” or “products”) in Australia. Clinical protection products are intended to provide protection against heavy sweating. By number of sales, clinical protection products comprise approximately 1.8% of total sales of anti-perspirant deodorants in Australia, amounting to about $20 million in value.  2    Unilever’s products are sold under the brand names “Rexona” and “Dove”. Revlon’s products are sold under the brand name “Mitchum Clinical”. The Unilever products have been sold in Australia since July 2009. The Mitchum Clinical products have been sold in Australia since January 2014. 3    Next month, this court will commence a final hearing of various claims made by the parties against each other in connection with the supply of clinical protection products. The proceedings were commenced in late May 2014. Unilever claims that Revlon has contravened ss 18, 29(1)(a) and 29(1)(g) of the Australian Consumer Law, Schedule 2 to the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (“Australian Consumer Law”) by various representations including as to the superiority of the Mitchum Clinical products. The representations are alleged to have been made in advertising and on the packaging of the products. The relief sought includes orders restraining Revlon from selling the Mitchum Clinical products in their current packaging. 4    Revlon counter claims that Unilever has contravened the same provisions of the Australian Consumer Law, and also engaged in the tort of passing off. Revlon’s claims also concern both Unilever’s advertising and its packaging of the clinical protection products. The relief sought by Revlon includes orders restraining Unilever from selling Revlon clinical protection products in the “New Rexona Packaging”. 5    In June 2014, Unilever was denied interlocutory injunctive relief which would have restrained Revlon from publishing and broadcasting advertisements making certain claims, and also from making the certain representations: Unilever Australia Limited v Revlon Australia Pty Ltd [2014] FCA 573 (“June 2014 decision”). At that time, the parties were offered and accepted an early final hearing in July 2014. As it turned out, that hearing was vacated and the matter has been listed for a six day hearing commencing on 15 September 2014. 6    In July 2014, Unilever commenced distributing and marketing four variants of Rexona clinical protection products in new packaging (“New Rexona Packaging”). According to Unilever, the new packaging was part of a worldwide rebranding of the products. According to Revlon, Unilever is passing off the Rexona products as Mitchum Clinical products and is engaging in misleading or deceptive conduct in breach of the Australian Consumer Law. Specifically, Revlon claims that by selling its products in the New Rexona Packaging, Unilever has represented to consumers in Australian that the Rexona products: a.    are Mitchum Clinical products; b.    are made, imported or sold with the sponsorship or approval of the makers of Mitchum Clinical; and c.    are otherwise associated with the Mitchum Clinical products or the makes of Mitchum Clinical. 7    Revlon now seeks an urgent interlocutory injunction restraining Unilever from selling, offering for sale or marketing in Australian any Rexona clinical protection products in the New Rexona Packaging. 8    When the application was first made, there was a concern or suspicion that one of the parties may have deliberately copied the packaging design of the other. By the hearing of the application, the parties accepted that there was no evidence on any deliberate wrongdoing of this kind. However, Revlon maintained that Unilever had re-packaged its products in full knowledge of the similarities between the New Rexona Packaging and the Mitchum Clinical packaging. This was necessarily the case because the Mitchum products were sold in the Mitchum Clinical packaging from January 2014 and overseas from December 2013. Revlon went further and submitted that the selection of the New Rexona Packaging, the choice to launch it and the timing of the launch were influenced by having seen the Mitchum Clinical packaging. 9    Revlon sought to emphasise its point by referring to an internal Unilever slide pack dated January 2014 and entitled “Response plan for Mitchum”. The slide pack commented on the “extreme” similarity between the “Mitchum graphic” and the graphic on a package similar to the New Rexona Packaging. The pack also commented on similarities between the variants of the Rexona and Mitchum clinical protection products, and “almost the exact same ‘use’ claims” on both packages. The pack did not make any recommendations about a response. Issue to be decided  10    The issue is whether Revlon has demonstrated a sufficient likelihood of success to justify, in the circumstances, the interlocutory relief sought. In Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O’Neill (2006) 227 CLR 57 at [65], Gummow and Hayne JJ said (footnotes omitted): The relevant principles in Australia are those explained in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [(1968) 418 CLR 618]. This Court (Kitto, Taylor, Menzies and Owen JJ) said that on such applications the court addresses itself to two main inquiries and continued [at 622-623]:   “The first is whether the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to relief ... The second inquiry is ... whether the inconvenience or injury which the plaintiff would be likely to suffer if an injunction were refused outweighs or is outweighed by the injury which the defendant would suffer if an injunction were granted.”   By using the phrase “prima facie case”, their Honours did not mean that the plaintiff must show that it is more probable than not that at trial the plaintiff will succeed; it is sufficient that the plaintiff show a sufficient likelihood of success to justify in the circumstances the preservation of the status quo pending the trial. That this was the sense in which the Court was referring to the notion of a prima facie case is apparent from an observation to that effect made by Kitto J in the course of argument. With reference to the first inquiry, the Court continued, in a statement of central importance for this appeal [at 622]:  “How strong the probability needs to be depends, no doubt, upon the nature of the rights [the plaintiff] asserts and the practical consequences likely to flow from the order he seeks.” 11    In Warner-Lambert Company LLC v Apotex Pty Ltd [2014] FCAFC 59 at [72], the Full Court referred with approval to the following statement of Mahoney JA (with whom Glass and Samuels JJA agreed) in Shercliff v Engadine Acceptance Corporation Pty Ltd [1978] 1 NSWLR 729 at 734 about the nature of the task to be undertaken by a judge hearing an application for an interlocutory injunction, where there is a conflict of evidence: But there are limitations upon the extent to which a judge is to take into account such evidence as the defendant may tender upon an interlocutory application. It is not his function to conduct a preliminary trial of the action, nor is it, in general, to resolve the conflict between the parties’ evidence, and grant or refuse the application upon the basis of such findings. Where there is conflict of evidence, the use which may be made of the defendant’s evidence in determining whether the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case is a limited one. For example, the plaintiff’s evidence, considered alone, may be such a prima facie case as would be acceptable if submitted to a jury in a trial. But, when considered in the light of the defendant’s evidence, it may be explained away so as no longer to be such. Or the defendant’s evidence, when juxtaposed to that of the plaintiff may show that there is in reality no such case, no real question between the parties, appropriate to warrant preserving the status quo until the hearing. 12    In the June 2014 decision, Jacobson J noted (at [31]) that whether there is a serious question, or a prima facie case, is not to be considered in isolation from the discretionary considerations which inform the balance of convenience. What is involved is an assessment of whether Revlon has demonstrated a sufficient probability of success to justify the grant of interlocutory relief in light of the discretionary considerations raised in the interlocutory hearing. Factual issues 13    According to Revlon’s written submissions, in order to succeed in its claims, it needed to establish as at late July 2014, that: a.    The features or “get up” of its Mitchum Clinical packaging had become sufficiently distinctive and associated in the minds of a substantial number of the relevant class of consumers with Revlon Australia; b.    There was a misrepresentation by Unilever that the New Rexona Packaging is from the same source or associated with Mitchum Clinical or Revlon; and c.    For passing off, there is a likelihood that Revlon Australia will suffer damage by reason of the erroneous belief. Legal principles concerning passing off and misleading or deceptive conduct Passing off 14    The principles governing the tort of passing off are set out in Bodum v DKSH Australia Pty Limited [2011] FCAFC 98 at [211] to [214] (“Bodum”). Revlon’s identification of the factual issues reflects the statement of Lord Oliver in Reckitt & Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc [1990] RPC 341 at 405, cited in Bodum at [212]. 15    Concerning reputation, Lord Oliver said that the plaintiff must: …establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which he supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by association with the identifying “get-up” (whether it consists simply of a brand name or a trade description, or the individual features of labelling or packaging) under which his particular goods or services are offered to the public, such that the get-up is recognised by the public as distinctive specifically of the plaintiff’s goods or services. 16    As Perram J observed in Mars Australia Pty Ltd v Sweet Rewards Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 606 (“Mars”) at [22], similarly, it is the reputation in the features of the applicant’s packaging which is the springboard for the argument that consumers are deceived by a particular imitation. 17    In Natural Waters of Viti Limited v Dayals (Fiji) Artesian Waters Ltd [2007] FCA 200 (“Viti”) at [59], Bennett J said: The reputation which must be proved in a case such as this is that the get-up, packaging, shape, or trade dress relied upon is associated by consumers with the applicant’s product. It takes a strong case to establish a reputation of this nature (Interlego [AG v Croner Trading Pty Limited (1992) 39 FCR 348] at 386) as consumers will not necessarily associate a get-up with the applicant’s product (Collins Debden Pty Ltd v Cumberland Stationery Co Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] FCA 1398 at [33] to [34] per Lindgren J). The requisite reputation will more readily be found where the get-up is unique or striking rather than descriptive, mundane, merely functional, or in common use. Misleading or deceptive conduct 18    It is necessary to identify whether the impugned conduct, as a whole and in context, is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. Conduct is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive if it has the tendency to lead into error, and if there is a sufficient causal link between the conduct and the error on the part of the person exposed to the conduct. The causing of confusion or questioning is insufficient; it is necessary to establish that the ordinary or reasonable consumer is likely to be led into error. The proper context may include consideration of the type of market, the manner in which the goods are sold and the habits and characteristics of purchasers in such a market: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Limited [2014] FCA 634 at [38] to [41]. 19    In the case of representations to the public, it is necessary to isolate the class of prospective purchasers to which the representations are directed: Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Ltd (2000) 202 CLR 45 at [102] and [103].  20    According to Revlon, the tendency of the New Rexona Packaging to mislead is determined by whether the similarity of the design is apt to bring the consumer into the “marketing web” of Unilever rather than of Revlon, on the basis of an erroneous belief engendered by the “general thrust” of the messages: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v TPG Internet Pty Ltd [2013] HCA 54 at [48] to [50].  21    Revlon relied on the following passage from Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (2007) 159 FCR 397 at [97] (cited with approval in Bodum at [193] (Greewood J, Tracey J agreeing at [272])): Both in the context of Part V of the [Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth)] and the common law tort of passing off, trade indicia other than names and logos can become associated with a particular trader, such that a use by another trader could give rise to misleading or deceptive conduct or passing off. If particular branding elements used by a trader have been identified in a special way with that trader in the minds of the members of the public, there may be misleading or deceptive conduct by reason of the appropriation of those particular branding elements by another trader. 22    In that case, the Full Court concluded that the primary judge had erred in rejecting expert opinion evidence to support claims by Cadbury that it had achieved a substantial, exclusive and valuable reputation and goodwill throughout Australia in the colour Cadbury Purple. 23    Unilever accepted that the “get up” of a product could become associated with a particular trader, such that its use by another could involve misleading or deceptive conduct or passing off. 24    A product can be misleading despite the use of branding: see Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd v Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1228 at [66], (2001) 53 IPR 481 at 513 (“Red Bull”); WD & HO Wills (Australia) Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd (1997) 39 IPR 356; and Kettle Chip Co Pty Ltd v Apand Pty Limited (1993) 46 FCR 152. However, in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd (1982) 149 CLR 191, Gibbs CJ said at 199-200: Speaking generally, the sale by one manufacturer of goods which closely resemble those of another manufacturer is not a breach of s 52 if the goods are properly labelled. There are hundreds of ordinary articles of consumption which, although made by different manufacturers and of different quality, closely resemble one another…the normal and reasonable way to distinguish one product from another is by marks, brands or labels. If an article is properly labelled so as to show the name of the manufacturer or the source of the article its close resemblance to another article will not mislead an ordinary reasonable member of the public. Assessment of claims 25    In Viti at [31], Bennett J said: The determination of passing off and of contravention of the [Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth)] and the [Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW)] is assessed as a matter of impression based on recollection of the [first product’s] get-up and the [second product’s] get-up. Whether a get-up so nearly resembles another as to be deceptive or likely to deceive is a question for the Court ([Interlego AG v Croner Trading Pty Limited (1992) 39 FCR 348] at 387). The packaging must be viewed as a whole (Sterling Winthrop Pty Limited v R & C Products Pty Ltd [[1994] FCA 1000] (1994) ATPR 41,308 at 42,126). It is not a question of comparing the [products] side by side and engaging in a minute and detailed analysis of the similarities and differences. 26    In Schweppes Ltd v Gibbens (1905) 22 RPC 601, Lord Lindley said at 607: It appears to me that the real answer to the appellants’ case is this — that they invite your Lordships to look, not at the whole get-up, but at that part of the get-up which suits their case. The resemblances here are obvious enough, but, unfortunately for the appellants, so are the differences. The differences are not concealed; they are quite as conspicuous as the resemblances. If you look at the whole get-up, and not only at that part of it in which the resemblances are to be found, the whole get-up does not deceive. 27    In Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCAFC 157 at [133], Weinberg and Dowsett JJ said that a potential purchaser does not come to a decision with the benefit of argument as to the similarities and differences between two get-ups but is likely to make his or her decision in a relatively short period of time and in conditions which may vary.  Evidence 28    Revlon relied on affidavit evidence from Tracey Raso, the Marketing Director of Revlon, Mina Heebyung Chae, an Associate Brand Manager of Revlon Consumer Products Corporation based in New York and Christopher Jurgens, the Operations Director of Revlon. 29    Unilever relied on affidavit evidence from four witnesses. 30    There was no cross-examination.  The packaging 31    All clinical protection products sold in Australia are packaged in an outer box, reflecting their status as “niche” and “top end” products. The products and packaging features first used by Unilever 32    Unilever observed that the Mitchum Clinical products share the following features with the Rexona clinical protection products sold in the Australian market prior to January 2014: a.    The products are a soft solid cream;  b.    The products are marketed and sold in a canister (or applicator) contained within separate cardboard packaging; c.    The products are significantly more expensive than most other anti-perspirant deodorants; d.    The word “Clinical” appears prominently on the internal and external packaging for each product; and e.    each product contains, as an active ingredient, aluminium zirconium tetrachlorydrexgly (“AZAG”). Mitchum Clinical packaging 33    Ms Chae’s evidence was directed to the development of the Mitchum Clinical packaging. Exhibited to her affidavit was a design brief which identified efficacy and a “very distinctive” colour green (“Mitchum green”) as “core assets” of the Mitchum brand. The design brief stated that Mitchum’s main communication comes from the pack and point of sale. Also exhibited to Ms Chae’s affidavit was a market research report obtained by Revlon to evaluate consumer perception of design options for the Mitchum Clinical packaging.  34    Ms Chae’s evidence was that the “M” shape on the coloured arches that were referred to before this court as the “Mitchum Three Toned Triangles” and the shape of the “M” in the Mitchum brand name were designed to mimic each other, in a deliberate attempt to create a recognisable link between the shape of the arches and the Mitchum brand name. 35    Revlon relies on the following visual features of the Mitchum Clinical packaging. It comprises a box with: a.    A curved line travelling from the bottom left corner to the right side of the front face and a curved line travelling from the bottom right corner to the left side of the front face, leaving three triangular shapes, each of which is filled in with a different coloured tone (“Mitchum Three Toned Triangles”), the colours varying depending on the variant; b.    Fine silver foiling outlining the three sectors of the Mitchum Three Toned Triangles; c.    The background of the upper section of the front face, being a white colour (for the women’s variants) or a silver colour (for the men’s variants), with the lower portion of the front face being the colour-coded Mitchum Three Toned Triangles, the colours varying depending on the variant; d.    The brand name “Mitchum Clinical”; e.    Written text; and  f.    An oxygen symbol. 36    Each of the four variants features a different colour scheme, using two tones of one colour and the Mitchum green colour (dark for men and light for women), which is said to allow the consumer to identify their preferred variants and to tie them all together as parts of the Mitchum Clinical range when forming a block at point of sale. Revlon contends that the “Mitchum Three Toned Triangles” are likely to be recalled by the consumer, as the most distinctive design element on the packaging. The design element is reinforced by its appearance on the front face of the canister and other products, such as Mitchum Advanced 100ml roll-on.  37    Unilever argued that Revlon did not specify whether the reputation sought to be protected is said to include as an element the particular colour schemes for the four variants; the notion of four colour schemes; or colour schemes that conform to the set of rules put forward by Ms Raso, being two tones of a colour and a contrast colour, with a different colour scheme for each stock keeping unit. At a final hearing, it will probably be necessary to clarify at least whether the use of Mitchum green is an essential element of the Mitchum Clinical get-up.  New Rexona packaging 38    Revlon contends that the New Rexona Packaging has the following visual features: a.    Curved line travelling from the bottom left corner to the right side of the front face and a curved line travelling from the bottom right corner to the left side of the front face, leaving three triangular shapes, each of which is filled in with a different coloured tone (“Rexona Three Toned Triangles); b.    Fine silver foiling outlining the three sectors of the Rexona Three Toned Triangles; c.    The background of the upper portion of the front face being a white colour, with the lower portion of the front face being the colour-coded Rexona Three Toned Triangles, the colour varying depending on the variant; d.    The brand name “Rexona”; e.    Written text; and f.    A “tick” device. 39    A particular complaint made by Revlon is that, in some cases, the New Rexona Packaging has been displayed with a “shelf flash” or “wobbler” identifying it as a “new” product.  Revlon’s reputation in Australia in Mitchum Clinical products  40    Revlon claims to have acquired a substantial and valuable reputation in Australia in Mitchum Clinical products and the Mitchum Clinical packaging. The relevant time for assessing the reputation is July 2014: see Viti at [57]. The reputation is alleged to have arisen principally from: a.    The distribution and sale of the Mitchum Clinical products in Australia since January 2014, noting that Revlon alleges approximately 200,000 units sold since January 2014; b.    The unique features of the Mitchum Clinical packaging; c.    The typical display of the products at the point of sale and the widespread sale of the products, through approximately 1,900 retail outlets throughout Australia; d.    The substantial and widespread promotion and advertising of the Mitchum Clinical products since January 2014, featuring pack shots of the Mitchum Clinical packaging and the Mitchum Clinical canister. 41    Revlon now estimates that it has a 13.5% share of the clinical anti-perspirant deodorant market and up to 25% share of clinical anti-perspirant product sales through Woolworths. It submits that these figures show that consumer recognition and awareness of the Mitchum Clinical brand has grown significantly since January 2014 and most rapidly since the advertising campaign over the May/June period. 42    Revlon contends that its advertising campaign has educated consumers to look for a new clinical deodorant in outer box packaging, featuring get-up with the “Mitchum Three Toned Triangles”. Its evidence is that the appearance of the packaging is given particular prominence in the advertising campaign, in accordance with common practice in advertising new products so that a consumer who is persuaded to “give it a try” picks up the right product. 43    Senior counsel for Unilever, Mr Cobden SC, emphasised that the relevant reputation is not in the Mitchum, or Mitchum Clinical brand, but in the get up of Mitchum Clinical.  44    In Mars at [13], Perram J noted that the identification of a trade reputation may be proved by brand specialists as well as evidence about the reactions of randomly selected shoppers to the brands in question. At [14], Perram J noted that evidence before him about marketing of relevant products was of little assistance in determining which elements of the product packaging were the ones that, in the public mind, had a reputation. 45    Revlon did not rely upon expert or survey evidence beyond the evidence of its own marketing director. I read her opinions as submissions but did not admit them on the interlocutory hearing as expert evidence.  46    Counsel for Revlon, Mr Hall, submitted that reputation is traditionally established by a “two-pronged attack”, showing extent of advertising and extent of sales. I accept that Revlon has conducted a significant advertising campaign to promote Mitchum Clinical products, particularly during the months of May and June 2014. However, without reference to authorities supporting Mr Hall’s submission, I am not convinced that the evidence of advertising and sales permits any inference to be drawn as to the existence of a significant and valuable reputation in Mitchum Clinical products and the Mitchum Clinical packaging, as distinct from the brand names “Mitchum Clinical” and “Mitchum”. This is particularly so where the product has only been in the market for seven months. 47    It may be possible to adduce further evidence about these matters at the final hearing. However, in my view, Revlon has not demonstrated a significant likelihood that it will succeed on the first element of its case, namely, that the features of the Mitchum Clinical packaging have become sufficiently distinctive and associated in the minds of a substantial number of potential purchasers so that Revlon could be said to have acquired a relevant trade reputation. Passing off or misleading or deceptive conduct: consideration of packaging 48    My conclusion on the first element of Revlon’s case is, strictly speaking, sufficient to dispose of the application. However, in case I am wrong in my conclusion about the strength of Revlon’s case on reputation, I now consider the other elements of the case. 49    The parties disagreed as to the correct identification of the class of prospective purchasers. Ms Raso gave the following evidence: The broad target market for the Mitchum Clinical product line is women and men aged 20-49 years of age, with a particular focus on women aged 30-45 years old, who perceive themselves as sweating heavily (or at least more than the average person), or as having a problem associated with sweat and odour. They are also seeking greater protection and peace of mind, and want to be able to go about their day without having to worry about sweat and odour. The advertising for Mitchum Clinical has been targeted at women as it is women who make up a high proportion of the clinical segment, and women predominantly do the grocery shopping for themselves and others (such as husbands, sons and daughters) within the target market. 50    The parties also made conflicting submissions about the likely approach of a consumer to the purchase of a clinical protection product, which might bear upon the manner of assessment of the packaging. Revlon submitted that anti-perspirant deodorants are generally a quick impulse purchase. Customers in a hurried supermarket environment wishing to purchase Mitchum Clinical (or the new clinical anti-perspirant deodorant that they had seen advertised), could easily purchase Rexona Clinical by mistake. Unilever submitted that the purchase of a clinical protection product, being three times the price of an ordinary deodorant at around $15 per unit and purchased for a particular personal hygiene reason, was unlikely to be an impulse purchase and was most likely to be made on the basis of brand name.  51    For the purposes of assessing Revlon’s case, I have proceeded on the basis that the class of prospective purchasers comprises Revlon’s broad target market. I have also proceeded on the basis that the purchasing decision in this case is likely to be made in a relatively short period of time and in conditions which may vary.  52    According to Revlon, there is a high risk of consumer confusion between the Mitchum Clinical packaging and the New Rexona Packaging. Relevant factors are: a.    The hurried supermarket environment; b.    The relative frequency of re-purchase (said to be approximately once every three months); c.    The likelihood that the product would be an impulse purchase; d.    That consumers look for key visual triggers such as the “Mitchum Three Toned Triangles”; e.    The likelihood that the product would be purchased quickly, in no more than two minutes; f.    The typical close proximity between the products on supermarket shelves; and  g.    Lack of uniformity of supermarket shelf arrangements of products. 53    Revlon contended that, by reason of the similarity between the New Rexona Packaging and the Mitchum Clinical packaging, consumers “might perceive a range of associations between the two products or their distributors”. Revlon identified scenarios in which a consumer might be misled: for example, a repeat purchaser of a Mitchum Clinical product who, at point of sale, recalls the use of the “Mitchum Three Toned Triangles” as an identifier of the Mitchum Clinical brand as a whole and thinks that new variants have been added. 54    Revlon argued that the ordinary reasonable consumer is likely to have an imperfect recollection of the Mitchum outer product packaging. First time purchasers are likely to consider a “conversion purchase” once their current deodorant is finished and not immediately upon seeing the Mitchum advertising campaign. Similarly, repeat purchasers are likely to have an imperfect recollection of the Mitchum outer product packaging. 55    Mr Cobden SC emphasised that the evaluation of the packaging should not focus on a comparison between the Mitchum Three Toned Triangles and the Rexona Three Toned Triangles. Rather, he submitted that I should look at the whole of the packaging that forms the “get-up”. 56    When I was first shown the Mitchum Clinical packaging together with the New Rexona Packaging, I thought that the degree of similarity was striking. However, the boxes were shown to me from the Bar table and, at that distance, I could not read any of the print on the packaging, including the brand names. 57    Assessing the packages as a matter of impression, but sufficiently closely to be able to read them, in my opinion, the single most obvious feature in each case is the brand name. For Revlon, this comprises the words “Mitchum Clinical” in Mitchum green font (dark for men’s variants and light for women’s variants). For Unilever, this comprises the word Rexona underneath a very large tick, both in a dark blue font. In each case, the brand name appears in large font on both the front and the top of the boxes. 58    Revlon contended that the presence of the brand name “Rexona” and the Rexona “tick” device on the New Rexona Packaging do not necessarily obviate the risk of confusion. However, their prominence cannot be overlooked in an assessment of the overall packaging. That prominence is enhanced by the fact that both Mitchum and Rexona are very well known trade-marks. 59    The second most obvious feature is the shared use of the word “Clinical”. On the Mitchum Clinical packaging, this forms part of the brand name. On the New Rexona Packaging, the words “Clinical Protection” appear in capitals immediately under the brand “Rexona”. 60    Another prominent feature of the Mitchum Clinical packaging is the use of Mitchum green (dark for men’s variants and light for women’s variants). For each variant, this colour is used on the top of the box, in one of the coloured triangles on the front of the box and for the majority of the words on the front of the box.  61    The Mitchum Clinical packaging also identifies the men’s variants with the word “men” at the top of the front of the box and the women’s variants with the word “women” at the top of the front of the box. In contrast, the Rexona New Packaging does not refer to either men or women but has a graphic of a woman on the side of the box. Rexona’s clinical protection products for men are not packaged in the Rexona New Packaging. 62    Other features of the Mitchum Clinical packaging which tend to differentiate it from the New Rexona Packaging are: a.    The use of the large gold oxygen symbol in the centre of the front of the box; b.    The use of a silver box for the men’s variants; c.    The taller boxes; 63    A differentiating feature of the New Rexona packaging is Rexona’s use in the bottom triangle of the words “DOCTOR RECOMMENDED” encircled by a symbol containing in very small font “No 1 Deodorant Brand in the World”. 64    The main similarities in the packaging are the prominent use of the word “CLINICAL” and the triangular graphics on the bottom halves of the boxes, that is, the Mitchum Three Toned Triangles and the Revlon Three Toned Triangles. However, the shapes of the triangular graphics are significantly different, as is the use of the Mitchum green in the Mitchum Three Toned Triangles but not the Revlon Three Toned Triangles.  65    My impression is that the similarities do not detract from the overall distinctiveness between the two forms of packaging, which is derived from the brand names and the other differentiating features mentioned above. I conclude that, on the available evidence, it is possible but unlikely that the ordinary or reasonable consumer within Revlon’s broad target market would confuse the Mitchum Clinical packaging with the New Rexona Packaging. If they were confused, it is fairly unlikely that they would be misled or likely to be misled into believing that the products were associated because of the distinctive differences in the packaging, particularly the prominent use of brand names on each product and the use of Mitchum green on the Mitchum Clinical packaging.  Likelihood of damage to Revlon by reason of erroneous beliefs 66    I accept that there is a reasonable likelihood of damage to Revlon if the New Rexona Packaging amounts to passing off, or involves misleading or deceptive conduct on the part of Unilever. I did not understand Unilever to argue to the contrary, although no concession was made about whether any material harm would be suffered.  67    Ms Raso gave evidence that very significant harm would be done to the Mitchum Clinical brand if its capacity to link consumers, who have seen its advertising and are prepared to try the product, to the correct pack is impaired. Such harm includes erosion of market share and loss of sales, lost or misappropriated investment by Unilever and “misattribution” of brand awareness. No attempt was made to quantify the harm. 68    Although I accept that there is a reasonable likelihood of harm to Revlon if it is able to establish the first two elements of its claim, the extent of any impact is unknown. Unilever’s purpose in adopting the New Rexona Packaging 69    Revlon referred to the following statement of Dixon and McTiernan JJ in Australian Woollen Mills Ltd v FS Walton & Co Ltd (1937) 58 CLR 641 at 657: The rule that if a mark or get-up for goods is adopted for the purpose of appropriating part of the trade or reputation of a rival, it should be presumed to be fitted for the purpose and therefore likely to deceive or confuse, no doubt, is as just in principle as it is wholesome in tendency. In a question how possible or prospective buyers will be impressed by a given picture, word or appearance, the instinct and judgment of traders is not to be lightly rejected, and when a dishonest trader fashions an implement or weapon for the purpose of misleading potential customers he at least provides a reliable and expert opinion on the question whether what he has done is in fact likely to deceive. 70    At the hearing, counsel for Revlon, Mr Hall, disavowed a case of “dishonest trader”, but submitted that Unilever had deliberately adopted the new packaging “with intention of appropriating part of the trade or reputation of a rival”. 71    I do not doubt Mr Hall’s submission that Unilever has made a “coordinated response” to the launch of Mitchum Clinical products in Australia. Nor do I doubt the general proposition that Unilever’s response is intended to recover market share lost to Revlon by the launch of Mitchum Clinical. However, I do not infer from the material pointed to by Revlon that Unilever sought to erode the distinctiveness of the Mitchum Clinical packaging by the New Rexona Packaging. This was the stated basis for a finding of the relevant intention. It follows that I am not satisfied that Unilever’s adoption of the New Rexona Packaging was for the purpose of appropriating part of the trade or reputation of Revlon by eroding the distinctiveness of the Mitchum Clinical packaging.  72    I reject the submission that Unilever “delayed for 6 months while Mitchum built its presence in the market, before deciding to launch their new packaging”. There was no evidence of any deliberate delay on Unilever’s part. Discretionary considerations 73    In my opinion, the following discretionary considerations weigh strongly against the grant of interlocutory relief.  First, on the available evidence, Revlon’s case is weak. In my view, even if the relevant reputation is established, it is fairly unlikely that a reasonable consumer in the relevant class would be misled by the similarities between the Mitchum and New Rexona Packaging, for the reasons I have given above. Second, the final hearing is due to commence in less than one month. Third, if interlocutory relief were granted, there is a real likelihood of disruption to the market by temporary unavailability of the Rexona clinical protection products for women. (Men would probably not be affected because Rexona has not changed the packaging of its men’s variants, a point which Revlon relies on in its favour on the balance of convenience). Ms Raso’s evidence is that women make up a high proportion of consumers of clinical protection products. The potential cost to Unilever of responding to an injunction, by re-packaging, is significant but I have not taken this into account because Unilever made a deliberate decision to launch its New Rexona Packaging in the face of the Mitchum Clinical packaging. 74    On the other hand, if interlocutory relief is not granted, then prospective purchasers will continue to be adversely affected by any passing off or misleading or deceptive conduct eventually found to have occurred after a final hearing.  Further, Revlon may suffer from the erosion of the distinctiveness of its product and be disadvantaged in its efforts to launch the Mitchum Clinical range.  It was also submitted that it would be difficult or impossible to assess the damages caused by any harm Revlon is found to have suffered.  75    These considerations in favour of interlocutory relief are material. However, ultimately, even if there is a prima facie case of either passing off or misleading or deceptive conduct, I would not grant relief because the extent to which prospective purchasers may be misled is unclear, the extent of likely harm to Revlon is unknown and the parties will have a final hearing in less than one month. Conclusion The application for interlocutory relief should be dismissed.      I certify that the preceding seventy-five (75) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gleeson.

WHERE MADE:  MELBOURNE     THE COURT DECLARES THAT:  1.    The Respondent has, in trade or commerce: 1.1    Engaged in conduct that was misleading and deceptive and was likely to mislead or deceive, in contravention of ss 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (“the Act”); and 1.2    In connection with the supply and possible supply, and in connection with the promotion of the supply of

the Respondent inserted the name of one of her garments followed by a question mark; 1.4    On or before 2 September 2010, updating or causing to be updated her Facebook page, and in the album under the heading “The most sincere form of flattery?”, posting 8 photographs of models wearing White Sands garments (“White Sands Photographs”) alongside the Seafolly Photographs with each pair of photos bearing the captions “White Sands as seen at RAFW in May – Seafolly September 2010” or “White Sands 2009 – Seafolly 2010”; 1.5    On 2 and 3 September 2010, publishing or causing to be published comments on her personal Facebook page and the White Sands Facebook page the comments set out at [10] – [12] and [23] of the reasons below; 1.6    On or before 2 September 2010, sending or causing to

Note:    Entry of orders is dealt with in Rule 39.32 of the Federal Court Rules 2011    IN THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA     VICTORIA DISTRICT REGISTRY     GENERAL DIVISION  VID 764 of 2010      BETWEEN:  SEAFOLLY PTY LTD (ACN 001 537 748) Applicant    AND:  LEAH MADDEN Respondent      JUDGE:  TRACEY J   DATE:  29 November 2012   PLACE:  MELBOURNE     REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 1    Since the commencement of uniform defamation laws in Australia, companies with ten or more employees have been unable to prosecute proceedings for defamation. This case illustrates the difficulties now confronted by such companies when their commercial reputations are called into question. 2    The applicant (“Seafolly”) alleges that the respondent, Ms Leah Madden, has made a number of serious and false allegations against it. These allegations relate to the provenance of designs of ladies’ swimwear marketed by Seafolly. Put simply, Seafolly claims that Ms Madden has made public statements which suggest wrongly that Seafolly has copied some of her designs.  THE BACKGROUND FACTS 3    The genesis of the present dispute can be traced back to 1 September 2010 although it was influenced by Ms Madden’s perception of events which had occurred earlier in that year.  4    On 1 September 2010, Ms Madden saw a copy of the September/October edition of a magazine called “The Gold Coast Panache”. The front cover was dominated by a picture of a well known model, Samantha Harris, who was, at the time, an “ambassador” for Seafolly. Ms Madden claimed that her immediate thought was that Ms Harris was wearing one of her (Ms Madden’s) creations known as the ‘High Society Bikini’. On turning to an inside page, however, Ms Madden discovered that Ms Harris was wearing a Seafolly ‘Goddess’ bikini. Ms Madden considered that the Seafolly garment was remarkably similar to her own design. 5    Ms Madden recalled that, earlier in the year, she had some dealings with Ms  Julie McLaren. Ms McLaren had become an employee of Seafolly in about 2001. In her role as an Account Manager she had handled the account for the retail outlets conducted by Sunburn Company Pty Ltd (“Sunburn”). In 2009 Seafolly had acquired a 68% interest in Sunburn. Shortly afterwards Ms McLaren was employed as a buyer by Sunburn.  6    In May 2010, the Rosemount Australian Fashion Week (“RAFW”) was held. This event was one of the premier occasions for the promotion of swimwear for the forthcoming season. It was attended by designers, wholesalers and retailers. It provided the opportunity for designers to market their ranges to retail chains. 7    On 6 May 2010, Ms McLaren attended a pre-arranged buying appointment with Ms Madden at a Sydney hotel. They met in a suite. Ms Madden showed Ms McLaren samples of her White Sands swimwear range. Some of the garments were worn by a model who was present. Ms McLaren took some photographs on her Blackberry phone. On the following day Ms McLaren attended a ramp presentation of the White Sands range. Again she took some photographs on her Blackberry phone. 8    During their meeting Ms McLaren told Ms Madden that she liked some of the garments which she had seen but budgetary constraints were likely to make the placing of any orders difficult. Despite some follow-up contact by e-mail from Ms Madden, Ms McLaren placed no orders for White Sands products. Nor did she respond to the e-mails. 9    In July 2010, a major international swimwear show took place in Miami in the United States. Both Seafolly and White Sands ranges were on display. Each company had a booth or a stand at the show. As Ms Madden passed the Seafolly stand she saw Ms McLaren wearing a Seafolly badge. Ms McLaren explained that, because she had previously worked for Seafolly, she had been asked to help out at the Miami show. Her attendance in Miami had been paid for by Seafolly.  10    On 1 and 2 September 2010, Ms Madden posted on her personal Facebook page an album of photos under the heading “The most sincere form of flattery?”  This caption was featured on each page of the album.  On the front page of the album appeared seven photographs of Seafolly garments.  Each of these photographs was taken from Seafolly's 2010 catalogue or from Seafolly's website or both.  There was a caption below the photographs which stated “Why allowing 'buyers' to photograph your collection at RAFW can be a bad idea”.  Below this caption were the following comments, among others, from Ms Madden (Facebook user name “Leah Madden” or “White Sands Swimwear Australia”) and other Facebook users:   “Leah Madden Seriously, almost an entire line-line ripoff of my Shipwrecked collection.  …  Leah Madden I know, the buyer from 'sunburn' (who, as it turns out, works for seafolly)  Came to my suite at RAFW and photographed every one of these styles.   Yvonne Yeo Nasty! Shame on 'em!  Won't be buying Seafolly. WHITESANDS all the way. X    Danielle Maree Bourke seafolly own everything!  sunburn, miraclesuit and gottex and they used to own jets but sold it recently! and unfortunately they do rip off everyone, they have copied a design 2 chillies has been doing for years! a little frilly triangle, its so bad!  Leah Madden Ripping off is always going to happen, but sending in a dummy 'buyer' to get photos is super sneaky!  …  Susan Gallagher Disgusting!  How people look at themselves in the mirror is beyond me.  You do what you do Leah and forget them.  They don’t (sic) run their businesses with style and class not to mention principles and ethics .....  Maria is right it will bite them in the bum one day ..... how bout you post a list of your stockists so I can email it to my friends list ;)   Zoe Emma Teasey well that is why you are always a step ahead! Take it as a compliment for now and NEVER allow them to come to another one of your shows with a camera!:) 11    Under the comments appeared a larger version of each of the seven photographs which depicted Seafolly garments. Under each Ms Madden inserted the name of one of her garments followed by a question mark. Ms Madden said that she wrote these names because she considered that they were her styles which she considered looked similar to the particular Seafolly costume. The successive photos had written below them:     Noemi?     Eshter?     Nelly?     Shelly?     Sylvia?     Anne?     Gracie? Below the photograph titled “Anne?” the following comments appeared:  “White Sands Swimwear Australia Lucy and Holly!!  These are the ripoffs Seafolly did! Jeeze, you girls.  We have them in Black, in store now:)   White Sands Swimwear Australia Even the lazer (sic) cut ruffle is a perfect copy!!!  Gemma hand drew lace that (sic) for this style!”  12    Some time prior to 2.51 pm on 2 September 2010, Ms Madden updated her personal Facebook page and posted the eight White Sands Photographs alongside the Seafolly Photographs referred to in paragraph [11] above. Each set of photographs bore the caption “White Sands as seen at RAFW in May - Seafolly September 2010” or “White Sands 2009 - Seafolly 2010”.  Ms Madden posted the following further comments on her Facebook page:  •    “Why allowing 'buyers' to photograph your collection at RAFW can be a bad idea”;   and, on her White Sands Facebook page:  •    “It wasn't a photographer. I had a private showing with a 'buyer' who came with a digital camera and took photos.  As it turned out, that 'buyer' was Julie McLaren from Seafolly:(  She also requested a seat at the show for her boss, Anth ...”  It will be convenient, in these reasons, to refer to the Facebook postings which have been described in this and the preceding paragraph as “Ms Madden’s Facebook postings.” At the relevant time, Ms Madden had 518 “friends” on her personal Facebook page. 13    At 2:00 pm on 2 September 2010, Ms Madden sent an e-mail from wholesale@whitesandsaustralia.com to:      a journalist from the Sunday Telegraph newspaper;      journalists from the ""Pedestrian TV"" fashion industry publication;      the fashion industry publication ""Ragtrader"";      the publishing company ""Focal Attractions"";      the “Gold Coast Bulletin"";      writer@socialistmedia.com; and      her public relations agent Danijela Terzic.  14    At 2.48 pm Ms Madden also sent a copy of this e-mail to the Daily Telegraph/Sunday Telegraph newspaper.   15    The e-mail had the subject line “The most sincere form of flattery?” followed by the following words: “Is it just us, or has Seafolly taken a little to (sic) much ‘inspiration’ from White Sands?”.  Attached to the e-mail were eight photographs depicting a model wearing “White Sands” garments alongside a number of the Seafolly photographs. Each photograph bore the caption “White Sands as seen at RAFW in May - Seafolly September 2010” or “White Sands 2009 - Seafolly 2010”. These pages appeared in identical layout to those in Ms Madden’s Facebook postings, as follows (with the names of the various creations and their creator added):                                 I will refer to the e-mail containing these photographs and statements as “the 2 September e-mail.” 16    In the afternoon of 2 September 2010, the online publication “Pedestrian TV” published an article titled White Sands Swimwear Calls Seafolly Plagiarists.  This article was circulated to Seafolly's media relations agency by means of an e-mail from Pedestrian Daily News to Alex Losung sent at 4.53 pm on 2 September 2010 listing the headlines of the “Daily Pedestrian” news for 2 September 2010.  One of the Daily Pedestrian headlines listed in the email was titled WHITE SANDS SWIMWEAR ACCUSE SEAFOLLY OF COPYING.  17    Following the dissemination of the e-mail, the publication of the statements on Ms Madden’s personal and White Sands Facebook pages and the publication of the Pedestrian TV article, Seafolly's media relations agency Torstar Communications received a substantial number of telephone calls and e-mails about Ms Madden’s statements. 18    At 5.26 pm on 2 September 2010, a fashion industry publication ""Ragtrader"" forwarded the e-mail to Torstar Communications, which then forwarded it to Seafolly. Seafolly was told by its media relations agent that ""Ragtrader"" was going to run a story on the allegations made by Ms Madden against Seafolly and that Seafolly had until 7:00 pm on 2 September 2011 to submit a statement to Ragtrader before it published its story, and that Daily Pedestrian was also going to run a story on the allegations made by Ms Madden against Seafolly.   19    On the evening of 2 September 2010, Seafolly issued a press release about the allegation (“Seafolly’s first press release”).  The press release was sent to Pedestrian TV and Ragtrader.  It read, in part:  “Earlier today Seafolly became aware that Leah Madden of White Sands Swimwear has made allegations on her facebook page that Seafolly has copied 7 of her swimwear designs. Ms Madden has posted on her facebook page reproductions of photographs from Seafolly’s catalogue showing the Seafolly garments which she claims are copies of swimwear garments designed by White Sands Swimwear. Seafolly has also become aware that Ms Madden has sent e-mails to media outlets attaching Seafolly’s photographs together with photographs of the White Sands Swimwear garments making these allegations of copying.   Seafolly denies these claims and says that they are completely false and without foundation and says that the claims have been made maliciously to injure Seafolly. Seafolly will be taking immediate action to cause Ms Madden to withdraw these allegations. Seafolly notes that many of the designs which Ms Madden claims Seafolly has copied were released into the marketplace by Seafolly before White Sands Swimwear released its relevant swimwear garment. Seafolly also says that the other designs which Seafolly is alleged to have copied were substantially progressed in development prior to White Sands Swimwear releasing it (sic) relevant swimwear garments into the market place.” The press release was authorised by Mr Anthony Halas, the Chief Executive Officer of Seafolly. 20    At about 7:00 pm, Ms Madden took down the postings on her website. 21    Later that evening, the fashion publication Ragtrader published an article entitled “EXCLUSIVE Seafolly v White Sands:  Swim labels at arms”.  Shortly prior to the release of the Ragtrader article, Ragtrader contacted Ms Madden and advised her that Ragtrader had received a statement by Seafolly's lawyers.  22    At 7.24 pm on 2 September 2010, Seafolly's solicitors filed a copyright complaint notification with Facebook in respect to the Seafolly Photographs posted by Ms Madden seeking the removal of that content from Facebook.  On 3 September 2010, Facebook sent Seafolly's solicitors an e-mail confirming that it had removed the relevant content from Facebook. 23    On or before 3 September 2010, Ms Madden posted a number of comments on the White Sands Australia Swimwear Facebook page.  They were: •    “Thank you for your kind support, FYI, It wasn't US that said Plagiarist!” followed by a link to Pedestrian TV article “White Sands Swimwear Calls Seafolly Plagiarists” and one of the Seafolly Photographs next to one of the White Sands Photographs; and   •    “…It wasn’t a photographer. I had a private showing with a ‘buyer’ who came with a digital camera and took photos. As it turned out, that ‘buyer’ was Julie McLaren from Seafolly :(She also requested a seat at the show for her boss, Anth ...”. [This comment was posted in response to a message from Zoe Emma Teasey asking “Did a photographer really come to your showing?”]; and   •    “White Sands Australia says: ‘bullies be gone and take your bully tactics with you! We tiny little fledgling designers will not be taken advantage of!’” I will refer to this publication as “the White Sands Facebook posting.” At the relevant time, White Sands had 3,535 “friends” on its Facebook page. 24    During the morning of 3 September 2010, Ms Madden told a journalist from Ragtrader that she could quote Ms Madden as saying that “I am also not claiming outright copying, just questioning the issue of similarity, in light of the fact that they requested the viewing earlier in the year”.  25    On 3 September 2010, Seafolly, through its solicitors, sent a letter of demand to Ms Madden.  It alleged infringement of Seafolly’s legal rights and demanded that Ms Madden remove the allegedly offending material from her website and that of Seafolly, provide a written apology acknowledging that the representations appearing in the e-mails were false and provide an undertaking not to republish such statements. 26    Ms Madden responded to the letter of demand on the same day by e-mail to Seafolly's solicitors. Ms Madden stated:  “It would be really helpful if you could indicate where any representative of White Sands has claimed ‘copying’. I realise that others have said this, but am not aware of this word being used by anyone from White Sands. Are you referring to ‘The most sincere form of flattery?’ as this is a question, not a statement.   Any comments made or questions posed, on my personal facebook page were personal, not for publication, and were removed yesterday, as were all images.   I will forward your email to my solicitor, whom I am sure will be in contact if he believes it is necessary.” 27    Ms Madden then sent a further e-mail to Melinda Oliver of Ragtrader on 3 September 2010 which stated:  “I really need to clarify that White Sands has at no stage accused Seafolly of ‘repeatedly ripping of’ (sic) designs. Those words did not come from me or anyone on my team. Which is why earlier today I gave the the (sic) quote ‘I am not claiming outright copying, just questioning the issue of similarity, in light of the fact that they requested the viewing earlier in the year.’  I did not offer those words to inflame the situation.   The comparisons have been made, and can not be undone, but at no stage has  anyone of my team claimed plagiarism. Wherever possible would you please clarify  this, as I am sure Seafolly would appreciate it as much as I would.” 28    On 3 September 2010, Ragtrader published a further article about this dispute on its website, titled “EXCLUSIVE White Sands speaks out”.  29    Ms Madden has discovered Facebook messages on a confidential basis that she sent and received on 3 September 2010, and in the early morning of 4 September 2010. The messages passed between Ms Madden’s White Sands Facebook account and Ms Zoe Teasey’s personal Facebook account. The first message, sent at 9:31 am on 3 September, was sent to Ms Teasey by Ms Madden. It said: “Can you do me a massive favour, and ask me on facebook if a seafolly staff member DID pose as a buyer to photograph the collection? At least then I can get it out there in a legitimate forum!”   Ms Teasey replied in the following terms:  “Yes on this account or on your personal account? What is your PR saying? Maybe they should issue a press release ASAP and have something printed! … No it is fine I will post something!”  Ms Madden then sent a message to Charles Kelly at 12:47 am on 4 September in similar terms as follows:  “help! Can you do me a massive favour and pose the question about seafolly posing as buyers and photographing the collection? I have told them I won’t make a statement, but I really need to get that part out there! Hopefully seafolly will be forced to answer that question at some stage. They have very conveniently ignored that point.”  Mr Kelly immediately responded in terms that suggest he had done so:  “FINALLY they posted my comments (twice – idiots), but I think I made the point clear.”   30    Ms Madden did not comply with Seafolly's demands, and on Monday 6 September 2010, Seafolly issued this proceeding seeking urgent injunctive relief. Ms Madden ultimately consented to an interim order restraining her from:      reproducing or authorising the reproduction of Seafolly’s photographs without the consent of Seafolly; and      making the allegations about copying or aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the making of such allegations.  31    Between 8 and 13 September 2010, Seafolly issued a second press release (“Seafolly’s second press release”). This press release was sent to journalists from Pedestrian TV, The Age, and the Gold Coast Bulletin. It contained the following passages:  “On Thursday 2 September 2010 Seafolly became aware that Ms Madden made allegations on her facebook page that Seafolly copied 8 of her swimwear designs. Ms Madden claimed that Seafolly copied these designs after a buyer from Sunburn (a company partly owned by Seafolly) attended a White Sands Fashion Show in May 2010 and saw the White Sands swimwear on display. Ms Madden posted on her facebook page (without Seafolly’s consent) reproductions of photographs from Seafolly’s catalogue showing the Seafolly garments next to White Sands garments. In addition, Seafolly has become aware that Ms Madden sent emails to media outlets attaching these photographic comparisons and making false allegations of copying.   Seafolly denies these claims and says that they are completely false and without foundation. Seafolly says that these claims have been made maliciously to injure Seafolly and its business. Five of the designs which Ms Madden claims Seafolly has copied were released into the market place by Seafolly in March 2010. One of the designs was released into the marketplace by Seafolly in March 2009. The remaining two designs which Seafolly is alleged to have copied were substantially progressed in development prior to White Sands Swimwear showing these swimwear products to the market. White Sands Swimwear held their fashion parade in May 2010 and as the Seafolly garments alleged to be copies of the White Sands Swimwear garments were either already released to market or nearly completely designed, it is impossible that Seafolly copied the White Sands Swimwear that was on display during this parade.  To clarify further media reports, a Sunburn swimwear buyer attended the White Sands RAFW parade in May 2010. Sunburn is a multi-brand swimwear chain that is partly owned by Seafolly. The Sunburn buyer attended many swimwear brand showings during this time with the intention to purchase product for the Sunburn stores in 2010. Ms Madden was aware that Sunburn is partly owned by Seafolly. During the viewing of the range in May 2010 photographs were taken on a blackberry device by the Sunburn buyer. Taking photographs by buyers is standard practice for the use of referencing when placing orders. These photos were not downloaded. Any allegations that the Sunburn buyer showed photographs of the White Sands garments to employees at Seafolly is totally false.” The press release ended by advising that the present proceeding had been issued. CAUSES OF ACTION 32    Seafolly’s Further Amended Statement of Claim pleaded causes of action:     For misleading and deceptive conduct;      In injurious falsehood; and      For copyright infringement.  33    Ms Madden cross-claimed against Seafolly. Her claims were for defamation and misleading and deceptive conduct. Both were founded on the statements in Seafolly’s press releases that she had made her various allegations against Seafolly with the malicious intent of damaging Seafolly. MISLEADING AND DECEPTIVE CONDUCT – ss 52 and 53 (a) of the trade practices act and their state counterparts 34    Seafolly complained that various statements appearing on Ms Madden’s personal Facebook page, the White Sands Australia Facebook page and in the e-mail sent by Ms Madden to various press outlets (see above at [10]–[12], [23] and [15] respectively) falsely represented that Seafolly:     Had copied Ms Madden’s swimwear designs which appeared in the photographs appearing above at [15];     Seafolly was not the creator of the original “Seafolly” swimwear designs depicted in the various adjoining photographs and that it had copied the White Sands garments; and     Seafolly had used underhanded means (in the taking of photographs by Ms McLaren) to obtain pictures of the White Sands garments and then copied the White Sands garments to create the Seafolly garments from those photographs. 35    These representations were said to have been made in trade or commerce and were misleading and deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive members of the public and consumers of clothing accessories in Australia and were false and misleading. The representations were said to be false and misleading in that:     Seafolly did not copy the White Sands garments;     The Seafolly garments were original designs created by employees of Seafolly and created without reference to the White Sands garments; and     Seafolly did not use underhanded means to obtain photographs of the White Sands garments and did not create the Seafolly garments using such photographs. 36    Ms Madden’s defences to these allegations were multi-layered. She denied that the statements about which complaint is made can fairly be understood as alleging that Seafolly had copied garments which she had created: the statements amounted to no more than expression of her genuinely held opinion as distinct from statements of fact. The Facebook postings were only “up” for a short time (about 30 hours) before they were taken down by Ms Madden. Alternatively, she sought to distinguish between the approach taken on the two Facebook pages and that adopted when she contacted the media outlets. Any allegations of copying were only to be found in the Facebook pages which were only accessible by her “friends”. The e-mail went no further than to raise questions and invite the reader to form his or her own conclusions. Ms Madden further contended that she had not made any of the statements “in trade or commerce”. The legislation 37    In its amended statement of claim, Seafolly relied on ss 38 and 40 of the Fair Trading Act 1989 (Qld) (“the FT Act”). Those provisions relevantly provided that: “38    A person shall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive.  …  40    A person shall not, in trade or commerce, in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services or in connection with the promotion by any means of the supply or use of goods or services – (a)    falsely represent that goods are of a particular standard, quality, value, grade, composition, style or model or have had particular history or particular previous use …”  38    On the first day of the hearing, Seafolly applied to amend its pleadings so that it could also place reliance on ss 42 and 44(a) of the Fair Trading act 1987 (NSW) (“the NSW FT Act”) and ss 52 and 53(a) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (“the TP Act”). Subject to one important exception, these provisions were in substantially the same terms as those appearing in ss 38 and 40(a) of the FT Act. That exception is that ss 52 and 53(a) of the TP Act applied to corporations rather than persons. Given that Ms Madden was not a corporation Seafolly sought to rely on the extended operation of ss 52 and 53(a) which was provided for in s 6(3) of the TP Act. That provision caught conduct which involved the use of telegraphic or telephonic services by an individual. The same facts were relied on by Seafolly to support its claims under the NSW FT Act and the TP Act. In the absence of any prejudice to Ms Madden, leave was granted.  39    All of these provisions have subsequently been repealed and replaced by other, similarly worded provisions in the Australian Consumer Law (“ACL”) with effect from 1 January 2011, which appears as Schedule 2 to the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth). Sections 38 and 40 of the FT Act, sections 42 and 44(a) of the NSW FT Act and sections 52 and 53(a) of the TP Act were all respectively replaced by ss 18 and 29 of the ACL. The transitional provisions in each case provided that the former provisions continued to apply to conduct which occurred prior to the commencement of the new legislation. It will, therefore, be convenient, in these reasons, to continue to refer to the superseded legislation. I will deal first with Seafolly’s claims pursuant to the TP Act. My findings in relation to its state counterparts are set out below at [108]-[109]. The relevant legal principles 40    The principles which govern the application of s 52 of the TP Act are now well established. Relevantly they were conveniently summarised by Weinberg J in CPA Australia Ltd v Dunn (2007) 74 IPR 495 at 500-1 as follows: “[26]    … When determining whether particular conduct was, or is, likely to mislead or deceive it is unnecessary to prove that anyone was actually misled or deceived: Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 198; 42 ALR 1 at 7; 1A IPR 684 at 691. However, evidence that particular individuals have been misled or deceived is admissible, and may be persuasive: Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 87; 55 ALR 25 at 30 (Global Sportsman). The test is objective, and the court must determine the question for itself: Taco Co Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd (1982) 42 ALR 177 at 202. Finally, conduct is likely to mislead or deceive if there is a real and not remote possibility that it will do so. It is not necessary to establish that the degree of likelihood exceeds 50%: Global Sportsman at CLR (sic) 87; ALR 30.  [27]    It is clear that regard must be had to the relevant conduct as a whole, and in context. See generally Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd (2000) 202 CLR 45; 169 ALR 677; 45 IPR 481; [2000] HCA 12. The question whether a representation made by a person to the public, or a section of it, would be likely to mislead or deceive must be answered without regard to whether that person intends to mislead or deceive. It is not a question of whether, if the person makes these representations, he or she would be acting honestly and reasonably. It is simply a question of whether potential members of the class to whom the representations are to be addressed (which include the astute and the gullible, the intelligent and the not so intelligent, and the well educated and the poorly educated) are at serious risk of being misled or deceived: see .au Domain Administration Ltd v Domain Names Australia Pty Ltd (2004) 207 ALR 521; 61 IPR 81; [2004] FCA 424 at [12]-[15] and National Exchange Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2004) 61 IPR 420; 49 ACSR 369; [2004] FCAFC 90 (National Exchange).  [28]    Statements that are capable of more than one meaning may be misleading or deceptive provided that the meaning for which the applicant contends is one that would be reasonable open, and might be drawn by a significant number of those to whom the representation is made. In the same way, a statement may contain a representation that is implied, rather than express. That is why a statement that is literally true can be misleading or deceptive: National Exchange at [48]-[52].”  41    A similar approach has been taken to the construction and application of s 53(a). This paragraph will be contravened if “a representation is in fact not correct … even if it is not false to the knowledge of the person making the representation”: see Given v CV Holland (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1977) 29 FLR 212 at 217. As is the case in relation to s 52, the question of whether a particular statement is misleading is one of fact which is to be determined having regard to the context in which the statement is made and all of the surrounding circumstances. The Court must determine what a reasonable person who is a member of the class to which the representation was directed would reasonably understand it to convey: see Taco Co, supra; Henderson v Pioneer Homes Pty Ltd (No 3) (1980) 43 FLR 276 at 288. Any false representation must be made “in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services”. An immediate causal nexus is not required: see Our Town FM Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (1987) 16 FCR 465 at 479-80. Rather, there needs to be “a substantial relation, in a practical business sense” between the representation and, relevantly, the supply of goods: cf Berry v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1953) 89 CLR 653 at 658-9. Were the statements misleading, deceptive or false? 42    It was not disputed that, if Ms Madden’s statements conveyed the meanings for which Seafolly contended above at [34], they would have been likely to mislead or deceive their readers and were false. 43    In opening Ms Madden’s case senior counsel advised the Court that Ms Madden did not contend that Seafolly had copied her designs. This concession was understandable having regard to the state of the evidence. It was undisputed that six of the eight Seafolly designs which appeared in the Facebook postings and the e-mail (Shimmer/Frill Me, English Rose, Goddess Munroe Maillot, Priscilla Maillot and La Bella Separates (both variants)) were released to the wholesale market no later than March 2010. The development of the other two designs (Goddess Munroe Bustier and Plume Separates) was well advanced in May 2010 and completed shortly thereafter. They were part of a photography “shoot” in June 2010 and released to the wholesale market the following month. In each case the release dates were preceded by design and development work by Seafolly employees. In some instances the items depicted were of Seafolly products which had been on the market for many years but which had been rebadged or reissued. The Shimmer garment, for example, was strikingly similar to an earlier Seafolly product which was marketed as “Frill Me Ruffles Slide Tri” which had first been created in December 2008. It in turn, had been based on an earlier Seafolly product named “Samba Halter Bikini” which had been created in June 2004.  44    Nor did Ms Madden seek to make good a claim that Ms McLaren had attended the private showing and runway event in May 2010 for the purpose of photographing part of Ms Madden’s range or that the photographs taken on these occasions by Ms McLaren were subsequently used by Seafolly to copy the White Sands garments. 45    Ms McLaren was subject to a lengthy cross-examination. At no point was it suggested to her that she had lied in denying these allegations. Her evidence was that she took photographs on her Blackberry machine to assist her in determining whether to place orders for particular designs and that she never downloaded any of the photographs which she took. 46    Ms McLaren impressed me as a truthful witness. She was a good historian who had a clear recollection of relevant events. When giving evidence about related matters she was prepared to make concessions which were not necessarily in Seafolly’s interests. I accept her evidence.  47    It is surprising that, despite her counsel’s statement that she did not contend that Seafolly had copied her designs, Ms Madden, under cross-examination and having heard all of the evidence called by Seafolly, declared that she did not know whether or not Seafolly had so acted. 48    The issue in dispute was whether the impugned statements could fairly be understood as conveying the representations about which Seafolly complained. It is, therefore, necessary to examine the language employed by Ms Madden (read in context), with a view to determining whether the persons to whom her statements were addressed were at risk of being misled or deceived. 49    As already noted the statements which Seafolly contends constitute false representations (which have been identified above at [34]) are to be found on the Facebook pages and in the 2 September e-mail (see above at [10]–[12], [23] and [15] respectively).  50    Upon seeing the photographs in the “Gold Coast Panache” on 1 September 2010, Ms Madden was struck by what she considered to be the similarity between the Seafolly garment being worn by the model and one of her own creations. She made some further comparisons between garments in her range and those in the Seafolly catalogue. She noted what she considered to be a “close similarity” between her garments and Seafolly’s products. She came to the conclusion that Seafolly had copied her designs. So much is evident from statements made in her Facebook posting and the White Sands Facebook posting. 51    Ms Madden’s Facebook postings on 1 and 2 September 2010 contained an album of photographs of Seafolly garments. The heading (which was used repeatedly) was “The most sincere form of flattery?”. This was an evident reference to the well known phrase “imitation is the sincerest form of flattery” which, according to the Oxford dictionary, conveys the meaning that “copying someone or something is an implicit way of paying them a compliment.” The allegation of copying was reinforced by the caption below the photographs which read “why allowing ‘buyers’ to photograph your collection at RAWF can be a bad idea.” This was plainly a reference to Ms McLaren taking photographs at the private showing and the runway show. Ms Madden’s own comments about there having been “almost an entire line-line ripoff (sic)” and that rip offs were “always going to happen, but sending in a dummy ‘buyer’ to get photos is super sneaky!” confirm the allegation of copying. 52    While these statements were made to a limited audience of Ms Madden’s Facebook “friends”, the responses clearly show that these representations were understood by the readers as asserting that Seafolly had engaged in the alleged unethical practices. 53    This impression is reinforced by the additions to the site which occurred on 2 September 2010 in which photographs of Ms Madden’s garments were placed alongside the Seafolly photographs which were said to show the allegedly copied costumes. Under each pair of photographs Ms Madden wrote either “White Sands as seen at RAFW in May – Seafolly September 2010” or “White Sands 2009 – Seafolly 2010.” 54    The 2 September e-mail had as its subject line “The most sincere form of flattery?”. This question was followed by another: “Is it just us, or has Seafolly taken a little to (sic) much ‘inspiration’ from White Sands?” There were attached to the e-mail the eight pairs of photographs with the captions which had appeared on Ms Madden’s Facebook postings. 55    The e-mail was sent to various media outlets. The e-mail led to some articles being published in a number of trade journals. As is evident from the terms of those articles (see above at [16] and [21]), the journalists who prepared them clearly understood the 2 September e-mail to contain allegations of copying, made by Ms Madden, against Seafolly. So too did the readers of the articles. 56    Responses from readers of the Ragtrader article included:      “This sort of thing is happening ALL the time. Large corporations no longer have ‘designers’ but ‘product developers’ that source indie designs, copy and mass produce them.”.     “Isn’t it the designer who should be threatening legal action? How sad that a big brand can photograph a small designers (sic) collection, produce several styles that are almost identical, then threaten the designer with legal action for pointing out the similarities!”.     “Surely it doesn’t take an expert to see this goes far beyond coincidence? You may be able to overlook the similarities if there were only a few – but I’ve seen some more comparisons on another website, and there are so many of them! Then when you take into consideration the fact that someone working for Seafolly posed as a buyer for another company to enable them to take detailed photographs of the White Sands collection many months before Seafolly released their collection, it all starts to look very suspect indeed. I’d like to see how Seafolly explain their way out of what essentially amounts to an act of taking spy photographs?”. (Emphasis added).     “Yeah right Seafolly – you really expect us to believe this garbage? The similarities alone may by some freak occurrence actually have been a coincidence, the photocopying of White Sands’ line by a Seafolly employee may have been harmless – but put the two together and a foul smell starts to emerge. If, as they dubiously claim, Seafolly had already progressed with their own ‘designs’, WHY did they continue in the same direction upon discovering that White Sands had released an almost identical line. A rat isn’t all I smell.” 57    Similarly negative views were formed by readers of the Pedestrian TV online publication. Their comments included:     “I heard about this too. Apparently someone from Seafolly went to fashion week pretending to be a buyer for Sunburn and photographed all of the bikinis. So it sounds like more than a coincidence that so many are similar.”     “I’m no expert in swimwear design, and I think you may be able to overlook the similarities if there were only a few – but there are so many of them! Once you factor in the fact that someone working for Seafolly posed as a buyer for another company to enable them to take detailed photographs of the White Sands collection many months before Seafolly released their collection, it all starts to look very suspect indeed. (Emphasis added).     “White Sands has every right to make this statement, their work has been copied and someone is going to take the credit and make money for their creations. Quite embarrassing on Seafolly’s behalf I think.” (Emphasis added).     “Seafolly is shocked? They sent in a ‘buyer’ to photograph the collection, produce some very similar designs, yet are still shocked that the question has been posed? They made a pretty long statement about claims, but have avoided the one key claim. Did they send in a staff member pretending to be a buyer or not?” (Emphasis added). 58    The White Sands Facebook posting which was made on 3 September 2010 sought to distance Ms Madden from one of the media headlines which referred to Seafolly being “plagiarists” by implying that this conclusion had been reached by the publication as a result of its own comparison of the pairs of photographs but without Ms Madden having used the word. Her posting did, however, specifically name Ms McLaren as the “buyer” who had come to her show with a digital camera and taken photographs of her garments. Ms Madden also accused Seafolly of being a bully which had employed “bully tactics”. 59    The common feature of the representations which are impugned by Seafolly is that each claims that Seafolly had copied costume designs created by Ms Madden and marketed them as Seafolly products. This copying had been possible, in part at least, because Seafolly had access to the photographs which had been taken by Ms McLaren in order to facilitate the deception. When read in context, each of the statements about which Seafolly complained was false and was likely to mislead and deceive their readers. 60    I have concluded that, when Ms Madden published her various statements, she believed, erroneously, that Seafolly had copied her garments. Her choice of language was intended to and did convey to her readers that such copying had, as a matter of fact, occurred.  Were the statements mere expressions of opinion? 61    Ms Madden contended that the reasonable reader of the Facebook postings and the e-mail would have understood that she was expressing no more than an opinion about the similarity between the pairs of depicted garments. This similarity had led her to “her conclusion as to Seafolly’s conduct.” Although that “conduct” was not expressly stipulated, this could, in the context, only be understood as being a reference to copying. 62    Ms Madden rightly submitted that each of the three publications had to be examined separately and discrete decisions made as to whether the relevant statutory provisions had been contravened. Although many of the submissions made by her on the application of these provisions were common to all of the publications, she drew a distinction, in the present context, between the Facebook postings and the e-mail. She submitted that it was even clearer, from the phrasing of the 2 September e-mail, that she was expressing an opinion. This was because she did no more than pose the question in each case: “The most sincere form of flattery?” and leave it to the reader to make comparisons and draw his or her own conclusions. The question was unaccompanied by comments such as, “almost an entire line-line ripoff”, “sending in a dummy ‘buyer’ to get photos is super sneaky”, and “bullies be gone and take your bully tactics with you!”, which appeared in the Facebook postings. 63    Ms Madden further submitted that a statement of opinion could not be held to be misleading or deceptive (or likely to be so) if it was honestly held by her. She honestly believed that the copying had occurred. She was struck by the similarity in the design of the various pairs of costumes. Her suspicions were reinforced by her recollection of certain events which had occurred earlier in the year. They were:     Ms McLaren had approached her in her (Ms McLaren’s) capacity as a buyer for Sunburn and had assured her that Seafolly and Sunburn were separate entities notwithstanding Seafolly’s majority shareholding in Sunburn.      Ms McLaren had expressed great interest in the White Sands range and had taken photographs at the private showing and the runway show. Despite this no orders had been forthcoming from Sunburn.      Not long afterwards, Ms Madden had encountered Ms McLaren working on the Seafolly stand at the Florida show and wearing a Seafolly badge. 64    The distinction between statements of fact and statements of opinion has long been recognised by courts called on to apply s 52 of the TP Act. In an oft-cited passage in their joint judgment in Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 88, Bowen CJ, Lockhart and Fitzgerald JJ said that: “A statement which involves the state of mind of the maker ordinarily conveys the meaning (expressly or by implication) that the maker of the statement had a particular state of mind when the statement was made and, commonly at least, that there was basis for that state of mind. If the meaning contained in or conveyed by the statement is false in that or in any other respect, the making of the statement will have contravened s 52(1) of the Act … [T]he incorrectness of an opinion (assuming that can be established) does not of itself establish that the opinion was not held by the person who expressed it or that it lacked any, or any adequate, foundation.   The applicants argued that, nevertheless, the statement of an incorrect opinion is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive merely because it misinforms or likely to misinform. An expression of opinion which is identifiable as such conveys no more than that the opinion expressed is held and perhaps there is basis for the opinion. At least if those conditions are met an expression of opinion, however erroneous, misrepresents nothing.” (Emphasis added). 65    The line between statements of fact and statements of opinion is often difficult to draw. Guidance is provided by the observations of members of the Court in later cases. In Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (1992) 38 FCR 1, Hill J (with whom Foster J agreed on this point) said (at 46-7) that: “No case will afford a guide to any other case, since it must essentially be a question of fact whether a particular formulation of words expresses merely an opinion or a statement of fact. However, two observations may be made. First, the subjective purpose or motivation of the maker of the statement will not be of much significance. It is the readers’ perception of the maker’s intention which will ordinarily be the significant matter. The question will generally be resolved by looking to the persons to whom the statement was directed and asking whether any members of that class of persons would reasonably understand the statement to be one of fact or opinion.  Where, as here, the statement is directed to the public at large, it must be borne in mind that the class of persons will include the intelligent and the less intelligent, the informed and the less informed. The fact that some members of the class may perceive the statement as one of opinion will not avail a respondent if a not insignificant class of persons could reasonably be expected to perceive it as a statement of fact.  Secondly, a statement will most usually be seen as a statement of fact if it is one which can be measured against an objective criterion. Thus, generally, where no objective criterion exists, so that of necessity what is said must depend upon judgment or opinion, the statement will be seen not as a statement of fact but as one of opinion.” 66    In Industrial Equity Limited v North Broken Hill Holdings Limited (1986) 9 FCR 385 at 392-3, Burchett J emphasised that the necessary judgment had to be formed in the context in which the relevant statements were made. Like Hill J, his Honour considered that, where statements “assert some matter of physical observation”, it is more likely that the statement will be treated as one of fact. His Honour also contemplated (at 393) that the expressing of an opinion could contravene s 52(1) if that opinion was not “honestly made”: see  Orion Pet Products Pty Ltd v Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Vic) Inc (2002) 120 FCR 191 at 213 [124] and the cases there cited. An opinion will not be treated as being honestly held if it is formed with reckless indifference to the true position and no serious attempt has been made to ascertain the true position: see Bateman v Slatyer (1987) 71 ALR 553 at 559. The expression of an opinion which is not “honestly held” will be indicative of malice: cf Harbour Radio Pty Limited v Trad (2012) 86 ALJR 1256 at 1263-4 . 67    In my view, when read in context, the statements would not have been understood by the class of persons to whom they were directed as mere expressions of Ms Madden’s opinions. My reasons for so concluding appear above at [50]-[59]. 68    Even if it could be said that the readers of the impugned statements would have understood them to be expressions of Ms Madden’s opinions, she was reckless in forming them. Ms Madden acted precipitately. Her first Facebook postings occurred within hours of her seeing the photographs in the Gold Coast Panache. She then made a visual comparison of some of her designs and some Seafolly garments. This comparison was based on the photographs which appear above at [15]. As can be seen from those photographs, there are varying degrees of similarity between the paired sets of garments. Before posting her views she failed to take a number of steps which would have elicited facts inconsistent with the notion that any copying of her garments had occurred. She could, for example, have made enquiries of retailers to establish when the Seafolly garments were placed on the market. She could have attended a retail outlet and examined some, at least, of the Seafolly garments. She could have made enquiries of Seafolly with a view to ascertaining when the costumes which she considered had been copied had been designed and released to the market. She might also have paused to consider whether her creations which she thought had been copied had been on display at the private viewing and parade which Ms McLaren had attended in May 2010. 69    Had some or all of these prudent steps been taken, Ms Madden would have become aware that:     Six of the eight Seafolly garments had been on the market prior to May 2010. The other two were going through design stages and were released in July 2010.     The dates which she placed under the various photographs of Seafolly products which suggested that six of the costumes had been released to the market in September 2010 and that another two had been placed in the market that year (in each case after the allegedly copied White Sands garment had gone to market) were wrong. I do not accept Ms Madden’s submission that her references to “September 2010” under the photographs were intended to convey no more than that these Seafolly costumes had first come to her attention in September 2010. Had that been her intention there would have been no need to insert the references to May 2010 under her garments. Furthermore, the other two sets of photographs had under them “White Sands 2009 – Seafolly 2010.” Ms Madden’s evident intention was to suggest to the reader that her garments were in the market place before the comparator Seafolly garments.     A comparison of the actual garments would have disclosed varying degrees of design difference. So much was conceded by Ms Madden in her evidence. She agreed, for example, that her High Society Bandeau top was “narrower at the front” and “much deeper” than the comparator Seafolly Goddess Monroe Bustier, that there were “a lot of differences” between the print used on her White Sands Nelly costume and that used on Seafolly’s English Rose design and that her Shelley bikini pant was “much more brief” than that which formed part of the Seafolly La Bella equivalent. Her failure to take those steps (or some of them) was not merely careless. It resulted from her conviction that copying had occurred and her determination to expose what she saw as Seafolly’s misconduct. Her resolve was such that she was prepared to and did make the statements not caring whether they were true or false. 70    Ms Madden made her allegations against a competitor. The nature of the allegations were such that they would, to her knowledge have had the potential to harm Seafolly’s reputation. This knowledge should have caused her to adopt a cautious approach. The 2 September e-mail was, however, sent to both industry publications and to some daily newspapers which, it might have been expected, would have reported the allegations to a wider audience which included Seafolly’s customers or potential customers. 71    Despite being warned by Seafolly that her allegations lacked foundation, Ms Madden persisted. She was determined to make her point about copying and, in particular, that this had been possible because of the photographing of her range by Ms McLaren. Seafolly’s warning was conveyed by its solicitor’s letter on 3 September 2010. Within hours, Ms Madden was engaged in soliciting what she hoped would appear to be questions from disinterested parties which would enable her to reiterate her charges about photography for copying purposes. The parties to whom she turned were, in fact, personal friends. She asked both for “a massive favour”: see above at [29]. Again, she did not pause to ascertain the true facts before acting. 72    Even if, contrary to my view, each of the impugned statements made by Ms Madden constituted no more than the expression of opinions held by her, this defence fails because she was reckless in giving public expression to them and there was no adequate foundation for any of them.  73    I therefore find that, if s 52 of the TP Act applied to Ms Madden and her impugned statements were made in trade or commerce (issues to which I will shortly turn), she contravened s 52 of the TP Act in making those statements. Contravention of s 53(a) 74    There is a substantial overlap between ss 52 and 53(a) of the TP Act. Both apply to conduct engaged in by a corporation in trade or commerce, in connection with the promotion or supply of goods or services. Section 53(a) differs from s 52 in that the impugned representation must be “false” and, relevantly, assert that the goods concerned are of a particular “style or model”. 75    In my view Ms Madden also contravened s 53(a). Each of her impugned representations was false and they suggested that the eight depicted Seafolly garments were not of the style and model advertised and marketed by Seafolly as having been designed by it. Rather, she asserted, wrongly, that they were copies of White Sands’ styles and models. Did ss 52 and 53(a) of the Trade Practices Act apply to Ms Madden? 76    Ms Madden submitted that she, as a natural person, could not be held to have contravened ss 52 and 53(a) of the TP Act because they only regulated the conduct of corporations. 77    Section 6(3) of the TP Act provided that the provisions of Part V of the Act also have the effect that they would have if: “(a)    those provisions … were …. confined in their operation to engaging in conduct to the extent to which the conduct involves the use of postal, telegraphic or telephonic services … and   (b)    a reference in those provisions to a corporation included a reference to a person not being a corporation.” 78    Seafolly contended that, in making the Facebook postings and sending the e-mail, Ms Madden had used telephonic services. The term “telephonic services” is not defined in the TP Act. It is, no doubt, intended to bear the same meaning as attaches to it in s 51(v) of the Constitution. In Australian Competition and Competition Commission v Hughes [2002] FCA 270 Allsop J dealt with representations which appeared on an internet web-site. His Honour held that relief was available under the TP Act, in part because of the provisions of s 6(3) as access to the internet involved the use of telephonic services: see at [77]; Dataflow Computer Services Pty Ltd v Goodman (1999) 168 ALR 169 at 171 and cf CPA Australia Ltd v Dunn (2007) 74 IPR 495; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chen (2003) 132 FCR 309. 79    Each of the impugned publications was promulgated using the internet. Access to that facility involved the use of telephonic services. As a result I accept that Ms Madden is liable for contraventions of ss 52 and 53(a) because of the extended operation of those provisions as prescribed by s 6(3) of the TP Act.  “In trade or commerce”? 80    It is necessary for Seafolly to establish that Ms Madden’s impugned conduct occurred “in trade or commerce”. Ms Madden denied that, in making the Facebook postings and sending the 2 September e-mail, she was engaged in trade or commerce. 81    The reach of provisions such as ss 52 and 53(a) of the TP Act is limited by the use of the preposition “in”. In Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd v Nelson (1990) 169 CLR 594 at 604, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ said that: “What the section is concerned with is the conduct of a corporation towards persons, be they consumers or not, with whom it (or those whose interests it represents or is seeking to promote) has or may have dealings in the course of those activities or transactions which, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character. Such conduct includes, of course, promotional activities in relation to, or for the purposes of, the supply of goods or services to actual or potential consumers, be they identified persons or merely an unidentifiable section of the public.” 82    As a result, a person who is not an industry participant but who acts as a commentator on industry matters, is unlikely to be held to have published his or her views “in trade or commerce”: see, for example, Robin Pty Ltd v Canberra International Airport Pty Ltd (1999) 179 ALR 449. On the other hand, the making of statements which are intended to have an impact on trading or commercial activities, even if made by a person not engaged in the relevant industry, may bear the necessary trading or commercial character: see, for example, Fire Watch Australia Pty Ltd v Country Fire Authority (1999) 93 FCR 520. 83    In the present case, Ms Madden was the principal of White Sands, a trade competitor of Seafolly. Her statements related to the manner in which Seafolly conducted its business. She alleged that Seafolly had engaged in conduct which was improper to the detriment of her own business. She thereby sought to influence the attitudes of customers and potential customers of Seafolly. In these circumstances, I consider that her statements were made “in trade or commerce”. Damage 84    Seafolly alleged that it suffered damage to its reputation and economic loss as a result of the publication of the Facebook postings and the e-mail.  85    I will deal first with the economic loss claim. 86    The applicant is one of a number of companies which constitute the Seafolly group. The marketing of the Seafolly brand internationally constituted 90 percent of the group’s business. Seventy percent of that business was conducted in Australia. The applicant conducts a significant part of the group’s business in Australia. 87    The evidence established that Seafolly enjoyed a substantial and favourable reputation and that Ms Madden’s statement had the potential, if accepted by third parties, to undermine that reputation. The evidence, however, stopped well short of showing that any loss of sales or other business losses had resulted from the publications on the website and the e-mail. Mr Anthony Halas expressed apprehension that members of the public might have formed negative views of Seafolly’s business ethics, calling into question the exclusivity of its designs and thereby damaging Seafolly’s reputation. This could, in turn, lead to a disinclination to purchase Seafolly garments. In a rather melodramatic passage in his evidence Mr Halas said: “[t]he problem we have in this day of internet, where things go viral, and no amount of – once these things are released into the public space, no amount of logical reasoning actually matters any more. See, I couldn’t win. Once she put that up there, I was finished anyway. See, it was – the damage had been done …” In fact, Seafolly’s business was anything but “finished”. Its sales and profitability were, on its own figures, wholly unaffected by what occurred. As a result, Mr Halas was not able to point to any adverse commercial impact on Seafolly’s business resulting from the making of Ms Madden’s statements. 88    Seafolly tendered its financial accounts for the relevant financial year as a confidential exhibit. Those accounts showed no diminution of profitability. There was no evidence of a downturn in sales, even for a short period, in the wake of the publications. On the contrary, Seafolly’s sales figures and profitability have been on an upward trajectory both before and since Ms Madden’s publications. 89    This does not mean that Seafolly is left without redress under the TP Act. Compensation is available for damage to a corporation’s reputation. 90    Section 82(1) provided that a person who suffers loss or damage by conduct of another person that was done in contravention of Part V, (which includes ss 52 and 53(a)) may recover damages for any loss occasioned by the contravention. Section 87(1) provided that, if a contravention of Part V of the Act is established, the Court may make orders compensating the victim. Both provisions require the victim to have suffered loss and damage by reason of the contravening conduct. As the Full Court said in Enzed Holdings Ltd v Wynthea Pty Ltd (1984) 57 ALR 167 at 183: “The principle is clear. If the court finds damage has occurred it must do its best to quantify the loss even if a degree of speculation and guess work is involved … We emphasize, however, that the principle applies only when the court finds that loss or damage has occurred. It is not enough for a plaintiff merely to show wrongful conduct by the defendant.” 91    Damage to the commercial reputation of a corporation may be compensated for under s 82(1): see Brabazon v Western Mail Limited (1985) 8 FCR 122 at 129; Flamingo Park Pty Ltd v Dolly Dolly Creation Pty Ltd (1986) 65 ALR 500 at 525. 92    In FAI General Insurance Company Ltd v RAIA Insurance Brokers Ltd (1992) 108 ALR 479 such an award was made against a broker who had disparaged an insurance policy proffered by the applicant.  93    In Nixon v Slater and Gordon (2000) 175 ALR 15 two surgeons were held to have been defamed by the publication, by the respondent, of booklets relating to medical malpractice litigation which featured their photographs. The surgeons also pursued a cause of action under s 52 of the TP Act. Merkel J found that the respondent had contravened s 52. His Honour awarded damages under s 82 of the TP Act which he calculated on the same basis as he had done in determining the measure of damages for defamation.  94    In Cryeng Pty Ltd v Loyola [2011] FCA 956, Stone J dealt with misleading and deceptive representations to the effect that the applicant was about to go out of business and that it would be replaced, as manufacturer of particular goods, by another company. The evidence called relating to the damage caused to the applicant’s reputation by the representations was described by her Honour as “flimsy”: see at [99], She was, nonetheless, prepared to award damages for the loss of the applicant’s reputation under s 82.  95    As was the case in Cryeng, the evidence of damage to Seafolly’s reputation in the present proceeding is sparse. The evidence did establish that Seafolly had a strong and positive image in the swimwear industry and that that reputation was important to it in a highly competitive environment. Any damage does not, however, appear to have been significant or ongoing.  96    In attempting to quantify loss it is relevant, as Wilcox J held in Typing Centre of NSW Pty Ltd v Northern Business College Ltd (1989) 13 IPR 627 at 641, to have regard to “the nature of the statements made by the respondents and to the manner and extent of their publication.” The two Facebook postings were accessible to the “friends” of the sites for less than two days. The numbers of people with access to the pages was relatively small. The same cannot be said of the 2 September e-mail to trade and general press outlets. The contents of this e-mail had the potential to be widely published. In the event it does not appear that they were. They excited interest in the trade publications but do not seem to have led to any significant publicity in the mainstream press. As I have already found the allegations made by Ms Madden were a serious assault on Seafolly’s business integrity.  97    It is, I consider, appropriate to award Seafolly limited damages under s 82 of the TP Act. Doing the best that I can on the limited available evidence I consider that an amount of $25,000 would be appropriate. Injunctions 98    Seafolly submitted that, if it was successful in establishing contraventions of ss 52 and 53(a) of the TP Act, the Court should restrain Ms Madden from reproducing or authorising the reproduction of the photographs of the Seafolly swimwear depicted above at [15] without the consent of Seafolly and from making the representations recorded above at [34] or other claims to like effect. 99    Section 80(1) of the TP Act empowered the Court to grant an injunction on such terms as it considered to be appropriate if it was satisfied that a person had engaged, or was proposing to engage, in conduct that constituted or would constitute a contravention of a provision of Part V. Section 80(4) provided that: “(4)    The power of the Court to grant an injunction restraining a person from engaging in conduct may be exercised:  (a)    whether or not it appears to the Court that the person intends to engage again, or to continue to engage, in conduct of that kind; (b)    whether or not the person has previously engaged in conduct of that kind; and (c)    whether or not there is an imminent danger of substantial damage to any person if the first-mentioned person engages in conduct of that kind.”  Because this proceeding was commenced before 1 January 2011, s 80 of the TP Act is deemed to continue to apply and the proceeding is deemed to be taken under the ACL: see Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Act (No 2) 2010 (Cth), Schedule 7, Item 7. In any event, s 232 of the ACL is in substantially the same terms as the former s 80. 100    As Gummow J pointed out in ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1992) 38 FCR 248 at 266-7, the statutory power, which is conferred by s 80(1), is, in a number of respects, available in a wider range of circumstances than are equitable injunctions. 101    The statutory and equitable powers are both designed to prevent a repetition of contravening conduct. Although s 80(4) renders it unnecessary for an applicant to demonstrate that the commission, continuance or repetition of contravening conduct is threatened or apprehended it is, nonetheless, necessary for the Court to be satisfied that the injunction will serve a purpose: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd (in liq) (2007) 161 FCR 513. In Dataline the Full Court said (at 543-4) that: “Many contraventions simply will not justify injunctive relief. We doubt whether unintentional misconduct in contravention of s 52 would lead to such relief. An isolated intentional breach may also not warrant it. Conduct which occurred many years before the enforcement proceedings may not do so, especially if the offender has not recently infringed the law, or is no longer in a position where contravention is likely. These are obvious cases, but they raise questions as to the relevant factors in considering whether to grant such relief. The discretion is at large. It is for the relevant applicant to demonstrate that the injunction will serve a purpose. That purpose may involve the protection of the public interest or private rights.” 102    The contraventions of the TP Act by Ms Madden occurred in September 2010. There was some limited evidence about her having made similar statements in the early part of 2011. Although s 80(4) relieves Seafolly of the need to establish that it is likely that Ms Madden will continue to make such statements, I would not have been inclined to accede to Seafolly’s application for an injunction, were it not for the position adopted by Ms Madden at trial. Despite having instructed her counsel that she did not maintain that Seafolly had copied her garments and despite having heard the uncontradicted evidence which supported that concession, she refused to deny that she continued to harbour such a belief. There is, in my view, a possibility that Ms Madden will, in future, repeat her allegations, notwithstanding the publication of these reasons. I consider that Seafolly is entitled to an injunction to protect itself from any further public utterances alleging that it copied White Sands creations. 103    Such an injunction will also serve the public interest in ensuring that consumers of swimwear are not misled into thinking that Seafolly garments are copied from another designer’s range. Declarations 104    Seafolly’s application sought a declaration that Ms Madden had engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct.  105    The Court has power, pursuant to s 21(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), to grant binding declarations of right. This is a wide discretionary power which may be exercised when there is utility in doing so: see Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission (1992) 175 CLR 564 at 581-2. A declaration that a provision of the TP Act such as ss 52 and 53(a) has been contravened may be made because it protects the right of the public not to be misled or deceived by misrepresentations: see Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (No 2) (1993) 41 FCR 89 at 98, 110. 106    A declaration of the kind sought by Seafolly would serve a number of useful purposes. It would identify conduct that constitutes a contravention of the consumer protection provisions of the TP Act which continue to apply under the Australian Consumer Law. This would have an educative effect. Such a declaration would also identify the bases on which the granting of injunctions and the award of damages are founded. It would serve the additional purpose of marking the Court’s disapproval of Ms Madden’s conduct.  107    These considerations, in my view, warrant the making of a declaration that Ms Madden has contravened ss 52 and 53(a) of the TP Act by making her impugned statements. The FT Act and the NSW FT Act 108    Sections 38 and 40 of the FT Act and ss 42 and 44(a) of the NSW FT Act appear in largely the same terms as ss 52 and 53(a) of the TP Act respectively. Seafolly relied on the same facts to support its claims under all three sets of provisions. 109    In light of my findings set out above as to Ms Madden’s liability under ss 52 and 53(a) of the TP Act, it is not necessary for me to deal with Seafolly’s respective claims under the relevant provisions of the FT Act and NSW FT Act.  INJURIOUS FALSEHOOD 110    Seafolly also sought to establish a cause of action against Ms Madden for injurious falsehood. Although they are similar in some respects, the elements of this tort differ from those required to make good a claim of defamation. The differences were explained by Weinberg J in Orion Pet Products Pty Ltd v Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Vic) Inc (2002) 120 FCR 191 at 223: “In some respects, this tort bears a marked resemblance to defamation. Both involve a false and harmful imputation concerning the plaintiff which is made to a third party. They differ, however, in that the law of defamation protects interests in personal reputation while injurious falsehood protects interests in the disposability of a person’s property, products or business. Defamation is generally actionable without proof of damage. Falsehood is presumed and liability is strict. In an action for injurious falsehood, the plaintiff must prove that he sustained actual economic loss, that the offending statement was false, and that it was made with intent to cause injury without lawful justification. The requisite state of mind is often described as malice.” 111    The elements of the tort of injurious falsehood, to which Weinberg J made reference, were stipulated by Gummow J in Palmer Bruyn and Parker Pty Limited v Parsons (2001) 208 CLR 388 at 404 to be: “(1)    a false statement of or concerning the plaintiff’s goods or business; (2) publication of that statement by the defendant to a third person; (3) malice on the part of the defendant; and (4) proof by the plaintiff of actual damage (which may include a general loss of business) suffered as a result of the statement.” See also: Ratcliffe v Evans [1892] 2 QB 524 at 527-8; Hall-Gibbs Mercantile Agency Limited v Dun (1910) 12 CLR 84 at 95; Sungravure Pty Ltd v Middle Eastern Airlines Airliaban SAL (1975) 134 CLR 1 at 13, 16, 21-2. 112    For reasons which I have already given in dealing with the misrepresentation issues, the first three elements of the tort have been established. Ms Madden falsely stated that Seafolly had copied her designs and had sent Ms McLaren to photograph her garments. The statements were published to a number of third parties and Ms Madden acted maliciously.  113    Seafolly’s principal difficulty in making good this aspect of its case is its inability to adduce evidence which established any actual damage caused to Seafolly’s business which could be attributed to Ms Madden’s false statements. In the absence of such evidence the tort cannot be made out: Ratcliffe v Evans at 528; Palmer Bryun at 404, 432. As Kirby J explained in Palmer Bruyn (at 432), damage was the gist of the action for injurious falsehood and a plaintiff bore the onus of establishing that the impugned publication caused it actual damage. His Honour continued: “The [plaintiff] was not entitled to general damages for loss of reputation or the hurt felt by its officers. Actual damage, in the form of pecuniary loss, was necessary, although this could include damage such as a general downturn in profits, if that were established by evidence.” 114    Whilst Seafolly’s reputation has suffered as a result of the statements made by Ms Madden, it has not, as I have already explained, been able to point to any pecuniary loss arising from those publications. 115    Seafolly has failed to make good its claim of injurious falsehood. COPYRIGHT CLAIMS 116    Seafolly made a number of claims of copyright infringement against Ms Madden. These claims related to the photographs of the Seafolly garments being worn by models, which are shown above at [15]. The photographs had been taken by a photographer engaged by Seafolly, Mr Max Doyle. Seafolly contended that Mr Doyle had assigned copyright in the photographs to Seafolly by deeds of assignment dated 6 September 2010 and 29 March 2011. 117    The copyright claims were founded on provisions of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) (“the Copyright Act”). It was not disputed that the photographs were artistic works in which copyright could subsist pursuant to s 32 of the Copyright Act. Nor was it disputed that Mr Doyle was a “qualified person” for the purposes of s 32(1). 118    Seafolly’s principal claim was that Ms Madden had infringed its copyright in the photographs contrary to s 36 of the Copyright Act. That section provides that copyright in an artistic work is infringed by a person who, not being the owner of the copyright, and without the license of the owner of the copyright, does in Australia, or authorises the doing in Australia of, any act compromised in the copyright. By s 31 of the Copyright Act a copyright owner enjoys exclusive rights to reproduce an artistic work or communicate that work to the public. Seafolly complained that Ms Madden had reproduced the photographs and communicated them to the public. 119    Ms Madden admitted having acted in this way but sought to defend her position by pleading that she had published the photographs for the purpose of criticism or review (see s 41 of the Copyright Act) and that such communication as had taken place was properly to be regarded as de minimus. 120    Seafolly can only succeed in its copyright claim if it was the owner of the copyright at relevant times. The effect of ss 115 and 119 of the Copyright Act is that the only person who is competent to bring an action for infringement of copyright is the owner of the copyright or an exclusive licensee thereof: see Enzed Holdings Limited v Wynthea Pty Ltd (1984) 57 ALR 167 at 180-1; Taypar Pty ltd v Santic (1989) 21 FCR 485 at 491. 121    Seafolly sought to rely on a deed of assignment from the photographer Mr Max Doyle to it. The copy of the deed of assignment which was in evidence was undated. Seafolly’s solicitor deposed that it had been entered into on 6 September 2009. This cannot be correct. The photographs were taken by Mr Doyle during two separate photo shoots in 2010. The first occurred between 22 April and 27 April; the second between 6 June and 9 June. Mr Doyle deposed that he had assigned copyright in the photographs to Seafolly on 6 September 2010 and 29 March 2011. Mr Doyle also assigned his right to sue for past infringements of copyright in the photographs. 122    At the time at which Ms Madden published her Facebook postings and the 2 September e-mail, copyright in the photographs of the Seafolly garments which appear above at [15] remained with Mr Doyle. They were not assigned to Seafolly until 6 September 2010 at the earliest. Seafolly is, as a result, unable to maintain that it was the holder of the copyright at relevant times. What it does seek to do is to assert rights under the assignment of Mr Doyle’s right to sue for past infringements. The assignment of this right, however, does not entitle Seafolly to pursue a damages claim by it for copyright infringement. All it permits is for Seafolly to sue for copyright infringements suffered by Mr Doyle. No evidence was called to establish that Mr Doyle suffered any damage as a result of the publication of the photographs which he had taken earlier in 2011. 123    Seafolly sought general damages of $500,000 pursuant to s 115(2) of the Copyright Act and additional damages of $500,000 pursuant to s 115(4). The general damages were sought for damage to Seafolly’s reputation. The additional damages were sought because of certain aggravated features of Ms Madden’s conduct which was said to have attended the contraventions. These included the flagrancy of the infringement and benefits said to have been derived by Ms Madden from her conduct. 124    Had it been necessary to consider the award of damages I would have regarded the quantum of these claims by Seafolly as grossly excessive in the circumstances. The photographs were only displayed on the Facebook pages for a short time and there is no evidence that any actual damage flowed from their use. THE CROSS-CLAIMS – DEFAMATION AND MISLEADING AND DECEPTIVE CONDUCT 125    Both these cross-claims, made by Ms Madden, relate to a phrase which appeared in each of the two press releases issued by Seafolly. The relevant parts of these press releases appear above at [19] and [31]. Both press releases contained the allegation that Ms Madden’s statements about Seafolly copying her garments had “been made maliciously to injure Seafolly …”. 126    Ms Madden alleged that this accusation conveyed the defamatory imputation “that [she] has knowingly made false claims that her competitor, [Seafolly], has copied some of her swimwear designs, with the malicious intent of damaging [Seafolly].” She further alleged that, in distributing these press releases to media outlets, Seafolly either knew or intended that they would be republished and that Seafolly was, as a result, liable for republications which had appeared in the Ragtrader magazine and in the Sydney Morning Herald and Age newspapers. Ms Madden also contended that, when Seafolly published each of the press releases, it knew that the defamatory imputation was false or that Seafolly was recklessly indifferent to its truth or falsity.  127    Seafolly pleaded a series of defences. They were as follows:     The statements were not defamatory of Ms Madden;     If they were, the defence of justification was available on the basis that the publications were substantially true; the statements attributed to Ms Madden had been made maliciously.     The related defence of contextual truth.     The defence of fair comment was available; Seafolly was doing no more than expressing its opinion that Ms Madden’s allegations were malicious and made for the purpose of injuring Seafolly.     The defence of qualified privilege was also available; Seafolly had been entitled to respond to the serious allegations made against it by Ms Madden and, in doing so, had expressed its honestly held views as to Ms Madden’s conduct. 128    Ms Madden’s related cross-claim was that the press releases contained representations by Seafolly, in trade and commerce, that Ms Madden had knowingly made false claims about the copying of her swimwear designs by Seafolly with the malicious intent of damaging Seafolly, and that these representations were false. Were the statements defamatotry? 129    Ms Madden relied on the natural and ordinary meaning of the words used in the press releases. A defamatory statement is one which has the tendency to lower a person in the estimation of others. Such a statement is calculated to bring the person to whom it is directed into “hatred, ridicule or contempt”: see Parmiter v Coupland (1840) 151 ER 340 at 341-2. The tendency of the statement to produce this response is to be assessed objectively through the reaction of “ordinary decent folk in the community, taken in general”: see Gardiner v John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd (1942) 42 SR NSW 171 at 172. More recently, a broader test has been propounded. In a series of cases the High Court has adopted the general test of “whether the published matter is likely to lead an ordinary reasonable person to think the less of a plaintiff”: see Mirror Newspapers Limited v World Hosts Pty Ltd (1979) 141 CLR 632 at 638-9; Chakravarti v Advertiser Newspapers Limited (1998) 193 CLR 519 at 545; Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Chesterton (2009) 238 CLR 460 at 467.  130    When read separately, and in the context of the releases as a whole, Seafolly’s statements would have clearly conveyed to the ordinary and reasonable reader the imputations pleaded by Ms Madden. Those imputations were defamatory of Ms Madden. They asserted that she had acted in a malicious way in order to harm Seafolly’s commercial interests. Justification 131    In its defence to the cross-claim, Seafolly pleaded Polly Peck (Polly Peck Holdings Plc v Trelford [1986] 1 QB 1000) and contextual truth defences. It pleaded that the imputations advanced by Ms Madden were true in substance and in fact. It also contended that the press releases each “carried the additional imputations that [Ms Madden] made false claims of copying by [Seafolly] which were recklessly indifferent to the truth of such allegations and did so with the malicious intent of damaging [Seafolly]” and that such additional imputations were also true in substance and in fact. 132    In pleading its additional imputation, Seafolly sought to rely on the principle expounded in David Syme and Co Ltd v Hore-Lacy (2000) 1 VR 667, that such defences are permissible provided that the meanings attributed to the relevant statement by the respondent are not substantially different from the meanings contended for by the applicant and are no more injurious or serious than those to which they respond. 133    Ms Madden did not seek to suggest that the additional imputation could not be relied upon. 134    She contended that Seafolly had failed to establish that she had acted maliciously.  135    Seafolly responded that it had a proper basis for asserting that she had done so. That basis was her reckless indifference to the truth. Particulars of the truth of the two meanings were provided. 136    I have already dealt with this issue. I have found that Ms Madden did act maliciously in the sense recognised by the authorities: see above at [68]-[72]. She did so in circumstances where she must be taken reasonably to have known (or been blind to the issue) that her statements would be damaging to Seafolly’s commercial reputation. What was said by Seafolly was substantially true. 137    I, therefore, uphold Seafolly’s defence of justification. Fair Comment 138    Seafolly contended that the press releases responded to the articles which had appeared in the trade publications. The matter of whether or not Seafolly was copying the White Sands designs was one of public interest. The allegations that Ms Madden had acted maliciously to damage Seafolly represented the honestly held views of Mr Halas at the time at which he authorised distribution of the press releases. His views were based on his knowledge of the true position relating to the design and marketing of the Seafolly garments which had appeared as an attachment to Ms Madden’s 2 September e-mail to media outlets. 139    Ms Madden submitted that Seafolly had failed to make good the common law defence of fair comment or the statutory defence of honest opinion because the impugned statements had been presented as statements of fact rather than the expression of opinions. 140    Ms Madden sought to contrast the statements which she had made and those appearing in the press releases. She contended that the press releases did not refer to any facts which might support the relevant imputations. Where she had published photographs and referred to events which supported her allegations, Seafolly had done no more than make “bare” statements about Ms Madden’s motives for making her allegations of copying. 141    This defence only protects statements in the nature of comment and not of fact: see Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Parker (1992) 29 NSWLR 448. It is necessary that the language employed by the defendant conveys with reasonable clarity that an opinion is being expressed. 142    The relevant parts of Seafolly’s press releases do not manifest an intention merely to comment on Ms Madden’s allegations. Rather the statements make allegations of fact: she had acted maliciously for the purpose of damaging Seafolly’s commercial interests. The statements are not, therefore, protected by the defence of fair comment. Qualified Privilege 143    Seafolly contended that it was seeking to vindicate itself against an attack made on it by Ms Madden.  144    Ms Madden accepted that the publication by her of the Facebook postings and the e-mail gave rise to a privileged occasion which entitled Seafolly to rebut the accusation of copying. She also accepted that some form of response by Seafolly was fairly warranted. She complained, however, that any response must be relevant and proportionate. 145    The principles which underpin this defence were explained by Dixon J in Penton v Calwell (1945) 70 CLR 219 at 233-4 as follows: “The foundation of the privilege is the necessity of allowing the party attacked free scope to place his case before the body whose judgment the attacking party has sought to affect. In this instance, it is assumed to be the entire public. The purpose is to prevent the charges operating to his prejudice. It may be conceded that to impugn the truth of the charges contained in the attack and even the general veracity of the attacker may be a proper exercise of the privilege, if it be commensurate with the occasion. If that is a question submitted to or an argument used before the body to whom the attacker has appealed and it is done bona fide for the purpose of vindication, the law will not allow the liability of the party attacked to depend on the truth or otherwise of defamatory statements he so makes by way of defence.” 146    Speaking of this passage in Trad Gummow, Hayne and Bell JJ said (at 1266) that: “In this passage it is the phrase ‘and it is done bona fide’ which indicates the distinct role of malice to defeat what otherwise would be a good plea. The phrase ‘be commensurate with’ reflects what was said by Earl Lorbeurn in Adam v Ward.” 147    What Earl Loreburn had said in Adam v Ward [1917] AC 309 at 320-1 was that “the fact that an occasion is privileged does not necessarily protect all that is said or written on that occasion” and that anything “not relevant and pertinent to the discharge of the duty … or the safeguarding of the interest which creates the privilege will not be protected”. 148    Seafolly made the statements in its press releases in response to attacks made on it by Ms Madden. It sought to defend itself from the allegations, made by her, which it knew to be untrue. In replying, Seafolly impugned both the veracity and motivation of Ms Madden. Its allegation was that Ms Madden had acted maliciously in order to damage its business. Seafolly’s response, in my opinion, was commensurate with the serious allegations which had been levelled against it. Seafolly did not, itself, act maliciously. 149    Seafolly has, therefore, made good its defence of qualified privilege.  150    It follows that Ms Madden’s cross-claim for defamation must fail. TP Act claims 151    Seafolly’s claim that Ms Madden’s statements about it having copied her garments being made maliciously for the purpose of injuring Seafolly were true and were not apt to mislead.  152    Accordingly, Ms Madden’s cross-claim under the TP Act also fails. CONCLUSION 153    In bringing this proceeding, Seafolly was concerned not only to protect its corporate reputation. It was also concerned for the reputation of its employees; false allegations had been specifically made against Ms McLaren and there were implicit suggestions that the designers of Seafolly’s creations had not relied on their own ingenuity but had chosen instead to copy designs which had been created by Ms Madden. 154    Seafolly has been substantially successful in vindicating its reputation. It should have the costs of its application. 155    Ms Madden’s cross-claims should be dismissed with costs. I certify that the preceding one hundred and fifty-five (155) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Tracey.

IN THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA     VICTORIA DISTRICT REGISTRY     GENERAL DIVISION  VID 735 of 2011     ON APPEAL FROM THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA     BETWEEN:  MANAGEMENT 3 GROUP PTY LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) ACN 100 863 036 First Appellant  ANDREW REGINALD YEO AND GESS MICHAEL RAMBALDI (AS LIQUIDATORS OF MANAGEMENT 3 GROUP PTY LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) ACN 100 863 036 Second and Third Appellants    AND:  LENNY’S COMMERCIAL KITCHENS PTY LTD  ACN 009 044 295 First Respondent  SINO IRON PTY LTD ACN 058 429 708 Second Respondent      JUDGES:  LANDER, GILMOUR & GORDON JJ   DATE:  12 december 2011   PLACE:  MELBOURNE     REASONS FOR JUDGMENT THE COURT: 1    The first appellant, Management 3 Group Pty Ltd (In Liquidation) (M3G), was at the relevant time a building contractor. It went into administration on 7 April 2009, and on 21 May 2009 it was ordered to be wound up in insolvency. The second and third appellants are the joint and several liquidators of M3G. 2    The first respondent (Lenny’s) was a manufacturer of kitchens and a supplier of kitchen items. The second respondent (Sino), at the relevant time, owned the Fortescue River Construction Camp (Site), which was a camp being constructed to accommodate workers who were constructing Sino’s Magnetite Plant. Facts 3    On 2 July 2008 M3G and Sino entered into a construction contract for M3G to construct the mining accommodation at the Site (Contract). On 12 August 2008 M3G entered into a purchase agreement with Lenny’s for Lenny’s to supply and install a kitchen, items for a wet mess, and an ice room at the Site. 4    This is an appeal against an order of a judge of this Court dismissing the appellant’s claim against Sino’s conversion of unaffixed goods which were described in the proceeding as the “additional goods” (Additional Goods). 5    The appellants’ claim against Lenny’s for a breach of s 440C of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (Corporations Act) and for conversion of various kitchen goods (Kitchen Goods) also failed, but the appellants did not seek to reagitate their claim as against Lenny’s. Lenny’s is no longer a party to the appeal. Nothing more needs to be said about Lenny’s involvement. 6    The Contract provided for M3G to supply and install the Additional Goods, which comprised laundry machines and wall vents, hot water units, fire extinguishers and carpets. M3G acquired the Additional Goods from suppliers other than Lenny’s.  7    As at 7 April 2009, the date when M3G went into voluntary administration, some of the Additional Goods had not been affixed at the Site. Although there was a dispute as to the number of goods which remained unaffixed, the trial judge found that the Additional Goods comprised 37 laundry machines and wall vents, 16 hot water units, 40 fire extinguishers and 30% of the carpet. That finding is not challenged on the appeal. 8    Some time after 7 April 2009, Sino installed the Additional Goods at the Site.  9    The question before the primary judge and on appeal is whether M3G or Sino owned the Additional Goods as at 7 April 2009. If they were owned by M3G then Sino’s actions constitute a conversion of the Additional Goods. If they were owned by Sino at that time there was no conversion. 10    The primary judge was of the opinion that Sino owned the Additional Goods at 7 April 2009. She held that title to the Additional Goods had passed to Sino pursuant to clause 42.2 of the Contract in circumstances where Sino had paid the full value of the Additional Goods prior to 7 April 2009, in December 2008. 11    The appellant contends that the primary judge was wrong to reach that conclusion, and that she should have found that as at 7 April 2009 M3G owned the Additional Goods, and that Sino had converted those goods to its own benefit. Sino, it argues, is therefore liable to M3G for the total value of those goods at the date of conversion, namely $236,000. 12    On 15 December 2009 Finkelstein J granted leave to Sino nunc pro tunc to install and use the Additional Goods upon Sino’s undertaking that the damages sought by the appellants would be assessed by reference to the ownership of the goods on 7 April 2009, and by reference to the value of the Additional Goods in the place they were located and in the state they were in on that date. 13    The primary judge did not, because of her finding that Sino owned the Additional Goods, address the question of their value. She did however consider the value of other goods of the same kind that had been supplied by Lenny’s and installed by Sino after M3G went into administration. In respect of those goods she was of the opinion that their value onsite was 40 to 50% of their invoice value. 14    Sino contends that the primary judge was right for the reasons she gave, but that if Sino is liable in conversion the value of the items is overstated at $236,000. It claims that the value of the Additional Goods at 7 April 2009 was between $95,001.93 and $118,752.41, which represents approximately 40 to 50% of their invoice value. 15    Sino argued in the alternative that if there was a conversion of the Additional Goods the damages payable were between $1,045.02 and $1,306.27. That argument relies on a further finding that the primary judge made, which was that on any understanding Sino had paid 98.9% of the value of the Additional Goods, and so at most Sino would have converted 1.1% of the value of the Additional Goods. 16    M3G’s complaint on this appeal is that the primary judge was wrong to find that Sino had paid M3G an amount which included the full value of the Additional Goods prior to 7 April 2009. It argues that the evidence was against such a finding. It submits that the appropriate finding that should have been made was that Sino had not paid for any of the Additional Goods at the relevant time, and in those circumstances Sino was not entitled to deal with those goods in denial of M3G’s interests in the goods as owner of the goods. 17    M3G contends that Sino could not by making a progress payment pursuant to the Contract become the owner of the Additional Goods: Egan v State Transport Authority (1982) 31 SASR 481; R J Grills Pty Ltd v Dellios [1988] VR 136. 18    Sino answered that contention by relying upon clause 42.2 of the Contract, which provided: Unfixed Plant and Material  The Principal shall not be obliged to pay for any item of unfixed plant and materials which is not incorporated in the Works unless  (a)    that item is listed in Annexure Part A;  (b)    the Contractor provides the amount of additional security stated in Annexure Part A separately approved by the Principal under Clause 5.3; and  (c)    the Contractor establishes to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that the Contractor has paid for the item, the item is properly stored, labelled the sole and exclusive property of the Principal and is adequately protected and insured.  Upon payment to the Contractor of the amount which includes the value of the item, and upon the release of any security, the item shall be the property of the Principal free of any lien or charge.  Any additional security provided for any item of unfixed plant and materials shall be released in accordance with Clause 5.9.  19    M3G argued that clause 42.2 had no application and that Sino could not rely upon those parts of the clause which follow after paragraph (c). Clause 42.2 refers to items listed in Annexure Part A. It was contended by M3G that there were no items listed in Annexure Part A, and that therefore clause 42.2 had no effect or operation. It also argued that clause 42.2 only applied to allow the Principal to make payment for any item of unfixed plant and materials when all three conditions in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of clause 42.2 were met. 20    Sino on the other hand argued that it was entitled to rely upon the last two sentences of the clause without reference to the preceding paragraphs, and if it had made full payment for the Additional Goods it was entitled to the ownership of the goods and to deal with them as it liked. 21    Sino conceded before the primary judge and on appeal that it could only avoid being held liable in conversion if it was entitled to rely upon clause 42.2 in the manner for which it contended. It did not attempt to argue that there was a separate agreement whereby it acquired ownership of the Additional Goods. 22    The primary judge accepted that the language and structure of the clause supported the appellants’ construction. However, she found that “a literal construction would… produce a result unlikely to have been intended by the parties.” She further found at [162]: [162]    On the applicants’ construction, because there are no items of unfixed plant and material which satisfy the preconditions of its obligations to pay, the construction contract would make no provision at all for the transfer to the Principal of any unfixed plant and materials in respect of which it voluntarily paid the value. If the second paragraph of clause 42.2 does not apply to such unfixed items, the Principal could acquire no property in them pursuant to the terms of the construction contract even if it had paid the value and had released any security. It is, in my view, improbable that the parties intended that consequence or the relative rights of the parties under such transactions to be uncertain or left to be resolved by the general law or a separate agreement.  23    Her Honour said that notwithstanding that a literal construction would better accord with the appellant’s interpretation, “the clause must be read in the context of the construction contract as a whole which, as a commercial contract, should be robustly construed in order to avoid irrational or unintended results”: at [163]. 24    She concluded at [164]-[165]: [164]    On that basis, in my opinion, the failure to specify any items in Annexure Part A Item 47 did not deprive clause 42.2 of all operation. The second paragraph is capable of independent application to unfixed items which are not subject to Sino’s obligation to pay imposed by the first paragraph. On a robust construction, according to the applicable principles, paragraph 2 of clause 42.2 in my view extends to unfixed plant and equipment for which Sino was not obliged to pay.  [165]    The second paragraph assumes that, on payment to the Contractor, the item shall be the property of the Principal free of lien or charge. The application of clause 42.2 thus appears limited to unfixed plant and equipment in relation to which the Contractor can pass property to the Principal.  25    Her Honour found at [169] in relation to the construction of clause 42.2: [169]    Therefore, on the better view, if Sino paid M3G an amount including the value of unfixed items such as the kitchen goods and such additional goods as were still unfixed (given there was no evidence that there was any security), in my opinion, property in such goods passed to Sino pursuant to clause 42.2 of the construction contract.  26    There was a dispute as to whether Sino had paid the full amount, which was decided adversely to M3G. Her Honour made the following finding at [184]: [184]    I am satisfied that Sino, prior to 7 April 2010, paid M3G an amount which included the full value of the kitchen goods and the additional goods, and that title in those goods therefore passed to Sino pursuant to clause 42.2 of the construction contract. In my opinion, Sino paid M3G the full value of items 1 to 4 as at December 2008, save for $422,344.00. I accept Mr Stoney’s evidence that the withheld amount did not relate to the kitchen goods or the additional goods and therefore did not detract from Sino’s payment of the full value of those goods.  27    Mr Stoney assisted and was later nominated as the representative of the Superintendent under the Contract, Mr McFie. The primary judge described him at [8]: [8]    … Together with CPMM’s Project Director, Graham Harris, and its Project Director of Services, John Bonnette, Mr Stoney was the principal point of contact with M3G’s representatives in relation to its performance of the construction contract.  The primary judge described Mr Stoney as an impressive witness: at [132] and [135]. 28    Mr Stoney’s evidence was that the Contract originally required Sino to make payments to M3G according to a payment schedule which related to milestone events. However, when it became obvious that M3G had cashflow problems, Mr Stoney negotiated with Mr Robertson of M3G for an amended payment schedule. That amended payment schedule was confirmed by Mr McAdam on 17 December 2008 (Amended Payment Schedule). 29    There was no dispute that items 1 to 4 of the Amended Payment Schedule included the Additional Goods. Mr Stoney’s evidence was that: Items 1 to 4 of the Amended Payment Schedule included the supply of all the building modules required for the FRRCC [the Site] in a “fitted out” condition as manufactured, including the modules comprising the kitchen. The value of the modules was $8,446,892, as recorded in both the Price Schedule and the Amended Payment Schedule in Appendix A of the Contract.  30    He said that by 5 March 2009, save for $422,344.00 which was withheld, Sino had paid M3G for all of the works comprising Items 1 to 4 of the Amended Payment Schedule. He said that the amount withheld did not relate to the Kitchen Goods, but to the further fitout and installation works required to obtain shire approval of occupancy of the entire Site, including the accommodation units and the central buildings. 31    His evidence was that: The kitchen Assets had already been paid for by Sino and the only outstanding payments due to M3G related to further fit-out and installation works required in respect of those Assets in order to ensure the fitness for occupation of the accommodation units at the FRRCC.  32    Mr Stoney said that after 5 March 2009, on 3 April 2009, Sino paid Lenny’s $93,500.00 at the request of M3G, which reduced the amount withheld to $337,344.00. Mr Stoney said that the amount withheld was less than the value of undelivered goods and incomplete installation and fitout works attributed to Items 1 to 4 of the Amended Payment Schedule, which he identified as follows: Loose Furniture     $155,909 Gym Equipment     $100,000 Televisions    $    9,200 Installation of kitchen equipment     $  63,380 Installation of coolroom and bar    $ 5,750 Beer garden roof/ shade sails    $  46,875 TOTAL    $381,114  33    M3G argued that the certificate issued by Mr Stoney was not in respect of any particular building or goods and it was irrelevant how Mr Stoney subjectively arrived at his assessment. It argued that there was no evidence before the primary judge as to the date that Mr Stoney certified M3G’s interim progress claim, the amount of work still to be performed by M3G as at 19 December 2008, and whether or not Mr Stoney had over certified or under certified the amount of M3G’s entitlement as at that date. 34    Therefore it contended it was not open to the primary judge to find that Sino had paid for all of the Additional Goods. 35    In the alternative, M3G argued that if Sino had paid the full value of the Additional Goods on 19 December 2008, that did not remain the case. It argued that the Amended Payment Schedule was never given contractual force by the parties as it remained subject to Sino’s approval. Insofar as Mr Stoney acted in accordance with the Amended Payment Schedule it was because he wrongly believed that the Amended Payment Schedule bound him. 36    When Mr Stoney further certified on 5 March 2009 because of his erroneous belief he under certified the amount payable to M3G, and as a result if there previously had been a payment for all of the Additional Goods the under certification meant that they had no longer been paid for. 37    M3G argued that her Honour was wrong to conclude that if the Additional Goods had been paid for that action could not be retrospectively reversed by reason of any later miscalculations or rectifications. 38    There was an additional complication in this proceeding, and that relates to the question of damages, the quantum of which was a live issue before the primary judge and on appeal. In a claim for conversion the plaintiff’s damages are to be assessed as at the date of the conversion by reference to the value of the property at that date: Associated Midland Corporation Ltd v Bank of New South Wales [1983] 1 NSWLR 533 at 550 per Mahoney JA. The only evidence led by the appellants as to the value of the Additional Goods in the place they were located and the state they were in on 7 April 2009 was the invoices that had issued when M3G had purchased the goods. Consideration of Appeal 39    Clause 42.2 has to be construed in the context of the Contract as a whole because the other provisions may reveal the proper meaning of the clause under consideration. If the words are plain and unambiguous they must be given their plain meaning, even if that leads to a capricious or unreasonable result. However, if the ordinary meaning of the words is inconsistent with other clauses of the Contract, that may be a reason to depart from the plain meaning. If the words are ambiguous then the words should be given a meaning that is not “capricious, unreasonable, inconvenient or unjust”: Australian Broadcasting Commission v Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd (1973) 129 CLR 99 at 109 per Gibbs J. A commercial contract should be construed in accordance with business commonsense: MLW Technology Pty Ltd v May [2005] VSCA 29. 40    The Contract required M3G to execute the works identified in the Contract in accordance with the terms of the Contract. The Contract contained as Schedule 1 the “Australian Standard General Conditions of Contract for Design and Construct” (Standard). 41    The Standard covers the following type of project procurement methods: (a)    Design and Construct Contract.  (b)    Design Development and Construct Contract.  (c)    Design, Novate and Construct Contract.  42    Clause 3.1 of the Contract provides that the Contractor (M3G) shall execute and complete the work under the Contract in accordance with the requirements of the Contract. The work under the Contract is defined to mean “the work which the Contractor is or may be required to execute under the Contract and includes the Contractor’s Design Obligations, variations, remedial work, Constructional Plant and Temporary Works”. The “works” is defined to mean “the whole of the work to be executed in accordance with the Contract, including variations provided for by the Contract, which by the Contract is to be handed over to the Principal”. 43    Clause 5.1 provides for the Contractor to give security for the purpose of ensuring the due and proper performance of the Contract. Clause 5 states that the security required to be provided is identified in Annexure Part A. 44    Clause 5.9 addresses the release of security if security is being given by the Contractor. It provides: If the Contractor has provided security then the Principal shall release it when required by Clause 42.6. If the Contractor has provided additional security for any item of unfixed plant and materials pursuant to Clause 42.2, the Principal shall release that additional security within 14 days of the incorporation into the Works of the unfixed plant or materials.  45    Clause 42 deals with certificates and payments. Clause 42.1 provides for the regime whereby the Contractor is to deliver the Contractor’s claims for payment. It relevantly provides: At the times for payment claims stated in Annexure Part A and upon the issue of a Certificate of Practical Completion and within the time prescribed by Clause 42.5, the Contractor shall deliver to the Superintendent claims for payment supported by evidence of the amount due to the Contractor and such information as the Superintendent may reasonably require. Claims for payment shall:  (a)    include the value of work carried out by the Contractor in the performance of the Contract to that time together with all amounts then otherwise due to the Contractor arising out of or in connection with the Contract or for any alleged breach thereof;  (b)    include the total amount previously certified pursuant to this Clause 42.1;  (c)    include the amount of the Contract Sum being claimed by the Contractor; and  (d)    separately identify work attracting GST and work which does not attract GST.  46    Once the Contractor has submitted a claim for payment the Superintendent, who was defined in clause 2 to mean the person stated in Annexure Part A as the Superintendent, must consider the claim and provide a payment certificate in respect of that claim. 47    Clause 42.1 specifically provides that payment made under clause 42.1 does not prejudice the right of either the Contractor or the Principal (Sino) to dispute that the amount paid was properly due and payable. It also provides that payment of monies shall not be an admission of liability or evidence that the work has been executed satisfactorily. The clause also allows the Superintendent to correct any certificate given if an error is demonstrated. Lastly, it provides that the issue of a certificate does not prevent the Contractor having the dispute resolved in accordance with clause 47. Clause 47 provides for dispute resolution. 48    We have already identified clause 42.2. Clause 42.4 “Effect of Certificates” is also relevant. It provides: The issue of a payment certificate or a Certificate of Practical Completion shall not constitute approval of any work or other matter nor shall it prejudice any claim by the Principal or the Contractor.  Prior to and as a condition precedent of the granting of a Certificate of Practical Completion, the Contractor shall (at its own cost, and in a manner approved by the Principal), assign full right, title and interest in and to any part of the Works in respect of which property has not already passed to the Principal.  49    Clause 42.6 requires the Superintendent to issue a final certificate in the time prescribed in clause 42.6. 50    Clause 43.5 allows the Principal at the request of the Contractor to make payments on behalf of the Contractor directly to any worker or subcontractor. 51    Appendix A is the “Price & Payment Schedule”. The Buildings Schedule within Appendix A identified 12 separate types of buildings that were to be constructed on the Site at a cost of $8,446,892. The services which were to be provided by M3G were separately identified in the sum of $3,807,275. Lastly, Appendix A provided for installation costs of $11,600,000, making a total contract price of $23,854,167. 52    Appendix A also contained a payment schedule, and insofar as it related to the buildings it provided: 2.    PAYMENT SCHEDULE  Buildings (Total AUD $8,446,892)  1.    30% deposit being AUD $2,534,068 due within 7 days of receipt of invoice when the contract has been executed;  (N.B. The following payments are being made whilst the Contract is being executed:      USD $600,000 direct to CIMC China as a deposit on the first 30 accommodation units; and     AUD $300,000 to M3g to assist with their cashflow requirement for the project).  The balance of the funds required to make up the 30% deposit being approximately AUD $1,602,628 will be paid within 7 days, upon receipt of invoice after the contract has been executed by both parties.  2.    50% being AUD $4,223,446 within 7 days of receipt of invoice, upon receipt of Meinhardt Inspection certificate prior to despatch ex China;  3.    10% being AUD $844,689 within 30 days of receipt of invoice, upon arrival of buildings onsite; and  4.    10% being AUD $844,689 within 30 days of receipt of invoice, upon receipt of shire approval for occupancy;  Contractor is to provide a Bank Guarantee for 2.5% of the total value of the buildings being AUD $211,172 valid for the 12 month duration of the Defects Liability period.  53    The installation schedule does not need to be addressed. 54    Annexure Part A states that it is to be “attached to General Conditions of Contract and shall be read as part of the Contract”. It consists of a number of items which are referred to in the General Conditions, including the law to be applied; the contract sum; the deposit which had to be paid by the Principal; the security which had to be provided by the Contractor; and the amount of public liability insurance to be effected by the Contractor. 55    Item 47 of Annexure Part A provides: Unfixed plant and materials for which payment claims may be made before they are incorporated in the Works: (Clause 42.2).  No unfixed plant and materials were identified. 56    Item 13 required M3G to provide security in the amount of 2.5% of the contract sum. Annexure Part A was silent as to additional security. 57    M3G submitted its claims for payments in accordance with the Contract and the Superintendent certified those claims from time to time. The claims were accompanied by invoices which identified the amount of the claim. 58    Evidence was led before the primary judge of a side agreement between M3G and Sino for Sino to pay a subcontractor of M3G direct in accordance with clause 43.5. The parties agreed at that time when Sino paid that amount directly to the subcontractor that: 6.    Pursuant to clause 42.2 of the Agreement, we confirm once payment is made all goods supplied by CIMC shall be the property of Sino.  59    The evidence was not led for the purpose of establishing post-contractual behaviour that bore upon the construction of the Contract. It is not clear to us for what purpose the evidence was tendered. Indeed counsel was unable to assist as to the relevance of that evidence, and we have disregarded it in our consideration of the issues on the appeal. 60    The Contract is for the carrying out of the Works, and it is not a contract for the sale of goods. As we have mentioned, Sino expressly conceded that unless it obtained property in the Additional Goods pursuant to clause 42.2 it would be liable in conversion. Sino did not argue that property in the goods passed by operation of law because of the payment made by Sino and because there had been a delivery of the goods to Sino. Sino limited its claim for an entitlement to the Additional Goods to any contractual right given by clause 42.2. We have approached the appeal on that basis. We have not considered whether Sino was otherwise entitled to ownership of the Additional Goods. 61    The Principal’s obligation to pay the Contractor in respect of the buildings, services and installation is in accordance with the Payment Schedule. That Schedule recognises four different occasions when Sino must pay M3G in respect of the buildings. Those payment occasions do not reflect the purchase or delivery of unfixed items or materials. The payment occasions are fixed by the parties to recognise the progress of the works generally. Apart from clause 42.2 there is no obligation on Sino to pay for any particular items or materials at any time. Its obligations for payment are contained within the Payment Schedule. Unless clause 42.2 operates, Sino cannot be required to pay any monies to M3G except in accordance with the Payment Schedule. As we have already noted Sino may, if requested by M3G, agree to pay a worker or subcontractor directly: clause 43.5. However, there is no obligation on Sino to do so. It would make that payment if requested at its own election. 62    Clause 42.2 provides that the Contractor can require the Principal to pay for an item of unfixed plant and materials if the Contractor complies with paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of clause 42.2. Clause 42.2 has the effect that if the Contractor can satisfy paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) the Contractor can oblige the Principal to pay for unfixed items and materials. Clause 42.2 is unlike clause 43.5 in that the Contractor can require the Principal to make payment so long as the Contractor has complied with paragraphs (a), (b) and (c). It is not in the case of this clause a matter of election on the part of the Principal. 63    When the Contractor requires the Principal to pay for the items of unfixed plant and materials the Principal is protected so that when the security that is taken is released the item of unfixed plant and materials become the property of the Principal, free of any lien or charge. 64    There is no suggestion in this case that M3G acted so as to oblige Sino to make the payment in accordance with the clause. Indeed it could not have done so because no items were listed in Annexure Part A. Nor was an amount of additional security included in Annexure Part A. M3G could not in those circumstances ever comply with paragraphs (a) and (b) even if it complied with paragraph (c) which, as a matter of fact in this case, it did not. 65    Unless at the time of the execution of the Contract Annexure Part A provides for items of unfixed plant and materials, and for additional security, clause 42.2 in our opinion can have no operation. If the parties have not addressed paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 42.2 in the Annexure Part A, the Contractor can never comply with the clause, so it cannot operate. Clause 42.2 cannot operate unless paragraphs (a) and (b) are addressed at the time of the execution of the Contract. 66    Both paragraphs (a) and (b) require the parties to apply their minds to whether or not clause 42.2 should operate at the time of the execution of the Contract. Paragraph (c) would apply if items of plant and materials had been listed in Annexure Part A and the Contractor had provided the additional security stated in Annexure Part A, and, during the currency of the Contract, the Contractor established to the satisfaction of the Superintendent the matters in paragraph (c). 67    We see no difficulty with that construction because if Annexure Part A does not include any item of plant and materials then clearly the parties intended that the Contractor could not require the Principal to pay for any items of unfixed plant and materials during the currency of the Contract. 68    We disagree with the primary judge that the words which follow paragraph (c) have any operation independently of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c). In our opinion, the words which follow paragraph (c) are a consequence of the actions in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), and provide protection to the Principal if the Contractor complies with paragraph (c) and the Contract has at the time of execution recognised paragraphs (a) and (b) in Annexure Part A. The Principal requires the protection that clause 42.2 provides where the Principal is being compelled to pay for items of plant and materials. The items of plant and materials which the Principal is being compelled to pay for may or may not have been manufactured or may or may not be on site when the Principal has to pay for the items, and so the Principal has to be protected. The protection is in the parties recognising that property in the items has passed to the Principal free of any lien or charge. 69    We think that is the plain meaning of the words in the clause. 70    The words which follow paragraph (c) in clause 42.2 speak about “the amount”, “the item”, and “the release of any security”. “[T]he amount” which is referred to is the amount to be paid for the unfixed plant and materials which have been identified in Annexure Part A, for which security has been given in accordance with Annexure Part A, and where the Contractor has satisfied paragraph (c). “[T]he item” is the item which is identified in the opening words of clause 42.2, and must be an item which is identified in Annexure Part A. “The security” which is referred to is the security identified in Annexure Part A and referred to in paragraph (b). The last paragraph in the clause, which refers to the release of security, also refers to the security mentioned in paragraph (b). 71    We do not agree with Sino’s contention that the words after paragraph (c) can stand by themselves for the further reason that if they operated independently of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of clause 42.2, the parties would never know whether property in unfixed plant and materials had passed to Sino without knowing exactly how the Superintendent had arrived at a particular certificate. 72    It was not the parties’ objective intention that Sino could, without reference to M3G, purchase from M3G, independently of the works, items of unfixed plant and materials without reference to M3G: Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35; (2004) 218 CLR 451 at [22]; Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at [40]. 73    We do not see any difficulty with the construction we give clause 42.2. We think the construction is consistent with business commonsense. Ordinarily property in unfixed plant and materials does not pass to the Principal until such time as it is incorporated in the works: Egan v State Transport Authority. Clause 42.2 provides for a regime whereby property might pass in those items in other circumstances, but it does not otherwise detract from the general rule that property in unfixed plant and materials will not pass until incorporated in the works. 74    We also disagree with the primary judge that the Contract does not provide for the passing of property. Clause 42.4 expressly provides that prior to and as a condition precedent of the granting of a Certificate of Practical Completion, the Contractor shall (at its own cost, and in a manner approved by the Principal), assign full right, title and interest in and to any part of the works in respect of which property has not already passed to the Principal. 75    For those reasons, the construction contended for by M3G must be accepted, and in those circumstances, because of the concession made, Sino must be held liable for conversion. 76    That leaves only the question of damages. As we have said, M3G relied upon the invoices which show the cost to M3G of the purchase of the Additional Goods. No other evidence was adduced in relation to the value of the Additional Goods. 77    It is true, as Sino has contended, that in relation to the Kitchen Goods her Honour found that those goods had depreciated in value and only had a value of between 40% and 50% of their cost value at the date that Sino obtained the property in those goods. However, there were particular reasons for the depreciation in the value of the Kitchen Goods. They were custom built for the Site and therefore had little value to other parties apart from Sino. 78    In the case of the Additional Goods Sino had undertaken to Finkelstein J that the value of the goods should be assessed as their value at the Site on 7 April 2009. In our opinion, the goods had the value contained in the invoices which was demonstrated by the fact that Sino paid for those goods at that price by reason of the Superintendent’s certificate. That does not mean of course that property passed, but the Superintendent recognised their cost at that time as cost price. 79    Insofar as Sino has paid a sum of monies that reflects the cost of the Additional Goods, Sino can prove in the administration of M3G for that amount. Sino will rank with the other unsecured creditors for the cost of those items reflected in the judgment of this Court. It was not argued by Sino that any amount it had paid to M3G pursuant to the certificates certified by Mr Stoney could reduce the damages otherwise payable: see Associated Midland Corporation Ltd v Bank of New South Wales at 550-554 per Mahoney JA. 80    For all of those reasons, we would allow the appeal and enter a judgment for M3G in the amount claimed. The parties have not addressed the question of pre-judgment interest, and the parties should be entitled to address that issue by providing short minutes of order. The costs of the appeal have to follow the event. The parties may wish to be heard on the question of costs of the trial having regard to the fact that M3G’s claim against Lenny’s failed.  I certify that the preceding eighty (80) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justices Lander, Gilmour & Gordon.

The second respondent is an examiner under the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) (‘the Commonwealth Act’) and within the provisions of the Australian Crime Commission (South Australia) Act 2004 (SA) (‘the State Act’). 2    On 10 June 2009 the Board of the Commission made an instrument by resolution entitled ‘Australian Crime Commission — State Special Investigation Consent and Determination (High Risk Crime Groups — South Australia) 2009’. The instrument recorded or effected two acts by the Board. First, the Board consented to an investigation of a matter relating to activity that, under the State Act is relevant criminal activity. That consent was given under s 55A(3) of the Commonwealth Act which provides as follows: (3)    The ACC cannot, under a law of a State: (a)    investigate a matter relating to a relevant criminal activity; or (b)    undertake an intelligence operation; unless the Board has consented to the ACC doing so.  3    There is a definition of ‘relevant criminal activity’ in s 4 of the Commonwealth Act and that definition refers to ‘serious and organised crime’ which is a term or expression defined in s 4 of the Commonwealth Act and in s 3 of the State Act. 4    Secondly, the Board made the determination set out in the instrument ‘in relation to that relevant criminal activity, acting under the South Australian Act, by virtue of s 55A(4) of the Commonwealth Act’. Section 55A(4) of the Commonwealth Act provides as follows: (4)    A law of a State may confer on the Inter Governmental Committee, the Board, the Chair of the Board, a member of the Board, the CEO, an examiner or a member of the staff of the ACC a duty, function or power that: (a)    relates to the investigation of a matter relating to a relevant criminal activity in so far as the relevant crime is, or the relevant crimes are or include, an offence or offences against a law of the State (irrespective of whether that offence or those offences have a federal aspect); and (b)    is either: (i)    of the same kind as a duty, function or power conferred on the Inter Governmental Committee, the Board, the Chair of the Board, a member of the Board, the CEO, an examiner or a member of the staff of the ACC by this Act or any other Act (whether or not the last mentioned duty, function or power relates to the investigation of that matter); or (ii)    of a kind specified in regulations made for the purposes of this subparagraph.  5    The section of the State Act under which the Board of the Commission acted in making the Determination was s 8, which, so far as relevant, is in the following terms: (1)    The Board has the following functions: (a)    to determine, in writing, whether an ACC State intelligence operation is a special operation or whether an ACC State investigation is a special investigation; (b)    to determine, in writing, the class or classes of persons to participate in an ACC State intelligence operation or ACC State investigation; (c)    to establish task forces; (d)    such other functions as are conferred on the Board by other provisions of this Act. … (3)    The Board may determine, in writing, that an ACC State investigation is a special investigation. Before doing so, it must consider whether ordinary police methods of investigation into the matters are likely to be effective. (4)    A determination under subsection (2) or (3) must— (a)    describe the general nature of the circumstances or allegations constituting the relevant criminal activity to which the operation or investigation relates; and (b)    state that the serious and organised crime is, or the serious and organised crimes are or include, an offence or offences against a law of the State but need not specify the particular offence or offences; and (c)    set out the purpose of the operation or investigation.  6    Although the Australian Crime Commission – State Special Investigation Consent and Determination (High Risk Crime Groups – South Australia) 2009 had the dual function I have described, it is the determination part of it which is important in this case and I will refer to it simply as the Determination. 7    The Determination consists of nine clauses and two schedules. The various clauses address aspects of s 8 of the State Act. For example, clause 5 addresses subsection 8(3) and clause 9 addresses paragraph 8(4)(c).  8    Clause 6(b) of the Determination provides as follows: (b)    Pursuant to subsection 55A(5A) of the Commonwealth Act, the Board consents to the performance of a duty or function, and the exercise of a power, of a kind described in subsection 55A(5) of the Commonwealth Act: (i)    presently conferred; or (ii)    from time to time conferred; on the CEO or examiners of the ACC by a law of the State of South Australia, including the South Australian Act, in relation to the State special investigation, and this consent shall continue through the currency of the State special investigation.  9    Section 55A(5A) of the Commonwealth Act provides as follows: (5A)    The CEO or an examiner cannot perform a duty or function, or exercise a power, under a law of a State: (a)    relating to the investigation of a matter relating to a relevant criminal activity; or (b)    relating to the undertaking of an intelligence operation; unless the Board has consented to the CEO or the examiner doing so.  10    Of particular importance in this case is the provision in the Determination linked to paragraphs 8(1)(b) and 8(4)(a) of the State Act. 11    As to the former, the Determination provides as follows: 7.    Classes of persons to participate in investigation Pursuant to paragraph 8(1)(b) of the South Australian Act, the classes of persons to participate in the State special investigation are those mentioned in Schedule 2. … Schedule 2    Classes of persons 1.    The CEO. 2.    Each person who is: (a)    a member of the staff of the ACC; and (b)    identified in writing by the CEO, or a delegate of the CEO, as a person whose duties include providing services in relation to operations and investigations under the Commonwealth Act. 3.    Each person who is: (a)    an officer or member of the staff of any of the following agencies: (i)    an agency of which a Board member is head (other than the CEO) in his or her capacity as a Board member; (ii)    the Australian Taxation Office; (iii)    AUSTRAC; (iv)    the Department of Immigration and Citizenship; (v)    the New South Wales Crime Commission; (vi)    the Queensland Crime and Misconduct Commission; (vii)    the Australian Defence Force; (viii)    the Department of Defence; (ix)    the South Australian Department of Fisheries and Wildlife; and (b)    identified in writing by the head of that agency, or a delegate of the head, as a person whose duties include providing services in relation to operations and investigations under the Commonwealth Act.  12    Examiners are not included in the list in Schedule 2 and this is a ground upon which the applicant challenges the summons issued by the second respondent. 13    As to paragraph 8(4)(a), Schedule 1 of the Determination which is entitled ‘Authorised investigation’ is in the following terms: 1.    Investigation An investigation to determine whether, in accordance with the allegations mentioned in clauses 3 and 4 and in the circumstances mentioned in clause 2, relevant criminal activity: (a)    was committed before the commencement of this instrument; or (b)    was in the process of being committed on the commencement of this instrument; or (c)    may in future be committed.  2.    Circumstances The general nature of the circumstances constituting relevant criminal activity that may have been, may be, or may in future be, occurring are those implied from information available to Australian law enforcement agencies indicating that:- (a)    High Risk Crime Groups are involved in a range of serious and organised crime activity in and impacting on South Australia, including: illegal drug dealings; fraud; corruption and bribery of officials; perverting the course of justice; murder, kidnapping and other offences involving violence; extortion and blackmail; obtaining financial benefit by vice engaged in by others; theft; firearms offences; and money laundering; (b)    they tend to be sophisticated, resilient, flexible, use key facilitators and operate across multi-jurisdictional illicit commodity markets; (c)    they may generate profits through their commission of serious frauds and deceptions as a means of enabling their primary criminal activities; and (d)    effective targeting of these groups requires a multi-agency intelligence-driven approach at a national level with access to coercive powers.  3.    Allegations The general nature of the allegations constituting relevant criminal activity that may have been, may be, or may in future be, committed is that certain persons, in concert with one another or with other persons, may be engaged in 1 or more of the following activities: (a)    murder; (b)    kidnapping; (c)    blackmail, extortion, and unlawful threats; (d)    other offences involving violence; (e)    obtaining financial benefit by vice engaged in by others; (f)    illegal drug dealings; (g)    firearm offences; (h)    bribery or corruption of public officers or abuse of public office; (i)    theft; (j)    deception and dishonest dealing with documents; (k)    money laundering; (l)    offences relating to judicial proceedings contrary to Part 7, Division 3 of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA); (m)    such other incidental offences that the head of the special investigation authorised by this instrument suspects may be directly or indirectly connected with, or may be a part of, a course of activity involving the commission of any of the offences mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (l).  14    Clause 1 in Schedule 1 refers to a clause 4, but there is no clause 4 in the Determination. This is a ground upon which the applicant challenges the Determination. 15    The period of the authorisation referred to in the Determination was extended to 30 June 2011 by Australian Crime Commission — State Special Investigation Consent and Determination (High Risk Crime Groups — South Australia) Amendment No 1 of 2010. Nothing in this case turns on the amendment. 16    The applicant was served with a summons and schedule requiring the production of documents under s 19 of the State Act (‘Summons’). Annexed to the summons and schedule were the Board’s Determination and the Amendment, a written statement of the type referred to in s 21(3) of the State Act and a set of explanatory notes. 17    The applicant advances three arguments in support of his challenge to either the Determination, the Summons or the conduct of the examination. Those arguments are as follows. First, he submits that the Determination is incomplete and its scope is uncertain because in clause 1 of Schedule 1 there is a reference to the allegations mentioned in clauses 3 and 4 and yet there is no clause 4. The Determination is therefore invalid and if it is invalid so is the Summons. Secondly, he submits that the Summons is invalid because the second respondent had no authority to issue it. He had no authority because he was not identified in Schedule 2 of the Determination in the class or classes of persons ‘to participate in an … ACC State investigation’ as required by paragraph 8(1)(b) of the State Act. Thirdly, he submits that his examination should be restricted because there are criminal proceedings pending against him and the second respondent intends to ask him questions about matters which are the subject of those charges. The applicant submits that he should be restrained from doing so. The Validity of the Determination 18    The applicant submits that the Determination is invalid because it does not describe ‘the general nature of the circumstances or allegations constituting the relevant criminal activity to which the … investigation relates’ as required by paragraph 8(4)(a) of the State Act. The applicant submits that this requirement goes to the validity of the Determination and a failure to meet it means that the Determination is invalid. 19    The requirement in paragraph 8(4)(a) is expressed in mandatory terms, that is, a determination ‘must’ describe ‘the general nature of the circumstances or allegations constituting the relevant criminal activity to which the … investigation relates’. Furthermore, the significance of a proper delineation of the ACC operation or investigation is made clear by other sections in the Act: s 17 (power of examiner to conduct examination), subsection 18(6) (scope of questions at an examination); subsection 19(8) (power to summon witnesses and take evidence; s 23 (failure of witnesses to attend and answer questions). In addition, by reason of subsection 19(3) a summons under subsection 19(1) must be accompanied by a copy of the determination of the Board that, relevantly, the State ACC investigation is a special investigation. Therefore, the proposed examinee has a right to receive a copy of the determination including all that it must contain by reason of s 8. That will provide the proposed examinee with some notice about the proposed examination.   20    In P v Board of the ACC (2006) 151 FCR 114 the Full Court of this Court addressed subsections 7C(1)(d) and (3) of the Commonwealth Act. Subsections 8(1)(a) and (3) are the equivalent subsections in the State Act. The Full Court said (at 122 [29]): The requirements for writing in s 7C(1)(d) and (3) serve another purpose. Pursuant to s 28(2), a summons requiring a person to appear for examination must be accompanied by a copy of the relevant determination pursuant to s 7C(3). Section 7C(4) provides that such a determination is to identify the general nature of the circumstances or allegations constituting the relevant criminal activity, the federal nature of the investigation and its purpose. The purpose of serving a copy of the determination with the summons is to demonstrate to the person summoned:  •    the authority by which the summons has been issued; and •    the nature of the subject matter with respect to which he or she is to be examined.  21    There is no reason to think that the observations in this passage do not apply with equal force in the case of the State Act. 22    It seems to me that the requirement in paragraph 8(4)(a) is such that if it is not met then a determination is invalid (Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355). So much appears to have been conceded by the Commission in P v Board of the ACC (at 121 [26]) and I do not think seriously disputed by the Commission in this case. 23    In the course of submissions counsel for the respondents referred to s 16 in the Commonwealth Act and counsel for the applicant referred to the equivalent section in the State Act, that is, s 36. The submissions were not detailed and on the face of it neither of those sections apply in this case. Section 16 is limited to ‘federally relevant criminal activity’ and s 36 is limited to a challenge ‘in any court of the State’. In any event, the respondents accept that s 16 does not protect a jurisdictional error (Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth of Australia (2003) 211 CLR 476) and in view of my conclusion that the requirement in paragraph 8(4)(a) goes to jurisdiction, the precise scope of s 16 or its equivalent in the State Act is not material to the outcome of the applicant’s challenge. In other words, while those sections might preclude review for mere error of law, they do not preclude review for jurisdictional error. 24    Having decided that the requirement in paragraph 8(4)(a) of the State Act goes to jurisdiction, the next question is what is required by paragraph 8(4)(a). The respondents refer to the use of the disjunctive ‘or’ in the phrase ‘the general nature of the circumstances or allegations’ and submit that as there was no uncertainty about the ‘circumstances’ described in the Determination any uncertainty (assuming for present purposes there was uncertainty) in the description of the ‘allegations’ was immaterial. In other words, the respondents submit that a determination must describe the general nature of the circumstances constituting the relevant criminal activity or the general nature of the allegations constituting the relevant criminal activity, but need not describe both. If as here the general nature of the circumstances constituting the relevant criminal activity are described adequately the fact that there was not an adequate description of the general nature of the allegations constituting the relevant criminal activity does not affect validity. There is force in this submission. I do not see why in every case the Board must deal separately with circumstances and allegations. If it chose to deal with only one then I do not think it would be acting in breach of paragraph 8(4)(a). The difficulty here is that the Board has chosen to describe both and as they overlap in terms of content it is arguable that an incomplete description of one affects the overall description. As I have reached the conclusion that there has been no breach of the paragraph for the reason which follows I do not need to decide this point. 25    The applicant referred me to various common law cases which discussed uncertainty as a ground for judicial review. In particular I was referred to Ballarat Broadcasters Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (unreported, Davies J, 16 September 1988), Television Corporation Ltd v The Commonwealth of Australia (1963) 109 CLR 59 at 71 per Kitto J and Hitchener v Ham [1961] VR 97 at 103-104 per Sholl J. There are of course a number of other cases (see, for example, the authorities referred to in Aronson M, Dyer B and Groves M, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (3rd ed, Thomson Lawbook Co, 2004) at 331-334). The applicant also referred to cases in which a Court has had to consider whether to read words into or out of a statutory provision or piece of delegated legislation. In particular, I was referred to Wentworth Securities Ltd v Jones [1980] AC 74; Taylor v Centennial Newstan Pty Ltd (2009) 76 NSWLR 379 and Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZJGV (2009) 238 CLR 642.  26    The applicant also referred to the provisions of the ADJR Act which provide that uncertainty is a ground of review in relation to decisions (subsections 5(1)(c) and 5(2)(h)) and conduct (subsections 6(1)(e) and 6(2)(h)). 27    There was passing reference in submissions to the question of whether the Determination was a legislative or executive instrument. It may be that this is not an issue of any real significance (Parks Holdings Pty Ltd v Chief Executive Officer of Customs (2004) 81 ALD 365 at 385-386 per Goldberg J) and in any event I am satisfied that if the reference to ‘and clause 4’ is a mere slip then I can ignore it. 28    The first task for the Court is to construe the relevant provisions of the Determination. If the Court is unable to construe the provision so that it has a clear meaning or a clear operation then consideration must be given to the doctrine of uncertainty either at common law or under the ADJR Act. That point is not reached in this case because I have reached the conclusion that the reference ‘and 4’ is a mere slip and that there is not even a realistic possibility that there was a clause 4. 29    The applicant’s submission is that it is not clear whether there was a clause 4 but it was not included in the determination in writing as required by subsections 8(3) and (4) or was not in the copy of the determination which accompanied the summons as required by subsection 19(3) or that there was never a clause 4. I think it is sufficiently clear that there was never a clause 4 for two reasons. First, the wording of each of clauses 2 and 3 follows closely the wording of paragraph 8(4)(a) of the State Act and there is no reason to think that they are not an exhaustive statement of the general nature of the circumstances or allegations constituting the relevant criminal activity. Clause 3 is very general and embodies an approach of describing the general nature of the allegations simply by listing a number of offences. The list of offences is extensive and, having regard to the terms of paragraph (m), on the face of it complete. The offences listed in clause 3 bear a close resemblance to those identified in clause 2. There is simply no reason to think, as the applicant postulated, that there might be a clause 4 which limited clause 3 to a particular time, a particular location, particular groups or particular methods or techniques. Secondly, if consideration is given to clauses 2 and 3 together one can see an attempt to cover the matters identified in the definition of ‘serious and organised crime’ in section 3 of the State Act. It is true that the approach taken in the Determination is a very general one but there is simply no reason to think that anything has been left out. 30    The applicant’s first ground of challenge must be rejected. The Validity of the Summons 31    The applicant’s second ground of challenge relates to the Summons issued by the second respondent under s 19 of the State Act rather than the Determination. It was that the second respondent, or the class of which he was a member, that is, examiners, were not named as persons to participate in the ACC State special investigation in Schedule 2 of the Determination. The fact that neither the second respondent nor the class of examiners is referred to in Schedule 2 means, so the applicant’s argument runs, that no examiner including the second respondent is entitled to participate in the ACC State special investigation by, among other things, issuing a summons under s 19 of the State Act. 32    The respondents’ first submission is that paragraph 8(1)(b) of the State Act does no more than identify a function of the Board and that it is not mandatory for the Board to determine, in writing, the class or classes of persons to participate in an ACC State investigation. Although there is good reason to think that it is a mandatory requirement (D v Australian Crime Commission (2006) 152 FCR 497 at 507-508 [53]-[54]) I do not need to decide the point because I am satisfied that examiners may exercise their powers under the State Act even though not identified in a determination. 33    The word, ‘examiner’ is not defined in the State Act. The Act provides in subsection 3(2) that a term in the State Act has the same meaning as it has in the Commonwealth Act, unless the contrary intention appears in the Act. There is no suggestion of a contrary intention and ‘examiner’ is defined in s 4 of the Commonwealth Act to mean a person appointed under subsection 46B(1). Section 46B provides as follows: (1)    An examiner is to be appointed by the Governor General by written instrument. Consulting the Inter Governmental Committee (2)    Before the Governor General makes such an appointment, the Minister must consult the members of the Inter-Governmental Committee in relation to the appointment. Legal practitioner (3)    A person must not be appointed as an examiner unless he or she is enrolled as a legal practitioner, and has been so for at least 5 years. Period of appointment (4)    An examiner holds office for the period specified in the instrument of appointment. The period must not exceed 5 years. Note:    An examiner is eligible for reappointment: see the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. Basis of appointment (5)    An examiner may be appointed on a full time basis or on a part time basis.  34    There are other quite extensive provisions dealing with examiners in Part II Division 3 Subdivision B of the Commonwealth Act. It is clear that they stand in quite a different position from the staff of the Commission or of organisations referred to in subsection 7B(2) of the Commonwealth Act. The CEO of the Commission is to consult with them before making arrangements as to the examiner who is to be able to exercise his or her powers under the Act in relation to a special ACC operation/investigation (subsection 46A(3)). There is a similar provision in the State Act (subsection 6(4)). 35    The examiner is guaranteed a level of independence consistent with his or her position and is in a different position from other groups such as those identified in Schedule 2 clause 3 of the Determination in this case. 36    In a broad sense an examiner participates in an ACC State special investigation but I would read paragraph 8(1)(b) of the State Act more narrowly and as being limited to staff of the Commission and officers or members of organisations like those identified in s 7B(2) of the Commonwealth Act or those identified in the Determination in this case. The powers of an examiner are identified in the State Act and conferred by that Act and they depend on there being a special ACC operation/investigation. 37    I should mention that I have not found reference to the use of the word ‘participating’ in other sections of the Act, for example, subsection 29(2), (1) and (11), of assistance in resolving the issue of construction. 38    The applicant’s second ground of challenge must be rejected. The Conduct of the Examination 39    The applicant presently faces a number of criminal charges which are being prosecuted in the criminal courts in South Australia. A redacted copy of the informations and complaint were tendered and became exhibit P2.  40    The Summons contains a notation that no information from the examination will be published to the SA Director of Public Prosecutions or to any person involved with the investigation or prosecution of the charges. At the same time the respondents admit in their Defence that the examiner intends to question the applicant about matters which are relevant to the charges.  41    The applicant submits that to be questioned by an examiner about matters relevant to those charges would be a contempt of court and the examiner should be restrained from doing so. However, he acknowledges that the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Australian Crime Commission v OK (2010) 185 FCR 258 (‘OK’) stands in the way of an acceptance of that submission and that I am bound to follow that decision. Although the Court in OK dealt with the Commonwealth Act, there is, in this respect, no relevant difference between the Commonwealth Act and the State Act. I follow the decision in OK.  42    The applicant’s third ground of challenge must be rejected. Conclusion 43    For the reasons I have given the applicant’s application must be dismissed with costs.  I certify that the preceding forty-three (43) numbered paragraphs is a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Besanko.

It held a licence pursuant to the regime established by the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth) (the TGA Act) and was obliged to comply with the requirements of the licence in manufacturing its products. On 28 April 2003 the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) suspended the licence. Pan could not manufacture or sell any more goods covered by the TGA Act and was obliged to recall goods it had sold. The licence was never restored. Pan became insolvent and was ultimately wound up. 2                     The applicant, Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Ltd (Naturalcare), was one casualty of these events. It sold complementary medicines by mail order. It purchased most of its stock from Pan, and had done so for many years. The recall of goods in stock, the inability of Pan to supply orders that had been accepted and the loss of Pan as a future supplier caused major disruption to its business. Naturalcare lodged a proof of debt claiming a substantial sum to compensate for this disruption. The liquidator has allowed amounts in relation to goods recalled and the failure to supply accepted orders but has denied liability otherwise. Naturalcare sues for damages for the disruption to its business.  3                     The essence of the case for Naturalcare is that, in one way or another, Pan guaranteed the continued supply of products that complied with TGA requirements. Liability is put on various bases, including contract, tort, estoppel and breach of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). Each basis depends upon the course of business dealing between Naturalcare and Pan which commenced in 1989.  Background Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth) and the therapeutic goods legislative regime 4                     Until the TGA Act established the TGA, there was no single authority responsible for the regulation of therapeutic goods in Australia. The objects of the TGA Act are set out in s 4 and include the provision of a national framework for the regulation and control of therapeutic goods and medical devices to ensure their safety, quality, efficacy and timely availability to consumers.  5                     A ‘therapeutic good’ under the TGA Act is broadly defined as a good which is represented in any way to be, or is likely to be taken to be, for therapeutic use (unless specifically excluded or included under s 7 of the TGA Act, which provides for a declaration that goods are or are not therapeutic goods by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Aging). ‘Therapeutic use’ is defined in s 3 of the TGA Act. 6                     The TGA Act applies to therapeutic goods used in Australia (whether produced in Australia or elsewhere) and to therapeutic goods that are exported from Australia. It sets out the legal requirements for manufacturing, supplying and importing of medicines into Australia as well as the requirements for listing or registering all medicines on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (the Register). It also regulates advertising, labelling and product appearance. The TGA Act is supplemented by regulations and various orders and determinations. The Australian Code of Good Manufacturing Practice for Therapeutic Goods – Medicinal Products (the Code) is of particular importance in this case. 7                     The Register was established under Pt 3 of the TGA Act. The Register is a database of information about therapeutic goods for human use which are approved for supply in, or export from, Australia. Any product claiming to have therapeutic qualities must either be listed or registered in the Register before it can be supplied in Australia, unless it is specifically excluded or exempt. As a general rule, higher risk medicines are registered and lower risk medicines are listed. The assessment of a product’s ‘risk’ will largely depend on its ingredients, its form of dosage and the promotional or therapeutic claims made for the product. Many complementary medicines are listed in the Register and some are registered. 8                     The application to have a product listed or registered is made by a ‘sponsor’. Under s 3 of the TGA Act, a sponsor is someone who imports, exports, manufactures or has therapeutic goods imported or manufactured on its behalf, but does not include someone who arranges or personally imports, exports or manufactures therapeutic goods on behalf of another if that person is a resident of, or carrying on business in, Australia. To apply for registration, a sponsor needs to supply product specifications and analytical reports. Necessary product specifications include the formula (generally by way of a formulation certificate), the ingredients including quantities, the size and shape of the pill and a copy of the proposed label. The analytical report identifies the ingredients and their strength and how this supports the therapeutic claims made on the product’s behalf.  9                     A sponsor’s product must be manufactured by an authorised manufacturer in order for the product to be registered. All applications by sponsors of a proposed therapeutic good must specify which approved manufacturer is to produce the product if registration is to be successful. Australian manufacturers of therapeutic goods have to be licensed under Pt 4 of the TGA Act. Manufacturers must also comply with the principles of the Code. Clause 699 of the Code states: ‘To ensure that the responsibilities of both parties are clearly understood and recorded, the arrangements and responsibilities for every aspect of manufacture and quality control that is relevant to Good Manufacturing Practice, for each product made under contract, must be unambiguously specified in writing in a “Specification of GMP Responsibilities”, or equivalent document, signed by a representative of both parties …’ 10                  Naturalcare (as sponsor) and Pan (as manufacturer) entered into a series of GMP or Manufacturing Agreements to satisfy the requirements of cl 699. Those Manufacturing Agreements are outlined in greater detail below. Pan 11                  Selim was the Chief Executive Officer, a director and a shareholder of Pan Laboratories Pty Limited from the time it was established in 1974 until 1999. In 1999, the manufacturing business conducted by Pan Laboratories Pty Limited was transferred to Pan Laboratories (Australia) Pty Limited (which was renamed Jimang Pty Limited on 2 February 2000) and was carried on by it until March 2000 when the business was transferred to Pan Pharmaceuticals Limited. From 1999 to 2000, Selim was the Chief Executive Officer, a director and a majority shareholder of Pan Laboratories (Australia) Pty Limited. When Pan Pharmaceuticals Limited was listed on the Australian Stock Exchange on 23 August 2000, Selim became the Chief Executive Officer, a director and the majority shareholder of the company. Hereafter, ‘Pan’ refers to whichever entity was conducting the manufacturing business from 1974 to April 2003 except where it becomes necessary to distinguish between the corporate entities. 12                  Selim’s job involved day to day contact with sponsors to encourage them to buy Pan’s new and existing products. Between 1974 and 1988 he was the only person at Pan working in a marketing position. Between 1990 and 2003, he was the head of Pan’s Marketing & Sales and Exports departments with a number of Marketing & Sales Managers reporting to him. He claimed to have a number of formal qualifications relevant to his position including a Bachelor of Pharmacy, a Diploma of Food and Drug Analysis, a Master of Science (Organic Chemistry), a Diploma of Herbology and a Ph.D. in Nutrition. 13                  Pan was audited by the TGA in February 1995, November 1995, April 1997 and November 1998. A number of compliance issues were raised in these audits, particularly in the November 1998 audit report. However, Pan remained licensed. Naturalcare 14                  Schadel became involved with complementary medicines in 1979 when he was employed as the North Coast Sales Representative for a range of health food products manufactured by a company called Pretorius Pty Ltd. In 1985 or thereabouts he was appointed as the General Manager of Balance Sports Supplements which had an established relationship with Pan. Schadel met Selim and dealt with him directly in negotiating product development and manufacturing processes between the two companies. In 1987, Schadel became the Sales and Marketing Manager of a business trading under the name of Weider Health and Fitness.  15                  In 1989, with encouragement from Selim, Schadel started his own business known as Styjive Pty Limited from 1989 to 1991 and Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Ltd thereafter, herein referred to as ‘Naturalcare’. Schadel and his wife were initially the sole shareholders of Naturalcare. The company started with only one product called Royal Jelly which was supplied by Pan but initially sourced from overseas as Pan did not have the technology to manufacture it at that time.  Business relationship between Naturalcare and Pan 16                  The business relationship between Naturalcare and Pan was first formalised when the companies entered into a Manufacturing Agreement as required by the Code in 1990. Both Selim and Schadel agreed that the companies were parties to this agreement although a copy was not available to tender in the proceedings. The form and content of the successive Manufacturing Agreements will therefore be discussed in greater detail in the context of those agreements which are in evidence.  17                  The business relationship between the two companies was fostered by a close professional and personal relationship between Selim and Schadel who worked together on the development of Naturalcare’s business, particularly in the early years of their dealings. They met at least once every three months, and probably more often, for three to four hours at a time. Selim and Schadel continued to have regular, though less frequent, meetings until April 2003. At the meetings, Selim proposed new products and discussed their formulas and benefits, as well as discussing business more generally.  18                  In the early 1990s, Selim actively encouraged Schadel to expand Naturalcare’s product range. Schadel remembered having conversations with Selim at this time in words to the following effect: ‘Mr Selim: “I think it’s time for you to introduce several new products so you can compete against Hilton Lifestream, which is Australia’s oldest mail-order company. I have first-hand knowledge of the best product range for a mail order business like [Naturalcare]. I can give you a list of suggested products that are selling well that your customers would like.” Me [Schadel]: “I accept that we need new products, but at the moment we don’t have the cash to purchase so many products at once.” Mr Selim: “I can offer you extended credit until you get established in the future.” ’ 19                  Selim would suggest which products should be added to Naturalcare’s range. If Schadel was interested in the product he would ask Selim to send him a quote and if Schadel found it satisfactory, he would send Pan a purchase order. Selim agreed that they worked ‘closely and collaboratively’ to develop Naturalcare’s business. As a result of that practice, Naturalcare’s range expanded beyond Royal Jelly to include products such as Korean Ginseng, Evening Primrose Oil, Arizona Odourless Garlic, Vitamin E, Vitamin C and Multivitamin and Mineral. By the end of 1992 or thereabouts, Naturalcare offered its customers approximately 26 separate complementary products. To the best of Schadel’s recollection, Selim had suggested all of them and Selim did not deny that this could have been the case. Selim encouraged Naturalcare to purchase all of its product from Pan. 20                  Selim provided financial as well as technical assistance to help Naturalcare expand its range in the early years. Schadel claimed that from 1989 to 1994, Naturalcare received monthly invoices from Pan but would only partially pay selected invoices at the end of the month, irrespective of the total amount owing. Selim agreed that he offered Naturalcare favourable credit terms but added that from about the early 1990s, Naturalcare was required to pay within 45 days for repeat products and only allowed to delay payment on new products. Schadel claimed the credit terms encouraged him to buy products he may not otherwise have bought and also to continue to purchase almost 100 per cent of Naturalcare’s product from Pan until around March 1994. Schadel gave evidence that Naturalcare consistently owed hundreds of thousands of dollars to Pan during this period. It suffices to hold that considerable credit was advanced by Pan to Naturalcare. 21                  Selim also offered Naturalcare assistance in registering products with the TGA including the preparation of product specifications, formulation certificates and initially on the labelling or packaging details for new Naturalcare products. Pan also sent relevant paperwork to the TGA directly on Naturalcare’s behalf until the mid 1990s, although Selim denies that it was Pan’s practice to lodge an application for listing or registration with the TGA on behalf of Naturalcare. Schadel claimed that if the TGA had any queries in relation to ingredients of products or registration requirements, the TGA called Pan, or Naturalcare and then Pan, although Selim denies that the TGA addressed such queries to Pan rather than Naturalcare in its capacity as a sponsor. Again, it suffices to hold that Pan gave considerable assistance to Naturalcare in relation to sponsorship of products. Once a product was registered, Pan manufactured the product for Naturalcare (if Naturalcare submitted an appropriate order) and the product was then added to Naturalcare’s product range. 22                  The usual modus operandi of supply was that Naturalcare sent Pan a purchase order and Pan sent back confirmation if it could source the relevant raw materials and fill the order. A purchase order usually set out the manufacturer’s name and address, the sponsor’s name and address, the sequence number of the order, the product name and Pan’s formula code for the product, a quantity of product, the price of the product (taken by the mid 1990s from an annual price list supplied to Naturalcare to be discussed below), the total amount payable for the order, the required delivery date, and the place of delivery. Pan informed its sponsors of its policy that purchase orders were to be submitted by the tenth day of each month and Pan would then attempt to deliver the goods by the end of the following month. Pan usually ordered its raw materials by the fifteenth day of each month. If it could not source the raw materials required to produce the product, Pan’s practice was to withhold confirmation of the purchase order by not issuing an order confirmation. Schadel programmed in a lead time of three months in case of such eventualities, when for example, the product had to be sourced internationally. If the price of a product had changed since the issue of the annual price list, Pan would send the confirmation order back to Naturalcare stating the new price. If Pan did not receive a response within a couple of days of sending the confirmation order it would begin to process it. 23                  Pan normally required Naturalcare to purchase prescribed batch sizes. The size of the minimum batches increased over the years, as did Pan’s commitment to enforcing the policy. Selim helped Naturalcare on several occasions by agreeing for Pan to do an early or special production run for Naturalcare. However, Schadel wanted to find a way to test new products on the market without having to pay the costs involved in filling Pan’s minimum production runs. In about 1992, Selim suggested that he should contact a Mr Sid Sarantis, the owner of a company called Markethaven Pty Limited. The company did contract packaging and also bought Pan products to sell to supermarkets. Schadel said Selim suggested: ‘ “He [Sarantis] could supply you my products for testing from batches ordered by him and then, if your customers like that product, you may buy a full batch run from Pan in the future.” ’ Selim gave evidence that he introduced Schadel and Sarantis because Schadel wanted to find a company to do smaller packaging runs rather than smaller purchase runs. On any view, it is clear that Schadel contacted Sarantis as a consequence of Selim’s recommendation in about 1992 or 1993. Naturalcare then developed a relationship with Markethaven. Markethaven became Naturalcare’s packaging agent and the two companies signed a Packaging Agreement in 1997. Markethaven packaged product from both Pan and other manufacturers for Naturalcare. Schadel and Sarantis also made oral arrangements to split orders from Pan so that Naturalcare periodically bought a percentage of Pan product from Markethaven. 24                  On a number of occasions throughout the relevant period Selim said that he wanted Naturalcare to be Pan’s biggest mail orderoutlet. From time to time, Selim described Naturalcare as ‘Pan’s mail order arm’. Selim encouraged Naturalcare to look into selling its products into international markets and promised to help Naturalcare with the supporting documentation required to register products overseas. I am satisfied that at all times Schadel reposed considerable trust and confidence in Selim personally and from a business point of view. 25                  Naturalcare ordered its complementary medicines from Pan in the form of either ‘soft gels’ or tablets. Schadel described soft gels in the following way: ‘Soft gel describes the capsule containing the product. Soft gel products attract a premium in the market place. Benefits include being easier to swallow and thus more attractive to consumers, especially mail order customers who are predominantly elderly. It is also a superior means of delivering a therapeutic product as it is ordinarily easier to swallow and digest a soft gel tablet than it is a hard tablet.’ 26                  Pan imported soft gels from overseas until about 1994 when it started manufacturing them locally. The only company with the technology to make them in Australia up until this time was R P Scherer. From 1994 onwards, Pan’s principal competitor for the soft gel market was R P Scherer.  27                  Products were described by the parties as being either ‘generic’ or ‘non-generic’. Schadel described a generic product in the following way: ‘… say, vitamin E or evening primrose oil, which is products that everyone in the market has. Virtually – or fish oil would be a good example, virtually single ingredient product, 1000 milligram fish oil. Every sponsor has it …’ Selim’s description was as follows: ‘A generic product is a soft gel or tablet product that has been in the market for some time and was sold by Pan to a number of sponsors. … A non-generic product is a soft gel or tablet product typically developed by Pan for [Naturalcare] or developed by [Naturalcare] in consultation with Pan. A non-generic product developed by Pan for [Naturalcare] was typically sold to [Naturalcare] exclusively for a period before release to any of Pan’s sponsors.’ Naturalcare’s tablet product range was principally composed of generic products.  28                  By March 1994, Naturalcare found itself with a large quantity of unsold stock and owing Pan a debt of around $420 000. Naturalcare could not go on without an injection of equity. During the year, Schadel therefore negotiated the sale of 65 per cent of Naturalcare’s issued shares to Cellarmasters Wines Pty Limited with an option to acquire a further 10 per cent, which was exercised in 1995. Schadel retained his position as Managing Director.  29                  Mr Terry Davis, the then Executive Director of Cellarmasters, told Schadel that he would like to investigate alternative suppliers for Naturalcare’s generic products as he was concerned about the company’s reliance on Pan. As a consequence, Schadel contacted Lipa Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd to obtain tentative quotes for supply of certain generic products.  30                  Schadel, Davis and Selim had two meetings in 1995/1996 where Davis voiced his concerns to Selim. Davis said that at one of the meetings a conversation took place to the following effect: ‘Me [Davis]: “How can I be certain you can supply all our product at the right quality and competitive prices as you want all our business? Given your current and past issues with the Therapeutic Goods people where do you stand with a clean bill of health and who could we turn to if you were not able to supply?” Mr Schadel: “Jim, you have to give Terry confidence that all the commitments you have made to me that you can deliver on them, particularly in respect of new products, pricing and continuous supply.” Mr Selim: “You have nothing to worry about. [Naturalcare] can continue to buy all of its products from Pan without a worry. Pan is the largest manufacturer of health care products in Australia. Pan complies with all of the TGA’s requirements so there is no risk in Pan not being able to supply [Naturalcare]. There is no problem in Pan continuing to supply [Naturalcare].” ’ Schadel said that the conversations included words to the following effect: ‘Mr Davis: “Jim, I am extremely concerned that [Naturalcare’s] business is totally reliant on Pan for the majority of its best-selling products. I have asked Barry to continue to try to source products from other manufacturers.” Me [Schadel]: “Jim, I have told Terry many times about our long term relationship and the fact that I believe Pan is still the major manufacturer in Australia but we are both concerned that [Naturalcare] has become totally reliant on Pan.” Mr Selim: “You have nothing to worry about. [Naturalcare] can continue to buy all of its products from Pan without a worry. Pan is the largest manufacturer of health care products in Australia. Pan complies with all of the TGA’s requirements so there is no risk in Pan not being able to supply [Naturalcare]. There is no problem in Pan continuing to supply [Naturalcare].” Mr Davis: “For example, what would happen if government intervention closed your plant?” Mr Selim: (laughing) “That would never happen. Pan is Australia’s number one manufacturer and is TGA compliant.” ’ Selim said that the conversation was to the following effect: ‘Mr Davis: “[Naturalcare] is looking to diversify its suppliers of generic products, and I am encouraging Barry to source product from other suppliers.” Me [Selim]: “What about our relationship, Barry? What about our history? We have together formulated [Naturalcare’s] top sellers. Pan has helped to build your business.” Mr Schadel: “Can Pan cope with supplying all of [Naturalcare’s] products? Does Pan have the production capacity?” Me [Selim]: “Yes, Pan has the production capacity to manufacture all of [Naturalcare’s] products. [Naturalcare] should get 100% of its products from Pan and we should continue to work together to develop new products. Other sponsors which are much larger than [Naturalcare], such as Bullivants, get all of their products from Pan with no problem.” Mr Schadel: “Pan needs to be competitive on price.” Me [Selim]: “Yes, Pan will stay competitive on price, but it is not a charity.” ’ 31                  Selim denied that the TGA was mentioned in the conversation, or that he said the phrase ‘nothing to worry about’ and asserted that the focus of the discussion was the capacity of Pan to supply a number of big customers as well as Naturalcare at the same time. I accept the evidence of Davis. He was not cross examined. He is now independent of the parties and had no reason to give false evidence. His evidence is broadly consistent with and corroborates that of Schadel. I find that Schadel and Davis relied upon and continued to rely upon the assurances given by Selim.  32                  At one of the meetings with Davis and Selim, Davis suggested the possibility of Pan paying Naturalcare a 2.5 per cent advertising rebate on all Naturalcare’s purchases from Pan so that Naturalcare did not bear all the risk on new products. Selim agreed to grant Naturalcare an advertising rebate of 2.5 per cent of annual sales and $1000 for every new product introduced. Schadel remembers Selim saying words to the following effect: ‘Barry, this rebate must remain confidential between us as it is something that I don’t do for any other company. I’m only doing it for [Naturalcare] to help us grow the business together.’ A fax from Schadel to Selim dated 31 May 1996 states the following: ‘With regards to our loyalty rebates for 1996/97, I would like to confirm that our existing loyalty arrangement will continue to operate over the next year as our purchase’s may exceed the $2 million dollar mark.’ The advertising rebate arrangement continued until about 2001. 33                  Schadel stated that after the meetings with Davis and Selim, Naturalcare nonetheless began placing more of its orders for generic products with Lipa when Lipa could offer a better price than Pan. On 10 December 1997, Naturalcare and Lipa signed a Manufacturing Agreement. Schadel also made enquiries during the course of 1995 about the possibility of purchasing soft gel products from R P Scherer but was informed that Naturalcare would be required to appoint R P Scherer as Naturalcare’s main supplier of other products if the two companies were to do business. Naturalcare continued to purchase the bulk of its products from Pan. 34                  As noted above, Pan sent Naturalcare a price list to act as a guide for the following year (although prices did fluctuate to some degree because of changes in the price of raw materials). The list would set out the names, product codes and prices for all the products Pan was supplying to Naturalcare at that time. Schadel claimed that to the best of his recollection the price lists were provided in response to his request for greater price certainty because Naturalcare promised its customers a fixed yearly price. Selim recalled the request but claimed that price lists were provided to all sponsors. There is no reason to doubt Selim on that point.  35                  Selim denied that he ever had a conversation with Schadel in which Naturalcare promised to pay the price stipulated in the annual price list, or if not stipulated, a reasonable price, as Schadel was told the prices on the list were subject to change. Schadel agreed in cross-examination that the negotiation of prices was an ongoing affair. He said: ‘… Mr Selim likewise reserved the right to increase his prices at any point in time or decrease his prices ... The arrangement was flexible.’   36                  Selim also denied that Naturalcare was under any obligation to buy the products on the list as some of the products were not ordered for some time and were effectively ‘inactive’. Schadel admitted in cross examination that Naturalcare had bought products from manufacturers apart from Pan. Naturalcare therefore did not confine its purchasing to products on Pan’s price lists.  37                  Selim also denied that Schadel ever promised to attempt to ensure that Naturalcare purchased goods from Pan of an average annual value not less than the preceding annual value of goods purchased from Pan. Schadel admitted under cross examination that he could not recall a conversation in which such a promise was made. However, if Naturalcare placed an order for product that Pan had quoted Naturalcare for in the past, Pan would supply the product if it had the relevant raw materials and the order was for the required minimum batch run. 38                  On 10 February 1995, Pan and Naturalcare signed another Manufacturing Agreement. It included the following clauses: ‘1. Objective: This document specifies the Code of Good Manufacturing Practice responsibilities relating to the manufacture of the products listed in Annexure 1 of this Contract for Australian Natural Care Products (herein referred to as “Natural Care”) by Pan Laboratories (Australia) Pty. Ltd. (herein referred to as “Pan”). These responsibilities refer to the numbered clauses in the Code of Good Manufacturing Practice for Therapeutic Goods, August 1990. 2. Operation: Products manufactured and packed in final containers by Pan. 3. Confidentiality: Formulation supplied for purposes of this Agreement are considered confidential and are not to be supplied by any third party other than with Pan’s written consent. 4. Term: This Agreement shall continue in operation for three (3) years, and will be deemed automatically renewed for a further three (3) years at the end of each three (3) year period. Either party shall determine otherwise by giving six (6) months notice in writing to the other party of their intent to terminate the Agreement. 5. Scope: This Agreement does not cover any other commercial arrangements.’ A significant purpose of the Manufacturing Agreement was to allocate the statutory responsibility under the Code. It included a table which set out relevant clauses of the Code, the responsibilities those clauses are concerned with, and which of the two companies was to undertake each responsibility. This table was followed by Annexure 1 described in a sub heading as ‘(List of Products)’. This document appeared in identical form in subsequent Manufacturing Agreements but was referred to as ‘Appendix 1 and will be referred to as such hereafter. There are 15 products in Appendix 1 of the 1995 Manufacturing Agreement. There was no provision in the Manufacturing Agreement in relation to commercial arrangements for the supply of goods. There was no obligation to order or supply any particular goods on any particular terms.  39                  A further agreement was made in August 1998. That Manufacturing Agreement was in similar form to the 1995 Manufacturing Agreement with a few minor amendments. There were 67 products in Appendix 1 of the 1998 Manufacturing Agreement. 40                  Schadel described the Appendix 1 product lists as ‘fluid’ in that they showed products Naturalcare had received quotes for but never introduced into its range, products that were introduced but which failed, and products that Naturalcare continued to order. The list also excluded products that had been introduced shortly before the Manufacturing Agreements were signed. Schadel said that he did not feel under an obligation to purchase the products on the various Appendix 1 documents from Pan if Pan’s prices were not competitive. However he did believe that Pan was under an obligation to supply Naturalcare with a product, even if Naturalcare had only ordered it once.  41                  Naturalcare and Pan also signed a Confidentiality Agreement in February 1995 and in August 1998 in similar form.  42                  In mid 1998, Cellarmasters sold its shares in Naturalcare to Amrion Inc, a manufacturer of therapeutic goods based in the Unites States of America. Amrion came to own 90 per cent of Naturalcare’s issued shares although Schadel retained his position as Managing Director. Mr David Robinson, a director of Amrion, became a director of Naturalcare in about July 1998 and retained this position until about November 2000. He gave evidence that he travelled to Australia on two occasions to have meetings with Schadel to evaluate Amrion’s ownership of Naturalcare and analyse the company’s business opportunities and weaknesses. At one of these meetings Robinson claims he had a conversation with Schadel with words to the following effect: ‘Me [Robinson]: “[Naturalcare] appears to be very dependent on Pan Laboratories for the supply of the majority of your products. I am concerned about what happens to [Naturalcare] if that supply is cut off or interrupted?” Mr Schadel: “Pan Labs is the largest manufacturer of nutritional supplements in Australia. Almost every company in our industry is buying from Pan. They have a great reputation for quality. I don’t think there is any chance they would not be able to supply [Naturalcare].” ’ 43                  Robinson, Schadel and Selim had a meeting as to the substance of which all three men gave evidence. Robinson said the relevant conversation was to the following effect: ‘Me [Robinson]: “[Naturalcare] buys a significant amount of product from Pan Labs. If you were not able to supply [Naturalcare], even temporarily, it would have a seriously negative affect on our business.” Mr Selim: “You do not need to worry about that. Pan is the largest supplier of nutritional supplements in Australia. There is no possibility that Pan won’t be able to supply [Naturalcare] with the products they order. Further, as Pan is the largest supplier in Australia, we work closely with the TGA and we meet, or exceed, all necessary standards the TGA sets for the manufacture of nutritional supplements.” ’ Schadel said Robinson said words to the following effect: ‘[Naturalcare] is overly reliant on Pan. I think that we will be seeking to diversify its suppliers.’ Schadel said Selim’s reply was to the following effect: ‘There is no risk of Pan ceasing supply. Pan has helped build [Naturalcare]. Our relationship extends beyond simply supplying goods – it extends into other areas including constant product development. We have built the business together and we should stay together.’ Selim said the conversation included words to the following effect: ‘Mr Robinson: “I’m telling Barry he should source products from other suppliers.” Me [Selim]: “There is no problem in Pan continuing to supply [Naturalcare]. Pan has the capacity to meet all of [Naturalcare’s] production needs. Pan has not let you down. For products you have ordered, Pan has supplied.” Mr Robinson: “Yes, Pan has looked after [Naturalcare].” ’ 44                  I accept the evidence of Robinson. He was not cross-examined and there is no reason to doubt his reliability. His evidence is broadly consistent with and corroborates that of Schadel. I find that Robinson and Schadel relied and continued to rely upon Selim’s assurances. 45                  Amrion had a plan to distribute its products, manufactured in a factory in Colorado, USA, to the Australian market by using Naturalcare’s client list. However, the TGA did not grant Amrion the appropriate accreditation and in May 2001, Amrion sold its shares in Naturalcare back to Schadel and his wife, who became the sole shareholders of the company again. 46                  In around 1999 or 2000, Pan had developed a new formulation for glucosamine sulphate to relieve arthritic pain. The formulation was approved by the TGA and Naturalcare sold it under the name ‘Healthy Joints’. In about September 2001, Selim and Schadel had a meeting in which Schadel told Selim that he was planning to have Healthy Joints manufactured by Lipa because Lipa could supply it for a lower price. Schadel and Selim remembered this conversation differently. Schadel recalled Selim getting out of his chair, pacing to the other side of the desk and raising his voice ‘to almost screaming pitch’ when he said words to the following effect: ‘Healthy Joints is my formulation. You have no right to give it to another manufacturer. If you do, I will sue you! If you decide to fight me it will cost you a lot of money and I will win.’ Schadel claimed he was ‘extremely shocked and fearful’ because of Selim’s reaction and replied with words to the following effect: ‘Jim, I am not giving them your formulation. Lipa is reformulating to their own specifications from our label claim. You know it’s a major price issue for us. The product is so much more expensive from you. And you’ve always told me that you would meet their prices.’ Schadel gave evidence that Selim went on to say: ‘Enjoy the prices from Lipa now because as he grows he will have to deal with the same overheads I have had to deal with and he won’t be able to compete with me once he gets as big as Pan.’ Schadel also claimed Selim said words to the following effect: ‘I insist that all new products which Pan has offered to [Naturalcare] in the past stay with Pan in the future.’ Schadel claimed that while he was ‘very mindful’ of Selim’s threat to sue, he continued to seek quotes from other manufacturers for products apart from soft gels as he believed Pan was overcharging Naturalcare for the majority of their products compared to Lipa. Selim denied that he threatened to sue Naturalcare and claimed that he responded to Schadel’s announcement by saying it was ‘disappointing’.  47                  Despite this incident, Naturalcare and Pan continued to work together. In March 2002, Pan and Naturalcare entered into another Manufacturing Agreement and another Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement was in the same terms as before. The March 2002 Manufacturing Agreement was in the same form as the 1998 Manufacturing Agreement. There were 103 products in Appendix 1 of the 2002 Manufacturing Agreement. 48                  Schadel gave evidence that in relation to the period of January 2000 to April 2003, he understood that Pan was to supply ‘close to all’ of Naturalcare’s soft gel product requirements and the ‘majority of all other goods sold’. When Counsel for Pan put it to Schadel that in reality Pan only supplied 52.5 per cent by volume and 42.8 per cent by value of Naturalcare’s soft gel product in this period and only 44.5 per cent by value of Naturalcare’s other products, Schadel said ‘I don’t know whether those figures are correct.’. The figures appear in a statement by one of Pan’s liquidators, Mr Christopher John Honey, who caused a purchasing analysis to be conducted by Gary Busby, Bian Guan Lim and persons under their direction and under his supervision. Mr Bradley James Stuart, the financial controller of Naturalcare gave evidence based on a review of Naturalcare’s MYOB database that for the financial years ending 30 June 2002 and 30 June 2003, Pan supplied Naturalcare with approximately 66 per cent of Naturalcare’s total stock purchases; and with 98 per cent of its total soft gel purchases. A difference in the figures could be the result of Stuart including product that was indirectly sourced from Pan, for example if Markethaven bought product from Pan and packaged it for Naturalcare under their Packaging Agreement. Schadel certainly reserved the freedom to acquire products from other manufacturers if the price was more favourable than Pan’s price. 49                  The business relationship between Schadel and Selim continued to function. In late 2002, Selim offered to introduce Schadel to a Mr Derek Coates as a possible buyer of Naturalcare when Schadel expressed a desire to sell the company. In February 2003, Selim told Schadel that he thought there was an opening in the market for a pharmacy only brand which Naturalcare could fill by selling its existing range under another label. In the same month, Selim told Schadel that he should relaunch his business in the French market and that Pan would give him extended credit terms and free product to help him with the venture. Selim expected that the relationship whereby Pan supplied Naturalcare with a large portion of its therapeutic goods would continue indefinitely into the future. Travacalm incident and thereafter 50                  In early 2003 there were reports of adverse reactions after individuals took Travacalm, one of Pan’s products. As a result, the TGA conducted a special GMP audit of Pan between 30–31 January 2003. The TGA’s report, dated 5 February 2003, listed the objectives of the audit as follows: ‘(i) To investigate possible-probable causes of the recent recall(s) of “Travacalm Original” (Aust R 78192) and “Travacalm HO” (Aust R 68450). These batches were recalled because of a series of adverse reactions and (confirmed) and unacceptable variation in the concentration of the Hyoscine Hydrobromide within individual tablets;and (ii) To assess compliance with the Manufacturing Principles, the above referenced Manufacturing Standard, the conditions specified in the company’s Licence to Manufacture Therapeutic Goods, and compliance with the relevant marketing authorisation(s).’ The report went on to note: ‘The audit revealed a number of significant deficiencies, including three items classified as critical. As indicated during the inspection, these deficiencies were to be referred to the Chief GMP Auditor and a Section Review Panel for further consideration, including the possibility of amendment, suspension or revocation of the company’s licence.’ The report noted a number of ‘possible-probable’ causes of the recall(s) of ‘Travacalm Original’ (Aust R 78192) and ‘Travacalm HO’ (Aust R 68450). The report then added the following by way of conclusion: ‘… the audit revealed compelling evidence: (i) That the organisation was actually aware, following the analysis of the first batch of Travacalm, that the product failed to meet the requirement for “Uniformity of Content”. Nonetheless, subsequent batches: ·        were also manufactured under the same conditions,  ·        shown to fail specification, and ·        “released” to Key Pharmaceuticals. (ii) Of deliberate and systematic manipulation of laboratory analysis results, so to (re)present OOS (Out Of Specification) batches as complying with specification.’ 51                  The report stated that a response to the report should by received by the Chief GMP Auditor within four weeks of the date of the audit report, adding: ‘This response should include, as applicable, 1. Details of the action(s) taken to correct each reported deficiency, and (for critical and major deficiencies) supporting objective evidence of completion; 2. The identification of any/the root cause(s) of the deficiency(ies) (at the quality management/system level) and the details of related action(s) (also) taken so as to prevent recurrence of the deficiency(ies), (again) with supporting objective evidence; and/or, 3. When, within reason, an extended time frame is warranted, then a description of the proposed corrective action(s) (including a timetable with target completion dates(s)), progress reports, and upon conclusion, objective evidence of its completion.’ The report then went on to list a substantial number of both ‘Critical Deficiencies’ as well as ‘Major Deficiencies’ in Pan’s process control. 52                  The TGA carried out a general GMP audit of Pan’s operations, for the purpose of assessing compliance on 24–25 February 2003 and 7–11 and 14 April 2003. The TGA’s report from that audit stated that: ‘The audit revealed: (i) That the issues identified during the (30-31 January ’03) audit investigating the recall of Travacalm, were not restricted to that product; (ii) That “corrective actions” to previous TGA audits were unsatisfactory; (iii) (Further) Non-Conformities: With respect to: ·        The Manufacturing Principles; and ·        The conditions of the company’s licence to manufacture Therapeutic Goods; and (iv) Nine aspects regarded as critical’ The report then went on to discuss the nine aspects regarded as critical under the following headings: ·                    data manipulation;  ·                    results fabrication;  ·                    substitution of both chondroitin sulphate from shark with chondroitin sulphate from bovine and of chondroitin sulphate from bovine with chondroitin sulphate from shark;  ·                    deficient raw material and finished product-control(s);  ·                    breach of the ‘conditions of licences’ (to manufacture therapeutic goods);  ·                    breach of the (schedule of) conditions to the licence to manufacture therapeutic goods;  ·                    breaches of marketing authorisation(s);  ·                    unsatisfactory process control(s); and,  ·                    inadequate assurance regarding mix-up +/- (cross) contamination. The report again listed a substantial number of critical deficiencies and major deficiencies with Pan’s processing system.  53                  An Expert Advisory Group Meeting was convened on 23 April 2003. Among the Group’s findings were the following statements: ‘The multiple failures of GMP identified in the auditors’ report, in the opinion of the Expert Advisory Group, create risks of death, serious illness, and serious injury. … The Group lacks confidence in the quality of any products manufactured by the company. The Group advised that poor quality products have an increased risk of failure in both safety and efficacy.  The Group recommended that the company should be subject to significant remediation. The Group recommended that the company’s manufacturing licence should be suspended immediately for the protection of the community’s public health and safety.’ 54                  On 28 April 2003, the TGA sent a letter to Selim as well as Notices under ss 30, 40 and 41 of the TGA Act, informing him of the suspension of Pan’s licence, the cancellation of all Pan’s products on the Register and the requirement for all such products to be recalled. Schadel gave the following evidence in relation to the immediate effect of the Pan recall: ‘We had a phone call at 4.00 pm from the TGA telling us that we had to recall all of our products. We were notified by the TGA after it was in the media. In that first week we had 26,000 phone calls and 162,000 hits on our website. We had customers constantly jamming up our telephone. I rang our industry representatives and couldn’t get them because they were on national television. … I was in total shock. I spoke to my financial adviser and he told me to start firing people instantly.’ 55                  Naturalcare was faced with the necessity to find alternative sources of supply for most of its products at a time when many other businesses were faced with the same problem. The party which acquired the assets of Pan did not commence to operate that business until well into 2004.  56                  On 22 May 2003, Anthony Gregory McGrath and Christopher John Honey were appointed as administrators of Pan and as liquidators on 23 September 2003.  Proof of debt 57                  Naturalcare submitted a proof of debt to Pan for $15 674 619 dated 13 February 2004, which was the subject of adjustment between the parties over the following two years. On 29 May 2006, the solicitors for the liquidators forwarded the following table as a summary of the liquidators’ final adjudication of Naturalcare’s claim:        ‘Product Claim$  Cost Claim $  ProfitClaim$  Total Claim$   Proof of debt (as varied by [Naturalcare])  1,404,609.00  382,122.00  8,905,271.00  10,692,002.00   Adjustments to Claim  103,965.49  -  -  103,965.49   Less: Rejected amounts  (228,320.12)  (366,437.00)  (8,203,394.21)  (8,798,151.33)   Gross Admitted Claim  1,280,254.37  15,685.00  701,876.79  1,997,816.16   Less: debtor set off as per Pan ledger  (532,691.03)  -  -  (532,691.03)   Net Admitted Claim  $747,563.34  $15,685.00  $701,876.79  $1,465,125.13   Rejected amounts subject to Federal Court appeal  -  $208,724.00  $2,002,155.00  $2,210,879.00’ Liability Contract 58                  The terms of the alleged Supply Contract, teased out of the Third Further Amended Statement of Claim, are as follows: ·                    Pan promised to manufacture and supply to Naturalcare the goods customarily bought by Naturalcare from Pan at the quantities customarily acquired by Naturalcare. ·                    The contract was for a period of three years from 1 March 2002 with an automatic renewal for a further three year period. ·                    Either party could terminate the contract by six months’ notice in writing to the other. ·                    Naturalcare promised: (a) to buy all of its ‘soft gel’ goods from Pan; and (b) to buy from Pan the majority of all other goods sold by Naturalcare. ·                    Naturalcare promised it would use its best endeavours to ensure that it purchased goods from Pan of an average annual value not less than the preceding annual value of goods purchased. ·                    Naturalcare promised to pay the price stipulated in the applicable Pan annual price list or, if not stipulated, a reasonable price. ·                    Naturalcare promised to keep formulations for the goods acquired confidential and not to disclose them to any other person without Pan’s written consent. ·                    Pan promised to manufacture and supply the goods to a particular standard, namely, to the standard set out in the Code. These terms were said to be a combination of the express terms of the 2002 Manufacturing Agreement, supplemented by the dealings between the parties from 1989 onwards, including discussions between Schadel and Selim and the knowledge Pan acquired throughout this period of Naturalcare’s commercial dependence on the manufacturer. 59                  The question is whether the conduct of the parties manifested a mutual assent to a long term contract as alleged. Naturalcare relied upon Brambles Holdings Ltd v Bathurst City Council (2001) 53 NSWLR 153 at [81], Integrated Computer Services Pty Ltd v Digital Equipment Corp (Aust) Pty Ltd (1988) 5 BPR 11,110 at 11,117–11,118 and Vroon BV v Foster’s Brewing Group Ltd [1994] 2 VR 32 at 82–83. It was submitted that the indicia of such mutual assent included: ·                    the 14 year supply relationship between Naturalcare and Pan; ·                    the high level of trust and confidence which Schadel placed in Selim; ·                    the representations made by Pan to Naturalcare; ·                    the successive Manufacturing Agreements between Pan and Naturalcare; ·                    the fact that Naturalcare organised its business such that it was reliant on Pan’s continuing supply with Pan’s knowledge, acquiescence and encouragement; ·                    the collaboration between Pan and Naturalcare in the development of new products; ·                    Pan’s support of Naturalcare by allowing it favourable credit terms during 1989 through to 1994; ·                    the fact that Pan organised special production runs for Naturalcare; ·                    Selim’s acquiescence in the description of Naturalcare as Pan’s ‘mail order arm’; ·                    Selim’s encouragement for Naturalcare to expand into international markets. 60                  It was submitted by Naturalcare that the goods customarily bought by Naturalcare from Pan were those set out in Appendix 1 to the Manufacturing Agreement, as added to or subtracted from time to time as new products were developed. It was submitted that the quantities customarily acquired by Naturalcare from Pan were fluid but the overall quantity per annum from 2000 onwards totalled approximately $2 million. 61                  I accept that commercial arrangements should not be pedantically analysed with a view to finding a self-contained offer and a self-contained acceptance before a contract can be found. However, in my opinion, the arrangements here were too fluid, if not amorphous, to amount to a long term supply agreement. Most of the points suggested to be in favour of the existence of the Supply Contract are indicative of a close working commercial relationship rather than contract. 62                  There are significant discrepancies between the pleaded terms and the evidence given on behalf of Naturalcare. The evidence was that the applicant would purchase ‘close to 100 per cent’ of the soft gel products from Pan rather than all of those products and would purchase ‘the majority of all goods’ not ‘all other goods’. The evidence of Schadel was consistent with a proviso that it was open to Naturalcare to acquire product from alternative suppliers who were offering a better price, but this is not reflected in the alleged contract. There is a question on Schadel’s evidence as to whether the arrangement was that Naturalcare would purchase the lion’s share of the overall business or (if there is a distinction) the bulk of the overall business. Schadel’s evidence did not support the alleged term concerning the promise to use best endeavours to ensure that Naturalcare purchased goods from Pan of an average annual value not less than the preceding annual value of goods purchased. There is also merit in the submission for Pan that the purchase of 90 per cent of Naturalcare by Amrion, was inconsistent with the gist of the alleged arrangements. Whether or not Amrion products were meant to replace Pan products, it was intended that Naturalcare would be used as the Australian distributor for Amrion.  63                  Another significant difficulty with the contract case is the existence of the successive written Manufacturing Agreements. There is no strict inconsistency between the Manufacturing Agreements and the alleged Supply Contract. It is to be noted, however, that one of the terms of the Manufacturing Agreements provided ‘this agreement does not cover any other commercial arrangements’. The formality associated with the Manufacturing Agreements may be accounted for by the requirements of the Code. However, it is improbable that the parties would document one form of binding agreement without documenting another more commercially significant agreement. The alleged Supply Contract would necessarily overlap with the current Manufacturing Agreement, it incorporates terms from the Manufacturing Agreement and would have involved very significant obligations on both sides. There were also the successive Confidentiality Agreements. It is inherently improbable that there was no note or memorandum of, or written reference to, any such agreement, if it existed and was regarded as binding by both parties.  64                  That improbability is underlined when the terms of the alleged agreement are more closely examined in the light of the facts. It will be recalled that the goods the subject of the Agreement were identified as those ‘customarily acquired by Australian Naturalcare from Pan’ and the quantities were ‘those quantities Australian Naturalcare customarily obtained from Pan’. There are insuperable difficulties in the path of establishing the identity of the goods covered by the alleged Supply Contract. It will be recalled that it was also alleged in the pleading that the goods listed in Appendix 1 of the Manufacturing Agreement were substantially all of the goods that Naturalcare customarily acquired from Pan as at 1 March 2002. In evidence, Schadel referred to Appendix 1 as identifying the goods subject to the supply agreement. However, he also contended that the document was ‘fluid’ and that Pan had an obligation to supply any product that the applicant had ordered, even if only once, or that Pan had ever manufactured for Naturalcare in the 14 year relationship.  65                  Honey’s analysis of Naturalcare’s purchases from Pan in two 12 month periods—1 March 2001 to 28 February 2002, and 1 March 2002 to 28 February 2003—illustrates the difficulty. Counsel for Pan summarised the results as follows: ‘In relation to the 2001–2002 period: (a) 54 different products were acquired; (b) 35 of the acquired products were listed in the schedule; (c) 19 of the acquired products were not listed in the schedule; (d) 67 of the products listed in the schedule were not acquired. In relation to the 2002–2003 period: (a)               56 different products were acquired; (b)               34 of the acquired products were listed in the schedule; (c)               22 of the acquired products were not listed in the schedule; (d)               68 of the products listed in the schedule were not acquired. Comparing the 2001–2002 and 2002–2003 purchasing periods: (a)               43 of the acquired products were common to both purchasing periods; (b)               13 of the 2002–2003 acquired products had not been acquired in the 2001–2002 period; (c)               Naturalcare did not acquire 11 products in 2002–2003 that it had acquired in the 2001–2002 period.’ 66                  Further, I am not satisfied that there was any pattern about the ordering practice which could form the basis for a finding that there were customary quantities purchased. Honey’s analysis established that only eight of the 43 common products which were purchased in both 2001–2002 and 2002–2003 were purchased in both years within a variation in amount of 10 per cent. The remaining 35 products purchased in both years varied in volume from ‑316 per cent to +82 per cent. The lack of any pattern is borne out by the records of Pan in relation to the purchasing history of Naturalcare. 67                  Schadel accepted that Naturalcare was free to shop around for a cheaper price. That was inevitable as the evidence showed that Naturalcare was obtaining supply from Lipa from the early days and was regularly transferring suppliers because of price. The contract case fails. Estoppel 68                  Naturalcare relies upon promissory estoppel as a ‘sword’, that is, as a source of substantive rights enforceable as a cause of action in its own right. Counsel referred to Waltons Stores (Interstate) Limited v Maher (1988) 164 CLR 387 at 416 per Brennan J; Commonwealth v Verwayen (1990) 170 CLR 394 at 430 per Brennan J; News Corporation Ltd v Lenfest Communications Inc (1996) 21 ACSR 553 at 569; and Gray (As Administrator of the Estate of Gray) v National Crime Authority [2003] NSWSC 111 at [153]–[159] (cf Australian Crime Commission v Gray (As Administrator of the Estate of Gray) [2003] NSWCA 318 per Mason P at [40], agreed to by Tobias JA at [313]). Counsel for Pan submits that this claim is misconceived and that equitable estoppel can not be used as a sword otherwise than in equity. Counsel submits that Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher does not establish that equitable estoppel is a cause of action in itself capable of sounding in damages (legal or equitable) although it may assist in establishing a recognised cause of action such as breach of contract (as in that case). There is much to be said for that submission. However, the question is controversial (KR Handley, Estoppel by Conduct and Election, Sweet & Maxwell, London, 2006, Ch 13). As I have a clear view that the integers of promissory estoppel are not established, I need not deal further with this fundamental question. It should be noted that the claim for estoppel by convention is not pursued.  69                  The estoppel case pleads the assumption that Pan was, and would continue to be, the exclusive supplier of soft gel goods and the supplier of the whole or the majority of the other therapeutic goods sold by Naturalcare for at least the term of the Manufacturing Agreement, including any renewed term. The case pleads an expectation by Naturalcare that Pan would continue to be its exclusive supplier of soft gel goods and the supplier of the whole or the majority of the other therapeutic goods sold by Naturalcare and that Pan would not be free to, or would not, withdraw from that expected relationship for at least the term of the Manufacturing Agreement, including any renewed term. 70                  That assumption and that expectation are said to have arisen from the same course of conduct as was alleged to have given rise to the Supply Contract, together with some allegations of a general kind as to the relationship between the parties, also relied upon to establish a duty of care. Counsel for Naturalcare referred, in particular, to parts of a conversation between Schadel, Davis and Selim, which took place in 1995.  71                  The first problem for Naturalcare is that promissory estoppel must be based upon conduct that is clear and unequivocal—Legione v Hateley (1983) 152 CLR 406 at 435–437; Foran v Wight (1989) 168 CLR 385 at 410–411. Conduct not precise enough to form a contract would rarely be the basis for a promissory estoppel. It is sufficient to refer to the discrepancies in the contract case to illustrate the lack of a basis for promissory estoppel 72                  The next problem is in identifying an appropriate subject matter for the assumption or expectation. Counsel for Naturalcare referred to the passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher where his Honour said, amongst other things (at 428): ‘… the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and, in the latter case, that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship;’ Mason CJ and Wilson J referred to ‘basic assumptions underlying the transaction between the parties’ (at 406). They went on to point out that the failure to fulfil a promise does not, of itself, amount to unconscionable conduct and mere reliance upon an executory promise to do something does not bring promissory estoppel into play (also at 406). It is submitted by counsel for Naturalcare that the legal relationship in question was as supplier of Naturalcare’s soft gel business and of the majority of Naturalcare’s tablet business. In my opinion, that does not amount to a relevant assumption or expectation. It only illustrates a continuing commercial relationship. 73                  The next problem is that Naturalcare has to establish that the estoppel in the terms alleged was operative in 2003. I have no difficulty in rejecting that contention. Such an assumption would be inconsistent with the course of dealings between the parties up to that time. Naturalcare had acquired soft gel products from non Pan sources and the majority of tablets from non Pan sources. Counsel for Naturalcare was only able to argue that Naturalcare gave Pan almost all of its soft gel business between January 2000 and April 2003, being 89 per cent by value and 48.2 per cent of its tablet products by value and Naturalcare acquired 58.25 per cent of its tablet products (by value) from Pan in the period January 2000 to April 2003, rather than 48.2 per cent but only if Healthy Joints figures are excluded. 74                  Next, it is not at all clear how it is alleged that the assumption and expectation were unconscientiously departed from. The failure to supply products was not the kind of deliberate unconscientious departure from a state of affairs which might found a promissory estoppel. It was the result of action by the TGA pursuant to statute.  75                  Other criticisms of the estoppel case were made by counsel for Pan. It is not necessary to deal with them. That case fails. Tort 76                  The argument for Naturalcare in tort commenced with the contention that, at least between 1995 and 2002, Pan made a number of representations to Naturalcare to the effect that Pan was ready, willing and able to continue to supply Naturalcare with therapeutic goods; that any risk to Naturalcare arising out of Naturalcare’s reliance or dependence upon Pan for the supply of product was negligible or immaterial and that Pan was, and would continue to be, compliant with the requirements of the TGA. For the purposes of argument, that can be taken as a fair summary of the statements by Selim from time to time and from the dealings between the parties over many years. The following propositions were advanced: (1)               The representations were made in circumstances in which Pan knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that the representations would be relied upon (referring to L Shaddock & Associates Proprietary Limited v Council of the City of Parramatta (1981) 150 CLR 225; Mid Density Developments Pty Limited v Rockdale Municipal Council (1993) 44 FCR 290; Eade v Vogiazopoulos [1999] 3 VR 889 at [115] per Smith J; Perre v Apand Pty Limited (1999) 198 CLR 180 per McHugh J at [124]).  (2)               Naturalcare was vulnerable to Pan in the sense that it was unable to protect its own interests. Pan was in control of its own manufacturing processes and, to the extent that Naturalcare might have taken steps to protect its own interests, it was induced not to do so by Pan’s express representations and conduct (referring to Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd (2003) 216 CLR 515 at [23]; Perre v Apand Pty Limited at [10]–[13] per Gleeson CJ; at [42] per Gaudron J; at [118]–[119] per McHugh J; at [216] per Gummow J; at [298] per Kirby J; at [416] per Callinan J; Fortuna Seafoods Pty Ltd (as trustee for the Rowley Family Trust) v Ship ‘Eternal Wind’ [2005] QCA 405).  (3)               Pan had actual foresight of the likelihood that Naturalcare could suffer harm in the event that it manufactured and supplied product otherwise than conformably with requirements of the TGA and the Code. Pan was supplying goods for sale to, and ingestion by, humans. Pan knew that Naturalcare was taking the lion’s share of its products from Pan and would be damaged if that supply ceased (Perre v Apand Pty Limited at [13] per Gleeson CJ; at [50]; and [133] per McHugh J).  (4)               The statutory scheme meant that Pan assumed, for its own advantage, particular responsibilities which would give comfort to sponsors in the circumstances of Naturalcare (Moorabool Shire Council v Taitapanui [2006] VSCA 30 at [3], [82], [159]).  (5)               The case falls within at least one of the standard categories in which the common law has previously recognised that a duty of care may arise, namely, the negligent supply of goods (Perre v Apand Pty Limited at [96] per McHugh J).  (6)               The policy consideration relating to indeterminacy of liability does not arise in the present case. Naturalcare was a first line victim.  (7)               Imposing a duty of care of the kind alleged would not impose an unreasonable burden on Pan (Perre v Apand Pty Limited at [133] per McHugh J). Taking these factors into account, it was submitted that Pan had a duty of care at least to take reasonable care to ensure that the goods it manufactured for supply conformed with the requirements of the TGA and the Code.  77                  It was then submitted that Pan has admitted that, at least between May 2002 and April 2003, it failed to manufacture goods conformably with the requirements of the TGA and the Code. It was indicated that the evidence contained in the reports by the TGA established that Pan must have known that it was in breach of those requirements and was at risk of losing its licence at any time.  78                  It was also submitted that if Pan had complied with its duty of care: (a)                it would not have lost its licence to manufacture therapeutic goods;  (b)               it would have continued to be in a position to supply product to Naturalcare; and (c)                the product it supplied to Naturalcare would have been compliant with the Code and would have been sold by Naturalcare for a profit in the ordinary course of events. Accordingly Naturalcare would not have suffered the loss it seeks to recover in the proceedings by virtue of the interruption to supply. Its losses were of a class that was a reasonable foreseeable consequence of Pan’s negligence (Gates v City Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited (1986) 160 CLR 1 at 13). 79                  A failure to warn was pleaded but was not pressed in written or oral submissions for Naturalcare.  80                  This is a claim for pure economic loss. That is an opaque area of the law. The case is not pleaded as negligent misstatement. The case bears no real similarity to any previous pure economic loss case. Stripped to the essentials, a duty to continue to supply goods is claimed. That is a novel basis for a tortious claim. 81                  Counsel for Pan has put forward a number of detailed reasons for its contention that the claim is misconceived. The most important is that Naturalcare was not ‘vulnerable’ in the sense required if that quality is to be a touchstone of liability as was submitted on behalf of Naturalcare. It would be necessary for Naturalcare to establish that it could not protect itself from the consequences of Pan’s want of reasonable care, either entirely or at least in a way which would cast the consequences of the loss on the other party (Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd at [23] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ; and Perre v Apand Pty Ltd per McHugh J at [120]). The risk of a supplier of goods not being able to maintain supply is an every day incident of commercial life. Many statutes regulate manufacturers and suppliers of goods. There is always a risk that if the statute is not complied with, the supply of goods may be prohibited or suspended. Various strategies to minimise risks of that kind and their impact are available to the intending purchaser. Particular contractual provisions can be framed, insurance can be sought, alternative suppliers located and so on. All available strategies were open to Naturalcare. The answer given on behalf of Naturalcare is that it was convinced by Selim’s assurances not to take such prudent steps. That is no answer. It highlights the fact that the real complaint is about the alleged representations, not about failure to take reasonable care to ensure that the requirements of the Code were met.  Misleading and deceptive conduct 82                  Naturalcare relies upon two representations. The first is that Pan would so conduct its manufacturing processes as to comply with the Code – called the Quality Assurance representation. This representation is alleged to have been made by the 2002 Manufacturing Agreement in the light of previous dealings between the parties. Contractual promises can be the foundation of misleading and deceptive conduct for the purposes of s 52 in some circumstances (HTW Valuers (Central Qld) Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd (2004) 217 CLR 640 at [13]). Whether these are such circumstances is best judged in a wider context.  83                  It is also alleged ‘further or in the alternative’ that Pan represented to Naturalcare that Pan would continue to supply all, or most of, Naturalcare’s requirements as to therapeutic goods or, alternatively, Naturalcare’s requirements as to soft gel goods and all or most of Naturalcare’s requirements as to other therapeutic goods – called the Supply representation. That alleged representation is based upon particular statements in various discussions between Schadel and Selim including that Pan was the largest manufacturer of health care products in Australia and was compliant with the requirements of the TGA and, accordingly, that the risk associated with Naturalcare’s reliance and dependence on Pan continuing to supply Naturalcare with those goods customarily purchased by it from Pan at the quantities customarily acquired was negligible or immaterial; and that Pan was ready, willing and able to continue to supply Naturalcare with all goods it customarily acquired from Pan at those quantities it customarily obtained from Pan.  84                  It is submitted on behalf of Naturalcare that each of the Quality Assurance representation and the Supply representation was with respect to a future matter: in the one case, future conduct of the manufacturing process; and the other, the future ability to supply therapeutic goods, each broadly concerned with the continuing supply of therapeutic goods. It is contended that Pan has not established reasonable grounds for making either representation, with the result that the making of each of them was misleading and deceptive, or likely to mislead and deceive. It is further contended that Naturalcare relied upon the misleading conduct by continuing to conduct business on the basis that the bulk of the products it was to sell would be acquired from Pan and did not reorganise its business. This left it vulnerable to the sudden cessation of supply which occurred upon suspension of Pan’s licence, leading to losses due to the disruption to its business. 85                  Pan disputes each link in that chain. It denies the making of the representations. Pan then submits that the evidence of Schadel was that the assurances he received from Selim were in the present tense so, even if his evidence is accepted, the representations were about the then present capacity to manufacture and supply rather than being about a future matter. On that basis Pan contends that the representations are not shown to have been misleading. Even if the assurances were in respect of a future matter, Pan submits that no continuing representation was pleaded or proved. It would follow, so it was said, that even if Pan failed to carry the onus provided by s 51A, all that would be established was a breach of s 52 at the time of the making of the representations and there was no causal relationship between those breaches and the damage alleged to have been suffered. It was submitted that, in any event, there was a reasonable basis for any representations that were made.  86                  Naturalcare places considerable emphasis upon the meetings in 1994 attended by Davis and those in 1998 and early 1999 attended by Robinson. Indeed, those are the only particular conversations which, in terms, are said to have included express representations as to compliance with TGA requirements. I have accepted the evidence of each of Davis and Robinson which in turn corroborates the substance of the evidence of Schadel about those meetings.  87                  I also accept the substance of the evidence of Schadel that he continued to have regular discussions with Selim up to the time of the licence suspension, the content of which is only explicable upon the basis of the continuance of the arrangements between them and their respective companies based, amongst other things, upon the assurances received at the meetings with Davis and Robinson. Schadel’s principal affidavit was broadly chronological in structure. After taking the narrative through to the sale of the Amrion interests in about May 2001, he dealt with the Healthy Joints dispute occurring around September 2001 and then with what was described as ‘Other Business Collaboration’ between Naturalcare and Pan involving discussions between Schadel and Selim. He then said: ‘Following the discussions with Mr Selim deposed to above, I believed that Pan would remain the sole supplier of [Naturalcare’s] soft gel goods and principal supplier of tablets for at least the balance of the 2002 Manufacturing Agreement, including any renewal of that agreement, and indeed I expected that the relationship between Pan and [Naturalcare] would continue indefinitely. I did not cause [Naturalcare] to seek a broad range of alternative manufacturers or suppliers, so that if one failed or ceased to exist [Naturalcare’s] business would not be overly affected. I did cause [Naturalcare] to obtain quotes for tablets or generic products from other suppliers. However this was largely a “check” to make sure that Pan was competitive on price. [Naturalcare] did diversify to an extent by having more tablets supplied by other manufacturers, but did not do so with its soft gels. I allowed [Naturalcare] to remain to a great extent reliant on Pan as its major supplier of tablets and virtually sole supplier of soft gel capsules, … This was because I had faith in Mr Selim’s assurances to me and Mr Davis and Mr Robinson about Pan and I felt as though I owed to Mr Selim a degree of the loyalty he expected. If Mr Selim had not made the statements deposed to above and [Naturalcare] had not relied on Pan, [Naturalcare] would have developed a different business – it would have had more generic products, rather than continuing to develop new complex slurry mix soft gels with Pan that were unable to be produced easily by other manufacturers. Pan was one of two Australian manufacturers producing soft gel capsules and it was the only one that could produce enteric coated soft gels. … … While some soft gels could have been obtained by [Naturalcare] overseas, I did not feel this was necessary due to Mr Selim’s assurances about Pan continuing to supply [Naturalcare]. In addition, [Naturalcare] wanted to deal with Australian manufacturers and it did so until it was forced to look to overseas for products following the Pan recall. Pan had other advantages from [Naturalcare’s] perspective which included the good service it provided, particularly through Mr Selim’s personal collaboration with me, good price on the complex soft gel formulas and the ability to manufacture the quantities of product sought by [Naturalcare] quickly (e.g. within 3 months compared to R P Scherer’s 6 months).’ Schadel’s evidence as to the continuing faith he had in the assurances given by Selim to Davis, Robinson and himself was not directly challenged in cross-examination. That may not be of any great moment in itself. No Browne v Dunn point is taken. The parties are clearly at issue on matters such as that. I accept the substance of this evidence of Schadel, notwithstanding some exaggeration on his part.  88                  The successive Manufacturing Agreements are also to be considered. Pan is correct in submitting that those agreements only bite contractually as and when particular goods are ordered. Further, each such agreement includes an express term that it does not cover any other commercial arrangement. On the other hand, Pan is committed by the Agreement to stand ready for a period of at least three years (subject to termination on six months’ notice) to comply with the nominated Code responsibilities in relation to all or any of the specified products. It is necessarily implicit that Pan was and would remain ready, willing and able to comply with the Code for the period of the Agreement. Compliance with the Code was fundamental to Pan’s ability to manufacture therapeutic goods. 89                  The question is whether entering into the Manufacturing Agreement in 2002 in the light of the previous dealings amounted to a representation or representations as pleaded and not whether a contractual promise was made. Reference has already been made to the judgment of Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Heydon JJ in HTW Valuers (Central Qld) Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd, dealing with the capacity of contractual promises to found representations for the purposes of s 52, which in turn refers to the judgment of Lockhart and Gummow JJ in Accounting Systems 2000 (Developments) Pty Ltd v CCH Australia Ltd (1993) 42 FCR 470 at 503–506(see also Futuretronics International Pty Ltd v Gadzhis [1992] 2 VR 217 at 233–241). A practical example of the interplay between contractual promises and misleading or deceptive conduct is seen in the decision of Finn J in Hughes Aircraft Systems International v Airservices Australia (1997) 76 FCR 151. Nonetheless, some caution needs to be exercised in too readily equating the two (Effem Foods Pty Ltd (t/as Uncle Ben’s of Australia) v Lake Cumbeline Pty Ltd (1999) 161 ALR 599 per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Kirby and Hayne JJ at [12] and Callinan J at [60]; Wright v TNT Management Pty Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 679; and McWilliam’s Wines Pty Ltd v LS Booth Wine Transport Pty Ltd (1992) 25 NSWLR 723).  90                  I am satisfied that entering into the Manufacturing Agreement in 2002 did constitute conduct within the meaning of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act (read in the light of s 4) which was capable of being and was misleading and deceptive, particularly when considered in the context of the previous course of dealings between Pan and Naturalcare and between Selim and Schadel. The terms of the Manufacturing Agreement convey the Quality Assurance representation in a general fashion for the term of the agreement, not restricted to goods actually ordered. I am also satisfied that the explicit assurances by Selim, in the conversations with Schadel, Davis and Robinson, were implicitly carried forward by the same course of dealing. I am satisfied that Pan, at all times, represented itself to Naturalcare as a safe and reliable supplier, which was, and would remain ready, willing and able to comply with the Code. I thus find that the Supply representation was also made. 91                  Was it misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive, to make either or both of those representations? Pan admits that it did not comply with the Code in relation to the therapeutic goods manufactured and supplied by Pan to Naturalcare between 1 May 2002 and 28 April 2003 and makes a similar admission in relation to therapeutic goods manufactured and supplied by it to other customers between 1 May 2002 and 28 April 2003. It also admits that its manufacturing licence was suspended by the TGA as a result of its failure to comply with what is described as Good Manufacturing Processes. Pan takes the point that the admission is as from 1 May 2002 but the Agreement was entered into in April and was said to be operative from 1 March 2002. That distinction is of little merit. There is no evidence of any relevant change of circumstances between 1 March 2002 and 1 May 2002. The audits by the TGA on 30–31 January 2003, 24–25 February 2003 and 7–11 and 14 April 2003 and the reports upon them, together with the report of the TGA Expert Advisory Group of 23 April 2003, and the various notices pursuant to ss 30, 40 and 41 of the TGA Act given in 2003 are cogent evidence of the failure by Pan to comply with the Code by reason of serious systemic deficiencies. Pan did not call evidence to establish compliance with the Code during 2002 and 2003 or at any time. It did not call evidence to explain or rebut the effect of the TGA investigation and the conclusions that can be drawn from it. I am quite satisfied that Pan was in serious breach of the Code during 2002 and 2003.  92                  The position in earlier years is not so clear. The TGA audit reports show significant deficiencies, but Pan continued to be licensed. Pan did not call evidence to prove compliance with the Code or that there was a proper basis for representations of compliance. On the other hand, Selim was not cross-examined on that topic. The extent of his involvement in, and knowledge of, the manufacturing process is not clear. The gist of the case is not based upon the earlier representations being a breach of s 52 when made. It is that they continued to be part of the basis upon which business was done in 2002 and 2003. It also follows that the fact that different Pan entities were involved in manufacturing prior to Pan Pharmaceuticals Limited taking over in 2000 does not affect the cause of action against it.  93                  The consequence is that the Quality Assurance representation was misleading if viewed as a statement of existing circumstances at the commencement of and during the term of the 2002 Manufacturing Agreement. That contract continued in force until the recall. Breach of s 52 does not have to be intentional or negligent. If the Quality Assurance representation carried with it a representation as to future conduct, no reasonable grounds are established for making such a representation. 94                  The situation in relation to the Supply representation is somewhat different. Pan was ready and willing to supply. Indeed, it continued to supply up until the suspension and recall. However, Pan was ultimately unable to supply because of the failure to comply with the Code leading to the consequent suspension and loss of licence. What is more, the true situation for all of 2002 and the relevant part of 2003 was that the failure to comply with the Code rendered Pan liable to suspension and cancellation of licence at all times. I am satisfied that the Supply representation was objectively misleading and deceptive for the whole of the relevant period. I am also satisfied that, to the extent that it related to the future, no reasonable grounds are established for making it. 95                  I am satisfied that Naturalcare, through Schadel, did rely upon the Quality Assurance representation and the Supply representation. Counsel for Pan relied upon some factors to negative reliance, for example, the intention to source product from Amrion; the pattern of purchase from other suppliers; the freedom reserved by Schadel to acquire goods from other suppliers if price were favourable; and the variety of manufacturers Naturalcare had listed with the TGA to manufacture its products. It is submitted for Pan that the express evidence of reliance given by Schadel should be given little or no weight, citing Chappel v Hart (1998) 195 CLR 232 at 246 n64.  96                  Chappel v Hart does not compel that conclusion. Indeed, the absence of such evidence could be fatal to a claim of reliance and causation. In the present case, Schadel’s evidence accords with commercial reality. Naturalcare continued to acquire most of its goods from Pan and was lulled into what was a false sense of security by the assurances over the years and entry into the Manufacturing Agreements. It is obvious that if Schadel had thought that there was any real danger of Pan losing its licence because of non-compliance with the Code, he would have taken steps to reorganise the business to minimise dependence upon Pan for supplies. In essence, Schadel was induced not to reorganise the Naturalcare business to reduce dependence upon Pan as a supplier. The misleading conduct does not have to be the sole cause of the action or inaction said to cause the damage (I & L Securities Pty Limited v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Limited (2002) 210 CLR 109 per Gleeson CJ at [33], per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ at [57], per McHugh J at [90]–[93] per Callinan J at [216]).  Damages 97                  The assessment of damages pursuant to s 82 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) presents some problems. Damages have been assessed by Naturalcare by estimating the loss of gross profits on product supplied to it by Pan as at April 2003 and then deducting from that amount any savings in costs and incidentals for a period until alternative suppliers were found. There are issues as to the particular methodology employed to arrive at that result which may be put aside for the moment. It is submitted for Pan that the basic approach is flawed. If Schadel’s evidence is accepted then, on the hypothesis as to liability being explored, he would have commenced decreasing his reliance on Pan from March 2002, both by obtaining products from a range of other suppliers and by developing more generic products rather than complex slurry mix soft gels dependent upon Pan’s particular expertise. Pan complains that there has been no attempt to estimate the difference between the position that would have been arrived at as a result of that conduct and the situation which existed at the time of the recall. In other words, Naturalcare has quantified damage on the basis of the continued supply of Pan products rather than upon the hypothesis that there would have been a substitution for Pan’s products.  98                  Naturalcare’s claim for damages was formulated in a global fashion for all causes of action seeking to demonstrate what was lost by the inability to acquire and resell Pan products. It is submitted for Pan that this leaves the Court in a position where there is no proper basis for the assessment of damages in circumstances where a proper basis could, and should, have been put forward (Placer (Granny Smith) Pty Ltd v Thiess Contractors Pty Ltd (2003) 196 ALR 257 at [38] per Hayne J; Optus Vision Pty Limited v Australian Rugby Football League Limited [2003] NSWSC 288 at [132]–[137] (unaffected by the appeal at [2004] NSWCA 61).  99                  Naturalcare responds that the approach that it has taken is likely to underestimate the quantum of potential damages as it does not take into account the fact that if it had reorganised its business it would have been in a stronger position in the market following the Pan recall than it ultimately was as its competitors would have been adversely affected by the recall and it would not have been. It, therefore, would have been likely to have increased its market share. It is also submitted that the method chosen uses actual figures and so reduces the necessity for hypothetical estimates which would inevitably be speculative. 100               In my opinion, the approach taken by Naturalcare is acceptable as a starting point (Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd (2004) 216 CLR 388 at [44]–[52]). As it was induced to do nothing, it did not get out of the way and was a sitting duck when hit by the runaway train. Quantification of the effects of the train wreck is a good starting point for the assessment of loss. Of necessity, the assessment of damages in a case such as this is imprecise. There is a body of material in evidence as to the financial performance of the Naturalcare business prior to and after the suspension of licence and product recall which forms the raw material for the necessary assessment. The fact that the witnesses have approached the matter in one way or another is not decisive.  101               If reorganisation of the business could have been completed so as to eliminate dependence upon Pan prior to the suspension of Pan’s licence, then the proposed measure of damages would be a good proxy for the loss caused by the misleading and deceptive conduct. If reorganisation would not have been completed, there would need to be a discount to reflect the extent to which reorganisation would not have taken place. The evidence of what occurred in relation to reorganisation after the recall is of some value in assessing what may have occurred in the 12 months prior to it. However, the latter period was complicated by widespread effect of the failure of Pan, which meant that many other customers apart from Naturalcare were scrambling to obtain supply. I am not satisfied that the divorce from Pan would have been complete by the time of the suspension of the licence, even if commenced in March 2002.  102               I agree with the submission by counsel for Naturalcare that the most striking aspect of the actual results post recall is the significant loss of total revenue by the business after the cessation of supply by Pan. The total revenue for the period 1 May 2001 to 30 April 2002 was $9 738 748 with an average monthly revenue of $811 562. In the period from 1 May 2002 to 30 April 2003, the total revenue was $11 240 026 with an average monthly revenue of $936 669. In the period from 1 May 2003 to 30 April 2004, the total revenue was $7 841 573 with an average monthly revenue of $653 464. In the period from 1 May 2004 to 30 April 2005, the total revenue was $10 667 344 with an average monthly revenue of $888 945. Thus, in what is roughly the year after the cessation of supply, the decrease in total revenue was $3 398 453 and in the ensuing 12 months the decrease was $572 682 in total which together can be rounded up to about $4 000 000. This pattern is broadly consistent with the evidence given as to the replacement of individual Pan products over the period. No other substantive reason has been advanced for the drop in revenue apart from the disturbance of supply of Pan products. I am satisfied that the interruption of supply was progressively alleviated over approximately two years. The total lost revenue in the two years would, as submitted by counsel for Naturalcare, understate the true loss as revenue had been on a rising plane up to the time of termination of supply by Pan. No doubt some of the effect of the unavailability of Pan products upon Naturalcare was due to Markethaven being unable to supply Pan products. It is reasonable to take account of that consequence because of the history of the relationship between Pan, Markethaven and Naturalcare. 103               Pan endeavoured to establish that Naturalcare had not taken reasonable or timely steps to obtain substituted supplies more quickly. There was an attempt to use cross-examination and some evidence to show that Naturalcare had not acted reasonably as there were sources of supply not examined at all or not examined promptly. In my opinion, that endeavour was unsuccessful. Naturalcare had every commercial reason to take all steps open to it to minimise the loss. There is no reason to doubt the motivation to do so. In assessing the situation it is necessary to bear in mind what was said by Lord Macmillan in the well known passage from Banco de Portugal v Waterlow & Sons Ltd [1932] AC 452 (at 506): ‘It is often easy after an emergency has passed to criticize the steps which have been taken to meet it, but such criticism does not come well from those who have themselves created the emergency. The law is satisfied if the party placed in a difficult situation by reason of the breach of a duty owed to him has acted reasonably in the adoption of remedial measures, and he will not be held disentitled to recover the cost of such measures merely because the party in breach can suggest that other measures less burdensome to him might have been taken.’ It is also necessary to bear in mind that Schadel’s reliance on Selim had limited his knowledge of the market. Even if the result was not perfect, I am satisfied that Naturalcare took reasonable steps to restore supply. 104               Loss of gross revenue is not the measure of loss to the business. It is quite obvious, however, that a sudden loss of revenue by a continuing business will inevitably lead to a net loss. Fixed costs and many of the variable costs will remain. There was a good deal of attention in the evidence and in the submissions to assessing the net revenue lost. In my opinion, the endeavour by Naturalcare to found upon a gross profit margin applicable only to the goods supplied by Pan is not appropriate to an exercise to determine damages for breach of s 52. I am satisfied that, in this respect, it is appropriate to adopt a margin of 45 per cent in accordance with the opinion of Mr McGuiness. However, having studied his report, and taking into account his evidence under cross-examination, his assessment of MSD costs and other operating expenses and the saving of wages costs are all too high. In my opinion, they should be approximately 15 per cent in total, rather than 20 per cent as he proposed. Therefore, in broad terms, the loss of net revenue is calculated as follows: loss of revenue $4 000 000 x gross profit margin 45 per cent = $1 800 000, less costs etc x 15 per cent = $270 000, leaving net revenue of $1 530 000. Allowance then needs to be made for the overlap between that amount and the loss of profit on goods returned and goods ordered but not supplied. Then there should be some discount for the uncertainty as to whether the business would have been completely reorganised by the time of the licence suspension and for other uncertainties. 105               The principal difference between the parties in relation to the goods returned and goods not supplied claim relates to the gross profit margin. Naturalcare claims a gross margin of 58.5 per cent for goods sourced from Pan moderated to 55.2 per cent if freight is taken into account. In my opinion, the criticisms of the foundation for that claim made by McGuiness are valid. I prefer to adopt for those purposes the yardsticks I have adopted for the umbrella claim, ie gross margin of 45 per cent and MSD etc of 15 per cent. The amount which is to be allowed for loss of profits on those claims is to be deducted from the overall amount I found for net loss. I would then discount the net amount by 20 per cent to take account of the uncertainties to which I have referred. I do not see the necessity for any discount back to a present value at the date of breach. The time has now elapsed. The amounts in question reflect the dollar values at the time during the period of loss. On that basis, interest would not run from the date of breach but should be calculated to reflect the progressive occurrence of loss. The amount of judgment should also reflect amounts allowed for direct expenses incurred due to the disruption such as the packaging, costs of registration and so on. Unless there are special reasons to the contrary, costs should follow the event.  106               The proceeding will stand over to enable counsel for Naturalcare to bring in draft orders to reflect these reasons, including calculation of the amounts for damages and interest. The parties should also draw my attention to any issue that has been overlooked.       I certify that the preceding one hundred and six (106) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.

At all material times it was the registered owner of various trademarks identified in par 4 of the amended statement of claim (the “Louis Vuitton trademarks”). The relevant certificates of registration appear in exhibit 1. At all material times the applicant and/or its agents have manufactured and/or marketed various products, utilizing one or more of the Louis Vuitton trademarks.  2                    The applicant pleads that the first respondent (“Toea”) has at all material times been ‘the landlord of and the party responsible for operating, supervising and controlling a market at Nerang-Broadbeach Road, Carrara in the State of Queensland’. That market is hereinafter described as the “Market”. The applicant also alleges that the second respondent (“Mr Rosenlund”) has at all material times been the full-time manager of, and person responsible for operating, supervising and controlling the Market on behalf of Toea. There are more than 400 stalls at the Market. Traders occupy stalls pursuant to agreements entered into with Toea. The applicant alleges that various stallholders have breached one or more of the Louis Vuitton trademarks. It does not seek relief against those stallholders. It rather seeks relief as against Toea and Mr Rosenlund, alleging that at all relevant times they: ·                were aware that stallholders were infringing the Louis Vuitton trademarks; ·                permitted them to continue trading at the Market; ·                failed to take adequate steps to prevent them from further infringing the trademarks; and  ·                derived financial advantage from such continued trading. It is said that such conduct constituted infringement of the relevant trademarks. 3                    It will not be necessary to describe the Louis Vuitton trademarks in detail. The respondents have not seriously disputed the allegations concerning infringement by individual stallholders. The question is whether, in those circumstances, the respondents, or either of them, infringed the trademarks. It will, however, be necessary to say a little about the applicant’s business, or more particularly, about the way in which its products are marketed. It will also be necessary to say a little more about the operation of the Market. The Applicant’s products and marketing system 4                    The applicant manufactures luggage, hand bags and a wide range of other accessories. It supplies its products directly to retail outlets throughout the world. Louis Vuitton Australia Pty Ltd (“LV Australia”), which is a member of a worldwide group of companies controlled by the applicant, is responsible for the importation, distribution, promotion and sale in Australia of the applicant’s products. Such products are only retailed through outlets which are owned by LV Australia. The products are extremely high-quality and priced at the upper end of the market for such goods. Employees of LV Australia are trained in various aspects of the manufacture and promotion of Louis Vuitton goods, including design and methods of manufacture. This training is designed to assist in the identification of “counterfeit” goods.  The market 5                    Mr Rosenlund is employed as the manager of the Market and is a director of Toea, having been appointed to that office on 11 July 1997. Toea owns and operates the Market as trustee of the Toea Unit Trust and trades under the business name “Carrara Markets”. The Market is situated on approximately ten acres of land on the Nerang-Broadbeach Road at Carrara on the Gold Coast. Toea owns the land which is comprised of two lots, separated by Gin House Creek. The Market is open to the public from 7.30 am to 4.00 pm on each Saturday and Sunday. It is the largest such market on the Gold Coast, comprising approximately 450 stalls. Stallholders are either permanent stallholders, long-term casual stallholders or casual stallholders.  6                    There are approximately 400 permanent stallholders. Each is granted a licence to occupy a specific stall for a weekly fee. Four of those stallholders, having stalls situated on the perimeter of the Markets with direct street access, trade seven days a week. The remaining permanent stallholders trade only on weekends, although they have continuous access to their stalls so that they may attend to maintenance, restocking and setting up for weekend trading. Permanent stallholders may make improvements to their stalls. Many erect signage and permanent structures which enable them to lock up and secure stock. Many have expensive equipment and fit-out in much the same way as would a retail shop. Permanent allocation and the ability to make improvements allow a permanent stallholder to develop goodwill in the business operated from his or her stall.  7                    Since Mr Rosenlund commenced as manager in 1997, he has required that all new permanent stallholders enter into a “licence to occupy” in the form of exhibit JMR 3 to his affidavit. The licence provides as follows: ‘1. The Licensor does grant to the Licensee a license to occupy the stall for the weekly fee commencing on the date first set … 2. The Licensee will occupy the stall on days or hours based on arrangement with the Licensor upon payment of the relevant …  The Licensee must specifically occupy the stall between the hours of 7.30am and close of markets each Saturday and Sunday. 3. At the expiration of each weekend the Licensee shall leave the stall in a neat, tidy and clean condition to the satisfaction of the Licensor’s manager. 4. The Licensee will at all times be subject to control, management and direction of the Licensor’s manager and shall at all times obey his direction or directions of someone authorised by him. 5. The licensee whilst in occupation shall not carry on any illegal, offensive or hazardous trade or occupation nor engage in any activity which would be detrimental to the reputation of the markets. 6. The Licensee will operate within the area provided and not encroach outside the bounds of the stall. 7. The Licensee will not transfer his interest under this agreement without the consent of the Licensor first hand and obtained which consent may be granted on the condition that the Licensee pays to the Licensor a sum designated by the Licensor of total sale price received by the Licensee for the sale of his interest under this agreement and the goodwill of the business.  8. The Licensee shall have the right to occupy the stall on Saturday/Sunday of each week after the signing of this agreement upon payment of the License fee subject to the Licensor’s right to cancel this agreement at any time and the Licensor shall not be required to provide any reason for the cancellation nor should the Licensee have any recourse against the Licensor arising from the cancellation. 9. The Licensee should not bring in a vehicle to clear the contents of the stall before 2.45pm on Saturday and 3.45pm Sunday. 10. The Licensee and any staff employed will park in the designated car park and not in the customer car park, and shall ensure that the motor cars are parked in such position and will not block access to, egress from or interfere with traffic flow. 11. The Licensee hereby agrees to indemnify the Licensor in respect of all or any actions arising from or as a result of the Licensee and or its agent’s conduct, performance or other actions arising from its occupation of the stall.  12. Failure to comply with all these conditions may result in the “License to Occupy” being cancelled.’ 8                    Should a permanent stallholder propose to transfer his or her interest in a stall he or she must list it with Toea and introduce any prospective buyer to Mr Rosenlund so that he may assess that person’s suitability. A relevant consideration is the general category of product or service which the proposed transferee will sell or provide. Toea seeks to ensure that the Market maintains an appropriate spread of categories of products and services, and that stalls offering like products are not located in close proximity to one another. Permanent stalls “sell” for between $20 000 and $40 000, excluding stock. Toea receives 10 per cent commission on such sale prices. Businesses conducted from permanent stalls have sold for as much as $400 000, including the stall, improvements, fixtures and fittings and goodwill.  9                    Approximately 20 stalls are occupied by long-term casual stallholders. These people have been operating from the Market for many years. Each is allocated the same stall on each weekend. They are not required to book stalls during the preceding week, nor queue at the office on Saturday mornings to be allotted stalls. This right to a specific stall is not assignable. Long-term casual stallholders may be permitted to erect permanent signage and structures on their sites. Since mid-2004 no new arrangements of this kind have been made. The change in policy was the result of discontent amongst permanent stallholders over the preferential arrangements made for long-term casual stallholders. Stalls already allocated to existing long-term casual stallholders remain so allocated but, when such a stallholder leaves the Market, the stall goes back into the pool of stalls available for casual occupation, or it is “sold” as a permanent stall.  10                Each weekend, other (non-long-term) casual stallholders occupy about 40 stalls. The number varies from week to week. Stalls may be booked on Tuesday morning for the following weekend. Casual stallholders do not enter into a licence to occupy. They arrive between 5.00 am and 7.00 am on Saturday mornings and queue at the office. They are asked about the types of goods which they propose to sell and are then allocated stalls, depending upon availability and product type. Mr Rosenlund tries to separate stallholders selling similar products. Potential casual stallholders are told that they cannot sell anything which is illegal. On the first few occasions on which they rent stalls, casual stallholders are given copies of a slip entitled ‘Conditions of Renting a Stall’. The document is also available on the Market website. It is exhibit JMR 4 to Mr Rosenlund’s affidavit. There is nothing of particular relevance in the conditions save that stallholders are obliged to accept five and ten dollar vouchers issued by Toea. The vouchers are redeemable by stallholders at the Market office. Mr Rosenlund claims that it is not practicable for him or his staff to check every individual item to be offered by the 40 casual stallholders each week. Exhibit JMR 5 is an information brochure provided to persons who enquire concerning the hiring of stalls. Attached to it is a document entitled ‘Carrara Markets Casual Stall Policy’. The only relevant provision seems to be that: ‘Products not described to the Booking Officer at the time of booking may not be allowed to be sold on the day.’ 11                Stallholders pay a levy to cover public liability insurance, presumably effected by Toea. Stallholders are responsible for the tidiness of their own stall areas, but Toea is responsible for all common areas, including car parks and toilets. There is a manager’s office where stallholders attend to pay rent. It also serves as an information centre.  12                Some stallholders sell secondhand goods. During the relevant period, Toea held a licence which covered stallholders selling secondhand goods, provided that they did not do so on more than three occasions in any one year. Toea receives no commission upon sales effected at the Market by stallholders. Its only revenue is rent and commission received on the sale of stalls.  13                On each weekend eighteen to twenty-three thousand customers attend the Market. Sunday is the busier day. The Market is at its busiest in winter. Mr Rosenlund has about fourteen staff in attendance each weekend. One is a full-time employee. There are three part-time office personnel, six part-time car parking attendants and two part-time employees who attend to general duties. 14                Security guards are employed by Security and Traffic Management Pty Ltd, trading as Guardrite. Toea is invoiced each week for their services. On Saturdays there are two security guards, one working from 8.30 am to 2.00 pm at the main gate and assisting in traffic control, and one working from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm on general security duties. Those duties include patrolling, dealing with lost children, lost property, theft, accidents, sickness and otherwise identifying and dealing with problems around the Market. All have first-aid certificates. On Sundays three security guards are retained, one working from 8.30 am to 2.00 pm on the main gate, one working on general duties from 7.00 am to 4.00 pm and one working on general duties from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm. A security guard patrols the Market from 1.00 pm to 5.00 pm on Mondays to Fridays. Mr Rosenlund issues instructions to the security guards as required. 15                In late 2002 or 2003 Mr Rosenlund was informed by investigators acting on behalf of the owners of trademarks that there had been an increase in the sale of allegedly counterfeit goods at the Market. As a result he instructed security guards to advise him if they saw any goods which appeared to be counterfeit. However none of those guards had any training or specific knowledge in performing this task. On a few occasions security guards informed Mr Rosenlund that they had seen goods which were obviously counterfeit. On each occasion Mr Rosenlund went to the stall and confronted the stallholder. On one occasion the stallholder asserted that he had a certificate of authenticity for the item. It did not appear to be an item produced or marketed by the applicant. 16                Mr Rosenlund’s duties include hiring and supervising of staff, liaison with stallholders and customers and taking day-to-day decisions concerning the operation of the Market. Various issues arise in the course of such operation, particularly over weekends. It is necessary to ensure that the ATM machine is operational. Parking, including vehicle security, is a major ongoing problem. It is also necessary to deal with urgent health problems, difficulties with the toilet facilities, shoplifting and disputes between customers and stallholders. The Market operates a website which is exhibit JMR 9. The following statement now appears at the end of a passage headed ‘Casual Stall Information’: ‘NB: Copyright Infringement Policy . Carrara Markets does not condone the sale of products identified as infringing Australian copyright and/or Trademark laws. It is your responsibility to ensure your products do not infringe Australian copyright and/or Trademark laws. Carrara Markets reserves the right to take immediate action to exclude products identified to us as infringing these laws.’ 17                There is no evidence as to when this note was first published on the website. 18                In the course of cross-examination Mr Rosenlund said that in the 2004/2005 financial year Toea derived about $200 000 from commission on the sale of permanent stalls. That was about 10 per cent of Toea’s total revenue in that year. This figure was atypical, being inflated by one major sale. He also said that he tries to ensure that the Market is attractive to potential customers. This involves making sure that parking arrangements are satisfactory, that there is bus transport to and from the Market and that entertainment is available. Promotional vouchers are also issued. Mr Rosenlund agreed that the restriction on the sale of products by casual stallholders, other than those identified to the booking officer, was designed to assist in ensuring a good mix of products for sale rather than to detect and prevent the sale of counterfeit goods. He is more concerned about the sale of products that bear a false trademark than about the sale of goods which appear to be the imitations but do not bear any trademark. This evidence related particularly to the operation at the Market of a stall selling sunglasses. It has a sign describing its stock as ‘Looks the same without the name’. Mr Rosenlund did not consider this to be illegal conduct. He said that if he perceived that any stallholder was selling counterfeit goods he would tell that person to get rid of them or not to return to the Market. Such persons are often casual stallholders who do not return. He agreed that some people went to markets for the purpose of obtaining low-priced copies of designer goods. However he did not consider that those people formed a significant revenue source for the Market. The rest of Mr Rosenlund’s evidence will be best dealt with elsewhere in these reasons. Offending stallholders 19                Although the applicant’s case is pleaded widely, at the trial, it focused on a number of trap purchase to three stallholders, Mr Alcock, Ms Byrne and Ms Gallop. Most of the evidence concerned such purchases and observations made by private inquiry agents retained by the applicant to investigate possible infringements.  Mr Alcock Purchase of one handbag on 6 April 2003 20                This sale is not pleaded in the statement of claim. Mr Edmonds is a private enquiry agent, working under sub-contract to another agent, Ken Taylor, of Mainpack Pty Ltd. Mr Taylor had, on 2 March 2003, visited Mr Alcock’s stall and there seen two medium-sized and one small “Epi” style bag bearing the applicant’s “LV” trademark, or a mark similar to it, and two other bags bearing such marks. At Mr Taylor’s request Mr Edmonds attended at the Market on 6 April 2003. Mr Taylor was also present. At Mr Alcock’s stall Mr Edmonds saw two “Epi” style handbags bearing the applicant’s “LV” and “Louis Vuitton” trademarks or similar marks. A sign indicated that one of the handbags was marked down from $110 to $90. Mr Edmonds indicated to a woman working at the stall that he wished to buy the handbag priced at $90. He paid cash for it. It bore a “swing tag” which bore the LV and Louis Vuitton trademarks or similar marks. 21                After Mr Edmond’s purchase on 6 April 2003 Mr Taylor spoke to Mr Alcock and gave him a “warning letter”. Mr Alcock said that: ‘I do not have any Louis Vuitton products because they stopped me three weeks ago when I spoke to your investigator. I will ring the Corrs lawyer.’ 22                The warning letter was headed ‘Notice in relation to vending of counterfeit items’ and bore a solicitor’s logo. It read as follows: ‘You have just sold goods which bear one or more trademarks owned by Louis Vuitton Malletier SA (“Louis Vuitton”). A schedule of these trade marks is attached to this notice. The goods sold by you are counterfeit and were not manufactured by or with the licence of Louis Vuitton. The sale of counterfeit goods is illegal and can result in criminal and civil liability. You are exposed to the risk of prosecution or may be sued by Louis Vuitton seeking remedies such as injunctions, damages, account of profits and delivery up of stock. Unless you immediately cease the sale of goods bearing trademarks owned by Louis Vuitton, court action will be taken against you without further notice. This notice is effective immediately.’ 23                Mr Alcock is a long-term casual stallholder. In his evidence he claimed to have bought 40 bags from a person called “Boris”, intending to sell them pursuant to a ‘party plan system’. That system involves sales at social functions specifically organized for that purpose. He said that he was not aware of the significance of the “LV” logo or that it represented the name “Louis Vuitton”. He was also not aware that Louis Vuitton only sold through its own outlets. He had no reason to believe that the bags were counterfeit. He was unable to sell the bags by party-plan because they were too expensive. He therefore decided to sell them at the stall. He does not normally sell handbags.  24                He said in evidence that when Mr Taylor approached him on 6 April 2003 he said that he did not have any counterfeit Lous Vuitton products. He otherwise denied the statement attributed to him by Mr Taylor. He said that Mr Taylor said that the bags were illegal but that if he got rid of them it would be ‘Okay’. Mr Taylor also suggested that he speak to someone ‘at Louis Vuitton’. Mr Alcock later telephoned the relevant solicitors and said that he would not sell counterfeit Louis Vuitton products again.  Purchase of one purse on 21 December 2003 25                On 21 December 2003 Mr Taylor saw ten handbags and two “Multicolore” wallets or copies thereof at the Alcock stall. “Multicolore” is a term used to describe one of the applicant’s trademarks. The handbags bore the initials “JB” as well as a number of the applicant’s “flower” trademarks or marks similar thereto. He asked Mr Moes, also a private enquiry agent, to visit the stall. 26                At Mr Alcock’s stall Mr Moes saw a girl, about fifteen years of age. He did not see any products bearing the applicant’s trademark or any similar mark. He asked the girl whether or not she had any ‘Louis Vuitton bags or items’for sale. She said that she did not. He then saw a man arrive at the stall and commence unpacking a box, taking out about fifteen bags and purses, each of which bore one or more of the applicant’s “flower” trademarks or similar marks. He said to the man, ‘They look good’. The man said, ‘These bags are not real Louis Vuitton bags. They’re imitation bags.’ Mr Moes then purchased a brown purse which bore one or other of the applicant’s “flower” trademarks or similar marks, paying $29.00. He asked for a receipt. The girl said that they did not give receipts.  Purchase of one wallet on 11 January 2004 27                On 11 January 2004 Huong Nguyen, a private investigation agent, visited the Market in company with Mr Taylor and Mr Moes. Ms Nguyen went to Mr Alcock’s stall and spoke to a woman called Hope. She saw five brown handbags, four brown wallets and one pink wallet, each of which bore one or more of the applicant’s “flower” trademarks or similar marks, and the letters “IX”. Ms Nguyen approached Hope, asking the price of the ‘Louis Vuitton handbags and wallets’. Hope said that the Louis Vuitton handbags were $49 each and the Louis Vuitton wallets, $29 each. Ms Nguyen selected one wallet and paid $29 cash. She asked for a receipt. Hope said that she had never written a receipt before, and that this was the first time anybody had asked. In the end a receipt was produced.  28                Mr Moes was in the vicinity, taking photographs. He said that he saw about ten handbags and wallets bearing the applicant’s “flower” trademarks or similar marks. He took photographs of Ms Nguyen speaking to Hope. A complaint 29                In January 2004 Mr Alcock’s alleged infringements were brought to the attention of Mr Rosenlund. In February 2004 Mr Roselund spoke to him, saying that he had been ‘caught selling fake Louis Vuitton bags’. He was shown a letter from the applicant’s solicitors and various photographs and was then given a notice of infringement. Mr Alcock protested that he was not selling Louis Vuitton products. Mr Rosenlund then drew his attention to certain items on the stall asking, ‘What are these then?’. Mr Alcock said that they were not Louis Vuitton bags and that he did not claim that they were, pointing to the “IX” logo and saying ‘They have IX on them, they’re not Louis Vuitton.’ Mr Rosenlund said ‘We’re getting flack over them anyway.’ Mr Alcock protested that everyone was selling them and that they could buy them from shops in the Robina Shopping Centre. Mr Rosenlund said ‘Look, the Louis Vuitton people have a problem, so I have a problem. I wouldn’t know if they’re legal or not. Just get rid of them. You can’t sell them. That’s all there is to it.’ Mr Alcock said that he would get rid of them.  Purchase of one bag on 15 February 2004 30                On 15 February 2004 Mr Moes visited Mr Alcock’s stall and saw Mr Rosenlund speaking to Mr Alcock. This appears to have been the conversation described in the preceding paragraph. He saw three bags on the stall, each of which bore one of the applicant’s “flower” trademarks or a similar mark. Each bore a price tag showing the price as $39. Mr Moes took one of the bags to a woman who was working on the stall and purchased it, paying cash. The woman did not have the correct change. She went to Mr Alcock and asked him for some change. At the time she was holding the bag which Mr Moes had purchased. Mr Moes heard Mr Alcock say to Mr Rosenlund: ‘There you go. That’s another one sold, I only have two out for sale now.’ 31                Mr Rosenlund then left the stall. The woman gave Mr Moes his change and the bag but declined to give him a receipt.  32                A little later Mr Moes saw Mr Rosenlund carrying a folder in which was a document headed ‘Corrs Chambers Westgarth’, the name of the applicant’s solicitors. He gave Mr Rosenlund a “letter of demand”. Mr Rosenlund told him that he was, at that time, seeing the store operators, presumably in connection with previous correspondence received from the solicitors. Mr Moes said: ‘I will be furnishing a report to Corrs Chambers Westgarth on stall holders who are selling counterfeit Louis Vuitton merchandise. It would be in your best interests to contact Corrs Chambers Westgarth in relation to the matter as soon as possible.’ Purchase of one scarf on 12 December 2004 33                On 12 December 2004, at the request of Mr Taylor, Ms Crystal Taylor, also a private enquiry agent, attended the Market. She went to Mr Alcock’s stall and there saw, in a glass display case, a scarf bearing one of the applicant’s trademarks, or a similar mark, and on a bench, two white handbags, each of which bore one or other of the applicant’s “flower” trademarks or similar marks. She spoke to a woman called Samantha who was working in the stall, asking, ‘Do you have any Louis Vuitton bags at all? I see you have the scarf and other brands.’ The woman said, ‘Yes we do, but just wait a moment while I check with my husband.’  34                The woman then spoke to a man at the stall whom Ms Taylor subsequently identified as Mr Alcock. She heard him say, ‘Be careful of this stuff.’ He seemed to be annoyed. He unlocked a glass cabinet and took out the scarf bearing the applicant’s trademark and relocked the cabinet. Ms Taylor noticed that there was an identical scarf underneath the scarf which he had removed. She asked the woman for the price of the scarf and was told that it was $39. She purchased it, paying cash. At the time Ms Taylor heard Mr Alcock say to the woman, ‘Hide these boxes, would you?’ She was not shown any bags and was not offered a receipt. Purchase of one watch and one hair clip on 24 April 2005 35                On 24 April 2005 Ms Nguyen again went to the Alcock stall. At the rear of the stall she saw a lady’s wristwatch which bore the applicant’s “LV”, “Louis Vuitton” and “flower” trademarks or marks similar to them. She saw a woman with short, curly, blond hair serving customers and asked if she could look at the Louis Vuitton watch. The woman said that it was her last ‘Louis Vuitton watch’. Ms Nguyen purchased the watch and a hair clip, paying $70 in cash. She received $2 change. She asked for a receipt, but the woman said that she did not have a receipt book. Ms Nguyen said that a piece of paper would be sufficient. She did not receive any receipt.  Confrontation – Mr Edmondson 36                On or about 7 May 2005 a Market employee, David Edmondson, called on Mr Alcock and showed him a letter from Corrs Chambers Westgarth in which it was alleged that on 24 April 2005, a lady’s wristwatch and other items which infringed the applicant’s trademarks had been seen on his stall. Mr Edmondson told him to withdraw any such infringing products from the Market and never to sell such products again. Mr Edmondson said that Mr Rosenlund had asked him to remind Mr Alcock that the selling of counterfeit goods might affect his future ability to occupy a stall and that his stall at the Market was at stake. Mr Alcock assured Mr Edmondson that he had no Louis Vuitton products, and that he would not, in the future, sell any such goods or anything like them.  Confrontation – Mr Rosenlund 37                On 15 May 2005 Mr Rosenlund spoke to Mr Alcock at his stall. He referred to the earlier conversation with Mr Edmondson and said: ‘I’m really upset at you for putting the Market and me in a position where it might appear that we are allowing you to sell these fake Louis Vuitton goods. You gave me an assurance that this would not happen again and I believed you.’ 38                Mr Alcock said: ‘I’m sorry John, it was a mistake. I didn’t even know that the watch was there. I bought a box of stock from a woman who was closing her shop at Robina Shopping Centre, and I didn’t realise that the Louis Vuitton watch was in the box. One of the girls unpacked the box and everything was put in a cabinet at the back of the stall. I didn’t even see the watch and my wife sold it to a woman she said was very persistent and specifically wanted to buy that particular watch.’ 39                Mr Rosenlund said: ‘It’s just not good enough, Gary. Any future problems and you will definitely be thrown out of the Market for good.’ 40                Mr Alcock said: ‘Look John, if you want I’ll give you a Stat Dec outlining what happened so that you and the Market don’t get into trouble.’ 41                Mr Rosenlund said that this might help. Mr Alcock then said: ‘I absolutely assure you that I won’t sell anything else. This will never happen again.’ 42                On 6 June 2005, Mr Alcock executed a statutory declaration. In it he declared that: ‘… sometime in the year 2004 the management of Carrara Markets instructed all stall holders that they were not to infringe on the trade marks of Louis Vuitton. To this end I changed the way I purchased goods for resale and restricted my purchases to goods which were either authenticated by the seller or came from a recognized retail outlet. Again in March 2005 the Carrara Markets management strongly instructed stall holders that they were not to infringe the Louis Vuitton trade marks. Even though I was able to purchase items from a nationally advertised retail source, which came with certificates of authentication backed by a money back guarantee, the market enforced their “NO Louis Vuitton” and I agreed.  On the 17th of April 2005 I purchased a number of fashion watches from a retail outlet on the Gold Coast. These watches were purchased for resale at the market and to my knowledge did not contain any Louis Vuitton items. All these watches were placed at the back of the stall in a cabinet. On the 24th of April my wife, who was looking after the stall was approached by a woman who was desperate to buy anything “Louis Vuitton”. My wife explained that we did not sell Louis Vuitton but the woman would not take no for an answer. The woman then searched through the cabinet at the back of the stall and asked my wife if she could buy the watch which I now know to be the one in question. As I was operating another stall which occupied all my time, I was not aware that the item had found its way into my stock or that the transaction had taken place.  It is my contention that the Carrara Markets management not only had no idea that this transaction had taken place, but, because neither the stall holders or market management could differentiate between authentic or counterfeit items, they were actively enforcing a ban on the sale of any Louis Vuitton items.’ 43                In July 2005 Mr Alcock received a memorandum dated 31 July 2005 from the Market outlining its policy in relation to counterfeit goods. It is exhibit GJA 7 to his affidavit. It states: ‘Carrara Markets are currently in Federal Court proceedings with solicitors representing Louis Vuitton as a result of stallholders here selling copy Louis Vuitton products. The facts are Trade Mark Investigation Services (TMIS) and Anti Counterfeiting Action Group (ACAG) are more active than ever in seeking to prevent the sale of counterfeit goods from markets in particular and have proven willing to prosecute as a result of their investigations. They continually send investigators under cover to seek out and purchase counterfeit goods and usually take photos etc as evidence of their ability to purchase these goods. This evidence will be used to support court action. It is Carrara Markets policy to co-operate with these groups and it is also our policy that the sale of illegal and counterfeit goods identified cannot be sold at our markets. Stallholders blatantly ignoring these policies or repeat offenders jeopardize their “Licence to Occupy” and run the risk of losing their stall. Attached for your information is a recent article from the Sun Herald concerning action taken at Parklea Markets. Would you please ensure you and your staff are aware of the policies and that counterfeit goods are not sold at your store. We thank you in advance for your co-operation in this matter.’ 44                The letter was signed by Mr Rosenlund as manager. Attached was a newspaper clipping referring to a police raid on a market in Sydney. Linda Byrne Purchase of one handbag on 6 April 2003 45                Ms Byrne is a permanent stallholder. On 6 April 2003 Mr Edmonds visited Ms Byrne’s stall where Ms Byrne introduced herself as Linda. There were two bags on display, each bearing one of the applicant’s trademarks or a similar mark. Ms Byrne said to him: ‘My daughter supplies me with all my designer stock. My daughter also holds a Louis Vuitton sales party. She lives in New South Wales.’ 46                Mr Edmonds purchased one of the handbags. Ms Byrne provided a dust bag in which to carry the handbag. The dust bag also bore one of the applicant’s trademarks or a similar mark. Mr Edmonds paid $220 in cash but did not get a receipt.  Purchase of one handbag on 11 January 2004 47                Ms Nguyen visited Ms Byrne’s stall on 11 January 2004. She spoke to a woman called Evangeline Balibay who asked her if she wanted Gucci bags. Ms Nguyen replied, ‘Do you have any Louis?’ Evangeline indicated to a younger woman that she should bring out a handbag stored in a blue, white and red carry bag. The handbag bore one or other of the applicant’s “flower” trademarks or a similar mark and the initials “IX”. Ms Balibay said that it was the last Louis Vuitton handbag, and that Ms Nguyen could have it for $60. She appeared to be nervous and quickly returned the bag to the storage bag, saying, ‘I have to hide it.’ Ms Nguyen did not buy anything at that stage but returned to the stall later in the day and again spoke to Ms Balibay. She asked if she could purchase the Louis Vuitton handbag which she had seen earlier. Evangeline produced the handbag and Ms Nguyen paid $60 for it. She asked for a receipt but was told that there would be ‘No receipt’. Ms Nguyen said that she was buying the bag as a gift for her mother and that she and her sister were going to split the cost. Evangeline then wrote the words and figures ‘Bag $60’ on a business card and gave it to her. The card bore the words: ‘Evangeline Balibay Director’. Purchase of one purse on 12 December 2004 48                On 12 December 2004, Ms Crystal Taylor went to the Byrne stall. She saw a woman who appeared to be between 45 and 50 years of age. Ms Taylor introduced herself as “Emily”. The woman said that her name was Linda Byrne. Ms Taylor asked if she had any Louis Vuitton stock. Ms Byrne led her to the back of the stall where, hanging on the wall, was a large garment resembling a raincoat, behind which were two large garbage bin liners. Ms Byrne produced two handbags from one of the bags, each of which bore one or more of the applicant’s “flower” trademarks or similar marks. One bag was white and the other, black. Ms Byrne said that they were each priced at $170.  49                Ms Byrne also showed Ms Taylor two purses, both of which bore the applicant’s monogram trademark or a similar mark. One purse was brown the other pink with a cherry blossom pattern on it. Ms Byrne said that the purses were each priced at $120. Ms Byrne then went to the other garbage bag liner, which was blue in colour, and produced a multi-coloured handbag which bore one or more of the applicant’s “flower” trademarks or similar marks. Ms Byrne said that this was priced at $250 but was ‘on hold’ for another customer. Ms Taylor asked Ms Byrne to write down the prices of the handbags and purses and her telephone number. She did this. Ms Taylor asked if she could ring later in the day to see if the handbag priced at $250 was available. Ms Byrne agreed. Ms Taylor again asked her name and Ms Byrne wrote ‘Linda Byrne’ on the paper on which she had written the prices. Ms Taylor then left the stall and went to speak to Mr Taylor. A little later she returned to the stall and purchased a brown purse bearing the applicant’s monogram trademark or a similar mark for $120. She did not get a receipt. Purchase of one purse on 8 May 2005 50                On 8 May 2005 Ms Taylor went to the Byrne stall where she saw Ms Byrne. She said to her ‘Hi, how are you? I’m looking for something very special for my mum.’ Ms Byrne pointed to some shirts which bore the Ralph Lauren “Polo” brand, saying that they were $25 each. Ms Taylor said ‘Yeah, but I’m looking for something special though. I don’t know if you remember me but I was here at Christmas time and you had some special purses that I bought for my sister.’ Ms Byrne said ‘How about Louis Vuitton?’ Ms Taylor said ‘Yes, that’s great. I bought for my sister a Louis Vuitton purse last time. My Mum really liked it and she got a bit jealous. So today I wanted to get something special for her.’ Ms Byrne said ‘Come with me.’ They walked behind a clothes rack in the stall, and Ms Byrne opened a beach bag. She took out a small purse which bore the applicant’s monogram trademark or a similar mark and said, ‘Now this is Louis Vuitton, it’s very nice, it is $80.’ Ms Taylor asked if she had any other purses. Ms Byrne produced two purses, each bearing such a monogram and said that they were priced at $120. Ms Taylor asked about a purse in a dust bag and was told that it was priced at $150. Ms Byrne said that she had no more of this stock and that she was selling for a friend who was ‘really broke’. She also said: ‘You know it’s very hard to sell Louis Vuitton any more. Not many people sell Louis Vuitton any more. There is a Louis Vuitton inspector up here and he looks out for Louis Vuitton. He told me not to sell any more otherwise I get fined from Louis Vuitton.’ 51                Ms Taylor responded ‘Well, I’ll buy this, it’s pretty cheap for Louis Vuitton, $80.’ She paid $80 in cash and Ms Byrne put the purse in a brown cardboard box also bearing the words ‘Louis Vuitton’.  Ms Byrne’s evidence 52                Ms Byrne said that she sold second-hand and new items from her stall, primarily clothing, bags and accessories. On 14 or 15 February 2004 Mr Rosenlund spoke to her at the stall, saying that she had been caught selling fake Louis Vuitton goods. She said that she had stocked Louis Vuitton bags ‘a long time ago’ but did not do so any more. Mr Rosenlund showed her a letter which listed goods ‘supposedly sold at my stall’. He handed her a notice. He asked her to promise that she would not sell any fake goods again. She said that she had not sold any fake goods ‘or other stuff’. Mr Rosenlund showed her certain photographs which she said were not of her. He said that he still wanted her to promise that she would not sell any fake bags. She agreed. Mr Rosenlund said that the photographs had been taken on 11 January 2004. Ms Byrne said that she had not traded at the stall on that day. She was on holidays. The notice which he showed her was from Toea, addressed to stallholders at Carrara Market. It was headed ‘Sale of Counterfeit Items Prohibited’ and stated: ‘It has come to my attention that you are selling counterfeit items at Carrara Market bearing trademarks owned by Louis Vuitton Malletier SA.  You are hereby notified that the sale of counterfeit items is illegal and prohibited. If you are found selling counterfeit items at the Carrara Market, you will be forced to leave the Market grounds, your rent will be forfeited, and you will not be allowed to lease space at the Market in the future. This policy is effective immediately. If you have any questions, please see me.’ 53                On 21 September 2004 Mr Rosenlund gave Ms Byrne a newsletter dated 21 September 2004. It was headed ‘Copyright Infringements’ and was signed by him. It stated: ‘A new government organization has been established in 2004 to combat copyright theft with relation to the motion picture and television industry (see attached). The new Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft Organization is very active in this area and detection can carry huge fines and gaol. Copyright infringements are not only illegal, but reflect badly on any establishment allowing it. Any illegal trading at Carrara Markets is not only contrary to the law, but is also contrary to Carrara Markets “Licence to Occupy” agreements. Management will do whatever is necessary to ensure our business is not subject to law infringement.  Please be aware of, and report to management, any traders involving themselves in these types of activities, their business may be at stake.’ 54                In June or July 2005 Mr Rosenlund again spoke to Ms Byrne. He said that he had discovered that she had again been selling Louis Vuitton counterfeit products. She denied this allegation. He said that she should make sure that she never again had anything resembling a Louis Vuitton product at the stall or she would be at risk of losing the stall. He said that he had decided to ban Louis Vuitton products from being sold in the Market, whether they were originals or copies. She said that she would not sell Louis Vuitton products again.  55                In July 2005 Mr Rosenlund came to the stall and gave her a Carrara Markets memorandum dated 31 July 2005. I have previously set out the content of the relevant newsletter in connection with the case concerning Mr Alcock. It is exhibit GJA 7 to his affidavit. 56                Ms Byrne said that when she first sold items bearing the Louis Vuitton logo she was unaware that it was illegal to do so. She had seen the items sold in shops and by ‘many people’. She now understands that it is illegal to sell counterfeit products. Her new understanding has been derived from information supplied by Mr Rosenlund and from the various notices and newsletters.  Ruth Gallop Purchase of one handbag on 21 December 2003 57                On 21 December 2003 Mr Taylor attended the Market and went to the Gallop stall. He there saw a grey-haired lady of thin build who, he thought, was about 58-60 years of age. I infer that this was Ms Gallop. He saw a large travel bag and a scarf, each of which bore the applicant’s monogram trademark or a similar mark. He saw Ms Gallop sell two scarves and five or six cherry blossom handbags and wallets, each bearing the applicant’s monogram trademark or a similar mark. He heard the woman say to one of the customers: ‘Like I mean, why would you pay that kind of money when the copies are so good?’ 58                Mr Taylor left the stall and returned some time later. He heard a female customer inquire of Ms Gallop whether she had any Louis Vuitton men’s wallets. She replied ‘Look, they are just so hard to get. You bring in four boxes of them and Customs get two.’ The customer then left.  59                Mr Taylor saw a brown handbag bearing the applicant’s monogram trademark or a similar mark. He pointed to the handbag and asked Ms Gallop whether she had a wallet in the same brown colour. She said ‘Look I’ve got some more hidden. The inspector has been around and they’ll fine you up to $100,000. It’s highly illegal. Come over here, and I’ll show you.’ 60                Mr Taylor followed her to the next stall where another woman handed her two small handbags, both bearing the applicant’s monogram trademark or a similar mark. Ms Gallop showed the handbags to Mr Taylor and said that one was priced at $180 and the other at $125. He asked her as to the quality of the handbag priced at $125. She said ‘It’s so good it’s grade B.’ He purchased the handbag and paid $125 in cash. He asked for a receipt and the operator said ‘I’m sorry love, it’s highly illegal.’  61                At the rear of the stall he saw two “Multicolore” wallets, three scarves and three small handbags, each bearing the applicant’s monogram trademark or a similar mark. They were on a shelf beneath the counter and were not visible to him when he stood at the front of the stall.  Purchase of one scarf on 11 January 2004 62                On 11 January 2004 Ms Nguyen visited the Gallop stall. The woman operating the stall appeared to be in her late 50’s. She identified herself as “Ruth”. I infer that it was Ms Gallop. Ms Nguyen saw one large bag, one brown scarf and one black “Multicolore” scarf, all bearing one of the applicant’s trademarks or a similar mark. Ms Nguyen asked Ms Gallop whether she had any wallets or handbags. The woman then produced a medium sized handbag from under the table. It bore a Louis Vuitton trademark or a similar mark. Ruth said, ‘Only this one left, you know it’s very hard to get and I keep it under here because it’s highly illegal. They have inspectors come round you know.’ She said that the purchase price was $160 and that it was expensive because it was a new design. The brown ‘monogram’ design was always cheaper. She then said, ‘I’m selling these for people from Sydney, it’s so hard to get now. They x-ray everything at the airport, you can’t even get one bag in now. These are dinkies but this one is a copy because it has the lines across the fabric.’ Ms Nguyen asked the cost of Louis Vuitton scarves and was told that they were $35 each. Ruth said that apart from the products on display, she had no more Louis Vuitton stock. Ms Nguyen left the stall.  63                Later, Ms Nguyen returned to the Gallop stall and purchased the black “Multicolore” scarf which she had seen previously. It bore the applicant’s monogram trademark or a similar mark. She paid $35 in cash. The woman said, ‘This is a dinkem one for you’.Ms Nguyen said,‘So is it genuine?’ Ruth replied, ‘Well, I’m not allowed to say that because it’s not from the shop you know. But genuine to you okay. The brown Monogram scarf is a copy because there are lines across the material.’  64                Ms Nguyen asked for a receipt but was told, ‘Nobody records things at the markets, people with warehouses will give you a receipt but I don’t have any.’  Purchase of one scarf on 15 February 2004 65                On 11 January 2004 Mr Moes had seen Ms Nguyen purchase a scarf at the Gallop stall. On 15 February 2004 he again visited the Gallop stall and saw a woman whom he knew as Ruth. I infer that the woman was Ms Gallop. On this occasion three bags and three scarves were displayed on the counter, each bearing the applicant’s monogram trademark or a similar mark. Each was contained in a separate “Glad” zip lock bag. He saw Mr Rosenlund arrive at the stall and speak to Ruth but did not hear their conversation. He then asked Ms Gallop, ‘How much are the Louis Vuitton bags?’ Ms Gallop replied that they were $120 each and that the scarves were $35 each. She then said: ‘I shouldn’t be selling the Louis Vuitton bags or scarves because they are fakes. The markets may get closed down if I sell those products. The man that I was just talking to was the market manager. He told me not to get caught selling any fake merchandise. I told him that I would keep the merchandise under the counter and only sell it to people that ask for it.’   66                This evidence was not led as truth of the contents of the statement. 67                Mr Moes then purchased a scarf bearing the applicant’s monogram trademark or a similar mark and paid $35 in cash. Ms Gallop declined to give him a receipt. Purchase of one scarf on 24 April 2005 68                On 24 April 2005 Ms Nguyen again visited Ms Gallop’s stall. She saw one black “Epi” style wallet bearing the “LV” trademark or similar mark. The wallet was not clearly displayed, being partially hidden by two “Gucci” leather wallets. Ms Nguyen picked up the “Epi” style wallet and asked the price. Ms Gallop said that it was $75. She appeared to be uncomfortable that Ms Nguyen was holding the wallet openly in public. She then said, ‘This is a Louis Vuitton. It is illegal. I can’t get them anymore.’ She also said, ‘I’ve got another one, but it’s cheap, it’s grey, not as good quality as that one (indicating the black “Epi” wallet). You won’t like it, you look fussy.’ Ms Nguyen replied, ‘That’s alright, just show me anyway.’ 69                Ms Gallop went behind the table and, from a plastic bag, took out a grey “Vernis” men’s wallet bearing the “LV” trademark and one or more of the applicant’s “flower” trademarks or similar marks. She said that the price was $25. Ms Nguyen compared the two and said that she would purchase the Louis Vuitton “Epi” wallet. She paid $75 for it but did not receive a receipt. 70                Thereafter, Ms Gallop and Ms Nguyen had a general conversation during which Ms Nguyen said, ‘I think I’ve bought stuff from you before, but I haven’t been to the markets in ages. It’s Ruth isn’t it?’  71                Ms Gallop replied ‘Yes, I think I remember you. It was ages ago.’ As she was about to leave, Ms Gallop said to Ms Nguyen: ‘Let me know if you want anything else. I could tell you who you can get it from, you know.’ Purchase of one wallet on 8 May 2005 72                On 8 May 2005 Ms Crystal Taylor went to the Gallop stall where she spoke to Ms Gallop. She saw various items bearing brand names and asked Ms Gallop if she had other brands. Ms Gallop said, ‘Well I used to sell Louis Vuitton, but it is not worth it. This Gucci wallet is much better quality.’ Ms Taylor then said, ‘So you haven’t got any Louis Vuitton at all?’ Ms Gallop replied, ‘You know, I don’t sell it any more.’ Ms Taylor said, ‘I was just looking for a lovely gift for my Mum. She has got a Louis Vuitton bag. I was hoping you would have something like a purse to match.’ Ms Gallop said, ‘Well I have only a Louis Vuitton men’s wallet, and they are not for ladies.’ Ms Taylor said, ‘Well, can I have a look at one?’ and Ruth said, ‘Okay. Come with me.’ They went behind the counter and Ms Taylor there saw Ms Gallop open a sliding door in a wooden cabinet. There were about seven items in the cabinet, each separately wrapped in yellow paper bearing the applicant’s “LV” and “Louis Vuitton” trademarks or similar marks with a layer of clear plastic wrapped around it. Ms Gallop removed an item and unwrapped it. It was a wallet bearing the applicant’s monogram trademark or a similar mark. She said, ‘Now I don’t like selling these. They get me into so much trouble. They’re just not worth it at all. They’re copies. You know I’ve got fined for these before. They’re the last ones. There was this one Asian lady who was very nice and she insisted “LV”, like you, and I sold it to her and I was photographed and sued for so much money. You know, about $450,000 for one wallet. She doesn’t know how much it affects people. But if your mum has a bag, this should be a good gift for her.’ 73                Ms Taylor said, ‘Yes that’s nice. That’s just like her bag. How much are they?’ Ms Gallop said, ‘They’re $85.’ Ms Taylor said, ‘Well that’s a good deal. I’ll get one.’ Ms Gallop said, ‘Okay, well here it is.’ Ms Taylor said, ‘Thanks.’ Ms Gallop then enquired whether she might be interested in ‘another Louis Vuitton gift’. She produced two watches, both bearing the “LV” trademark or a similar mark and the applicant’s “flower” mark or a similar mark. One watch was blue and the other, brown. She said, ‘I’ve also got these lovely watches too. Both are Louis Vuitton. One is brown and one is blue. They are $35 each.’ Ms Taylor said, ‘Okay, well I will just go and check my bank and if I have enough money I’ll come back for one of the watches. What was your name?’ Ms Gallop said, ‘Ruth. Well I have taken a good look at you. So I’ll remember you if you want a watch.’ Ms Taylor said, ‘Ok, Ruth. Thanks very much.’ The wallet was given to her in a dust bag which also bore the “LV” logo or a similar mark. Ms Gallop’s evidence 74                In evidence, Ms Gallop said that she rented the stall on a casual basis. She is considered to be a long-term stallholder. She is about 70 years of age and supplements her pension from the income from the stall, primarily selling clothing and accessories. For the last few years she has sold mainly American Indian products: t-shirts, bandanas and wallets. During her time at the Market, she had seen the documents entitled ‘Carrara Market Stall Information’ and ‘Conditions of Renting a Stall’. She could not remember when she received them. Those documents contain no particular reference to trading in illegal goods, although there is a statement that, ‘Products not described to the booking officer at the time of booking may not be allowed to be sold on the day.’ 75                On 15 February 2004 Mr Rosenlund spoke to her at her stall. He said that she had been caught selling copies of Louis Vuitton goods. She said that she had no fake Louis Vuitton goods. He showed her some documents, including photographs of her at the stall, selling to customers. He said that selling counterfeit goods at the Market was illegal and that she could not do so. He then gave her a copy of a notice which he said had been sent to him by the applicant’s solicitors. He had been asked to pass it on to her. He asked her to read it. She did so. He then asked for an assurance that she would not, again, sell counterfeit Louis Vuitton products from her stall. He said that he would be checking on her from time to time. He was forceful in his manner. He then said, ‘Don’t let us catch you again.’ She said that it wouldn’t happen again. The documents which he showed to her contained details of trap purchases made on 21 December 2003 and 11 January 2004, together with photographs and a notice concerning the sale of counterfeit items. On 21 September 2004, she received a newsletter bearing that date which referred to the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft.  76                On 7 or 8 May 2005 Mr Edmondson spoke to her, telling her about a letter which Mr Rosenlund had received from the solicitors for the applicant. He showed her details of observations made of her stall on 24 April 2005 at which time one wallet was purchased. Mr Edmondson asked her to remove any products which infringed Louis Vuitton trademark. He said that Mr Rosenlund wanted any illegal products to be removed from the Market site altogether, and that she could not sell those items at the Market. He said that the sale of counterfeit goods was against Market policy and that if she sold such goods, it would affect her ability to continue holding the stall. 77                On 15 May 2005 Mr Rosenlund spoke to her. He appeared angry and spoke harshly to her. He said that a Louis Vuitton investigator had caught her selling a fake Louis Vuitton wallet even after she had promised him that she would not deal in such products, and that he was disappointed with her. He said that the investigator had seen another fake Louis Vuitton wallet for sale on the stall. Ms Gallop was embarrassed as she had previously told Mr Rosenlund that she would not sell those products. She then swore that she would not, again, sell counterfeit products. Mr Rosenlund said that if she did, he would see that she was thrown out of the Market for good. 78                On 31 July 2005 Mr Rosenlund again spoke to her, giving her a letter dated 28 July 2005 which he asked her to read. The “letter” was the report of two investigators who had attended at her stall on 19 June 2005 and seen a Louis Vuitton bag there. She said that this was the personal property of a lady called “Elizabeth” who had a stall behind her stall. It was an original Louis Vuitton bag. The tag attached to it was a travel tag not a price tag. The letter also alleged that the private investigator had asked her about Louis Vuitton products and that she had replied: ‘no, I’m all sold out sweetie, see me next time.’ Mr Gallop said this was just a ‘throw away line’. Mr Rosenlund forcefully told her to make sure that she never again had any counterfeit goods for sale.  79                In July 2005 a staff member from the Market gave her a copy of the newsletter dated 31 July which mentioned Federal Court proceedings. In August 2005 she received a newsletter dated August 2005 which dealt with rental and other matters. The only reference to goods being sold was to ‘product additions’. This seems to have referred to products the sale of which had not been previously approved by Market management. Other trap purchases 80                Apart from the items already discussed, various other items were purchased from other stallholders at the Market. They and the relevant stalls are identified in pars 106 and 109 of the applicant’s written submissions as follows:  ·                 one brown Monogram canvas handbag – purchased at Stall 54 (“Pam”); ·                 one pink cherry blossom wallet – purchased from Irene, “Vaquer Qld Women’s Fashions Queensland”; ·                 one pink cherry blossom cap - purchased from stall next to “Funky Fones” stall; ·                 two black Multicolore mobile phone covers - purchased from “Funky Fones” stall; ·                 one pink mobile phone neck strap – purchased from “Funky Fones” stall;  ·                 one white mobile phone neck strap – purchased from “Funky Fones” stall; ·                 one mobile phone cover – purchased from “Funky Fones” stall; and ·                 one shoulder bag – purchased from Barbara Maskiell’s stall. Identification of counterfeit goods 81                Mr Bombardi or Mr Pichon are employees of the applicant, having specialist knowledge as to the manufacture and design of its products. One or other of them examined each of the items purchased and concluded that all were counterfeit. I do not understand their opinions to be challenged. I also do not understand there to be any challenge to the assertion that in those circumstances, each sale infringed one or more of the applicant’s trademarks. Mr Taylor  82                Mr Taylor seems to have been the applicant’s principal investigating agent. Prior to 2 March 2003 he had dealt with Mr Rosenlund concerning the sale of counterfeit sunglasses at the Market. Mr Rosenlund appears to have been helpful to Mr Taylor in that matter. That is of no particular relevance for present purposes. Mr Taylor visited the Market on 2 March 2003 in order to detect any infringement of the applicant’s trademarks. He noticed goods bearing such trademarks or similar marks at the Alcock stall, the Byrne stall and a stall operated by Paul Osmond, a person with whom Mr Taylor had had dealings in connection with sunglasses. On 6 April 2003 Mr Taylor attended at the Market with Mr Edmonds and made trap purchases at the Alcock and Byrne stalls. Mr Taylor served a warning notice on Mr Alcock. 83                On 21 December 2003 Mr Taylor observed, at the Gallop stall, products on sale which appeared to bear the applicant’s monogram trademark or a similar mark. He saw a woman sell two scarves and five or six handbags and wallets bearing that mark. He heard the woman say to one of the customers, ‘Like I mean, why would you pay that kind of money when the copies are so good.’ He also saw other goods bearing Louis Vuitton trademarks or similar marks. Later in the day he resumed his surveillance of the Gallop stall. His observations and actions have been set out in the section of these reasons dealing with Ms Gallop. He also visited the Alcock stall where he saw various items on display which bore the applicant’s trademarks or similar marks. He subsequently asked Mr Moes to visit the stall and make a trap purchase. 84                On 11 January 2004 Mr Taylor visited the Market with Ms Nguyen and Mr Moes. He told them to undertake surveillance of stalls. He waited outside the Market. He subsequently met Ms Nguyen and Mr Moes and then visited various stalls at the Market to serve warning notices on behalf of the applicant. He visited stall 54, which was next to the Gallop stall. He there saw two large “Multicolore” handbags bearing the applicant’s monogram trademark or a similar mark. Two women were operating the stall, one of whom had been at the Gallop stall on 21 December 2003, but was not the woman who had served him. He served a letter on her, told her that it was illegal to sell counterfeit Louis Vuitton products, that she must cease selling and displaying those products immediately and contact the applicant’s solicitor. She replied, ‘Is that so? I really didn’t know.’  85                Mr Taylor then went to the Gallop stall where he recognized the woman who had served him on the previous occasion. I infer that this was Ms Gallop. He saw a scarf bearing the applicant’s monogram trademark or a similar mark. The woman tried to cover it with another product. He gave her a letter concerning her alleged dealings in counterfeit Louis Vuitton products. He also saw two small boxes behind the counter, each bearing the words “Louis Vuitton”. The woman said, ‘I don’t have anything else. I only have this one. I didn’t sell any bags.’ Mr Taylor said to her, ‘Before Christmas you sold me a bag for $125 which is counterfeit, an illegal copy. Now Louis Vuitton’s lawyers will take action. I suggest you respond to the warning letter.’ He then left the stall.  86                On the same day he visited the Byrne stall where he saw two women who appeared to be of Philippine origin. He saw three cherry blossom clutch handbags and two monogram-style clutch handbags, each bearing one or more of the applicant’s “flower” trademarks or similar marks, as well as the initials “IX”. He also saw a wallet which bore the applicant’s “Damier” trademark or a similar mark. He said to that woman, ‘Are you Linda?’ The woman replied, ‘No.’ The other woman working at the stall said ‘Hello, I’m Eva. Linda is in the Philippines.’ He then said that counterfeit Louis Vuitton products were being sold from the stall and that this conduct infringed the applicant’s trademarks. He served a letter of demand on her and saw her remove the offending products and hide them from view.  87                On the same day Mr Taylor visited the Alcock stall where he saw on display three wallets, three cherry blossom-style bags and two handbags, each bearing one or other of the applicant’s “flower” trademarks or similar marks and the initials “IX”. He handed a letter of demand to Mr Alcock who replied, ‘They have “IX” not “LV”. Mr Taylor said, ‘The products still bear marks that are individually registered as trademarks by Louis Vuitton. The four petal flower shown on your products is one of the trademarks individually registered by Louis Vuitton.’ Mr Alcock replied, ‘Let’s trade, I know where you can get heaps of them, there’s a shop full of them.’ Mr Taylor said, ‘I am in no position to do a deal with you. You have been caught and I suggest you call Kadri Elcoat at Corrs Chambers Westgarth and discuss it with her.’ He then left the stall. 88                On the same day he went to stall 214 where he spoke to a woman called Irene Nazari. He saw a bag lying on the table. It bore the applicant’s “flower” trademark or a similar mark as well as the initials “IX”. He served a warning notice on her and told her to contact the applicant’s solicitors. She gave him the Louis Vuitton bag displayed on the table. She also said that over Christmas, she had purchased two such bags and two wallets at the Melbourne markets.  89                Mr Taylor next visited the Market on 17 January 2004. At the Alcock stall he saw four wallets and four handbags bearing the applicant’s “flower” trademark or a similar mark. Mr Alcock appeared to recognize him. Whilst Mr Taylor was looking at products bearing the applicant’s trademark, Mr Alcock said, ‘Well I have to sell them or I’ll lose money.’ Mr Taylor then went to the Byrne stall. He did not see Linda Byrne, nor did he see any products which he regarded as infringing the applicant’s trademark. However, as it was raining, there was a plastic sheet covering part of the product display. He then went to the Gallop stall where he saw a cherry blossom-style handbag which bore one or other of the applicant’s “flower” trademarks or a similar mark. It was about 30 cm in length.  90                Mr Taylor then went to the office, intending to speak to Mr Rosenlund. He was told that he was not there or that he was unavailable. Mr Taylor introduced himself to another man, saying that he was attending on behalf of the applicant. He said that for over a year, there had been problems with stallholders selling counterfeit goods. He also said that he had warned a number of stallholders and had served warning letters in the course of the preceding week. The man replied, ‘You didn’t tell us you were here.’ Mr Taylor said, ‘No, but today the lawyers have set everything out clearly so you can see.’ He then handed a letter and attachments to the man and asked that he pass them on to Mr Rosenlund. The man said that he would do so. Mr Taylor then said, ‘If you want to see the problem I am happy to show you on stall 55.’ The man said, ‘I will pass it on.’ The letter was dated 15 January 2004. Mr Taylor said that he then saw Mr Rosenlund in an inner office and formed the impression that Mr Rosenlund had been listening to the conversation. 91                Mr Taylor visited the Market again on 12 December 2004. On this occasion he was accompanied by Ms Taylor. He took Ms Taylor to the Byrne stall and told her to make a trap purchase of a product bearing the applicant’s trademark. He saw Ms Taylor speak to a woman at the stall whom he knew to be Linda Byrne. They walked to the back of the stall. He was unable to see what happened thereafter. On the same day he took Ms Taylor to the Alcock stall and told her to make a trap purchase. He subsequently met her in the car park.  92                On 24 April 2005 he visited the Market with Ms Nguyen and Mr Moes. At about 11.30 am he went to the Alcock stall where he saw a blonde woman serving customers. He said, ‘I have a letter from Louis Vuitton here, because there was a complaint that yesterday you displayed and sold counterfeit Louis Vuitton thongs.’ The lady replied, ‘They weren’t mine, they were someone else’s. I didn’t want to sell them.’ Mr Taylor then said, ‘You are Gary’s wife aren’t you?’, apparently referring to Mr Alcock. The woman replied, ‘Yes’. Mr Taylor then said, ‘Gary knows about this, he has been warned before. If you continue to sell these counterfeits, it will end up in court.’ He then handed a warning letter to Ms Alcock. As he was leaving the stall Mr Alcock called to him from a nearby shoe stall, asking if he wanted to buy some shoes.  93                Later that day he went to the Gallop stall where he saw Ms Gallop and said to her, ‘I have a warning letter here from Louis Vuitton in respect of counterfeit Louis Vuitton handbags.’ She replied, ‘I don’t have any Louis Vuitton.’ Mr Taylor said, ‘You had a counterfeit Louis Vuitton Epi bag on display earlier.’ She said, ‘No Louis Vuitton.’ He said, ‘Epi, a black Epi.’ She said, ‘What’s Epi?’ Mr Taylor said, ‘You should read this, you’ve been warned before.’ He then handed her the warning letter. 94                At the next stall, “Funky Fones”, he saw four telephone covers, each bearing the applicant’s “LV” trademark and its “flower” trademark or similar marks. He picked up one of these covers and took it to a man at the counter who was wearing a brown, bucket-shaped hat bearing the applicant’s monogram trademark or a similar mark. He placed the cover on the table. The man said, ‘Ten dollars’. Mr Taylor said, ‘I don’t want to buy it. I have a letter for you. It is illegal to sell Louis Vuitton copies.’ The man said, ‘I’m even wearing one on my head’ and laughed. Mr Taylor said, ‘Are you the boss?’ He replied, ‘No.’ Mr Taylor said, ‘What is your name?’ He said, ‘Bill’. Mr Taylor handed him a warning notice saying, ‘Give the letter to your boss.’ The man said, ‘Yeah, ok.’  95                Mr Taylor then went to an unnumbered stall next to the “Funky Fones” stall. He there saw two bucket-shaped hats on display, both bearing the applicant’s monogram trademark or a similar mark. He approached a Caucasian man who appeared to be operating the stall and handed him a warning letter. He asked the man whether he was in charge of the stall. The man said that he worked there. Mr Taylor then said, ‘It’s illegal to sell counterfeit Louis Vuitton caps.’ The man said, ‘I only work here.’ Mr Taylor said, ‘It doesn’t matter. They can not be displayed for sale.’ The man ignored him and straightened the hats on the table. Mr Taylor asked for the stall number. The man said, ‘Don’t know.’ Mr Taylor asked the business name of the stall. The man said, ‘No idea.’ Mr Taylor then asked for his boss’s name. He replied, ‘I don’t know’. Mr Taylor said, ‘Are you working here for nothing?’. The man said, ‘No, James pays me.’ Mr Taylor then left the stall.  Other witnesses for the applicant 96                There was other evidence from solicitors, private inquiry agents and employees of the applicant. It is necessary only to refer in detail to the evidence of one of them. Amy Rose Stead is a licensed security guard, who attended at the Market on 19 June 2005 with Mr Moes. On that date she purchased a mobile telephone cover at the Funky Fones stall. The salesman refused to give her a receipt. She and Mr Moes then went to stall 210 where two women, Ms Barbara Maskiell and her assistant “Sandy” met them. She did not see any Louis Vuitton products but did see other “designer” brand products. She asked if they had any Louis Vuitton stock. Ms Maskiell said, ‘No’. Sandy then said to Ms Maskiell, ‘They are all right. They’ve been in the shop.’ Ms Maskiell said, ‘That’s right, I remember now.’ She then produced, from under the table, a shoulder bag bearing Louis Vuitton trademarks, including the “LV” letters or similar marks and said, ‘I have this one and it is my last one I have here. It was $225 and I put it down to $150, but as it’s the last one you can have it for $90.’ Mr Moes said that he would purchase the bag on his credit card. She put it into a light brown dust bag marked ‘Louis Vuitton Mallatier a Paris’ and then into a white plastic bag. Ms Maskiell gave Mr Moes a receipt, presumably a credit card voucher. 97                On that day, Mr Moes and Ms Stead also went to a stall kept by a woman known as Ruth, presumably Ms Gallop. They did not purchase anything but, at a later stage, Ms Stead asked her if she had any Louis Vuitton bags for sale. Ms Gallop said, ‘No, I’m all sold out Sweetie. See me next time.’ As I have said, Ms Gallop described this as a “throw away” line. 98                On 18 April 2005, on instructions from Mr Moes, Ms Stead telephoned the Market and spoke to a man named “Noel”. She asked about setting up a casual stall at the Market on Sunday 24 April 2005. Noel said that she could do so and asked for her name and the type of goods she wished to sell. She said that she would like to sell telephone covers, computer stuff and sunglasses.’ Noel said, ‘Sorry, no sunglasses. We have too many, thousands.’ She asked if there was any way at all that she could sell sunglasses and he said, ‘No way and it doesn’t matter how much you suck up to me I will not allow it.’  99                Subsequently, she telephoned again, referring to her earlier telephone conversation. She said it would be ‘fine’ if she could just sell telephone covers and computer equipment. Noel said that he had booked a casual stall for her and that she should arrive at about 6.00 am to set up by 7.00 am. She should see a man called “Dave”. On 24 April 2005 Ms Stead arrived at the Market at about 6.15 am, accompanied by her flat-mate. She spoke to a lady at the window of a small office near the automatic teller machine. The woman said that her name was Jo. She asked what Ms Stead would be selling. She said, ‘Mobile phone covers, some computer stuff and little bits and pieces.’ Jo did not ask to see her products. Ms Stead paid $38.50 for the rental of the stall and received a receipt. Shortly afterwards she met a man called Dave who took her to her stall. He asked if she would be selling new or second-hand goods. She said, ‘I’ll just be selling new bits and pieces.’ Dave said, ‘I’ll be back later to have a look at what you ladies are selling.’ He then departed. Ms Stead did not see him again whilst she was at the Market on that day. 100            Later in the day a man came to her stall and served a warning notice on behalf of the Anti-Counterfeiting Action Group. The notice alleged that she had been selling ‘merchandise bearing trade marks that are substantially identical with or misleadingly, deceptively or confusingly similar to trade marks owned by the ACAG members …’. She said that other stallholders looked puzzled. She then went to the office and spoke to Jo, telling her, ‘I just got this, what is it for?’ She looked at it and said, ‘I’ve never seen this notice before. It must be something off the Internet. Who gave it to you?’ Ms Stead replied, ‘Some guy walked past my stall and dropped it on my table and said to read it yet didn’t give it to anyone else.’ Jo asked, ‘What were you selling?’ Ms Stead replied, ‘Mobile phone covers, computer ‘stuff’ and bits and pieces.’ Jo said, ‘Oh don’t worry about it. I don’t know who the hell he was. If it was serious he would have come to us first to get your name and address but we don’t have any names and it’s your first time here.’ Jo then looked at the notice again and read out the words, ‘You have been identified as selling trademark goods.’ Ms Stead said, ‘I’m confused.’ Jo said, ‘If you just have phone covers and little bits and pieces, ahh, don’t worry, forget about it, its nothing.’ A man standing nearby then said, ‘Mate don’t worry about it, its just some guy being an idiot.’ Jo agreed. The three of them then had a conversation in which Jo said a number of times, ‘It’s fine. It’s someone being stupid. Just ignore it.’  101            The woman named Jo was Ms Cochrane who gave evidence for the respondents. Her version of the conversation is a little different from that set out above. The applicant seems to suggest that I should draw some inference adverse to the respondents from this conversation. I am unable to do so, quite apart from the question of conflicting evidence. 102            Ms Stead and Mr Moes visited the Market again on 7 May 2005. Mr Moes took her to the “Funky Fones” stall. She saw two telephone covers bearing the applicant’s “LV” trademark and one of its “flower” trademarks, or similar marks and two neck straps bearing the “LV” trademark or a similar mark. She purchased one of the telephone covers and one of the neck straps, tendering a $50 note. She received $30 in change. She asked for a receipt. The woman said that she did not have any receipts. Mr Rosenlund 103            The applicant’s case is, in effect, that the respondents “joined in” the stallholders’ infringements of its trademarks and so also infringed. The conduct said to implicate the respondents is that: ·                 Mr Rosenlund’s attention had, over a number of years, been drawn to the offending conduct; and ·                 the respondents as land owners had taken no effective steps to stop such conduct but, by act or omission, had tacitly accepted it. (See pars 1 and 2 of the applicant’s outline of submissions.) 104            It is said that “illegal sales” were drawn to Mr Rosenlund’s attention on various occasions particularized in the applicant’s outline (par 114) as follows (including references to the evidence): ‘(a) 15 December 1998 – affidavit Ken Taylor at [12]; (b) 6 December 2002 – affidavit Ken Taylor at [19]; (c) 3 July 2003 – affidavit Ken Taylor at [24]; (d) 15 January 2004 – Exhibit JMR-12 to the affidavit of Rosenlund; Applicant’s Notice to Admit Facts at [13] and [14]; (e) 23 February 2004 – Exhibit JMR-23 to the affidavit of Rosenlund; Applicant’s Notice to Admit Facts at [17] and [18]; (f) 10 February 2005 – Exhibit JMR-25 to the affidavit of Rosenlund; Applicant’s Notice to Admit Facts at [19] and []; (g) 5 May 2005 – Exhibit JMR-28 to the affidavit of Rosenlund; This notice was also sent to the company secretary; Applicant’s Notice to Admit Facts at [21] and [22].’ 105            The dealings on 15 December 1998 and 6 December 2002 did not concern the applicant’s products. They primarily concerned the sale of counterfeit sunglasses, particularly by a Mr Osmond. However the letter of 3 July 2003, whilst mainly concerned with sunglasses, also referred to other counterfeit products, including counterfeit copies of the applicant’s products. The letter recorded observations made on visits to the Market on 7 December 2002, 2 March 2003 and 29 June 2003. Counterfeit copies of the applicant’s products were seen on the first and second visits. After the second visit, the applicant’s solicitors sent a “cease and desist” letter to one or more of the infringing stallholders. It seems that on the third visit, no counterfeit copies of the applicant’s products were detected. 106            Mr Rosenlund did not have a detailed recollection of the events involving Mr Osmond to which Mr Taylor referred in his evidence. However he said that on occasions, persons had sought his assistance in requesting stallholders to stop selling counterfeit goods. His approach was to discuss the matter with the stallholder in question, confirm the illegality, and pass on any warning notice issued by the relevant trademark holder or manufacturer. On occasions he had indicated that unless the stallholder stopped selling offending products, he or she might be excluded from the Market. He claimed that the Market and its staff had always co-operated with the representatives of the owners of trademarks when asked to do so. He said that it was impossible for management and staff to have the expertise necessary to identify counterfeit products amongst the hundreds of products at the Market. It is difficult to disagree with this view.  107            On 15 January 2004, following trap purchases on 21 December 2003 and 11 January 2004, the applicant’s solicitors wrote to Toea, complaining about the sale of counterfeit goods at the Market. Offending stallholders were Ms Gallop, Ms Byrne, Mr Alcock, “Pam”, Irene Nazari and the stallholder of stall 47. Mr Rosenlund said that prior to that letter, he was not aware of any trade in counterfeit Louis Vuitton goods at the Market. This seems to overlook the letter of 3 July 2003. However it may be that Mr Rosenlund had treated the absence of infringing products on 29 June 2003 as demonstrating that the problem had been resolved and forgotten about it. 108            On 14 or 15 February 2004 he visited the six stallholders named in the letter of 15 January, telling them that they could not sell illegal products at the Market. In the course of doing so he encountered Mr Moes and was handed a letter dated 14 February 2004 from the solicitors for the applicant. This was a “follow up” letter, pointing out that there had been no reply to the letter of 15 January 2004 and asserting that infringement was continuing. Mr Rosenlund replied by letter dated 15 February 2004 saying, ‘All six stallholders mentioned have now been visited and four of them removed all offending products while the other two will remove them today (Sunday 15 February). They have been given the appropriate letter. All assure me that these products will not be sold in future.’  109            In a letter dated 23 February 2004 the applicant’s solicitors advised of events which had occurred on a further visit by the applicant’s agents on 15 February 2004. It was said that Ms Gallop had asserted that Mr Rosenlund had said to her that she should not get caught selling any fake merchandise. The applicant apparently invites the inference that this indicated a willingness to permit such sales provided that she was not caught. I am not sure that it would be fair to draw that inference but, in any event, Mr Rosenlund denies the statement. There is no admissible evidence establishing that such statement was made. In the letter, it was also asserted that Mr Moes had heard Mr Alcock say to Mr Rosenlund, ‘There you go. That’s another one sold. I only have two for sale now.’ According to Mr Moes, this was a reference to a sale to him of a product bearing Louis Vuitton marks or similar marks. Mr Rosenlund did not deny that such a remark was made, but denied that at the time, he was aware that any such sale had occurred. He claimed that in that conversation, he also said to Mr Alcock, concerning counterfeit goods, ‘Gary you can’t sell them and that’s all there is to it.’ In the letter of 23 February 2004 the solicitors also advised that agents had detected counterfeit goods and made trap purchases during the visit on 15 February. 110            On 10 February 2005 the solicitors again wrote to Mr Rosenlund asserting that: ‘Ongoing surveillance of your market by our client’s investigators has revealed that stall holders are still selling counterfeit goods that infringe our client’s rights. You may be interested to know that we are receiving active co-operation from other market proprietors who have agreed to the program specified in the attached Deed of Co-Operation (Deed). We now seek your co-operation to the program by signing and returning to us the Deed within 14 days of 10 February 2005.  As you can see from the Deed, our client is more than willing to work with you to eradicate the illegal conduct being carried out at your premises. However, while our client seeks your co-operation, it remains firmly committed to resolving the ongoing problem of illegal dealings in counterfeit goods at your market.’ 111            The applicant and Toea were to be parties to the attached draft deed. Pursuant to it, the applicant was to notify the landlord of any stallholder whom it detected in offering infringing products for sale. It was also to make reasonable endeavours to assist Toea to identify infringing products. Toea’s proposed obligations were to: ·                 give warning notices to all stallholders in a form prescribed by the applicant, stating that any stallholder found selling infringing products would be expelled from the Market;  ·                 on a regular basis, inspect the Market for infringing products, and at least once every two months; ·                 notify the applicant if it became aware of, or suspected any sales of infringing products by stallholders, providing full details; ·                 expel any stallholder who had been given a copy of the warning notice and was subsequently identified by the applicant as selling infringing products; ·                 permit inspection by the applicant’s investigators; ·                 permit such investigators to carry out ad hoc awareness programmes aimed at stallholders and Market employees; and ·                 use its best endeavours to prevent infringement.  112            Mr Rosenlund considered that it would have been difficult or impossible for Toea to comply with the clauses relating to the expulsion of stallholders who infringed trademarks. He also considered that employees did not have the experience or expertise necessary in order to recognize counterfeit products or to confirm that a product was counterfeit even if a representative of the applicant so asserted. Mr Rosenlund was also concerned that the deed might oblige him to expel a tenant who had been a good tenant for many years and whose livelihood was at stake. The decision of White J in Sun Valley Dried Fruit Pty Ltd v Toea & Rosenlund (BS 9418/2004) caused at least part of Mr Rosenlund’s concern. In that case, Sun Valley had sought to restrain Toea from terminating a licence to occupy and applied for an interlocutory injunction pending trial. The decision concerned only the application for interlocutory relief and is not authority for any particular view of the nature of the relationship between Toea and stallholders. Nonetheless it demonstrates the difficulties inherent in terminating such an arrangement. One can well understand that Mr Rosenlund might feel that it would be unwise to commit Toea to immediate expulsion of a stallholder if he was not sure that it would be able to honour such a commitment. It might also be thought somewhat harsh that Toea should be obliged to act upon the applicant’s opinion as to whether there had been an infringement, rather than upon its own view of the matter, and that it should retain no discretion to consider other circumstances in deciding how to deal with a particular infringement.  113            On Saturday 26 February and Sunday 27 February 2005, Mr Rosenlund and two members of his staff walked around the Market in order to see whether any Louis Vuitton products were being sold. They found none. On 3 March 2005 Mr Rosenlund wrote to the solicitors, saying that he would not sign the deed of co-operation and outlining the steps which he had taken on the previous weekend to detect any further infringements. He indicated that he would continue to take these steps.  114            On 5 May 2005 the solicitors for the applicant again wrote to Mr Rosenlund. They set out the previous history of dealings between the parties and asserted that Ms Gallop and Mr Alcock had again, on 11 February 2004, 17 February 2004 and 24 April 2005, been found selling infringing goods. The solicitors indicated that they considered that Mr Rosenlund was not co-operating with the applicant and continued: ‘Your company’s conduct in allowing stall-holders at Carrara Market to deal in Infringing Goods is likely to constitute an involvement by your company, and its officers, as joint tortfeasor with those stall-holders of infringement of the Louis Vuitton trademark.  Our client has previously indicated in our letter dated 15 January 2004, and in a Deed of Co-operation that was sent to you on 10 February 2005, that it is more than willing to work with your company to prevent the unlawful sale of Infringing Goods that is being carried on at Carrara Market. However, in your letter dated 3 March 2005, your company declined to sign our Deed of Co-operation. We understand from your letter dated 3 March 2005, that so-called “permanent stalls” may have been bought for $50,000, while the Carrara website states that casual stall-holders pay $38.50 to hire for a stall for one day. Clearly, your company is obtaining significant financial benefits from stall-holders at Carrara Market. In our client’s view, given your company’s control over the Carrara Market, it appears that your company is sanctioning and also benefiting financially from stall-holders that sell Infringing Goods.  Our client considers that the only measures that will be adequate to prevent the ongoing infringements at Carrara Market are to take appropriate action against the stall-holders identified in Schedule C to G. Accordingly, our client demands that your company: (a) expel any casual stall-holders identified in Schedule C to G from the Carrara Market by 4 pm on Sunday 8 May 2005 and prohibit them from hiring casual stalls at Carrara Market in the future; (b) take whatever steps that you are legally able to in order to stop “permanent stall-holders” identified in Schedule C to G from selling Infringing Goods at the Carrara Market, which may mean giving reasonable notice to them that you will evict them within one month for breach of the terms on which they hold a permanent stall; and (c) inform us by 4.00 pm on Friday 12 May of compliance with the demands contained in this letter. If these demands are not fully satisfied by the dates referred to, we expect that our client will commence Federal Court proceedings against your company and any relevant officers of your company (including but not limited to directors and employees personally involved) without further notice. In any such Federal Court proceedings our client will seek both interlocutory and permanent injunctions against your company, damages or an account of profits, and its costs.’ 115            Mr Rosenlund instructed Mr Edmondson to speak to the relevant stallholders, telling them not to sell counterfeit Louis Vuitton products and that further infringement could affect their capacity to hold their stalls. On the next weekend he also visited those stallholders. Details of these visits appear in the evidence of the various stallholders. After receiving the statement of claim in these proceedings Mr Rosenlund spoke to Ms Byrne. She had not been mentioned in the letter of 5 May 2005. He warned her that if she was again caught selling Louis Vuitton products, she would be expelled. She denied that she had been doing so.  116            Upon receiving affidavits concerning the Funky Fones stall, he told the stallholder that he was, under no circumstances, to sell any Louis Vuitton products. The stallholder denied having done so and said that he would not be doing so in the future. Mr Rosenlund dealt similarly with Ms Maskiell. She admitted having possessed one Louis Vuitton bag which she had produced to the applicant’s agent. She undertook that she would not, in the future, bring any such products to the Market. Mr Rosenlund also spoke to Ms Gallop. I have already outlined that conversation. 117            During the week prior to 30 July 2005, Mr Rosenlund telephoned a friend, Ms Melissa Leak and asked her to visit the Market on the following weekend to see whether there were any Louis Vuitton goods on sale, particularly at the Alcock, Byrne, Gallop and Funky Fones stalls. Mr Rosenlund understood that on Saturday 30 July 2005 she attended at the Market. She subsequently reported that she had not located any such goods. At each of the specified stalls she asked for Louis Vuitton products and was told that there was none. In this context, the reference to Louis Vuitton products seems to have included counterfeit products. 118            Since September 2005 Mr Rosenlund has prohibited the sale of any Louis Vuitton products or “look-alike” products. This policy was motivated by the fact that it was impossible for his staff to determine whether or not a particular product was authentic. Some stallholders were concerned at being asked by customers if they had Louis Vuitton products. One stallholder erected a sign saying that he or she had none and requesting customers not to ask for them. Since September 2005 new stallholders have been specifically asked whether Louis Vuitton products are to be sold. It is made clear that they are not to sell them, and that bookings will not be taken if they intend to do so. A similar procedure is adopted when casual stallholders arrive on Saturday mornings.  119            Much of the cross-examination of Mr Rosenlund was designed to establish that he conducted the Market with the aim of maximizing the return to Toea. It would be surprising if it were otherwise. No doubt he tries to create an environment in which access and parking are easy, the range of stalls is extensive and entertainment and refreshments are available. I infer that he expects and demands co-operation from stallholders in creating this environment. They do so in connection with parking, honouring vouchers and being open at fixed times. There are no doubt many other areas in which co-operation is necessary. 120            Mr Rosenlund said in cross-examination that some casual stallholders had not returned to the Market after he had spoken to them about selling counterfeit goods. It is fair to say that in his cross-examination Mr Rosenlund indicated a fairly merciful approach towards some infringing stallholders, based upon their long associations with the Market and their financial positions. For example, concerning Linda Byrne who was caught selling counterfeit goods in December 2004 and May 2005, he said: ‘When we got the second letter, the first letter of 15 January 2004 was the one with all the trap purchases in the photos. The second letter I got from Corrs Chambers about Louis Vuitton was one asking me to sign an undertaking. The third one was in May this year which listed some more photos and five stallholders. Now, Linda wasn’t included in that. If she had been, she might have gone close to going. She wasn’t listed at all. I’m not sure why. It wasn’t until later on, when there was a statement of claim came, that her name was included, and I specifically went straight down and saw her and she said, “Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. No. I wasn’t.” If she had been included in the one in May when I went and saw Gary Alcock and Ruth Gallop, she might have gone close to going.’ 121            With respect to Ms Gallop, it was put to Mr Rosenlund that she had been caught selling counterfeit merchandise on various occasions including January 2004 and May 2005 and was still there. Mr Rosenlund said: ‘She is … I should be a little less merciful perhaps. Ruth was caught the first time with quite a number of items. The second time she had only two wallets. She’s a 70 year old pensioner. She promised me it wouldn’t happen again. She certainly scaled down what she said. It was certainly far, far less than the first time, and I gave it serious thought, but if I – and I’m not unwilling to expel people and I’m not preoccupied with it, but I am willing to expel people once they cross the line. I’ve got to be able to justify that to myself and to other people and be able to defend that. I looked at this poor old lady and thought, “I’ll give her one more chance. This is a bit tough, throwing her out here when she promises me this time it will never happen again and she’s had two wallets.” I mean, there’s – there’s no law that says I’ve got to expel people. I just felt it was a tough call, but, certainly, caught again, she’s crossed the line.’ 122            Mr Rosenlund agreed that he had expelled some casual stallholders for parking on Market premises, contrary to prevailing arrangements. He said that parking was a serious problem. He did not consider that it was a more serious issue than the sale of counterfeit goods. Mr Rosenlund pointed out the difficulty of detecting counterfeit goods concealed in stalls, short of searching them. It is fair to say that Mr Rosenlund also demonstrated a willingness to accept at face value, explanations given by stallholders. On the other hand, it is difficult to know what else he could do.  123            Mr Rosenlund was cross-examined about his failure to detect apparently counterfeit goods present at stalls when he visited them. This line of cross-examination failed to recognize the difference between Mr Rosenlund’s duties and functions, on the one hand, and those of the applicant’s agents on the other. Whilst such agents no doubt knew specifically what they were looking for, one could not reasonably expect Mr Rosenlund to have been, at all times, conscious of the appearance of Louis Vuitton goods and therefore of their presence at a particular stall. He also could not be expected to be able to distinguish between counterfeit and authentic Louis Vuitton goods. I see no basis for holding that he was obliged to acquaint himself with such matters. After all, the applicant is certainly not the only organization which wishes to protect its trademarks. I agree with Mr Rosenlund that manufacturers and suppliers cannot reasonably expect him or his staff to police observance of their trademarks. Of course that is not to say that they may connive at, or encourage, infringement of such trademarks. 124            Mr Rosenlund considered that it would have been helpful had the applicant’s agents spoken to him directly about strategies for preventing trademark infringement instead of using the trap purchase technique. The applicant’s answer to that seemed to be that there are about 4,000 markets in Australia, and that it would be difficult to make suitable arrangements with each of them. However Mr Rosenlund had over 400 stalls to supervise and, as I have said, the applicant is not the only trademark holder in Australia. Mr Rosenlund conceded that on any one day, items which infringed trademarks would probably be sold from a stall or stalls in the Market. He would prefer to be rid of the problem. Counterfeit goods cause pain to the Market and to other stallholders.  125            On 20 September 2005, the solicitors for Toea and Mr Rosenlund wrote to the applicant. That letter is exhibit 16. It was said to be ‘Without prejudice save as to costs’. It is, nonetheless, in evidence. The solicitors asserted that the applicant’s case was not maintainable in law and gave notice of their intention, if successful in these proceedings, of seeking orders for costs on a basis other than “party and party”. On 6 December 2005 the applicant’s solicitors wrote (exhibit 15), offering to settle these proceedings upon the basis that Toea and Mr Rosenlund enter into a proposed deed and that the parties pay their own costs. Mr Rosenlund considered the deed to be too inflexible in some respects and so did not sign it. Perhaps unfortunately, he did not seek to negotiate variations to it. The applicant’s offer was rejected (exhibit 17). The letter and draft deed are exhibit 15.  126            Mr Rosenlund said that he had not informed the applicant of his “no Louis Vuitton” policy and had not undertaken to continue that policy for the future. He said, however, that he and Toea did not want Louis Vuitton items or counterfeit items sold at the Market.  Other witnesses for the respondents 127            Mr Edmondson also gave evidence. He has been employed part-time by Toea as an office administrator since 16 February 2002. His duties include administrative tasks such as dealing with accounts receivable and general enquiries, liaising with stallholders and the public and other duties as directed by Mr Rosenlund. He said that since May 2005 it has been Market policy to inform casual stallholders that they may not sell counterfeit goods, and that the Market will not rent sites to them if such goods are to be offered for sale. In or about September 2005 Mr Rosenlund introduced a “no Louis Vuitton” policy at the Market. Stallholders are prohibited from selling any Louis Vuitton products or “look-alike” Louis Vuitton products. Mr Edmondson informs potential stallholders of these policies. If he sees offending products he orders their removal. He gave evidence concerning the various conversations which he had with stallholders concerning alleged infringements of the applicant’s trademarks. He was not cross-examined.  128            Joanne Joyce Cochrane is employed full-time by Toea as an office administrator. Her duties include writing letters and memoranda, replying to emails, coding accounts, attending to petty cash and wages, photocopying, maintaining the list of permanent stallholders, collecting rent and banking. She also deals with customers and stallholders. She gave evidence similar to that of Mr Edmondson concerning the reservation and allocation of stalls. She also enforces the policies relating to counterfeit goods and Louis Vuitton goods to which he referred. 129            She was the person who spoke to Ms Stead concerning the notice which she received. She said that Ms Stead’s account of the conversation omitted one aspect. Ms Cochrane said that she asked Ms Stead whether she was selling anything “wrong”, including illegal goods or anything which breached copyright and said, ‘If you’re not selling anything illegal then you haven’t got anything to worry about.’ She has been instructed by Mr Rosenlund that if a representative of the owner of a trademark or an investigator enquires as to the name and contact details of stallholders, such information is to be provided. 130            Ms Leak also gave evidence. She said that on 25 July 2005 Mr Rosenlund asked that on the next weekend, she visit the Market and, in particular, five identified stalls to see if she could detect any items for sale which looked like Louis Vuitton products. She did so, specifically asking each of those stallholders if he or she had any Louis Vuitton articles for sale and saying that she was keen to buy such articles. At each stall she was told that it had no such articles. She also walked around the Market generally and had a good look at a number of other stalls, particularly those selling products similar to Louis Vuitton products, such as bags, accessories, wallets, purses and watches. She looked at approximately twenty stalls in addition to the five to which she had been directed. She did not see any Louis Vuitton products. She was at the Market for between one-and-a-half and two hours. Findings 131            There is little real conflict in the evidence. However I should address three factual matters. The first is Mr Moes’ allegation that on 15 February 2004 Mr Rosenlund heard Mr Alcock say words to the effect that he had just sold ‘another one’ and had only ‘two’ left, referring to counterfeit Louis Vuitton products. I do not understand Mr Rosenlund to have denied that Mr Alcock used such words. However he claimed not to have associated them with the sale of a product which infringed any of the applicant’s trademarks. Had Mr Rosenlund intended to lie about this matter, he could simply have denied that the statement attributed to Mr Alcock had been made. It may be that such a response would have led to the applicant cross-examining Mr Alcock as to whether the statement was made. Nonetheless, it seems unlikely that Mr Rosenlund would have refrained from denying the statement, yet lied about the associated matter.  132            Much may have depended upon the context in which Mr Alcock’s remark was made. Mr Rosenlund struck me as a basically truthful witness. It is clear that at the time, he was taking steps to ensure that stallholders were aware that Toea would not countenance the sale of counterfeit products. The applicant at least implied that such steps as he took were merely window-dressing. On balance, I reject that view. On later visits by the applicant’s agents, at least some of the stallholders demonstrated their awareness that they should conceal offending products. Whilst this may have been attributable to their fear that the applicant’s agents would detect them in infringements, it may also have been attributable to Mr Rosenlund’s actions. Mr Alcock, Ms Byrne and Ms Gallop all confirmed that Mr Rosenlund had spoken to them. None of them seems to have thought that the warnings were issued other than with the intention that they be heeded. In those circumstances it is unlikely that Mr Rosenlund would simply have ignored another offending sale occurring under his nose, or tolerated the prospect of two further sales. In the circumstances I accept, on the balance of probabilities, that Mr Rosenlund was not aware that the remark made by Mr Alcock referred to a sale or potential sale of an infringing product.  133            The second factual dispute which I should resolve is that between Ms Stead and Ms Cochrane as to the content of the conversation concerning the notice that was served on Ms Stead at her stall. The difference between the two versions is that Ms Cochrane asserts that she asked whether Ms Stead was selling ‘anything illegal or anything that breaches copyright’. Given the limited nature of the issue and the limited opportunity to assess the witnesses, I am unpersuaded that either version should be preferred to the other. 134            The third matter is Mr Moes’ assertion that Ms Gallop alleged that Mr Rosenlund had encouraged her to think that she need only avoid being detected in infringing conduct but not necessarily refrain from such conduct. Ms Gallop said, in her affidavit, that Mr Rosenlund had extracted an assurance that she would not again sell counterfeit Louis Vuitton products and then said, ‘Don’t let us catch you again.’ In that context it is impossible to construe Mr Rosenlund’s words in the way suggested by the applicant. Mr Rosenlund’s own evidence was to similar effect. I infer that Mr Rosenlund intended to leave Ms Gallop with the impression that she was not to sell infringing goods. 135            There are a number of other, more general observations which I should make about the evidence. Clearly, the applicant’s agents were anxious to detect infringement and had familiarized themselves with the applicant’s trademarks for that purpose. They went to the Market with the intention of identifying counterfeit Louis Vuitton products and sales of such products. It is likely that they were much more alert to the presence of potentially infringing products than would be an ordinary member of the public, or were Mr Rosenlund and his employees. No doubt, as his dealings with the applicant’s agents continued, Mr Rosenlund became more conscious of the problem, but that does not lead me to conclude that it became, or should have become, the primary focus of his managerial activities and responsibilities. Whilst one might have expected him to cast a rather more critical eye over the goods offered at the various stalls, particularly those which had previously been detected in infringement, his responsibilities were such that his attention was always likely to be distracted by other matters.  136            Mr Rosenlund conceded that on any one day, counterfeit items are probably sold somewhere in the Market. He would prefer that such sales did not take place. When he was informed of infringing sales he took appropriate action. It may be that he did not accord the matter the priority which the applicant would have liked, but that preference offers no guide to his legal obligations or to those of Toea. 137            I accept that Mr Rosenlund’s primary aim was to continue the profitable operation of the Market, and that he did this by maximizing attendance, facilitating access and providing entertainment, as well as ensuring that the range of goods offered for sale was attractive to potential customers. There is no evidence that the availability of counterfeit designer goods was a significant aspect of the success of the Market. Mr Rosenlund considered it to be an undesirable, but unavoidable, incident of the business. There is certainly no direct evidence to suggest that he, in any way, encouraged stallholders to offer such products for sale. The applicant invites me to infer from his conduct that he encouraged or tolerated the sale of counterfeit goods, but I see no basis for such an inference. I accept that he wished to maintain reasonable relations with his stallholders, particularly those who had long-term associations with the Market. I infer that he did not consider that it was necessarily in the best interests of the Market to take stringent action with every stallholder who was detected in the infringement of a trademark. 138            Much of the applicant’s argument hinges upon the assumption that Toea, through Mr Rosenlund, could control the products which were sold at the Market. In a legal sense that assumption is correct. Regardless of any arrangements pursuant to which a stall was occupied, it would probably have been open to Toea to terminate such occupancy in the event that it became aware that a stallholder proposed to engage in unlawful conduct. Toea was not contractually bound to permit such conduct. Whether it would have been entitled to determine any ongoing contractual arrangement for past misconduct of that kind may be a different matter. I assume for present purposes that it would have been so entitled. However the legal right to control the range of goods being sold says nothing about physical ability to prevent all infringing sales. Had a stallholder evinced a clear and overt intention to sell counterfeit goods, then Toea may arguably have been obliged to terminate his or her right to occupy a stall or otherwise trade in that way at the Market. However that was not the position. Relatively small quantities of infringing goods were displayed at some stalls on some occasions. On other occasions stallholders produced infringing items on request, but were not otherwise overtly dealing in them. There is no evidence that Toea or Mr Rosenlund ever had prior knowledge of a stallholder’s possession of infringing goods or of his or her intention to sell such goods. I infer that the respondents dealt in good faith with its stallholders and with the applicant’s agents. They also assumed good faith on the part of the stallholders.  139            There was always the possibility that a stallholder would sell infringing goods, but I do not accept that the respondents should have proceeded on the basis that the likelihood of infringement was any higher than that. There is no suggestion that the sale of infringing goods was a substantial part of the business of any stallholder or that it was a particularly lucrative trade. I see no basis for the assertion that the respondents were ‘willfully blind’ to the possibility of infringing conduct. The Law 140            In pars 1 and 2 of its outline the applicant puts its case as follows: ‘1. This proceeding raises for determination by the Court the extent of the obligations of a owner of market premises, where it is drawn to the owner’s attention that, over a period of years, some of the stallholder licensees are engaging in the unlawful conduct of selling counterfeit goods and thereby infringing a number of registered trade marks. 2. It is contended that where, as here, the landowner takes no effective steps to stop the conduct but by acts or omissions tacitly accepts it, the landowner in fact joins in the tort and becomes independently liable as a joint tortfeasor.’ 141            In the course of the trial, the applicant sought to base its case on three different propositions, namely: ·                      that a person in control of premises who benefits from another’s activities on those premises is liable for torts committed by that other person in conducting those activities; ·                      that a licensor who, having knowledge of past torts committed by a licensee on the relevant premises, permits the licensee to continue using the premises is liable for any further torts (of the same kind) committed by the licensee; and ·                      that a licensor is liable for torts committed by a licensee in carrying out their joint enterprise. 142            In the course of oral submissions counsel put the case in this way (at TS 200 ll 25-30): ‘Our starting point is very simple, your Honour. When one goes to The Koursk([1924] P 140) which has been adopted as the foundation of the principle of joint tortfeasorship by the High Court in Thompson’s case, [Thompson v Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd (1996) 186 CLR 574] and we’ve set it out in paragraph 18 of our outline, Scrutton LJ spoke of two persons who agree on a common action in the course of, and to further which one of them commits a tort. And that’s the foundation of what are joint tortfeasors. In this case, in our respectful submission, the evidence is clear that Toea, as landlord or land owner, and the stallholders, who are two or more persons, agree on a common action, the common action being the promotion of their joint businesses at the market.’ 143            Given that the relevant cause of action is created by the Trademarks Act 1995 (Cth) (the “Trademarks Act”), one might reasonably have expected the applicant’s case to commence with an examination of the relevant statutory provisions, with a view to identifying the extent to which either of the respondents could be said to have infringed in the sense defined in s 120. Pursuant to ss 125 and 126, proceedings may be brought for such an infringement, seeking injunctive relief, damages or an account of profits. Criminal liability is imposed by Pt 14. Section 150 provides that a person who aids, abets, counsels, procures or is knowingly concerned in the doing of an act outside of Australia which, if done in Australia, would be an offence, is taken to have committed the offence. That section is said to be without prejudice to the operation of s 5 of the Crimes Act 1914 (now s 11.2 of the Criminal Code) which deals with aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring an offence committed by another person within Australia. However no provision extends civil liability to ‘secondary’ tortfeasors. Thus the applicant seeks to rely on principles as to liability in tort drawn from the general law.  144            Although the applicant’s case has been put in various ways, my understanding is that the case against each of the respondents depends upon the allegations in par 34 of the further amended statement of claim (exhibit 13) that: ‘By reason of the matters referred to above (Toea) and/or (Mr Rosenlund) have infringed and continue to infringe one or more of the Louis Vuitton trademarks as the conduct of the infringing stallholders was conduct undertaken with the concurrence of (Toea) and/or (Mr Rosenlund) and pursuant to their common design.’ 145            The reference to ‘the conduct of the infringing stallholders’ relates to pars 14, 15 and 16 of the further amended statement of claim in which allegations are made against Mr Alcock, Ms Byrne and Ms Gallop respectively. Those allegations include specific allegations of infringement of the applicant’s trademarks by sale of identified products on identified dates. The evidence concerning those transactions has been set out above. However there are also allegations, completely unparticularized, of infringement by manufacture, importation, advertisement and offering for sale, distribution or supply. Although there is some evidence of items, apparently bearing Louis Vuitton trademarks, having been seen at stalls (other than those items which were the subject of trap purchases), none of those items was examined by either Mr Bombardi or Mr Pichon. There is no evidence that they were counterfeit. I do not understand the applicant to rely upon display of those items. In the end the claims against each respondent depend upon the various trap purchases. 146            In par 34, the applicant also asserts that the conduct of infringing stallholders was ‘conduct undertaken with the concurrence of the first and/or the second respondents and pursuant to their common design.’ The allegation of ‘concurrence’ is particularized in earlier paragraphs of the further amended statement of claim. The applicant’s case is that, with knowledge of past infringements, the respondents permitted the infringing stallholders to continue to trade at the Market. As to the question of ‘common design’, this assertion was developed in oral submissions, but no such design is particularized in the further amended statement of claim. It seems that the applicant asserts that the common design was to achieve success for the market through the success of individual stalls including, in particular, those of the infringing stallholders.  147            At this point I should make two comments concerning the applicant’s case. Firstly, the case has been conducted upon the basis that no distinction should be drawn between the liability of Toea and that of Mr Rosenlund. Secondly, the applicant has not demonstrated that Mr Rosenlund or Toea was actually aware, in advance of any sale, that a relevant stallholder had counterfeit products at the Market or intended to sell such products. As I have said, in many cases the goods were not on display, but were produced from places of concealment in response to requests from the applicant’s agents.  148            I have previously referred to the applicant’s reliance on the decision of the Court of Appeal in The “Koursk” (supra). However I suspect that it has misconceived that decision. The case arose out of a collision at sea involving the “Clan Chisholm”, The “Koursk” and the “Itria”, leading to the loss of the “Itria”. The owners of the “Itria” sued the owners of the other vessels, alleging separate and independent acts of negligence against each of them. The question was whether judgment recovered against the owners of the “Clan Chisholm” barred a further action by the owners of the “Itria” against the owners of The “Koursk”. This depended upon whether the two ship owners (of the “Clan Chisholm” and The “Koursk”) were joint or several tortfeasors. Bankes LJ adopted the following proposition from Clerk and Lindsell on Torts, 7th ed at p 59: ‘Persons are said to be joint tortfeasors when their respective shares in the commission of the tort are done in furtherance of a common design.’  149            Scrutton LJ said at 155: ‘The substantial question in the present case is: What is meant by “joint tortfeasors”? and one way of answering it is: “Is the cause of action against them the same?” Certain classes of persons seem clearly to be “joint tortfeasors”: The agent who commits a tort within the scope of his employment for his principal and the principal; the servant who commits a tort in the course of his employment, and his master; two persons who agree on common action, in the course of, and to further which, one of them commits a tort. These seem clearly joint tortfeasor; there is one tort committed by one of them on behalf of, or in concert with another.’ 150            The applicant fastens on the proposition concerning two persons who agree on common action in the course of which one commits a tort, submitting that the present case fits that description. However that observation by Scrutton LJ must be read in the context of his Lordship’s later remarks at 156 where he referred with approval to the statement in Clerk and Lindsall (to which Bankes LJ had referred), that: ‘ “Persons are said to be joint tortfeasors when their respective shares in the commission of the tort are done in furtherance of a common design” … “But mere similarity of design on the part of independent actors, causing independent damage, is not enough; there must be concerted action to a common end.” Still more so when there is not even similarity of design, but independent negligence accidentally resulting in one damage.’ 151            At 159 Sargant LJ adopted the same passage. 152            The applicant points to the reference by Scrutton LJ to ‘common action’ and asserts that in this case, the common action agreed upon between the respondents and each stallholder was ‘the function of their joint businesses at the Market’. No doubt the respondents desired that the Market be successful and took steps to achieve that aim. No doubt, too, each stallholder desired that his or her stall be successful and took steps to achieve that aim. However that does not lead to the conclusion that the respondents and each stallholder had agreed on common action. Aims are not actions. The term ‘common action’ must surely mean ‘steps to be taken’. At p 155 of The “Koursk”, Scrutton LJ was identifying common relationships in which joint torts generally occur, rather than the underlying principle which defines the relationship of joint tortfeasors. At 156, his Lordship addressed that principle, holding that each party must share in the commission of the tort in furtherance of a common design, not merely in furtherance of similar designs.  153            I turn to the decision of the House of Lords in CBS Songs Limited v Amstrad Consumer Electronics PLC [1988] 1 AC 1013. The facts appear sufficiently from the head note as follows: ‘The plaintiffs, suing on behalf of themselves and other copyright owners in the music trade, claimed that the defendants, by manufacturing, advertising and offering for sale hi-fi systems with facilities for, inter alia, recording at high speed from pre-recorded cassettes onto blank tapes, had authorised and incited members of the public to infringe their copyrights, were joint infringers with such members of the public and were in breach of a duty of care owed to the copyright owners not to supply the machines without taking such precautions as would reasonably ensure that the copyrights would not be infringed by their use. They sought an injunction to retrain the defendants from parting with possession of the machines, or any like machines, without taking such precautions.’ 154            At 1055, Lord Templeman said: ‘BPI next submitted that Amstrad were joint infringers; they became joint infringers if and as soon as a purchaser decided to copy a record in which copyright subsisted; Amstrad could become joint infringers not only with the immediate purchaser of an Amstrad model but also with anyone else who at any time in the future used the model to copy records. My Lords, Amstrad sells models which include facilities for the receiving and recording broadcasts, disc records and taped records. All these facilities are lawful, although the recording device is capable of being used for unlawful purposes. Once a model is sold Amstrad have no control over or interest in its use. In these circumstances the allegation that Amstrad is a joint infringer is untenable. In Townsend v Haworth (1875) 48 L.J.Ch. 770n, decided in 1875 but reported in 1879 the defendant sold chemicals to be used by the purchaser in an infringement of patent and agreed to indemnify the purchaser if the patent should prove to be valid. Mellish L.J. said, at p.773: “Selling materials for the purpose of infringing a patent to the man who is going to infringe it, even although the party who sells it knows that he going to infringe it and indemnifies him, does not by itself make the person who so sells an infringer. He must be a party with the man who so infringes, and actually infringe.” Mr Kentridge on behalf of B.P.I. relied on the decision in Innes v Short & Beal (1898) 15 R.P.C. 449. In that case the defendant Short sold powdered zinc and gave instructions to a purchaser to enable the purchaser to infringe a process patent. Bigham J said at p 452: “There is no reason whatever why Mr Short should not sell powdered zinc, and he will not be in the wrong, though he may know or expect the people who buy it from him are going to use it in such a way as will amount to an infringement of Mr Innes’ patent rights. But he must not ask the people to use it in that way, and he must not ask the people to use it in that way in order to induce them to buy his powdered zinc from him.” Assuming that decision to be correct, it does not assist BPI because in the present case Amstrad did not ask anyone to use an Amstrad model in a way which would amount to an infringement. In Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v David Moseley & Sons Ltd [1904] 1 Ch 164,171, … the defendant sold tyre covers which were an essential feature of a combination patent for tyres and rims. The tyre covers were adapted for use in the manner described in the patent, but not necessarily solely for use in that manner. Swinfen-Eady J said … that most of the “covers would probably ultimately be used in one or other of” the patented methods but that “those are not exhaustive of the purposes to which the covers may be put, and that they would be useful for other purposes in connection with other tyres …” …’ 155            At 1057 his Lordship continued: ‘My Lords, joint infringers are two or more persons who act in concert with one another pursuant to a common design in the infringement. In the present case there was no common design. Amstrad sold a machine and the purchaser or the operator of the machine decided the purpose for which the machine should from time to time be used. The machine was capable of being used for lawful or unlawful purposes. All recording machines and many other machines are capable of being used for unlawful purposes but manufacturers and retailers are not joint infringers if purchasers choose to break the law. Since Amstrad did not make or authorise other persons to make a record embodying a recording in which copyright subsisted, Amstrad did not entrench upon the exclusive rights granted by the Act of 1956 to copyright owners and Amstrad were not in breach of the duties imposed by the Act.’ 156            In Thompson v Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd (supra) the facts, according to the head note, were as follows: ‘A television station broadcast live to viewers in the Australian Capital Territory a current affairs programme produced by another station. The licence to broadcast was granted by PBL which was a related entity of the producer. The content of the broadcast was defamatory of T. T settled with the producer and gave it a release. T sued the broadcaster in the Supreme Court of the Territory. The broadcaster joined the producer and PBL as third parties, seeking contribution and also damages for breach of an implied condition of the licence agreement that they would exercise reasonable care to ensure that the relayed programme would not include defamatory material.  Although the broadcaster took no part in the production of the programme, it acted in its own right and had the ability to control and supervise the material it televised. The broadcaster voluntarily decided to broadcast live. It sought to defend the proceedings on the grounds that it and the producer were joint tortfeasors and that the release granted to the producer by T also released it.’ 157            At 580-581, the majority (Brennan CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ) said: ‘The difference between joint tortfeasors and several tortfeasors is that the former are responsible for the same tort whereas the latter are responsible only for the same damage … . As was said in The “Koursk” …, for there to be joint tortfeasors “there must be a concurrence in the act or acts causing damage, not merely a co-incidence of separate acts which by their conjoined effect cause damage”. Principal and agent may be joint tortfeasors where the agent commits a tort on behalf of the principal, as master and servant may be where the servant commits a tort in the course of employment. Persons who breach a joint duty may also be joint tortfeasors. Otherwise, to constitute joint tortfeasors two or more persons must act in concert in committing the tort.’ 158            At 600, Gummow J (Gaudron J concurring) also identified the decision in The “Koursk” as defining joint liability for the purposes of Australian law. At 601 – 602, his Honour distinguished the decision in CBS Songs on its fact but did not doubt its correctness. 159            Finally, I should refer to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland NV v Export Credit Guarantee Department [1998] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 19. It is not necessary to set out the rather complex facts of the case, but I will include two extended extracts from the reasons for judgment of Stuart-Smith and Hobhouse LLJJ. Stuart-Smith LJ said at 35: ‘Be that as it may, it seems to me to be well established that a person who acts with another to commit a tort in furtherance of a common design will be liable as a joint tortfeasor. It is not enough that he merely facilitates the commission of the tort unless his assistance is given in pursuance and furtherance of the common design.’ 160            His Honour referred to the The “Koursk” and another case, and then observed that Lord Justice Mustill, in Unilever PLC v Gillette (UK) Ltd [1989] RPC 583: ‘… stated the common law rule that two persons were joint tortfeasors –  … where the two were concerned in a joint act done in pursuance of a common purpose. After reviewing the patent cases and the speech of Lord Templeman in CBS Songs Ltd v Armstrad… Lord Justice Mustill said at p 609 that the relevant question is whether: (a) there was a common design between B and G to do acts which, if the patent is upheld, amounted to infringements, and (b) B had acted in furtherance of that design. I use the word “common design” because they are readily to hand, but there are other expressions in the cases, such as “concerted action” or “agreed or common action” which will serve just as well.’ 161            Hobhouse LJ sought to compare treatment in the criminal law of parties to offences with the treatment of persons ‘involved’ in the commission of torts. His Lordship (at 42-43) identified three categories of persons other than the actual offender, to whom criminal liability attaches, namely: ·                     those who solicit or incite another to commit a crime or conspire with another to commit a crime; ·                     those who aid another in the commission of a crime, often known as ‘aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring’; and ·                     principals whose agents commit offences. 162            Hobhouse LJ subsequently referred to The “Koursk”, CBS Songs and Unilever, concluding (at 46) that these cases established that: ‘It is only conduct which comes into the first or the third of the categories I have set out above which constitute the commission of a tort. The criminal law for obvious policy reasons goes further than the civil law. Acts which knowingly facilitate the commission of a crime amount to the crime of aiding and abetting but they do not amount to a tort or make the aider liable as a joint tortfeasor.’ 163            His Lordship continued: ‘Accordingly, in my judgment there is no second category in the law of tort. Mere assistance, even knowing assistance, does not suffice to make the “secondary” party jointly liable as a joint tortfeasor with the primary party. What he does must go further. He must have conspired with the primary party or procured or induced his commission of the tort (my first category); or he must have joined in the common design pursuant to which the tort was committed (my third category).’ 164            In Kerly’s Law of Trademarks and Trade Names 14th ed at par 19-044, the learned authors observe, in connection with trademarks, that: ‘For the general principles applicable in relation to joint liability based on procurement or common design see CBS v Armstrad and Credit Lyonnais v Export Credit Guarantee Department’.   Those decisions are based on that in The “Koursk”. The High Court’s view of that case appears from the decision in Thompson v Australian Capital Television and is the relevant test for present purposes. 165            The applicant puts some emphasis upon Toea’s legal capacity to control use of the Market premises. It implicitly asserts that the respondents failed to prevent infringement notwithstanding that power, and that such failure is a basis for inferring their ‘concurrence’ in the infringement. The question of control has arisen frequently in connection with breach of copyright. Subsection 36(1) of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) (the “Copyright Act”) provides that a person infringes a copyright if he or she ‘not being the owner of the copyright, and without the licence of the owner of the copyright, does in Australia, or authorises the doing in Australia, any act comprised in the copyright.’ In University of New South Wales v Moorhouse (1974-1975) 133 CLR 1, the High Court considered the case of a university library which had provided photocopying machines on its premises, one of which had been used to make an unauthorized copy of a literary work. The question was whether the university had infringed by authorization. At 20-21, Jacobs J, with whom McTiernan J agreed, said concerning the word ‘authorises’: ‘It is established that word is not limited to the authorising of an agent by a principal. Where there is such an authority the act of the agent is the act of the principal and thus the principal himself may be said to do the act comprised in the copyright. But authorisation is wider than authority. It has, in relation to a similar use in previous copyright legislation, been given the meaning, taken from the Oxford Dictionary, of “sanction, approve, countenance”. …I have no doubt that the word is used in the same sense in section 36(1). It is a wide meaning which in cases of permission or invitation is apt to apply both where an express permission or invitation is extended to do the act comprising the copyright and where such a permission or invitation may be implied. Where a general permission or invitation may be implied it is clearly unnecessary that the authorising party have knowledge that a particular act comprised in the copyright will be done. The acts and omissions of the alleged authorising party must be looked at in the circumstances in which the act comprised in the copyright is done. The circumstances will include the likelihood that such an act will be done. “… (t)he Court may infer an authorisation or permission from acts which fall short of being direct and positive; … indifference, exhibited by acts of commission or omission, may reach a degree from which authorisation or permission may be inferred. It is a question of fact in each case what is the true inference to be drawn from the conduct of the person who is said to have authorised …” ’ 166            See also CBS Songs (supra) at 1053-1055 and Australian Tape Manufacturers Association Ltd v The Commonwealth (1993) 67 ALJR 315 at 317. 167            Frequently, the capacity to authorize will depend upon the capacity to control. In that sense, the question of control is implicit in the concept of authorization. Subsequent amendments to s 36 of the Copyright Act have made that clear. Subsection 36(1A) now provides that in determining whether or not a person has authorized the doing of any act, matters to be taken into account include: ‘(a) the extent (if any) of the person’s power to prevent the doing of the act concerned; (b) the nature of any relationship existing between the person and the person who did the act concerned; (c) whether the person took any reasonable steps to prevent or avoid the doing of the act, including whether the person complied with any relevant industry codes of practice.’ 168            There will be cases in which the relationship between the person who commits a tort and another person may be such as to amount to both authorization (in the case of copyright) and also to satisfy the test for joint tortfeasors laid down in The “Koursk” and Thompson v Australian Capital Television. However to prove authorization is not necessarily to prove infringement. As the present case demonstrates, control does not, itself, imply a common purpose. However the extent of control may be relevant evidence in determining whether such a common purpose existed at the relevant time.  169            As I have previously observed, I do not consider that Toea’s control of the Market premises, either alone or in conjunction with the other evidence, would justify the inference that either Toea or Mr Rosenlund shared a common purpose with any of the infringing stallholders. In any event, I am satisfied that it would have been virtually impossible for the respondents to control stallholders so as to prevent infringement, save in the case of the most blatant misconduct. In this case, the extent of the demonstrated misconduct by infringing stallholders was not such as to lead the respondents to the conclusion that there would be further infringement. They were entitled to accept assurances given by infringing stallholders that they would not again infringe. 170            In the course of argument the applicant referred to three American cases concerning ‘secondary’ liability for trademark infringements. Given the clear statement of principle in connection with tortious liability in Thompson v Australian Capital Television, I see no point in discussing those cases in this judgment. Conclusions 171            I proceed upon the basis that, in order to hold the respondents liable for the stallholders’ infringements, ‘… there must be a concurrence in the act or acts causing damage, not merely a coincidence of separate acts which by their conjoined effect cause damage’, and that in order to satisfy that test in the present case, it is necessary to show that the respondents acted in concert with each stallholder in ‘committing the tort’. 172            In my view it is simply impossible to reach that conclusion. I accept Mr Rosenlund’s evidence that he wished to deter stallholders from infringing trademarks and took steps to do so. The primary infringing stallholders all understood that this was his position and therefore that of Toea. The applicant’s case hangs upon the assertion that he did not do enough, or could have done more, to deter infringement. It is said that from this, I should infer that he was really encouraging the stallholders in their illegal activities. In other words, it is submitted that although there was no duty on the respondents to take steps to prevent infringement, the failure to do so evidenced an intention to encourage infringement. That approach fails to take account of the fact that there may have been other reasons for not taking more draconian measures to prevent infringement. In any event, I am unpersuaded that either of the respondents acted in common with any of the stallholders in the actions which constituted infringement of the applicant’s copyrights. I am also satisfied that such infringements were not committed in the execution of any common purpose shared with the respondents. As I have said, the respondents’ purpose was to conduct an efficient and profitable Market. The purpose of each stallholder was the successful conduct of his or her stall. There was no common purpose. 173            It follows that the application must be dismissed. I will hear submissions as to costs and any requests for further findings of fact.       I certify that the preceding one hundred and seventy three (173) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Dowsett.

  REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

  1                     The first applicant, Prismex Technologies Pty Ltd (‘Prismex Technologies’), is the owner of Australian Patent No 647834 (‘the patent’) for an invention referred to as a display system (‘the invention’).  In 1995, Prismex Technologies granted to Interium Pty Ltd (‘Interium’) an exclusive licence to exploit the invention, and Interium did so until June 2006, when it went into liquidation.  The principal question in this proceeding is whether the licence is revocable by Prismex Technologies, or whether it cannot be so revoked and is an asset assignable by the liquidator of Interium.  The question is important because the liquidator purported to assign all the property of Interium, including intellectual property, to the first respondent, Keller Industries Pty Ltd (‘Keller’), which was in competition with Interium, and which is still in competition with interests which were associated with Interium and which remain associated with Prismex Technologies.

  2                     The primary claim in the patent specification is for –

  ‘… an illuminated display system composing a transparent medium having two opposing surfaces to be illuminated, wherein both of said surfaces to be illuminated have a matrix of dots substantially covering said surfaces to be illuminated resulting in an increased illumination of the surfaces to be illuminated.’

  The invention is claimed to improve the evenness and brightness of the appearance of a sign, especially a large sign, illuminated by means of light sources at one or (on large signs) both of its edges, where the light radiates inwards over the surface of the transparent medium referred to. 

  3                     The display system was invented by the fourth cross-respondent, Mr John Ashall (‘Ashall’) in about 1991, in which year the patent was applied for by Ashlar Screenprints Pty Ltd (‘Ashlar’), a company with which Ashall was then associated.  In July 1992, Ashlar assigned its interest in the patent application to a company called Illumination Research Group (Properties) Pty Ltd (‘IRG’), which used the invention in the manufacture of an edge-lit diffusion system called ‘Prismex’.  Also in the early 1990’s, Mr John Matyear (‘Matyear’) was in a separate business in the manufacture of edge-lit signs, called ‘Interium’.  In July 1994, he was approached by Mr Garry Buick (‘Buick’) of IRG who said that IRG was in financial difficulties, and suggested that they establish a new venture which would purchase the rights to manufacture the ‘Prismex’ panel.  Whether or not connected with these developments, on 27 January 1995, IRG assigned its interest in the patent application, and in the then prospective patent, back to Ashlar.  The patent was sealed only four days later, on 31 January 1995, in the name of IRG.  The transfer to Ashlar was registered on 15 February 1995.  By the time of important events in June and July 1995 to which I shall refer, Ashlar was the patentee.

  4                     Matyear and Buick commenced to develop their new business.  They needed larger premises than were then available to them, and some factory space in Bayswater was offered by someone with whom Matyear had worked in the 1980’s, the third cross-respondent, Mr Colin Taggert (‘Taggert’).  A little later, it seems, Matyear was told by a representative of Ashlar that the patent could be purchased for $150,000.  Thus was born the idea of a business making edge-lit signs using the invention, which was referred to as the ‘Prismex technology’.  Taggert joined Matyear and Buick in the venture, as did Ashall himself, who had the technical skills required for the project.

  5                     The corporate structure for the business was discussed by the four venturers (Matyear, Buick, Taggert and Ashall) at a critical meeting in the office of their accountant, Mr Peter Mews (‘Mews’) on 9 June 1995.  I was told that Buick is now deceased.  Mews was not called to give evidence, a circumstance for which no explanation was offered by any party.  The other three participants in the meeting gave evidence, but their recollections of the meeting were very general, and understandably influenced by their concept of what was the general plan at the meeting, rather than by any recollection of what was actually said or agreed.  However, all were clear that there were to be two companies involved in the business, one to trade and the other to hold the patent.  On 13 June 1995, Mews wrote a memorandum the stated purpose of which was ‘to record the matters discussed’ at the meeting on 9 June.  Each witness accepted that this memorandum did accurately summarise what was discussed at the meeting.

  6                     Under the heading ‘Purpose of the Meeting’, Mews’ memorandum stated:

  ‘The meeting was called to consider the issues surrounding the formalising of the business associated with Edgelight Signs which is the sign system incorporating extruded aluminium framing, special lighting and the transfer of light through the Prismex Technologies Pty Ltd screens.  The work has been done by John Matyear and Garry Buick to a point where a market for the product has now been established.

  The business is to incorporate the acquisition of Asher screens, the screening company which produces the Prismex Technologies Pty Ltd panels, and by way of a separate company will acquire the patent for Australia for the Prismex Technologies Pty Ltd screen technology.

  The business will also incorporate the design, manufacture and installation of special signage such as the New South Wales rail project where a contract is about to be awarded to the group.’

  Under the heading ‘Name and Entities’, Mews’ memorandum stated:

  ‘The business is to trade under the company known as Interium Pty Ltd and the patent is to be held by a separate company known as Prismex Technologies Pty Ltd.  The purpose of separating the operations and the patent is to protect the value of the patent in the event of any litigation or law suits which may arise to Interium Pty Ltd.

  Two new companies are to be formed and the business name currently held by Metage Pty Ltd, John Matyear’s trustee company, is to be transferred to the new company Interium Pty Ltd.  The arrangement for the incorporation of the companies and the transfer of the name is to be between Garry Buick and John Matyear.’

  7                     Mews then recorded the agreed capitalisation of Prismex Technologies and Interium.  Prismex Technologies was to have paid-up capital of $150,070, $150,000 of which was required to purchase the patent from Ashlar.  That was raised by each of Matyear and Buick contributing $30 (30 x $1 shares), by Ashall contributing $10 (10 x $1 shares) and by Taggert contributing $150,000 (30 x $1 shares at a premium of $149,970).  Interium was to have paid-up capital of $100, which was raised by contributions of $30 (30 x $1 shares) from each of Matyear, Buick and Taggert, and of $10 (10 x $1 shares) from Ashall, together with a ‘premium issued’ (as Mews described it) of $99,960, giving total capital of $100,060.  All four men were to be directors of Interium, in addition to having various working roles in that company:  Taggert was to be General Manager and responsible for accounts and finance, and record-keeping; Buick was to be responsible for sales in Victoria; Matyear was to be responsible for sales elsewhere; and Ashall and Matyear together were to be responsible for research and development, and production.

  8                     Mews set out various ‘action steps’ that needed to be taken, and under the heading ‘Other Matters’, he stated:

  ‘Prismex Technologies Pty Ltd will also licence its patent to Interium Pty Ltd who will hold the master licence for Australia.  Interium Pty Ltd may then issue sub licences to other parties.’

  9                     Prismex Technologies was registered on 15 June 1995, and Interium was registered on 30 June 1995.

  10                  On 12 July 1995, two significant agreements were executed.  Each was drafted by solicitors engaged by Ashlar.  The first was an agreement to assign the patent, certain formulae and other property from Ashlar to Prismex Technologies (‘the assignment agreement’).  The sealing of the assignment agreement by Prismex Technologies was witnessed by Buick and Taggert.  The second was an agreement for the sale of business from Ashlar to Interium (‘the sale of business agreement’).  The sealing of the sale of business agreement by Interium was also witnessed by Buick and Taggert.  By these two agreements Ashlar, which had previously owned the patent and exploited the invention in its business, divested itself of the patent and the business, but each to a separate party.

  11                  By the assignment agreement, in consideration of the payment of $150,000 (paid in full at execution), Ashlar assigned the patent to Prismex Technologies absolutely, together with items which were listed in a schedule to that agreement as follows:

  ·          CURRENT PRISMEX DOT MATRIX PRINTING INK MIXTURE

  ·          CURRENT DOT MATRIX PRINTING FILMS

  ·          COPY OF CURRENT PRISMEX DOT MATRIX PROGRAMME DISCS

  ·          PROVISION FOR ACCESS TO ALL INK FORMULAE FILMS AND PROGRAMME DISCS RELATING TO THE MANUFACTURE OF PRISMEX PANELS

  12                  There were several provisions of the assignment agreement that recognised that Interium, not a party to that agreement, would be the trading entity that exploited the invention.  Prismex Technologies was obliged to ‘procure’ that Interium paid royalties to Ashlar for a 5-year period at the rate of 5% of the net proceeds (as defined therein) derived by Interium from sales of Prismex panels into the Australian market.  Prismex Technologies was obliged to ‘procure’ that Interium notified Ashlar of its intention to sell or dispose of the Prismex panel business over the ensuing 5 years.  If Interium went into liquidation, or if a receiver were appointed to Interium, Prismex Technologies itself was obliged, for the balance of the 5-year period, to pay an annual royalty to Ashlar equal to the average annual royalty that had been paid by Interium down to the date of liquidation or appointment of the receiver.  The assignment agreement was supported by guarantees in favour of Ashlar given not only by the directors of Prismex Technologies, but also by the directors of Interium (who were, of course, the same people).

  13                  By the sale of business agreement, in consideration of the payment of $30,000 by instalments over the ensuing 12 months, Ashlar sold its business to Interium.  The ‘business’ was defined as ‘the business of screenprinting’.  Goodwill, and a wide range of specific and general assets, passed under that agreement, as did –

  ‘… all trade marks and trade names copyrights, inventions, discoveries, patents, other than Patent No. 647834, trade secrets, know-how and other industrial property or rights … whether the same are registered or registrable or not ….’

  As noted at the outset, patent No. 647834 was the patent. Under the sale of business agreement, Interium was obliged to pay royalties to Ashlar for a 5-year period at the rate of 5% of the net proceeds (as defined therein) derived by Interium from sales of Prismex panels into the Australian market.  This was Interium’s primary obligation in relation to royalties, payment of which, under the assignment agreement, Prismex Technologies was obliged to procure.  Interium was obliged to notify Ashlar of its intention to sell or dispose of the Prismex panel business over the ensuing 5 years.

  14                  In each of the assignment agreement and the sale of business agreement there were three recitals.  Recital C in the assignment agreement was:

  ‘[Prismex Technologies] has agreed to grant a perpetual licence under the Patent to Interium …, and to procure Interium to pay a royalty to [Ashlar]  in respect of use of the patented invention.’

  Recital C in the sale of business agreement was:

  ‘[Ashlar] has agreed to assign its Patent No. 647834 to Prismex Technologies …, which has agreed to grant a perpetual licence to [Interium] to exploit the invention.’

  15                  The sale of business agreement contained a series of warranties by Ashlar, most of which were appropriate to be given by a vendor selling a business.  However, the warranties were introduced by the statement that Ashlar ‘hereby warrants and agrees with [Interium] that ….’  One of the warranties which followed was that ‘the Recitals to this Agreement are true and accurate’.  This provision assumed some importance in the present proceeding, as it was said (on behalf of Keller) that it constituted an assent by Taggert and Buick, who witnessed the execution of the agreement by Interium and who were, at the time, also directors of Prismex Technologies, to the truth and accuracy of the statement in the above recital that Prismex Technologies had agreed to grant a perpetual licence of the patent to Interium.  The agreement to which Prismex Technologies itself was a party, the assignment agreement, did not contain such a warranty.

  16                  Although it is common ground that, in those months, Prismex Technologies did grant to Interium an exclusive licence, there is no document constituting or (save for the assignment agreement and the sale of business agreement) evidencing the licence.  It is also common ground that, at the meeting on 9 June 1995, those who were to become the directors of both companies planned that Prismex Technologies would grant a licence to Interium to exploit the invention, yet it cannot be suggested that the licence was, at that meeting, granted orally, since neither Prismex Technologies nor Interium existed at the time.  What the individuals were discussing at the meeting was what would happen, not what thereby did happen.

  17                  Nothing further was said or written on the subject of the licence of the patent to Interium until events of 2006 in which the subject became controversial and in relation to which the participants in the events of June and July 1995 were in dispute.

  18                  From the time of those events, Interium carried on the business of developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling edge-lit signs utilising the technology protected by the patent.  The four initial venturers all had management roles in Interium:  Taggert was Managing Director, Matyear was NSW Business Development Manager/Sales Manager, Ashall was Technical Director and Buick was a director and Victorian Sales Manager.  The latter was removed as a director, and dismissed as an employee, in 1996. 

  19                  In 1998, Interium applied for the registration of the trade mark ‘PRISMEX’.  Registration of the mark was achieved in 2000, and Interium remains the registered owner.

  20                  To the observer, Interium was the only company involved in the ‘Prismex’ name or technology.  Not only was it Interium, not Prismex Technologies, that used the word in trade:  on a number of occasions Interium, not Prismex Technologies, took proceedings to protect its interest in the patent, including taking opposition proceedings when third parties sought to register new patents considered to be relevant to the patent.  From its incorporation in 1995 until the dispute which gave rise to the present proceeding, it seems, Prismex Technologies did virtually nothing.  It did not even have a bank account.  However, given the common shareholding and office-holdings within the two companies, Prismex Technologies must be taken to have been aware of Interium’s exploitation of the invention, thereby justifying the suggestion that there was at least an implied licence to do so;  and, given Prismex Technologies’ own state of quiescence, it would take little extra to imply that the licence was intended to be exclusive (that is to say, exclusive of the rights of any other person, including the patentee itself).  This latter aspect is not one which I am required to decide, since the existence of an exclusive licence is established on the pleadings.

  21                  At this point I should say something about the manufacturing process in which the invention was exploited.  In the early 1990’s, while employed by Ashlar, Ashall caused to be printed on to a sheet of acetate film, about 1200 mm square, millions of small dots in a particular matrix.  The size and spacing of these dots was critical to the effectiveness of the invention.  This particular piece of film was referred to by Ashall as the ‘B-Dot’ film.  The next step was to engage a commercial silk screen printer to produce a pattern on a silk screen from the dots on the film.  This silk screen was then used in the process of manufacturing the clear acrylic panels, about 10 mm in thickness it would seem, which were incorporated into the signs which Ashlar, and later Interium, manufactured.  Using the silk screen, the matrix of dots was reproduced on to both sides of a panel, and the panel, with dots, was then placed immediately behind the front image of the sign in question.  Then, as Ashall said in his evidence, ‘you place the lamps down the side, the light travels through the acrylic and hits all these dots and they all light up’.  The presence of the dots on both sides of the panel is said greatly to enhance the brilliance and evenness of the spread of the illumination across the whole sign.

  22                  It is evident that the physical item which is critical in the manufacturing process is the acetate film on which the dots are placed.  The original ‘B-Dot’ film which Ashall produced in the early 1990’s was used by Interium to the end.  It had not been replaced by another film of the same dimensions.  It could be, and presumably has been, used over and again for the production of silk screens with the corresponding matrix of dots.  Silk screens themselves may, apparently, be used many times for the production of acrylic panels, but they are intrinsically delicate in their main component (the screen), which may have to be replaced from time to time when it suffers damage.  The acetate film, by contrast, is quite robust.  While working for Ashlar, Ashall produced a larger film which he described as the ‘D-Dot’ film, and later in the service of Interium he produced two smaller films, the ‘A-Dot’ film and the ‘C-Dot’ film.  The production of these films from the original ‘B-Dot’ film was a relatively simple matter:  Ashall explained that he merely instructed the outside supplier contracted to produce such things to expand, or to shrink, the pattern on the film to the desired size, and this was done, proportionally in all directions, by computer.  In the result, the sizes of the dots themselves, and the distances between dots, were increased or decreased when films of different overall sizes were produced.

  23                  Returning to the course of events which preceded the present litigation, in 2003 Interium encountered serious cash flow problems as a result, it seems, of the failure of a particular overseas joint venture.  This apparently left Interium with unpaid debts, and these were purchased by National Australia Bank (‘the Bank’) in June 2004 under what was described as a debtor finance facility.  By way of security, the Bank took a fixed and floating charge over Interium’s assets. 

  24                  In 2003 Taggert was removed from his position as Managing Director of Interium, and in 2004 he resigned as director.  Ashall’s employment with Interium was terminated on 10 April 2006.  In May and June 2006, the only one of the original four venturers who remained actively working in the business of Interium was Matyear, although Taggert and Ashall (or interests associated with them) remained shareholders, and Ashall remained a director.

  25                  On 10 May 2006, the Bank terminated Interium’s debtor finance facility and demanded that Interium immediately repurchase the debts which it had sold to the Bank in 2004, a transaction which would have involved the payment of about $128,300.  Interium could not and did not repurchase the debts, but on 11 May 2006 Matyear himself paid out the Bank and took an assignment from the Bank of its fixed and floating charge.  On the same day, Matyear demanded repayment of the sum owing by Interium, and stated that, if payment were not made by the close of business on 12 May 2006, he would ‘take such other steps as are necessary to enforce [his] Securities’.  Payment was not forthcoming, and on 15 May 2006 Matyear appointed an administrator to Interium.  At a meeting of creditors held on 22 May 2006, that administrator was replaced by a different administrator, Mr Peter Vince (‘Vince’).

  26                  By letter dated 8 June 2006 to Vince, solicitors for Prismex Technologies noted that their client was the registered proprietor of the patent and was also the owner of the formulae for ink mixtures and films necessary for the manufacture of the Prismex panel.  They noted that Interium used the patent and ink formulae pursuant to the licence.  They noted (from the terms of a creditors’ report dated 31 May 2006) that there were a number of parties interested in purchasing the business and assets of Interium.  They asserted that Interium was incapable of assigning the licence or disclosing the ink formulae to interested purchasers without the permission of Prismex Technologies.  Their letter continued:

  ‘We note that you expect to receive a proposal from one or both of the directors of Interium.  In the event that Interium does not trade on, we are instructed that [Prismex Technologies] will immediately terminate the licence.  Accordingly, any purchaser interested in continuing to use the patent, ink formulae and films must seek permission from [Prismex Technologies].  We are instructed to respond to any enquiries in this regard.’

  27                  At a meeting of creditors of Interium held on Friday 30 June 2006 it was resolved that Interium be wound up.  Vince was the liquidator.  Immediately after the meeting, he negotiated with two parties who were interested in purchasing Interium’s business and assets:  one was a company with which Taggert was associated, and the other was Keller.  Keller’s offer was accepted.  No documentary record of the agreement between Vince and Keller on 30 June is in evidence, but the Managing Director of Keller, Mr Greg Pobke, stated that, as part of the purchase, Keller was required to enter into possession of Interium’s premises ‘under licence’ from the commencement of trade the next business day.

  28                  At some time about 7.15 or 7.30 am on Monday 3 July 2006, Taggert and Ashall entered the premises of Interium, by means of a rear door which was open.  Some employees were at work at that time, and Ashall spoke to one of them who was known to him from his own time working there.  Taggert uplifted cylindrical containers which he believed to contain – and which did contain – the acetate films used in the production of silk screens, and removed them from the premises.  Ashall used a piece of aluminium to slash a number of silk screens which he believed to have – and which did have – representations of dot patterns made from the films taken by Taggert.  By these steps Taggert and Ashall made it practically impossible for the purchaser of Interium’s business, Keller, to exploit the invention.  Ashall also removed an item referred to as a jig from the premises.

  29                  By letter dated 4 July 2006, Vince’s solicitors wrote to the solicitors for Taggert and Ashall.  They mentioned the actions referred to in the previous paragraph, and demanded the return of the films and of the jig.  They said:

  ‘As you are aware, the Prismex technology is an integral part of the business of [Interium] under which [Interium] holds a perpetual licence to use the patented Prismex dot matrix printing ink mixture and dot matrix printing films relating to the manufacture of Prismex panels.’

  30                  Solicitors for Taggert and Ashall – who stated that they also acted for Prismex Technologies – replied on 5 July 2006.  They referred to the assignment agreement.  They continued:

  ‘Recital C of the [assignment agreement] states that [Prismex Technologies] has agreed to grant a perpetual licence under the Patent to Interium.  We are instructed that no written licence between [Prismex Technologies] and Interium came into existence.  Accordingly, the terms of any licence are unclear.  At best, there was an implied licence for Interium to use the Patent and films.  On any view, it cannot be said that such a licence purported to transfer title to the Patent and films to Interium.

  In accordance with ordinary commercial practice, any implied licence terminated immediately upon Interium going into liquidation.  We note that the creditors resolved that Interium be wound up at the meeting on 30 June 2006.  Accordingly, from that date Interium had no lawful entitlement to use the Patent or possess the films.  Indeed, [Prismex Technologies] was entitled to the immediate delivery up of the films.

  We also note that by our letter to Mr Vince dated 8 June 2006, we advised that Interium was incapable of assigning the licence or disclosing the ink formulae to prospective purchasers without the permission of [Prismex Technologies].  [Prismex Technologies] has not provided permission.  Further, we advised that [Prismex Technologies] would immediately terminate the licence if Interium did not trade on.

  ….

  In addition to the licence coming to an end upon Interium being placed into liquidation, our earlier letter served as notice of termination of the licence.  Interium has no further entitlement to use the Patent or the dot matrix films.  Moreover, it has no claim to ownership.  They are the property of [Prismex Technologies].  Accordingly, our clients will not return them.’

  The letter concluded with a statement that the jig taken from Interium’s premises had been made by Taggert’s son-in-law, and did not form part of the assets of Interium.

  31                  On 14 July 2006 a written agreement recording the sale of Interium’s business assets to Keller was executed by Interium, Vince and Keller (‘the asset sale agreement’).  By that agreement, Keller bought all the ‘business assets’ of Interium (with certain presently irrelevant exclusions).  The term ‘business assets’ was defined to include choses in action, intellectual property, licences and permits.  The term ‘choses in action’ was defined to include Interium’s rights against Prismex Technologies, Ashlar, Taggert and Ashall.  The term ‘intellectual property’ meant the rights and interests used by Interium in (inter alia) any patent.  The term ‘licences and permits’ was defined as various generically-expressed rights and interests, but limited ‘to the extent assignable or transferable’ to Keller.  The term ‘Rights’ was defined to mean (inter alia) Interium’s rights ‘to use intellectual property rights in respect of Prismex, as recorded in’ the assignment agreement.  Keller acknowledged that Interium ‘does not have absolute rights to assign or transfer the Rights’.  Interium and Vince promised ‘to use their best endeavours to assign or transfer the Rights’.

  32                  The asset sale agreement also provided that the purchase price of $370,000 (subject to adjustments) would be allocated, for all purposes, as set out in a schedule to the agreement.  That schedule indicated that ‘$NIL’ had been allocated to intellectual property.  It was noted in a recital that, on 3 July 2006, Keller had been given ‘access’ to the premises on the terms set out in a licence annexed to the agreement.  That licence was described as ‘Exclusive Licence to Conduct Business of Interium Pty Limited (In Liquidation)’.  It was executed by Interium and Vince (but not by Keller) on 3 July 2006.  By the operative provisions of the licence, Interium granted to Keller a licence to conduct its business from the premises during the term of the licence.  Keller agreed to ‘use, operate, maintain and repair all of the Business Assets in a normal business manner consistent with past practice.’  It is recorded that Keller took possession of the premises at the ‘commencement of trading’ on 3 July 2006.  The term of the licence was not explicitly stated, but a recital thereto notes that Interium and Vince had agreed to grant a licence to Keller to conduct the business from the commencement of trading on 3 July 2006 until completion of the agreement, then in contemplation, which became the asset sale agreement.  On completion under the asset sale agreement, one of the obligations of Interium and Vince was to deliver to Keller an executed copy of an assignment of the lease pursuant to which Interium occupied the premises.  A copy of the lease itself was annexed to the asset sale agreement: it was a lease of the premises by a company called Berona Nominees Pty Ltd to Interium for a term of 3 years and 2 months commencing on 1 November 2004.

  33                  In the meantime, on 5 July 2006, Taggert procured the incorporation of the second applicant, X-Position Pty Ltd (‘X-Position’).  He is the sole director and his own company is the sole shareholder.  He gave evidence that, on the same day, he and Ashall, being a majority of the directors of Prismex Technologies, caused that company to grant to X-Position an exclusive licence to use the invention and to exploit the invention.  It is proposed that X-Position will carry on business in the manufacture of edge-lit signs.  Ashall is its Technical Manager.

  34                  Two of Interium’s former employees on the sales side, one Brendan O’Rourke and one Phil Talbot, commenced employment with X-Position.  In evidence is an email of 13 July 2006 from Talbot to someone apparently representing a potential customer for edge-lit signs.  Talbot said that Interium had been placed into liquidation, but that ‘all the Prismex technology relating to the manufacture of KFC signs has not been effected [sic] by the demise’ of Interium.  He said that ‘the company who owns all the technology relating to Prismex’ had appointed X-Position to market and promote the signs.  He sent a similar email on 14 July 2006 to someone in Thailand, in which he asserted that X-Position held the ‘exclusive rights to the Prismex edge-lit technology used by tens of thousands of customers throughout Australia and the world’.  He asserted that X-Position could ‘provide you the rights to use Prismex technology within Thailand’.  In evidence also is an email of 31 July 2006 from O’Rourke to another potential customer.  He said that X-Position ‘manufactures quality edge-lit lightboxes and displays using the No. 1 primary light diffusion technology on the market PRISMEXTM’.  He said that X-Position manufactured ‘a wide range of standard and custom-designed edge-lit PRISMEXTM illuminated and non-illuminated signage solutions’.

  35                  At the end of July and the beginning of August 2006 correspondence passed between solicitors for Keller on the one hand and solicitors for Prismex Technologies and X-Position on the other hand in which each asserted their clients’ rights to exploit the invention.  On behalf of Keller it was asserted that Interium had, and that Keller purchased, a perpetual licence.  On behalf of Prismex Technologies and X-Position, that was denied, and it was said that the licence had been terminated by the liquidation of Interium, or by the letter from Prismex Technologies’ solicitors to Vince dated 5 July 2006.

  36                  By letter dated 9 August 2006, IP Australia informed Keller’s solicitors that Keller’s name had been entered in the Register of Patents as licensee in relation to the patent.  This was said to be in accordance with a request from those solicitors received on 3 August 2006, which is not in evidence.  Also, by letter dated 22 August 2006, IP Australia informed the solicitors that Keller was entered in the Register of Trade Marks as the owner of the mark ‘PRISMEX’, with effect from 7 August 2006.

  37                  The present proceedings were commenced by Prismex Technologies and X-Position against Keller on 11 August 2006.  They allege that Interium’s licence to use the patent was terminated on 30 June 2006 when it was placed into liquidation, alternatively by reason of the letter from Prismex Technologies’ solicitors dated 5 July 2006.  They refer to demands previously made that Keller cease to exploit the invention and deliver up any films etc which embodied the patent and any articles made using the patent.  They claim a permanent injunction against infringement, orders for delivery up and damages or an account of profits.  In its Defence, Keller asserts that the licence granted to Interium was both exclusive and perpetual.  As I have mentioned above, Prismex Technologies admits that the licence was exclusive, but denies that it was perpetual.

  38                  By Cross Claim dated 20 September 2006, Keller makes a number of claims against Prismex Technologies, X-Position, Taggert and Ashall.  It alleges that the licence of the patent was both exclusive and perpetual, and that it passed to Keller on the sale of Interium’s business.  It alleges that the letter from Prismex Technologies’ solicitors to Vince on 5 July 2006, and the grant of a licence to X-Position, were breaches of the original licence to Interium.  It says, alternatively, that Keller is the equitable owner of the patent by reason of a constructive trust arising from a series of actions undertaken by Interium, and statements by Taggert, in relation to the patent since 1995 (which I shall mention in more detail in due course).  It alleges that X-Position has infringed the patent by manufacturing, selling etc articles made in accordance with the invention.  It alleges that X-Position, by using the trade mark ‘PRISMEX’ in the course of trade, has infringed that mark, and that Prismex Technologies authorised the use of the mark by X-Position.  It alleges that the exploitation of the invention and the use of the trade mark by X-Position, and the purported licence and authorisation by Prismex Technologies of X-Position to do these things, constituted a representation by both companies in trade and commerce that they were ‘entitled to engage in such conduct’, that that representation was misleading or deceptive, and that breaches of ss 52 and 53 (c), (d) and (g) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) resulted.  It says that Prismex Technologies and X-Position made unjustified threats of patent infringement.  It alleges the acts of Taggert and Ashall at the former premises of Interium on the morning of 3 July 2006, and says that they amounted to trespass to land and to goods, and conversion.  It also makes a number of claims of accessorial involvement against the cross-respondents.

  39                  The trial of the proceeding was expedited, and was conducted on 11, 12 and 13 October 2006.  Part of the way through the trial, it appeared that Keller was working to the assumption that the trial, at this stage, was concerned with issues of liability only, and that questions of remedy would be heard subsequently.  This assumption was not shared by the applicants or the cross-respondents.  I heard short argument on the matter, the result of which was that, on 13 October 2006, I ruled that the issue of liability on the Application and the Cross Claim be heard and determined prior to the issue of quantum.

  40                  I shall consider first the main issue in the proceeding:  whether the licence to exploit the invention granted to Interium in 1995 was not only exclusive but also perpetual, in the sense of being irrevocable by Prismex Technologies.  It is alleged by Prismex Technologies, and admitted by Keller, that, by an agreement made in or about July 1995, Prismex Technologies granted a licence to Interium to use and exploit the invention.  Prismex Technologies makes no further allegation about that agreement.  There is no reference to any other terms of the agreement or to the consideration (if any) given by Interium for the grant of the licence.  Neither are such matters raised by Keller in its Defence.   Rather, in its Cross Claim, Keller alleges that, in or around June and July 1995, Prismex Technologies granted a perpetual and exclusive licence to exploit the invention to Interium.  It is not suggested that this was pursuant to a contract.  That an exclusive licence was granted in about June 1995 is admitted by Prismex Technologies in its Defence to the Cross Claim; but the grant of a perpetual licence is denied.

  41                  In support of its argument that the licence was irrevocable, Keller submitted that the licence was a species of property which was assignable (Vitamins Australia Ltd v Beta-carotene Industries Pty Ltd (1987) 9 IPR 41), and that a licence ‘coupled with an interest’ was irrevocable, absent express contractual provision (Cowell v Rosehill Racecourse Co Ltd (1937) 56 CLR 605, 616).  It argued that, in this context, an ‘interest’ was an interest in property, real or personal (Hounslow LBC v Trigonum Garden Developments Ltd [1971] Ch 233, 254).  If it was intended, by these arguments, to advance the proposition that, in the absence of express provision to the contrary, a licence of a patent was necessarily irrevocable (because it was a species of property), I am bound to say that the argument strikes me as entirely circular.  If a licence arises pursuant to contract, the nature and incidents thereof will be given content by the terms of the contract in question.  As Megarry J said in Hounslow, ‘a contractual licence is not an entity distinct from the contract which brings it into being, but merely one of the provisions of that contract.’ [1971] Ch at 254.  It may be that an irrevocable licence (such as the licence expressed to be for the unexpired portion of the patent in the facts before the court in Vitamins Australia) might, in certain circumstances, be regarded as a species of property, but manifestly it cannot be argued that, simply because the phenomenon in question is a patent licence and can be regarded for some purposes as property, the licence cannot be revoked.  If it is a licence subtended from a contract, all will depend on the terms of that contract, and I can think of no reason why the express terms thereof only should be taken into account.  If it is a licence created not by contract but by the voluntary act of the patentee, the question whether the patentee reserved a power of revocation would be a question of fact from case to case.  Accordingly, the task for the court in the present case is to look at all the facts and circumstances which surrounded the grant of the licence by Prismex Technologies in 1995, and to decide, by reference to implications as well as to express terms, whether that grant was intended to be irrevocable.

  42                  It is important to identify the nature of the transaction – even if implied – by which Prismex Technologies granted the licence to Interium in 1995.  There was nothing ostensibly contractual in the plans of the venturers which led to the patent being held by one company, and the trading being done by the other.  Their discussions did not clearly involve a conscious exchange.  Neither did Interium provide, on behalf of Prismex Technologies, any part of the cash consideration for the patent.  The whole $150,000 was paid by Prismex Technologies from shareholders’ equity.  However, under the sale of business agreement, Interium paid royalties to Ashlar.  Were these payments referable to the patent, or only to the business which Interium had acquired from Ashlar?  I think the former.  The purchase price under the sale of business agreement was the sum of $30,000.  Royalties were a separate matter.  Furthermore, royalties were payable specifically ‘in respect of Prismex panels sold into the Australian market’.  The business purchased by Interium, on the other hand, was something wider: it was ‘the business of screenprinting’.  Evidently, the business involved more than merely the bundle of activities involved in exploiting the invention.

  43                  It must be remembered that the two-company arrangement devised in 1995 was for the benefit of the venturers and their new business, not Ashlar.  It was intended that Prismex Technologies would not trade, and would have no income.  It is, therefore, unsurprising that it was not that company upon which the primary obligation to pay royalties was imposed.  Put another way, the fact that Interium was subject to that primary obligation is not, in context, inconsistent with the proposition that those royalties were in fact part of the consideration passing to Ashlar for the assignment of the patent.  The fact that they were tied not to Interium’s total turnover but to Australian sales of Prismex panels strengthens the implication that they were.  The matter is taken further in the same direction by the terms of Recital C to the assignment agreement which refers to the royalties as being ‘in respect of use of the patented invention’.

  44                  In the circumstances, I consider that the correct way to view the transactions of mid-1995 is to treat Interium’s promise to pay royalties to Ashlar under the sale of business agreement as having been made pursuant to an implied contract between Interium and Prismex Technologies, and as consideration for the latter’s implied promise to allow – ie to license – Interium to use the patent. This has two possible consequences for the resolution of the question with which I am presently concerned.  First, Keller’s task of establishing that the licence was irrevocable is made a little less daunting than it might otherwise have been by virtue of the fact that Interium was not a mere volunteer, but a party which provided consideration.  Secondly, in identifying the implied terms of the licence, it will be the presumed intentions of both companies, not those of Prismex Technologies alone, which will be relevant.

  45                  Before turning to the axis of the relationship between Prismex Technologies and Interium, however, I should consider the nature of the obligations owed by each of them to Ashlar under the assignment agreement and the sale of business agreement.  Under the sale of business agreement, Interium was obliged to pay royalties to Ashlar over a period of 5 years from the making of that agreement.  I have found that those royalties were implicitly referrable to the exploitation of the invention.  Even if not, it seems to have been the common assumption of all in 1995 that the exploitation of the invention was likely to be the main driver of Interium’s sales of Prismex panels.  It may be thought odd, in those circumstances, that the assignment agreement contained no express covenant by Prismex Technologies not to revoke the licence within the 5-year period.  Had the licence been revoked, it would be a fair inference that Interium’s revenue from the sale of Prismex panels would have suffered, probably quite severely.  This would have had a direct impact on Ashlar’s receipts of royalties, something which, I infer, Ashlar would not have intended.  By what provision of either of the agreements in 1995 did Ashlar protect itself from such an eventuality?  If the circumstances were sufficiently serious to drive Interium into liquidation, Prismex Technologies would have been obliged to assume the obligation of paying the royalties.  But, short of that, the agreements did not deal with a situation in which Prismex Technologies simply chose to revoke the licence, thereby impairing Interium’s capacity to continue paying royalties to Ashlar.

  46                  There are two possible explanations for the absence from the assignment agreement of any express obligation on the part of Prismex Technologies not to revoke the licence during the period of Ashlar’s receipt of royalties.  The first is that the parties’ solicitors at the time may have regarded the agreement as within the class of contracts under which the co-operation of one party was necessary to enable the other party to have the full benefit of the agreement.  For Prismex Technologies, without proper cause being given by Interium, to have revoked the licence before Ashlar had received the benefit of its 5 years of royalties would in all likelihood have been regarded as a breach of the implied term of co-operation.  If there were such a term, it would supply the deficiency to which I referred at the start of this paragraph. At the same time, if the problem were solved in that way, there would be no basis for the implication of a term to the effect that the licence could not be revoked after the end of the first 5-year period.

  47                  The second explanation is that Ashlar’s concerns may have been put to rest by Recital C of the assignment agreement.  That recital is the only statement by Prismex Technologies directly on the matter now in controversy, and it contains an unqualified statement that the licence was perpetual.  Understandably, Recital C featured large in Keller’s case that the licence was irrevocable.  Keller contended that ‘perpetual’ meant for ever (ie for the remainder of the term of the patent).  It relied upon Taggert and Buick – who were two of Prismex Technologies’ directors at the time – having witnessed the execution of the sale of business agreement which contained a similar recital which Interium agreed was true and accurate.  In these respects Keller made points which were of considerable forensic effect, but ultimately they begged the questions at issue.  Those questions were, first, why did the parties to the assignment agreement include Recital C therein, secondly, what did those parties mean by the word ‘perpetual’, and thirdly (and critically) what was the content of the agreement between Prismex Technologies and Interium on the subject?

  48                  It seems that neither Taggert nor Matyear has any recollection of why the licence was described as perpetual in Recital C.  When he was taken to the recital, and reminded that his signature appeared on the assignment agreement, Taggert denied that the licence was in fact perpetual, adding:  ‘It was a licence.  Neither here nor there on that perpetual part.’  This was of course, an entirely self-serving response, and I give it little weight on the matter of the parties’ intentions in 1995.  Matyear was cross-examined about the assignment agreement at some length.  When asked whether there was a practical reason for keeping the patent separate from Interium, Matyear said:

  ‘We never actually discussed any reasons why we did it other than it was separated into a separate entity as a precaution, basically, that is all it was.  We just - there was never any reasons given.  It was never logically thought through to say these are the conditions under which it is going to be done even to the point where Ashlar actually set the agenda for the terms under which Prismex Technologies used its own licence.  Ashlar wrote out the document that we all signed that stated the patent would be a perpetual - given to Interium in a perpetual licence.  If we had sat down and discussed the matter we would have said, thank you, sell the patent to us and then we will decide what to do with it.  We had the company selling it to us telling us what to do with our patent.’

  Evidently Matyear had little or no actual recollection of the purpose of particular parts of the assignment agreement that now assume some importance.  He said that the agreement would have been considered by their own solicitors, and he presumed, in effect, that they were happy with it.  Taken specifically to Recital C, his cross-examination proceeded:

  ‘Well, you didn't turn your mind to that paragraph did you and consider its implications?‑‑‑I am sure I did at the time.  So, yes, we were happy to have a perpetual licence.  So we basically – the document, we were happy with and we signed it.’

  This evidence too was self-serving, and of about the same utility in the present circumstances as the corresponding, but contrary, evidence of Taggert to which I referred above.  

  49                  From the tenor of this part of Matyear’s evidence, I consider that he and his colleagues were ‘happy’ to have a perpetual licence only in the sense that he presumed, in hindsight, that their solicitors would have drawn attention to any provision in the agreement that was problematic, and they apparently did not do so in relation to Recital C.  Having perused the assignment agreement and the sale of business agreement, I cannot accept that each was the work only of Ashlar’s solicitors to the exclusion of any professional input on behalf of Prismex Technologies or Interium.  The agreements contain many provisions which bespeak the careful attention of solicitors engaged by the latter companies, and I am satisfied that Matyear was correct in his supposition that their own solicitors would have drawn attention to any issues that arose in relation to this recital.

  50                  The fact remains that the assignment agreement was not intended to regulate the relations between Prismex Technologies and Interium.  To give content to Recital C, it is necessary to ask why Prismex Technologies and Ashlar, the parties to that agreement, would have included the recital.  I can think of no reason why Prismex Technologies would have pressed for its inclusion.  I think it much more likely that this was one provision which found its way into the agreement on the initiative of Ashlar’s solicitors, and which the solicitors for Prismex Technologies accepted. 

  51                  Ashlar would seem to have had two reasons for wanting some comfort that the licence of the patent to Interium would endure.  The first was its entitlement to royalties from Interium over the initial 5 years.  That entitlement would not sustain an inference that the parties intended the licence to continue beyond that 5-year period.  And the interest which Ashlar notionally had over the first 5 years did not even, within that period, extend to a circumstance in which Interium was liquidated, since that eventuality was covered by the obligation of Prismex Technologies itself to pay royalties to Ashlar in place of Interium. 

  52                  Ashlar’s second reason for wanting the licence to endure was that it had another basis for a continuing interest in the viability and manufacturing activities of Interium.  The royalties due to Ashlar under the sale of business agreement related only to Interium’s sale of Prismex panels into the Australian market.  Under the heading ‘Ongoing Relationship’ in that agreement, the parties agreed to ‘co-operate in relation to the ongoing marketing and development of framing systems incorporating the Prismex panels’.  At Ashlar’s request, Interium was obliged to make its premises available for demonstration of Prismex panels by Ashlar to its (Ashlar’s) international customers.  If requested by Ashlar, Interium was obliged to supply Prismex panels to Ashlar for export to Ashlar’s customers out of Australia.  If the parties could not agree on price, Interium was obliged to procure a royalty-free licence from Prismex Technologies for Ashlar to manufacture (but not to deal in) Prismex panels in Australia.  Each of these obligations was supported by a corresponding provision in the assignment agreement under which Prismex Technologies was required to procure Interium to perform.  Specifically, under that agreement Prismex Technologies itself was obliged to grant a royalty-free licence to Ashlar in the event that Ashlar and Interium were unable to agree on price.  These provisions were not limited by reference to the 5-year period.  Little was made of these provisions in the hearing before me, but at one point Ashall did express disappointment that, at some stage, his ex-partners had ‘stolen’ his interest in the international patent.  However that may be, these provisions seem to be based upon an assumption by all three parties that Interium would hold a licence to exploit the invention at all times while the two agreements remained in force.  The fact that the agreements were not limited in point of time might sustain the argument that an indefinite licence was intended.

  53                  I infer that Recital C was inserted into the assignment agreement at the request of Ashlar, and predominantly to give Ashlar comfort that Interium would be able to exploit the invention over the period in the future in which Ashlar had a continuing interest in Interium’s operations.  That interest was strongest, and most focussed, in the first 5 years.  After that, Ashlar had no further direct financial interest in Interium’s sales of Prismex panels.  It did, however, continue to have an interest of the kind referred to in the previous paragraph.  That interest, although more general, provides a basis for inferring to Ashlar an assumption that the licence would continue indefinitely, and an intention that Recital C should reflect that assumption.  Since Prismex Technologies was the other party to the assignment agreement and was content to have this recital included therein, it too must be fixed with that assumption and that intention.  

  54                  I do, therefore, hold that the inclusion of Recital C in the assignment agreement, and the terms of that recital, support Keller’s argument that the licence was intended to be irrevocable.  That support is, however, indirect, since the licence was granted not pursuant to the assignment agreement at all, but pursuant to an implied contract between Prismex Technologies and Interium.  In this respect, it is significant that Recital C did not record the fact of an existing licence: it stated that Prismex Technologies ‘has agreed’ to grant a perpetual licence to Interium.  The fact is that, although such an agreement existed, it was not constituted by any express written or oral communication between the companies concerned.  On the evidence, the only express reference to the licence occurred at a meeting which took place before the incorporation of either company.  If that reference may be taken as a basis for a finding as to the terms of an agreement which was later adopted by the companies (a construction of events which would be consistent with the way all parties conducted the case before me), the fact is that there is no suggestion that anyone said that the licence would be perpetual, or anything of the sort.  There appears to have been no other communication as between Prismex Technologies and Interium about the licence.  Indeed, on the evidence, I could only find that there was no overt act – written or oral – which constituted the granting of the licence.  It is not as though the court may look to Recital C to confirm or to provide greater clarity about some identified transaction as between the parties directly concerned.  There is, therefore, something artificial about using Recital C as a means of throwing light on the assumed transaction between Prismex Technologies and Interium.  Since that transaction existed only as an implication, I consider that the surer route to an identification of the (necessarily implied) terms thereof is to look objectively at the facts and circumstances surrounding the relationship between Prismex Technologies and Interium in 1995 with a view to imputing to them their respective intentions as to the term of the licence.

  55                  Prominent amongst those facts and circumstances is the apparent purpose of the two-company structure devised in 1995.  I place no reliance on the identification of that purpose given by the three then players who gave evidence in the case:  I think that the passage of years, and the strong identification which each now has with the position of a party in this proceeding, presents such a risk of reconstruction as to make any such reliance unwise.  However, Mews’ memorandum of 9 June 1995 stated:

  ‘The purpose of separating the operations and the patent is to protect the value of the patent in the event of any litigation or law suits which may arise to Interium Pty Ltd.’

  The only, or at least the most obvious, threat to the patent arising from ‘litigation or law suits’ affecting the patentee would be where the solvency of the patentee was thereby affected to such an extent that its assets would be at risk of being sold to third parties.  For Prismex Technologies to have granted an exclusive, and irrevocable, licence would have so closely approximated an assignment of the patent itself as to defeat the apparent purpose of the two-company structure.  The very people into whose hands the original venturers would have been most concerned to prevent the patent from falling – their competitors – would have been the ones with the greatest incentive to purchase the assets of Interium, if that company were to have failed.  Such competitors could, by buying the assets and thereby the licence, have effectively acquired the patent and have put themselves, rather than the inventor and his associates, in a position commercially to exploit the invention over many years.  This was the very thing which, according to Mews’ memorandum, the venturers sought to avoid.  I consider, therefore, that an identification of the purpose of the two-company structure points rather strongly to an implication that the licence was to be revocable by Prismex Technologies at least in circumstances where the liquidation of Interium was imminent.

  56                  The other circumstance which strikes me as of considerable importance is the provision of the assignment agreement which operated if Interium went into liquidation, or a receiver were appointed, within the 5-year period.  Manifestly, if Prismex Technologies were, as was its obligation, to make the royalty payments thenceforth to Ashlar directly, the assumption would have been that Prismex Technologies would have the benefit of the invention for the purpose of generating income from which the royalty payments might be financed.  That Interium might be liquidated and lose, or be obliged to assign, the licence to a third party without Prismex Technologies being able to do anything about it, while at the same time Prismex Technologies was obliged to continue making royalty payments, could not have been intended.  Although this consideration is linked to the prospect of Interium being liquidated within the 5-year period, and is therefore of limited application, it does tell rather strongly against the argument that the licence could not be revoked in any circumstances.

  57                  Taking everything into account, the one objective conclusion which shines clearly through a constructional setting which is in other respects somewhat murky is that the retention of the licence by Interium in its own liquidation could never have been intended.  I find as a minimum that, whatever the agreed term of the licence otherwise was, the licence was revocable by Prismex Technologies if the liquidation of Interium were imminent.  At the other end of the spectrum, I consider that, if Interium continued to trade normally, it was implicit that Prismex Technologies would not revoke the licence within the first 5 years, while Interium was obliged to make royalty payments to Ashlar.  The intermediate situation, in which the 5-year period had passed uneventfully and Interium was not at risk of liquidation, is unclear.   The objective circumstances do not clearly point to an implication one way or the other on the matter of the revocability of the licence.  I am somewhat disposed to the view that there is nothing which would justify the implication of a contractual restraint upon the patentee’s power of revocation, but questions would then arise as to how, and on what notice, such revocation could be effected.  I am spared the need to address such questions in the present case, since my finding that the power of revocation could be exercised when the liquidation of Interium was imminent is sufficient in the circumstances.

  58                  The next question is whether Prismex Technologies did revoke the licence in the events which occurred in 2006.  It was submitted on behalf of Prismex Technologies that its solicitor’s letter of 8 June 2006 constituted a notice of termination.  On behalf of Keller, it was submitted that that letter did no more than to foreshadow some later act on the part of Prismex Technologies by which the licence would be terminated.  In my view, the distinction made on behalf of Keller is not such as would be obvious to practical business people in the industry concerned.  Within a practical context, I consider that the letter effectively notified Interium that it should treat the licence as terminated if it went into liquidation.

  59                  If there were any doubt about it, that doubt was removed by Prismex Technologies’ solicitors’ letter to Vince’s solicitors dated 5 July 2006.  Although postulating a legal proposition which Prismex Technologies did not seek to defend before me (that the licence terminated upon Interium going into liquidation ‘in accordance with ordinary commercial practice’), the letter left the reader in no doubt but that Prismex Technologies, as grantor of the licence, regarded the licence as terminated upon the act of liquidation.  Although it is true that Prismex Technologies could not have terminated the licence retrospectively, when read in the light of the earlier letter of 8 June 2006, (and if that letter was not, of itself, sufficient to terminate the licence by notice), the letter of 5 July 2006 at least had that effect from the date of receipt by Vince.  I hold, however, that the licence to exploit the invention granted to Interium was terminated by Prismex Technologies on 30 June 2006.

  60                  It was next contended on behalf of Keller in the alternative that Interium was, and that Keller itself now is, the owner in equity of the patent, as distinct from, or possibly in addition to, being the licensee.  The factual basis of that claim was that, over the period between its incorporation in June 1995 and its liquidation in June 2006, Interium had taken all the practical steps necessary to protect the patent, and generally represented to the world at large that it was the patentee.  Keller relied upon the following facts and circumstances:

  a.                   On 7 August 1995, Interium referred the assignment from Ashlar to Prismex Technologiesto its solicitors for purposes of registration.

  b.                  In 1996, Taggert prepared a company profile for Interium, in which one of the components of the business was described as ‘owners of the “Prismex” edge-lit system patent in Australia …’

  c.                   On 11 August 1995, Taggert, on behalf of Interium, sent a promotional facsimile to a Chinese company in which various configurations of possible business relationships were discussed, including the grant of a non-exclusive licence, or the grant of an exclusive licence, each of which would, it was said, secure for the grantee access to Prismex technology.

  d.                  On 23 October 1995, Taggert, on behalf of Interium, sent a facsimile to a company called Delta Electronics, in which he introduced himself as a director of Interium ‘the purchaser of the Australian Prismex patent along with the existing business previously operated by Ashlar Screenprints.’

  e.                   At a meeting of the management committee of Interium on 9 January 1996, attended by Ashall, Buick, Matyear, and Taggert, a patent violation which had come to the attention of those present was discussed.  The minutes of the meeting noted: ‘It was agreed by all parties that infringement of Interium’s patent should be pursued.’

  f.                    On 7 March 1996, Taggert, on behalf of Interium, sent a facsimile to a company called Win Win International, in which he explained why it was not possible for Prismex products to be sold into Hong Kong.  In that facsimile, Taggert said: ‘The patent we hold is for Australia, there are other patents granted and pending for various countries, these are held by other parties listed below.’  The parties appear to be interests associated with IRG, and did not include Prismex Technologies.

  g.                   On 18 September 1997, Taggert sent a facsimile, on Interium paper, to a company called Phillips Lighting, in which it was stated that Interium ‘is the Prismex technologies patent holder here in Australia.’

  h.                   In June 1998, Taggert caused an advertisement to appear in an information newsletter called ‘Info-link’, which opened with the words: ‘Interium P/L design and manufacture a range of ultra-slim illuminated displays, incorporating their patented PRISMEX optical system.’

  i.                     On 22 April 1999, Taggert sent a facsimile to a company called ACI Acrylics in India, in which Interium’s background was described in a series of representations including the following: ‘Australian Prismex representatives and Patent owners, company formed to commercialise the Prismex technology invented by Mr John Ashall (Interium – Technical Director).’

  j.                    In 1999, Taggert prepared a 32-page ‘Export Marketing Plan’ that was submitted to Austrade on behalf of Interium.  The executive summary in that presentation contained the following statement: ‘Interium … was set up in 1995 and purchased the Australian patent for the Australian invented Prismex illuminated sign technology.’

  k.                  Interium, not Prismex Technologies, was the opponent to patent application No. 683874, and incurred costs of approximately $20,000 in connection with that opposition.

  l.                     Interium, not Prismex Technologies, was the opponent to patent applications Nos. 720265, 755876, and 683878 and paid all costs in connection therewith. 

  m.                 Interium was involved in what is described as ‘an intellectual property dispute’ with a company called 3M Australia, and paid all costs in connection therewith.

  n.                   Interium paid all legal bills in connection with an action (by Interium) against a company called Australian Posters for infringement of the patent.

  61                  Keller relied on the fact that Prismex Technologies had observed all this activity by Interium without a word of demur, and had silently taken advantage of the expenditure of time and effort that Interium had put into the protection of the patent, the result of which was that equity would not now allow Prismex Technologies to deny Interium’s ownership of the patent.  In this respect, Keller relied upon the following passage from the judgment of Deane J in Muschinski v Dodds (1985) 160 CLR 583, 614:

  ‘Viewed in its modern context, the constructive trust can properly be described as a remedial institution which equity imposes regardless of actual or presumed agreement or intention (and subsequently protects) to preclude the retention or assertion of beneficial ownership of property to the extent that such retention or assertion would be contrary to equitable principle.’

  Keller relied also on the following statement by his Honour (160 CLR at 621):

  ‘Notions of what is fair and just are relevant but only in the confined context of determining whether conduct should, by reference to legitimate processes of legal reasoning, be characterized as unconscionable for the purposes of a specific principle of equity whose rationale and operation is to prevent wrongful and undue advantage being taken by one party of a benefit derived at the expense of the other party in the special circumstances of the unforeseen and premature collapse of a joint relationship or endeavour.’

  Keller submitted, in effect, that it should be regarded as unconscionable for Prismex Technologies now to seek to take advantage of the fact that it is the registered patentee.

  62                  I shall consider first Keller’s claims in equity to the extent that they rely on Prismex Technologies’ acceptance of a history of representations, on behalf of Interium, to the effect that it occupied the position of patentee.  I find it difficult to see how these claims could succeed. The question here is not whether Prismex Technologies would be precluded, as against a third party who had relied upon Interium’s assertions of ownership, from denying the truth of those assertions.  The question is whether the silence of Prismex Technologies, in the face of claims to ownership by Interium, would make it unconscionable for the former to assert its ownership rights as against the latter.  The question needs only to be stated in this way for a negative answer to be obvious.  However convenient it may have been for Interium to give the impression to the world at large that it was the owner of the patent, and however much Prismex Technologies might have stood by while that impression was given, nothing involved in those matters could in any way be regarded as affecting the conscience of Prismex Technologies in its dealings with Interium.  All those involved in both companies well knew the true legal position, at least to the extent that Prismex Technologies was the patentee and Interium the licensee.  That they did not bother to inform third parties of the true position was simply the way they carried on business.

  63                  Turning next to so much of Keller’s claim in equity as alleges a constructive trust based upon Interium’s considerable expenditure over the years to protect the patent, again it seems to me that this was but an incident of the way these two companies carried on business.  For its part, Prismex Technologies, although the patentee, effectively turned over to Interium, to the exclusion of itself, the opportunity to exploit the invention.  As a result, the whole commercial benefit of the patent was derived by Interium: and none of it by Prismex Technologies.  As exclusive licensee, Interium had something valuable to protect.  There is no reason to view its expenditure upon opposition proceedings and the like as done other than in its own interests.

  64                  Another way to arrive at the same result is to recognise that a constructive trust of the kind recognised in Muschinski v Dodds is necessarily born of the agreements, arrangements and understandings, express and implied, in the context of which equity will examine the conscience of the putative trustee.  In that case, the original agreement between Ms Muschinski and Mr Dodds as to the purchase, and subsequent renovation, of the property which they shared was critical to the outcome, and gave content and definition to the trust which was found to exist.  In the present case, if the implied terms of the agreement between Prismex Technologies and Interium in 1995 were as I have found them, equity could hardly do other than to follow the tenor of that agreement.  It was an agreement under which Interium was the licensee only of the patent.

  65                  I consider next Keller’s common law claims in trespass and conversion.  Keller first alleges that the entry of Taggert and Ashall onto the premises formerly occupied by Interium on the morning of 3 July 2006 was trespass to land.  It seems that this entry occurred before Keller itself entered into possession of the land, as alleged in the Cross Claim, at 8:30 am that day.  Indeed, there is a very real question whether, even after that time, Keller was in possession of the land, or was merely a licensee pursuant to the licence agreement made that day to which I have referred.  However, in the asset sale agreement, Keller purchased from Interium all its choses in action, and specifically its rights against various parties, including Taggert and Ashall.  Treating Interium as the occupier in possession (which it was, pursuant to its lease) with standing to sue in trespass, when it filed the Cross Claim in court, Keller was relevantly in the shoes of Interium, and had assumed that standing.

  66                  There could hardly be in argument but that the entry of Taggert and Ashall onto the former premises of Interium on 3 July 2006 amounted to a trespass.  They had not been invited (expressly or implicitly) to enter the premises, they had no (express or implied) authority to be on the premises and they had no lawful purpose to make their visit.  Even if some or all of the items which Taggert recovered from the premises that morning belonged to Prismex Technologies (a matter to which I shall turn next), that circumstance would not, in my judgment, have permitted him to engage in an exercise of self-help without the prior consent of, and without even any previous consultation with, the occupier of the premises.  Even that purpose, however, would not avail Ashall, as, on the evidence, it could not be suggested that he was on the premises with a view to recovering, or that he did in fact recover, any items belonging to Prismex Technologies.  Should it be necessary to provide further reinforcement of these findings, I would add only that the circumstance that Taggert and Ashall entered the premises at an early hour of the morning, when they must have assumed that no-one in any real authority would be present, gives rise to the clearest of inferences that they well knew that their presence would not be welcome.  I find that Taggert and Ashall did trespass on these premises on 3 July 2006, and I shall defer consideration of the question of damages, if any.

  67                  Turning to Keller’s claim in conversion, I deal first with the acetate film which Taggert removed from the former premises of Interium on 3 July 2006.  Prismex Technologies, and Taggert, assert that the film was never owned by Interium, but was merely bailed to that company as an incident of the licence of the patent.  As to all film except the ‘B-Dot’ film and the ‘D-Dot’ film, that contention is groundless.  It was those two films only which were made during Ashall’s time with Ashlar.  The other films were made during his time with Interium, and would be the property of Interium on any view.  They are now the property of Keller. When he removed those films on 3 July 2006, Taggert had no legitimate basis for so acting.  Manifestly he converted those films to his own use, or to the use of Prismex Technologies, and I shall defer consideration of the question of damages.

  68                  By contrast, the ‘B-Dot’ and the ‘D-Dot’ films had been made by Ashall during his time with Ashlar.  Chattels which passed from Ashlar to Interium pursuant to the sale of business agreement were listed in the second schedule thereto.  Although no submissions were addressed specifically to this point, I cannot see anything there which would be appropriate to describe these films.  On the other hand, under the assignment agreement, Prismex Technologies purchased from Ashlar ‘the formulae to all ink mixtures, films and program disks necessary for the manufacture of Prismex panels’.  They were described in Schedule A to that agreement, and they included ‘current dot matrix printing films’.  I find, therefore, that the ‘B-Dot’ and the ‘D-Dot’ films taken by Taggert on 3 July 2006 were the property of Prismex Technologies.

  69                  That is not the end of Keller’s claim in conversion, however.  Interium was the bailee of the ‘B-Dot’ and the ‘D-Dot’ films.  The possession of a bailee is sufficient to maintain an action in conversion: Fleming, The Law of Torts, 9th ed, p 71.  As against even the bailor where the bailment is not at will and has not been regularly determined, the bailee may succeed in detinue: City Motors (1933) Pty Ltd v Southern Aerial Super Service Pty Ltd (1961) 106 CLR 477.  Fleming (at 71-72) treats that judgment as applicable also to an action in conversion, and there seems to be no reason in principle why it should not be so regarded.

  70                  The proceeding has been conducted on the basis that Taggert was the agent of Prismex Technologies when he entered the former premises of Interium on 3 July 2006.  It follows that his removal of the ‘B-Dot’ film and the ‘D-Dot’ film should be treated as an act of the bailor.  The question arises, however, whether the bailment was then subsisting and could not ipso facto be determined by Prismex Technologies.  Like the licence, the terms of the bailment were implied.  I consider that an obvious term was that the bailment, in effect, followed the licence, such that, if the licence were regularly determined, the bailment would be likewise.  On the facts as I have found them, the licence was terminated on 30 June 2006.  From that point forward, to the extent that these films remained physically at Interium’s former premises, there was a bailment at will.  It could be, and by the actions of Taggert on 3 July 2006 it was, terminated.  Thus I would hold that the actions of Taggert did not amount to conversion of the ‘B-Dot’ or of the ‘D-Dot’ films.

  71                  No attempt was made by the cross-respondents to justify the removal of the jig from former premises of Interium on the morning of 3 July 2006.  Taggert said that Ashall removed it.  Ashall was not asked about it.  No-one explained what its purpose was.  Taggert said that the jig ‘unfortunately … got tied up in all this’.  There was no reference to the statement in Prismex Technologies’ solicitors’ letter of 5 July 2006 that the jig had been made by Taggert’s son-in-law: indeed, Taggert admitted that it had been made by an employee of Interium.  In the circumstances, the jig is in the same category as the films other than the ‘B-Dot’ and the ‘D-Dot’ films.

  72                  Keller also claimed that the removal of the films and the jig by Taggert and Ashall on 3 July 2006 amounted to trespass to goods.  I was not, however, favoured by any submission which illuminated how such a claim would differ in formulation, in outcome or in consequences from the claim in conversion with which I have just dealt.  In the circumstances I shall make no findings with respect to trespass to goods specifically, but I give the parties leave to address me further on the subject should any of them consider that anything turns on it.

  73                  What I have said above with respect to the films (other than the ‘B-Dot’ and ‘D-Dot’ films) and the jig applies equally to Keller’s case in conversion and trespass to goods against Ashall in regard to his deliberate destruction of silk screens on the morning of 3 July 2006.  He had the clearest intent of thereby depriving the owner of those screens of their intended use: see Penfolds Wines Pty Ltd v Eiliott (1946) 74 CLR 204, 229; Fleming, p 68.

  74                  I consider next Keller’s trade mark allegations. Keller alleges that the emails sent by O’Rourke and Talbot, to which I have referred in par 34 above, amounted to infringements of the mark ‘PRISMEX’.  In his evidence, Taggert frankly accepted that X-Position had no right to use the mark in this way and, as I understand it, has taken steps to ensure that such instances will not recur.  It is beyond question that the emails were used for the purpose of promoting edge-lit signs, and that the mark was used in those emails in relation to goods in respect of which the mark is registered.  As Kitto J said in the Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Ltd (1963) 109 CLR 407, 422:

  ‘A use of a mark in an advertisement of goods … is of course a use in relation to the goods advertised ….’

  Keller was not registered as the owner of the mark when these emails were sent, but, under s 20(2) of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth), it has the right to obtain relief ‘if the trade mark has been infringed’ and, under subs (3) of the same section, those rights ‘are taken to have accrued to the registered owner as from the date of registration of the trade mark’.  Further, by the asset sale agreement, Keller has assumed the rights, in relation to the mark, that Interium had before the transfer of registration.  Thus I consider that Keller has made good its case of infringement of the mark, and I shall receive submissions later on the question of relief.

  75                  Keller makes allegations against Prismex Technologies, and against X-Position, of misleading and deceptive conduct contrary to s 52, and to pars (c), (d) and (g) of s 53, of the Trade Practices Act.  Keller puts these allegations two ways.  The first relates to the patent, where the offending conduct is said to arise from Prismex Technologies purporting to licence X-Position to exploit the invention, and by X-Position doing so.  In the light of the findings which I have made above as to the termination of Interium’s licence to exploit the invention, these allegations cannot be sustained.

  76                  The second way in which Keller’s trade practices allegations are advanced is to say that Prismex Technologies, by authorising X-Position to make use of the trade mark, and that X-Position, by using the mark, represented that they were entitled to engage in that conduct (ie use of the mark).  There is no evidence, however, and, save for the allegation in the Cross Claim, there is no suggestion, that Prismex Technologies either authorised or purported to authorise X-Position to use the mark.  On the other hand, as I have found, X-Position did in fact use the trade mark, and, in context, that use conveyed also the representation that X-Position was entitled to use the mark and was, and would be, marketing edge-lit signs by reference to the mark.  I consider that this was misleading or deceptive, and thus in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act.  I do not, however, consider that any contravention of s 53 was thereby involved.  In submissions made on behalf of Keller, how the conduct of X-Position might be said to involve a contravention of s 53 was not dealt with at all and, for my own part, I am unpersuaded that the section has any operation in the circumstances of the present case.  However, I do find a contravention of s 52, and I will receive submissions as to the appropriate relief in due course.

  77                  Keller has also sought findings against Taggert and Ashall under s 75B of the Trade Practices Act that might be of assistance to it when I later consider the matter of remedies.  The only findings of direct contravention of that Act which I have made are against X-Position and relate to its use of the trade mark ‘PRISMEX’ in promotional correspondence.  Although Ashall is, apparently, employed by X-Position, there is no evidence that he did anything in relation to that correspondence that would attract the operation of s 75B.  As for Taggert, although he was in day-to-day control of the business and activities of X-Position, there is no evidence that he authorised, or even knew of at the time, the correspondence which I have held to be in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act.  Indeed, Taggert gave evidence under cross-examination, which I accept, that he did not authorise, and was not at the time aware of, the offending correspondence, and that he had, since becoming aware thereof, instructed the relevant staff that they should not use the trade mark.  In the light of this evidence, and of the absence of anything to link Taggert to the sending of the correspondence, I make no finding against him under s 75B of the Trade Practices Act in relation to X-Position’s contravention of s 52 thereof.

  78                  I propose to order that the proceeding be fixed for hearing on the question of the damages or other remedies, if any, to which the applicants and the cross-claimants are entitled in the light of these reasons.

  REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

  1                     The first respondent seeks to read an affidavit of Mr Ian MacDonald Andrew, sworn 5 May 2006, on the basis that I make an order that that affidavit not be disclosed to any person or party other than the respondents and their legal representatives in this proceeding and an order that publication of that affidavit and any of its contents be prohibited. The applicant objects to the affidavit being read at all and also objects to its being admitted on the basis that I make the orders that I have outlined.

  2                     The issue in this proceeding is whether certain documents evidencing communications between unnamed persons are the subject of legal professional privilege, such that their contents should be kept confidential. The documents were produced to the first respondent, the Australian Crime Commission (‘the Commission’), in response to a notice requiring production of the documents.

  3                     On 15 May 2003, pursuant to s 7C of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) (‘the Act’), the Board of the Commission authorised the Money Laundering and Tax Fraud Determination. That instrument authorised the Commission to conduct a special investigation in respect of certain kinds of federally relevant criminal activity, as defined in s 4 of the Act, including money laundering, tax fraud and related criminal enterprises. The duration of the investigation has been extended until 30 June 2006.

  4                     Pursuant to the Money Laundering and Tax Fraud Determination, the Commission is currently conducting a special investigation, code-named ‘Operation Wickenby’. Operation Wickenby is an investigation of national and international significance into allegations of tax fraud and money laundering.

  5                     Subsequent to the execution of search warrants at the first applicant’s home and business premises, pursuant to s 29 of the Act, an examiner of the Commission issued a notice to produce requiring production of certain materials. That notice bears the date 22 September 2005. In pursuance of that notice, numbers of documents were produced, including the documents in respect of which the applicant claims a determination that the documents are the subject of legal professional privilege.

  6                     There are in excess of 40 documents involved. The documents involved have been tendered by the applicant but an order has been made, at the instigation of the applicant and not opposed by the respondents, that access to those documents be limited to counsel and solicitors for the applicant.

  7                     The respondents dispute the claim to privilege on several grounds, one of which is that the communications evidenced by the documents in question were made in the furtherance of a crime, or fraud, or other impropriety, such that they are not privileged. The affidavit of Mr Andrew is said to establish that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the communications in question were made in the furtherance of a crime, or fraud, or other impropriety.

  8                     Mr Andrew has said in a further affidavit, also sworn on 5 May 2006, that the Commission is currently conducting Operation Wickenby and that the investigation relates to suspected taxation fraud and money laundering by Australian residents who have used the services provided by Strachans SA, an accounting firm located in Switzerland. Strachans is alleged to be involved in promoting tax fraud and money laundering schemes internationally and within Australia. Due to the complexity and breadth of the ongoing investigations, it is expected that Operation Wickenby will continue for a number of years.

  9                     To date, no criminal charges have been laid. However, the special investigation has identified the revenue at risk to the Australian Government to be in the vicinity of $300,000 million. Disclosure of the information contained in the affidavit now in question would have a prejudicial effect on the ongoing criminal investigations into the applicant and disclosure of that information would reveal police investigation methodology.

  10                  Mr Andrew says that the affidavit in question sets out background to, and the current status of, Operation Wickenby, information about the first applicant and current investigation into the first applicant’s activities, details about various schemes in which the first applicant is said to be involved that are the subject of criminal investigation and details of how the documents in question have been handled by the Commission during the course of the investigation.

  11                  Disclosure of the information contained in the affidavit may prejudice the ongoing investigations by revealing the current status and focus of the criminal investigation. Mr Andrew says that, on the basis of his experience in law enforcement, that could have the following outcomes:

  (1) Preparation by the first applicant for the specific matters the subject of the proposed examination;

  (2) Collusion between witnesses, potential witnesses and other persons of interest as to the evidence to be given before the examiner;

  (3) The destruction or fabrication of evidence including the divesting of assets and affording the opportunity to alert other persons to the current status and focus of the investigation.

  12                  The affidavit in question also details the methods used by the Commission in conducting criminal investigations into financial crimes. The disclosure of its contents would reveal the processes undertaken by the Commission in conducting, not only the specific investigation concerning the applicant, but Operation Wickenby as a whole.

  13                  It is common ground, on the basis of that evidence, that there is a public interest in preserving secrecy and confidentiality in relation to the information contained in the affidavit and in documents exhibited to the affidavit, which the Commission will also seek to tender on the basis that the orders proposed relate to it as well. The first applicant opposes the reading of the affidavit and the tender of the documents on the basis that they are subject to public interest immunity, which it is not open to the Commission to or anyone else to waive. Specifically, the first applicant refers to s 130 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth), which provides that if the public interest in admitting into evidence information or a document that relates to matters of state is outweighed by the public interest in preserving secrecy or confidentiality in relation to the information or document, the Court may direct that the information or document not be adduced as evidence.

  14                  Neither party has suggested that that provision does anything other than restate the general law in that regard. Section 130(3) provides that, in deciding whether to give such a direction, the Court may inform itself in any way it thinks fit. Section 130(4) provides that, without limiting the circumstances in which information or a document may be taken for the purposes of subsection (1) to relate to matters of state, the information or document is taken for the purposes of that subsection to relate to matters of state, if adducing it as evidence would:

  (a) Prejudice the security, defence or international relations of Australia; or

  (b) Damage relations between the Commonwealth and a State or between 2 or more States; or

  (c) Prejudice the prevention, investigation or prosecution of an offence; or

  (d) Prejudice the prevention or investigation of, or the conduct of proceedings for recovery of civil penalties brought with respect to, other contraventions of the law; or

  (e) Disclose, or enable a person to ascertain, the existence or identity of a confidential source of information relating to the enforcement or administration of a law of the Commonwealth or a State; or

  (f) Prejudice the proper functioning of the government of the Commonwealth or a State.

  15                  Under s 130(5), without limiting the matters that the Court may take into account, the Court is required to take into account the following matters:

  (a) The importance of the information or the document in the proceeding:

  (b) If the proceeding is a criminal proceeding, whether the party seeking to adduce evidence of the information or a document is a defendant or the prosecutor;

  (c) The nature of the offence, cause of action, or defence to which the information or document relates, and the nature of the subject matter of the proceeding;

  (d) The likely effect of adducing evidence of the information or document, and the means available to limit its publication;

  (e) Whether the substance of the information or document has already been published;

  (f) If the proceeding is a criminal proceeding and the party seeking to adduce evidence of the information or document is a defendant, whether the direction is to be made subject to the condition that the prosecution be stayed.

  16                  The first applicant says, in effect, that it is not open to the Court to permit evidence to be adduced that is not available to another party. In a sense, that is a curious submission, in the light of the order that I have already made, at the instigation of the first applicant, that access to the documents in question, which have been admitted into evidence in the proceeding, be limited to counsel and solicitor for the first applicant.

  17                  Section 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (‘the Federal Court Act’) provides that the Court may, at any time during or after the hearing of a proceeding in the Court, make such order forbidding or restricting the publication of particular evidence, or the name of a party or witness, as appears to the Court to be necessary in order to prevent prejudice to the administration of justice or the security of the Commonwealth. Section 23 of the Federal Court Act provides that the Court has power, in relation to matters in which it has jurisdiction, to make orders of such kinds, including interlocutory orders, and to issue, or direct the issue of, writs of such kinds, as the Court thinks appropriate.

  18                  Disclosure of the contents of the affidavits and documents sought to be tendered by the Commission could clearly prejudice the administration of justice, insofar as the administration of justice includes the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences. A question may arise as to whether s 50 of the Federal Court Act, in authorising an order forbidding or restricting publication of evidence, extends to forbidding or restricting the disclosure of evidence to a party. Whether the power is to be found in s 50 or in s 23, I consider that it is open to the Court, in an appropriate case, as I have already done, to direct that access to particular evidence be limited to one party or the party’s legal advisers.

  19                  The question that falls for decision involves the balancing of a series of public interests. There is a public interest in having before the Court all relevant evidence upon which any party wishes to rely, as long, of course, as the evidence is admissible (the ‘Full Evidence Interest’). There is also a public interest in ensuring procedural fairness between the parties to a proceeding, such that each party has knowledge of all of the evidence that has been admitted in the proceeding and is before the Court (the ‘Fairness Interest’). Finally, for present purposes, there is a public interest in preserving secrecy or confidentiality in relation to material, the publication of which could be prejudicial to the administration of justice including the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences (‘the Secrecy Interest’).

  20                  Section 130 of the Evidence Act involves a balancing exercise between the Full Evidence Interest and the Secrecy Interest. Without anything further, in the present case, the Secrecy Interest would outweigh the Full Evidence Interest. That is to say, the disclosure of the contents of the affidavit and the documents exhibited to it, could prejudice the ongoing investigations involved in Operation Wickenby. However, if the proposed orders are made, the Full Evidence Interest would outweigh the Secrecy Interest. That is to say, if the proposed orders are made, there would be no prejudice to Operation Wickenby and the further investigation and prosecution of offences under investigation.

  21                  The only persons who would have the material are those who already have access to it, plus the Court and Court officers. It has not been suggested that disclosure to the Court or to Court officers, by whom I mean my staff, will be prejudicial to the public interest. On the other hand, if the proposed orders are made, the Fairness Interest would be significantly affected. In my view, therefore, the question of whether the material should be admitted into evidence and whether the proposed order should be made involves resolution of a conflict between the Full Evidence Interest, on the one hand, and the Fairness Interest on the other hand. That is to say, does the public interest in procedural fairness in a proceeding in this Court outweigh the public interest in having before the Court relevant admissible material upon which a party wishes to rely.

  22                  This proceeding is unusual insofar as the only issue in it concerns the question of whether or not legal professional privilege attaches to the documents which have been tendered and marked. I have not yet looked at those documents, although senior counsel for the first applicant has foreshadowed that he would invite me to do so on the basis that they and their contents are withheld from the respondents and their legal advisers.

  23                  It would be a significant interference with the normal rules of procedural fairness for the legal advisers to the first applicant to be deprived of the opportunity of making specific submissions concerning whether or not the affidavit and exhibits intended to be relied upon by the respondents justify a conclusion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the communications evidenced by the documents in issue were made in the furtherance of a crime, or fraud, or other impropriety. On the other hand, if it be the fact that the documents evidence communications made in the furtherance of a crime, or fraud, or other impropriety, there is a very significant public interest in the conclusion that they should not be the subject of legal professional privilege. The balancing exercise that I have to undertake is a delicate one.

  24                  I consider, on balance, that the interests of justice will be best served by allowing the affidavit to be read on the basis that the orders proposed by the Commission are made in respect of the affidavit and any exhibits referred to in it. That, of course, is subject to my being satisfied that the contents of the affidavit and the documents referred to in it are otherwise admissible, according to the proper principles of evidence, in relation to any matter of fact that has to be proved and is relevant in this proceeding.

PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE –
pleading – motion for striking out statement of claim under
O 11 r 16 of Federal Court Rules – statement of claim
must plead material facts - while a conclusion may itself constitute a material
fact, a conclusion without exposure of the primary facts on which it is based
is likely to render the pleading objectionable – facts pleaded at unacceptable
level of generality – statement of claim struck out with leave to replead

TRADE AND COMMERCE – Trade
Practices - secondary boycotts for the purpose of causing substantial loss or
damage – boycotts affecting trade or commerce - allegation of conduct in
concert by several respondents – concerted conduct must actually hinder or
prevent supply or acquisition of goods rather than create the mere possibility
that hindrance or prevention might occur – pleading must go beyond repeating
the language of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) to reveal the facts
which bring a claim within that language - 
accessorial liability does not attract the extraterritorial application
of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth)

TORTS  - Tort of conspiracy requires that
conspirators have as their dominant purpose the intent of injuring the
claimants  - the object or objects of the
conspiracy should be clearly identified – to make out the tort of intimidation
there must be found an intention to harm the claimant

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

1                    
An application and statement of claim were filed
in this matter on 9 November 2004. 
Australian Wool Innovation Ltd (‘AWIL’) was the sole applicant.  AWIL claims that it represents some 30,000
Australian woolgrowers.  There were four
respondents to the application, namely three individuals who are American citizens
ordinarily resident in the USA, and the fourth respondent, People for the
Ethnical Treatment of Animals Inc (‘PETA’), a company incorporated under the
laws of Virginia, but which is alleged at material times to have carried on
business in Australia.

2                    
The application and statement of claim were
served on the first respondent, apparently whilst she was visiting
Australia.  Leave to serve the
originating process outside the jurisdiction has not been sought, and the other
respondents have not been served.  The
first respondent has entered a conditional appearance, and by notice of motion
filed on 25 November 2004 has applied for orders that the proceedings be
dismissed or stayed pursuant to O 20 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules (‘the
Rules’) or that the pleading be struck out pursuant to O 11 r 16 of the Rules
or that the originating process be set aside under O 9 r 7 of the
Rules.

3                    
On 18 February 2005 AWIL applied by notice of
motion to join a further 103 persons or companies as applicants and a further 6
persons as additional respondents to the proceedings.  The additional applicants are said to be
persons or companies who are Australian woolgrowers represented by AWIL.  The additional respondents are said to be
servants or agents of PETA.  The ninth
respondent is an American citizen, the other additional respondents are either
citizens of Australia who are ordinarily resident in Australia, or in the case
of the eighth respondent, a company registered in NSW.  Leave to file an amended application and an
amended statement of claim was sought.

4                    
An amended statement of claim (‘the ASC’) was
filed in Court on 11 March 2005.  The ASC
was treated by the parties as being the subject of the first respondent’s
motion filed on 25 November 2004.  

5                    
The addition of parties to existing proceedings
is effected by means of an order of the Court: O 6 r 8, hence the Court’s leave
to file the ASC is probably required, notwithstanding the provisions of O 6 r
2(a) and O 13 r 3(1).

The applicants’ claims

6                    
In very broad terms, the ASC alleges that the
respondents have announced and implemented what they have described as an
‘Australian wool boycott’ (‘the boycott’) the purpose of which is to stop the
overseas sale of wool produced in Australia until the Australian wool industry
discontinues the use of the veterinary surgical technique known as mulesing,
and until it ceases the export of live sheep for sale as meat.  The conduct complained of falls into four
principal stages:

            (i)         the initial announcement by the
respondents in Australia and overseas of the boycott of Australian wool; 

            (ii)        the intimidation of US and European
retailers (including Italian garment manufacturer Benetton Group SpA) with a
view to procuring agreement from the retailers not to purchase products
containing Australian wool;

            (iii)       the holding of protests in support of the
boycott both in Australia and overseas; and

            (iv)       the holding of protests and the carrying
out of other intimidatory conduct in Australia and overseas specifically
targeting Benetton Group SpA (‘Benetton’) because of its failure to agree not
to trade in goods made of Australian wool, which protests and conduct were
intended as an example to Benetton and the other US and European retailers
which had so far not agreed to PETA’s demands.

7                    
The respondents’ conduct is said to have
resulted in:

            (a)        contraventions of s 45D and 45DB of
the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (‘the TPA’);

            (b)        unconscionable conduct in contravention
of s 51AA of the TPA;

            (c)        accessorial liability for such of the
respondents who did not themselves commit the contraventions of the TPA;

            (d)        the tort of conspiracy; and

            (e)        the tort of intimidation.

8                    
The relief sought in the amended application
includes an order pursuant to s 80(1) of the TPA restraining the
respondents from threatening clothing retailers that unless they agree not to
purchase any goods made from Australian wool, the respondents will publish
matter and stage demonstrations at the retailers’ commercial premises that will
harm the retailers’ trade, as well as damages both under s 82 of the TPA
and under the general law.

The conduct alleged

9                    
The conduct on the part of the respondents (or
some of them) on which the applicants rely in support of the pleaded causes of
action is said to have occurred on various dates between October 2004 and
February 2005.  Some of the conduct is
said to have taken place in Australia, although much of it is said to have
occurred outside Australia.  The conduct
pleaded in pars 18-33 (‘the pleaded conduct’) may be summarised as
follows:

            (a)        the first, second, fourth, fifth, sixth,
seventh, eighth and ninth respondents have published announcements of the
boycott on web sites, and in media interviews, and news releases.  One of the particularised media interviews
was given by the first respondent in Australia on the 60 Minutes program;

            (b)        the first, fourth and ninth respondents
have intimidated two retailers in the USA (Abercrombie & Fitch and J Crew)
and one retailer in the UK (New Look) into agreeing not to purchase any goods
made of Australian wool by threatening to publish material defamatory of them
and to trespass on their commercial premises;

            (c)        the second and fourth respondents
published a letter to a UK retailer (Marks & Spencer Group Plc) urging it
to no longer trade in products made of Australian wool;

            (d)        the fourth respondent called on about 24
US retailers not to purchase products containing Australian wool;

            (e)        the fourth and ninth respondents
published an announcement in the US that US retailers which did not stop
selling products containing Australian wool would face demonstrations and
boycotts beginning in November 2004;

            (f)         the third and fourth respondents
published a letter to Benetton asserting that it had been chosen as an
‘international target’ and threatening to publish matter and stage
demonstrations at its commercial premises that would harm its trade, unless
Benetton agreed not to trade in goods made of Australian wool;

            (g)        the second and fourth respondents
published letters to two US retailers (Kellwood Company and J C Penney Inc)
threatening to make each of them the target of a campaign unless each agreed
not to purchase Australian wool or any products containing Australian wool
until the practices of live export and mulesing are eliminated;

            (h)        the second, fourth and tenth respondents
published letters to a UK garment manufacturer (Laura Ashley Holding Plc)
threatening to make it the target of a campaign unless it agreed not to
purchase Australian wool or any products containing Australian wool until the
practices of mulesing and live export are eliminated;

            (i)         the fourth, sixth and eighth respondents
organised and carried out protests outside retailers’ stores in Pitt Street
Mall, Sydney on 1 December 2004 in which potential customers were told not to
enter the stores, and material was distributed which conveyed defamatory
imputations that the applicants mistreat sheep, are cruel to sheep and/or
mutilate sheep;

            (j)         the respondents communicated to
Australian retailers in about December 2004, threatening to make them the
target of a campaign unless they agreed not to purchase Benetton products;

            (k)        the fourth, fifth, seventh and eighth
respondents published announcements in Australia that PETA would protest
against Benetton at its outlets in Sydney and Melbourne, and nationally at
David Jones department stores during the busy post-Christmas sales period;

            (l)         the tenth respondent published a letter
to Benetton stating that Benetton must not buy Australian wool, and threatening
to publish matter defamatory of Benetton to the general public in relation to
Benetton’s alleged involvement in cruelty towards sheep;

            (m)       the fourth respondent organised and
carried out protests outside Benetton stores in New York, Chicago and other
American cities, in which potential customers were told not to enter the
stores, and material was distributed which conveyed defamatory imputations that
Benetton mistreats sheep, is cruel to sheep and/or mutilates sheep; and

            (n)        the fourth, sixth, seventh and eighth
respondents organised and carried out protests outside retailers’ stores in
Pitt Street Mall on 10 February 2005 in which potential customers were told not
to enter the stores, and material defamatory of the applicants was distributed.

10                 
The only allegation made with respect to the
first respondent of involvement in conduct occurring in Australia is that
pleaded in the ASC par 18 (see 9(a) above) and par 29 (see 9(j)
above).  The only allegation made with
respect to the first respondent of involvement in conduct occurring outside
Australia is that pleaded in the ASC par 20 (see 9(b) above).

11                 
Even though particular respondents are alleged
to have engaged in specific conduct, par 39 of the ASC contains an
entirely unparticularised allegation that the pleaded conduct was engaged in by
the respondents in concert with each other.

Australian wool production chain

12                 
Paragraphs 14-17 of the ASC allege that
Australian wool is used in the manufacture of garments which are sold by
retailers to consumers.  The steps in the
production and supply of such garments are said to include the following:

            (a)        Australian wool growers (ie wool growers
represented by AWIL and the 2nd–101st applicants) and
Australian wool exporters (ie the 102nd–104th applicants)
sell Australian wool to the Australian wool acquirers (ie wool processors or
their intermediaries);

            (b)        wool processors (not further described)
process the wool into usable yarn (‘Australian wool yarn’);

            (c)        wool processors supply Australian wool
yarn to textile manufacturers and garment manufacturers;

            (d)        textile manufacturers manufacture fabric
(‘Australian wool fabric’) using at least some Australian wool yarn;

            (e)        textile manufacturers (not further
described) supply Australian wool fabric to garment manufacturers;

            (f)         garment manufacturers (not further
described) manufacture garments (‘Australian wool garments’) using at least
some Australian wool yarn or some Australian wool fabric;

            (g)        garment manufacturers supply Australian
wool garments to retailers, or in the case of garment manufacturers who are
also retailers, to consumers; and

            (h)        retailers (not further described) sell
Australian wool garments to consumers.

The s 45D case

13                 
Paragraphs 34-39 of the ASC allege that the
pleaded conduct (summarised above) was and is calculated:

            (a)        to deter consumers from acquiring
Australian wool garments from retailers (including garment manufacturers who
are also retailers);

            (b)        to deter retailers from acquiring
Australian wool garments from garment manufacturers;

            (c)        to deter garment manufacturers from
acquiring Australian wool fabric and Australian wool yarn from the suppliers
thereof;

            (d)        to deter textile manufacturers from
acquiring Australian wool yarn from the suppliers thereof; and

            (e)        to deter Australian wool acquirers from
acquiring Australian wool from Australian wool growers and Australian wool
exporters.

14                 
Three s 45D cases are then pleaded in
relation to different levels in the Australian wool production chain.  The respondents are alleged to have engaged
in conduct in concert with each other that hindered or prevented:

            (a)        each of the Australian wool acquirers
[the third person] from acquiring wool from the applicants [the fourth
person].  But for that conduct each of
the Australian wool acquirers was likely to acquire substantial quantities of
Australian wool.  The conduct was engaged
in for the purpose and would have or be likely to have the effect, of causing
substantial loss or damage to the business of the applicants;

            (b)        retailers [the third person] from
acquiring Australian wool garments from garment manufacturers offering to
supply such garments [the fourth person]. 
The conduct was engaged in for the purpose and would have or be likely
to have the effect, of causing substantial loss or damage to the business of
the garment manufacturers; and

            (c)        consumers [the third person] from
acquiring Australian wool garments from retailers or garment manufacturers
offering or proposing to supply such garments [the fourth person].  The conduct was engaged in for the purpose
and would have or be likely to have the effect, of causing substantial loss or
damage to the business of such retailers or garment manufacturers.

15                 
Section 5 of the TPA provides (inter alia) that
Part IV of the TPA extends to the engaging in conduct outside Australia by
bodies corporate incorporated or carrying on business within Australia, or by
Australian citizens or persons ordinarily resident within Australia.  Thus the TPA has been constructed on the
assumption that when conduct is made a contravention of the Act it is only
conduct occurring in Australia that is dealt with, unless the conditions set
out in s 5 apply to extend the operation of the TPA to extraterritorial
conduct: Bray v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (2002) 190 ALR 1 at [47] to [52];
Miller’s Annotated Trade Practices Act, 25th ed, Lawbook Co,
Sydney, 2004, at 126.

16                 
The ASC has been drafted by reference to the
same assumption insofar as the claims of contravention of s 45D of the TPA
are concerned, as pars 49, 56 and 63 are allegations of contravention on the
part of the first to tenth respondents based on conduct on the part of those
respondents which took place within Australia, whereas pars 50, 55 and 62
allege contraventions, but only on the part of the fourth, fifth, sixth,
seventh, eighth and tenth respondents, by reason of conduct occurring outside
Australia.  On the case as pleaded,
s 5(1) of the TPA applies to those persons, but not to the other
respondents, including the first respondent.

The s 45DB case

17                 
The pleading of the s 45DB case is confined
to par 49(d) of the ASC, and perhaps, par 46.  Paragraph 46 alleges that the applicants
supply Australian wool to Australian wool acquirers in trade or commerce
between Australia and places outside Australia. 
In substance, the effect of par 49(d) is that conduct which is said
to result in a contravention of s 45D also results in a contravention of
s 45DB, perhaps when taken in conjunction with par 46.

The ‘strike out’ application – the
s 45D cases and the s 45DB case

18                 
The grounds on which it is said that the claims
alleging contravention of s 45D and s 45DB of the TPA should not be
permitted to proceed in relation to the first respondent are set out below:

            (a)        The only allegation of fact involving
conduct by the first respondent is par 18, where it is alleged that she
participated in an interview on the 60 Minutes program in Australia.  If this conduct alone is said to be
sufficient to establish primary liability under s 45D or s 45DB, this
should be made clear.

            (b)        No material facts are pleaded to
establish that the first respondent acted in concert with all other
respondents.

            (c)        Except for the applicants, the pleading
does not allege the identity of any person who falls within the categories of
Australian wool acquirers, garment manufacturers, retailers or consumers.  Hence the first respondent does not know the
case she has to meet as she is not told who are the persons who are alleged to
have suffered substantial loss or damage, nor who are the persons who are
hindered or prevented from acquiring wool or Australian wool garments.

            (d)        All the pleading does is to recite the
language of the section.  It does not
plead the material facts relied upon.  In
particular, no material facts are pleaded to support the allegation that:

                        (i)         the first respondent’s purpose was to
cause substantial loss or damage to the business of each of the applicants, or
to the business of each of the garment manufacturers offering to supply
Australian wool garments, or the business of retailers who offered Australian
wool garments for sale and/or garment manufacturers offering or proposing to
supply Australian wool garments for sale;

                        (ii)        each
member of those classes suffered substantial loss or damage; and

                        (iii)       each member of the classes of Australian
wool acquirers, retailers and consumers was hindered or prevented from
acquiring goods from the relevant supplier.

            (e)        A number of the allegations made are
simply fanciful.  An example is the
allegation that the conduct alleged in fact caused substantial loss and damage
to each of the classes of persons who are alleged to have suffered loss and
damage, and in fact hindered or prevented the supply of goods in the manner
alleged.  The generality of the pleading
involves the proposition that the conduct alleged caused substantial loss and
damage to every retailer who sells Australian wool garments.

            (f)         The alleged contravention of s 45DB
in par 49(d) cannot be sustained by the matters referred to in that
paragraph as there is no allegation of any hindrance in the movement of goods
between Australia and places outside Australia.

Consideration

19                 
The applicants contend that the strike out application
is misconceived, because the applicants are required to plead the material
facts on which they rely, rather than to particularise the evidence by which
those facts are to be proven, and in any event, if there is a want of
particularity in the pleading, the defect can and should be cured by the
provision of further particulars.  The
issue is whether the applicants’ claim has been pleaded with sufficient
particularity to enable the preparation of a defence.

20                 
A statement of claim is required to show the
material facts on which it is based (O 4 r 6(2)(b)) but not the evidence by
which those facts are to be proved (O 11 r 2). 
A pleading which discloses no reasonable cause of action, or which has a
tendency to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay in the proceedings, or is
otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court may be struck out (O 11 r
16).  The proceedings may also be stayed
or dismissed in the circumstances referred to, under O 20 r 2.

21                 
As Lindgren J observed in Australian
Automotive Repairers’ Association (Political Action Committee) Inc v NRMA
Insurance Ltd [2002] FCA 1568 at [15] the requirement that material facts
be stated has two purposes: the natural justice purpose of adequately informing
the other party of the nature of the case alleged against that party; and the
purpose of providing a basis for determining whether that alleged case, so
exposed, constitutes a cause of action cognisable at law.  Particulars serve only the former purpose.  It is not the function of particulars to
remedy an omission of material facts. 
See also, as to the dual function of pleadings: Mick Skorpos Petrol
Discount King Pty Ltd v The Shell Company of Australia Ltd (1997) ATPR
41-556 (Mansfield J).

22                 
However, as Lindgren J also observed (at [17]),
notwithstanding the well established distinction between material facts and
particulars (as to which see the well known passage from the judgment of
Scott LJ in Bruce v Odhams Press Ltd [1936] 1 KB 697 at 712-713) a
less strict view may be taken now than was taken previously: cf Beach
Petroleum NL v Johnson (1991) 105 ALR 456 at 466.  According to this view, the particulars
contained in a statement of claim may be taken into account for the purpose of
determining whether the statement of claim amounts to a statement of all the
material facts.  But even this more
flexible view of pleading does not countenance the omission of material facts
from the statement of claim regarded as a whole.  Accordingly, if the pleading regarded as a
whole does not contain a clear statement of all the material facts on which the
applicant relies, it is no answer that the respondent can request the provision
of further particulars.

23                 
A statement of claim must set out clearly not
just the bare claim that is made, but also the material facts on which it is
based including facts that, if not specifically pleaded, might take the other
party by surprise: Multigroup Distribution Services Pty Ltd v TNT Australia
Pty Ltd (1996) ATPR 41-522, at 42-679. 
The material facts are all of those which are necessary for the purpose
of formulating a complete cause of action: Bruce v Odhams Press Ltd
(supra) at 712.  In the context of a case
arising under Part IV of the TPA, an applicant must plead material facts
sufficient to make out each asserted element of the cause of action propounded:
Chan Cuong Su trading as Ausviet Travel v Direct Flights International Pty
Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-662 at 41,374.  A
statement of a conclusion drawn from matters of fact not themselves alleged in
the pleading is not a statement of a material fact: Trade Practices
Commission v David Jones (Australia) Pty Ltd (1985) 7 FCR 109 at 114; Sammy
Russo Supplies Pty Ltd v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (1998) ATPR
41-641.

24                 
On the other hand, French J has expressed
the view that a conclusion may constitute a material fact: Charlie Carter
Pty Ltd v The Shop, Distributive & Allied Employees’ Association of Western
Australia (1987) 13 FCR 413; Kernel Holdings Pty Ltd v Rothmans of Pall
Mall (Aust) Pty Ltd WAG 83 of 1991, 3 September 1991 (unreported).  In his Honour’s view, the real issue in a
case where an objection is raised that a conclusion only is pleaded is whether
the facts are pleaded at too great a level of generality to allow the pleading
to serve its intended purpose. 
Drummond J agreed with that approach in State of Queensland v
Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 499.  In Charlie Carter (supra) it was
alleged that the respondents were acting in concert with each other, and it was
unclear whether the ‘concert’ was said to arise by inference from the overt
acts pleaded, or whether it was an additional element, and the pleading was
silent as to what it comprised.  If, as
appeared to be the case, the statement of claim alleged ‘concert’ as an independent
element, then what was pleaded was a conclusion which was unsatisfactory, if
only because the allegation of concert was at ‘too great a level of generality
or, put another way, [was] insufficiently particular’ (at 418).  The permissible level of generality at which
material facts may be pleaded differs depending on the subject matter, but it
must be consistent with the goal of defining the issues and informing the
parties of the case to be met (at 417). 
In the ordinary case, an allegation of a conclusion without exposure of
the primary facts on which the conclusion is based is likely to render the
pleading objectionable, even if a conclusion may itself constitute a material
fact.

25                 
A statement of claim which simply repeats the
language of a provision of the TPA, and then baldly asserts a contravention of
that provision, without more, will be struck out: McKellar v Container
Terminal Management Services Ltd (1999) 165 ALR 409 at [23].

26                 
It is now well settled in the context of Part IV
and V of the TPA that if damages are sought, material facts to show the causal
link between the conduct constituting the contravention of the TPA and the
damage must be alleged: Bond Corporation Pty Ltd v Thiess Contractors Pty
Ltd (1987) 14 FCR 215 at 222; Mitanis v Pioneer Concrete (Vic) Pty Ltd
(1997) ATPR 41-591 at 44,154; Sammy Russo Supplies Pty Ltd v Australian
Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (supra) at 41,097; McKellar v Container Terminal
Management Services Ltd (supra) at [26]; Council for the City of the Gold Coast 
v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd (1998) 157 ALR 135 at 141.

Specific complaints

18(a)
and (b) – ‘acting in concert’

27                 
The conduct in which the first respondent is
alleged to have engaged in Australia is that referred to in the ASC
pars 18(a) and (b).  The conduct in
which the first respondent is alleged to have engaged outside Australia is that
referred to in the ASC par 20. 
Paragraph 39 of the ASC alleges that the pleaded conduct was engaged in
by the respondents in concert with each other. 
Acting in concert involves knowing conduct, the result of communications
between the parties and not simply simultaneous actions occurring
spontaneously: Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry
Employees’ Union (1979) 27 ALR 367 at 373. 
However, as a matter of evidence, acting in concert can be inferred from
the conduct of the parties, as where there is such a concurrence of time,
character, direction and result as to lead to the inference that apparently
separate acts were the outcome of pre-concert: The King and the
Attorney-General of the Commonwealth v The Associated Northern Collieries
(1912) 14 CLR 387 at 400.

28                 
It is an essential element of a contravention of
s 45D that the respondent, ‘in concert with a second person …’ engaged in
conduct which otherwise involves a contravention of s 45D.  The ASC par 39 makes a bald assertion in
terms of the section, without pleading any facts which, if proven, would
establish that element.  It is plain that
many of the paragraphs and sub-paragraphs in the ASC pars 18-33 do not
allege conduct which, on the face of it, is concerted conduct on the part of
all respondents, as particular paragraphs or sub-paragraphs are confined to
particular respondents.  For example, no
facts are pleaded to establish that the first respondent acted in concert with
the fourth, sixth and eighth respondents in publishing their news release of 30
November 2004 referred to in par (c) of the particulars to the ASC
par 18.

29                 
As in Charlie Carter (supra) it is
apparent that the applicants rely on something more than an inference to be
drawn from the pleaded conduct to establish that the respondents acted in
concert.  But what is that ‘something
more’?  The ASC par 68 pleads
accessorial liability on the part of the respondents to the extent that any of
the respondents did (not) itself, himself or herself commit the contravention
of s 45D which the applicants allege. 
Particulars are given of that allegation including (b) that the first
respondent is the President of the fourth respondent and directs its activities.  That may be the ‘something more’.

30                 
But the ASC par 39 is an element in
establishing that the respondents did contravene s 45D, and it cannot
simply be assumed that particulars given of a claim which postulates that there
is no primary liability in a particular respondent are the facts on which the
applicants intend to rely to establish an essential element of the primary
liability of all respondents.

31                 
Paragraph 39 of the ASC (and dependent
paragraphs) should be struck out as the ASC fails to plead the primary facts on
which the conclusion pleaded in par 39 is based.  The ASC par 68(b) suggests that the
applicants may be able to plead a case that at least the first respondent and
the fourth respondent acted in concert in relevant respects.  The ASC par 68(l) is objectionable
because it assumes the matter which it seeks to establish, but the particulars
to par 68 generally suggest that the applicants may be able to plead a
case that others of the respondents and the fourth respondent acted in concert
in relevant respects.  It is less clear
whether the applicants are able to plead (or for that matter, would wish to
plead) facts to establish that all respondents acted in concert with each
other.  For these reasons leave to
replead or further amend the amended statement of claim should be given.

18(c), (d) and (e) – problems –
pleading the terms of the TPA, not the facts

32                 
The first respondent submits, in the words of
her counsel Mr Smith SC, that one cannot plead material facts by reference to
hypothetical categories.  The names of
the persons or companies who were hindered or prevented from acquiring goods,
and the identity of the persons whose businesses are likely to be substantially
and adversely affected thereby is essential if the first respondent is to know
the case she has to meet. 
Mr Littlemore QC’s response is that the respondents’ conduct is
continuing and that the harm done by the respondents’ conduct is at an early
stage of development.  It is sufficient
to plead the classes of persons who are affected by the pleaded conduct, and
the identities of the particular persons said to fall within a designated class
can and will be provided in the fullness of time.

33                 
For there to be a contravention of s 45D,
there must be at least two persons who concert, and third and fourth persons
between whom the process of supply or acquisition is hindered or
prevented.  If one commences the analysis
at the bottom of the Australian wool chain, the applicants’ case is that the
pleaded conduct hindered or prevented consumers (third persons) from acquiring
Australian wool garments from retailers or garment manufacturers offering or
proposing to supply such garments (fourth persons).

34                 
‘Prevents’ suggests a total cessation of
dealings between the third person and the target; ‘hinders’ suggests that they
have been made more difficult: J D Heydon, Trade Practices Law, Lawbook
Co, Sydney, 2001 at [10.130].  ‘Hinder’,
in the context of s 45D has received a broad construction, as in any way
affecting to an appreciable extent the ease of the usual way of supplying or
acquiring goods or services: Devenish v Jewel Food Stores Pty Ltd (1991)
172 CLR 32 at 45-46 (Mason CJ); Australian Builders’ Labourers’ Federated
Union of Workers – Western Australian Branch v J-Corp Pty Ltd (1993) 42 FCR
452 at 460.

35                 
In Australian Broadcasting Commission v
Parish (1980) 43 FLR 129,
Deane J (with whose judgment the other members of the Court agreed in this
respect) said at 153:

‘The actual cessation of
supply or acquisition of goods or services is commonly the object and can
represent the culmination of conduct in breach of s. 45D of the Act.  The conduct hindering or preventing supply or
acquisition to which the section refers can be engaged in by threat and verbal
intimidation as well as by physical interference with the actual
activities.  The fact that the supplier
or acquirer of goods or services is a party to the actual cessation of supply
does not preclude the activities of others involved in the cessation from
amounting to their engaging in conduct in concert of the type proscribed by the
section.’



36                 
Similarly in his (dissenting) judgment in Devenish
v Jewel Food Stores Pty Ltd (supra) at 49-50, Deane J said:

‘Conduct which significantly
disadvantages a trader because, and for so long as, it stocks a particular
product hinders the acquisition by the trader of that product.  It would be an illogical and unduly
constrictive construction of s. 45D(1) to hold that the imposition of economic
damage upon a trader to force it to cease stocking a competitor’s product is
not “conduct that hinders … the acquisition of” that product within the meaning
of s. 45D unless and until the conduct has succeeded to the extent of actually
preventing the trader from acquiring and supplying it.’



37                 
The amended statement of claim does allege that
some retailers were exposed to disadvantageous treatment because they had not
agreed not to stock products made of Australian wool.  It would therefore follow from the judgments
of Deane J referred to above that the pleaded conduct might, in fact,
hinder or prevent at least some retailers from acquiring for resale products
made of Australian wool, but whether this would be so in the case of all
persons in the category of ‘retailers’ is a different question. Section 45D
requires there to be an actual hindrance or prevention of the supply or
acquisition of the goods or service in question; it is not sufficient to plead
facts which do no more than suggest the possibility that hindrance or
prevention might occur.

38                 
In any event, the relevant allegation is that consumers
were hindered or prevented from acquiring Australian wool garments from
retailers, but no facts are pleaded which could establish that there was in
fact any affect to an appreciable extent on the ease of the usual way in which
consumers acquired Australian wool garments from retailers.  Neither the respondents, nor the Court should
be left to speculate as to how this might have come about, assuming it
did.  The applicants’ case may be that
the operation of s 45D is enlivened because potential consumers were
prevented from entering certain stores. 
Another possibility (and there may be others) is that one or more
retailers succumbed to PETA’s demands, and ceased stocking products made of
Australian wool, hence there was no product available for acquisition.  But if that is the way in which the
applicants’ case is to be put, they may be confronted with the view of the
majority in Devenish v Jewel Food Store (supra) that conduct which
prevents the supply of goods by a target corporation, without more, does not
amount to the hindering or preventing of acquisition of those goods from the
target corporation.

39                 
I express no concluded view on that question,
(on which I have not received any submissions) because to do so would be
premature and the question may never arise. 
I mention these two possible ways in which the applicants’ case might be
put to illustrate the practical importance of the applicants being required to
plead material facts sufficient to make out each essential element of the cause
of action propounded.  The two examples
of the way in which the case might be put raise quite different factual and
legal questions.

40                 
Similar problems emerge as one moves up the
Australian wool production chain.  The
applicants have created in the ASC a theoretical construct in which some retailers
might or might not be hindered or prevented from acquiring Australian wool
garments from garment manufacturers, rather than pleading facts which, if
proven, would show that this has in fact occurred.  If the applicants wish to make out a sweeping
case that the category of persons described as retailers were hindered or
prevented from acquiring Australian wool garments then the facts necessary to
sustain such a case need to be pleaded. 
The pleaded facts cannot sustain so broad a claim.  If, on the other hand, the applicants wish to
make out a narrower case that particular retailers were in fact deterred or
hindered by the pleaded conduct from acquiring goods, then the necessary
surgery on the pleading needs to be performed, including (but not limited to)
pleading the facts relied upon to establish hindrance or prevention.

41                 
The problem with the pleading is not so much
that it fails to put a name on all participants.  Sometimes in some contexts, for example, it
may be sufficient to allege that consumers were prevented from acquiring a
product without being able to name those affected.  Rather, the problem is that the pleading
repeats the language of the TPA, rather than pleading the facts which bring the
applicants’ claim within that language.

42                 
Similar observations apply in relation to the
next level in the Australian wool production chain.

43                 
The s 45D case as pleaded also suffers from
the vice that no facts are pleaded which show the causal link between the
conduct constituting the contravention of the TPA and the damage alleged to
have been suffered by the applicants on any of them.

44                 
The amended statement of claim should be struck
out insofar as it pleads a case based on contravention of s 45D of the
TPA, with liberty to replead.

18(f) – s 45DB

45                 
Section 45DB(1) of the TPA provides:

‘A
person must not, in concert with another person, engage in conduct for the
purpose, and having or likely to have the effect, of preventing or
substantially hindering a third person (who is not an employer of the first
person) from engaging in trade or commerce involving the movement of goods
between Australia and places outside Australia.’



46                 
The ASC par 49(d) alleges that all
respondents have by their conduct within Australia contravened s 45DB of
the TPA by reason of the matters referred to in pars 40 and 46 of the
ASC.  Those paragraphs alleged that the
respondents engaged in conduct with each other that hindered or prevented each
of the Australian wool acquirers (ie wool processors or their intermediaries)
from acquiring wool from the applicants, and that the applicants supply
Australian wool to Australian wool acquirers in trade or commerce between
Australia and places outside Australia.

47                 
I have already found that the pleading is
deficient insofar as acting in concert is pleaded, but not the primary facts,
and insofar as hindrance or prevention is asserted, but not the primary
facts.  However, in addition, the first
respondent contends that this pleading is deficient insofar as it sets up a
case involving contravention of s 45DB, as there is no allegation that any
third person was hindered or prevented in the movement of goods.

48                 
In his submissions, Mr Smith SC contended that
if Benetton, for example, was induced not to purchase Australian wool products,
that would not of itself be sufficient to enliven the operation of
s 45DB.  I do not know whether this
is an apt example, as the s 45DB case as presently pleaded is confined to
overseas wool processors who purchase Australian wool from one or more of the
applicants, and I do not know if Benetton conducts its business at that level.

49                 
But in addition to the deficiencies in the
s 45DB case which are consequential upon my findings in relation to the
s 45D claim, there is no allegation of facts which could conceivably
establish that the purpose and likely effect of the conduct within Australia
was for the purpose and likely to have the effect of inducing a foreign wool
processor not to buy Australian wool.

50                 
Whether there is a contravention of s 45DB
if an overseas person is induced not to buy Australian goods is something which
I prefer not to attempt to decide in the abstract, without a pleading in its
final form of a claim based on s 45DB, if there is to be one.  That preference is reinforced by the second
reading speech delivered in the Senate which is referred to by Mr Robert
McClelland in his article on s 45D and s 45E of the TPA (Australian
Bar Review, Vol 16, No 2, 1997, at p 128), on which I have not had the
benefit of any submissions.

51                 
The ASC should be struck out insofar as relief
is claimed based on a contravention of s 45DB, with liberty to replead.

Accessorial liability

52                 
Paragraph 68 of the ASC alleges that the first
respondent was an accessory under s 75B of the TPA to contraventions by
the other respondents of s 45D, s 45DB and s 51AA of the TPA.

53                 
The first respondent submits that the material
facts alleged against the first respondent which are relied on to establish her
knowledge of the essential elements of the contraventions of s 45D and
s 45DB are not pleaded.  This
submission was not developed in oral argument. 
The particulars to the ASC par 68 allege that persons said to be
primarily liable for contraventions of s 45D and s 45DB are officers,
servants or agents of PETA, and that the first respondent is the President of
and directs the activities of PETA.  This
submission fails for that reason.

54                 
Second, accessorial liability under s 75B
is asserted against the first respondent in relation to conduct on the part of
other respondents which took place outside Australia.  Section 75B occurs in Part VI of the TPA,
which is not a part of the TPA which is given an extended operation by
s 5(1).  This question was
considered by Merkel J in Bray v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (supra), in
which his Honour applied the general cannon of construction that an enactment
will not be construed as applying to foreigners in respect of acts done by them
outside the dominions of the sovereign power enacting, subject to a contrary
action appearing.  His Honour held (at
[55]) that the TPA did not evince a contrary intention and that s 75B is
to be construed as only being applicable to conduct in Australia, noting that
Wilcox J had come to a similar conclusion in Trade Practices Commission
v Australia Meat Holdings Pty Ltd (1988) 83 ALR 299 at 355.

55                 
The amended statement of claim should be struck
out insofar as it alleges accessorial liability under s 75B of the TPA
based on conduct occurring outside Australia.

56                 
Third, it is alleged that the first respondent
is liable under s 75B in respect of an alleged contravention by the fourth
and eighth respondents of s 51AA of the TPA.  Paragraph 66 of the ASC effectively alleges
that the pleaded conduct was in trade or commerce.  Whilst the ASC par 65(c) alleges that
each of the fourth and eighth respondents engage in some trading or commercial
activities, the first respondent submits that the pleaded conduct could not
possibly be in trade or commerce: Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd v
Nelson (1990) 169 CLR 594 at 604. 
Because s 51AA can have no application to the fourth and eighth
respondents, the first respondent cannot be liable under s 75B.

57                 
This submission should be rejected.  Whether the relevant conduct is ‘in’ trade or
commerce involves factual questions including a consideration of the nature of
any business conducted by the fourth respondent and the eighth respondent.  The question is whether the relevant conduct
is that of a bystander commenting on trade or commerce in which others are
engaged, rather than something done in that (or any other) trade or commerce: Dataflow
Computer Services Pty Ltd v Goodman (1999) 168 ALR 169.

58                 
It cannot be said that the applicants’ claim in
this respect is so manifestly untenable that it should be summarily dismissed.

The conspiracy claim

59                 
Like fraud, conspiracy is not an allegation that
should lightly be made: Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association Inc (1986)
69 ALR 660 at 700 (Toohey J).

60                 
Conspiracy is the agreement of two or more
persons to do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful act by unlawful means.  Historically, there are two kinds of
conspiracy, the elements of which are distinct:

            (1)        an ‘unlawful means’ conspiracy in which
the participants combine together to perform acts which are themselves
unlawful; and

            (2)        a combination to perform acts which,
although not themselves unlawful, are done with the sole or predominant purpose
of injuring the claimant.

See Bullen
& Leake & Jacob’s Precedents of Pleadings, Vol 2, 15th
edn, Sweet & Maxwell, London, 2004, at [50-01]; McKellar v Container
Terminal Management Services Ltd (supra) at [135] – [154].

61                 
Bullen & Leake identifies the
necessary elements in an action in conspiracy at [50-01.1]:

‘The claimant must plead and
prove the following necessary elements:

(i)        a combination or
agreement between two or more individuals (required for both types of
conspiracy);

(ii)       an intent to
injure (required for both types of conspiracy but must be shown as the sole or
predominant purpose for type (2) above);

(iii)      pursuant to which
combination or agreement and with that intention certain acts were carried out;

(iv)      resulting loss and
damage to the claimant.’



62                 
A conspiracy can be proved without evidence of
an express agreement.  A court is
entitled to have regard to the overt acts pleaded, and to infer from those acts
that there was an express agreement to further the common object of the
combination.  All of those said to be
parties to the conspiracy should be sufficiently aware of the surrounding
circumstance, and share the same object, for it properly to be said that they
are acting in concert.

63                 
‘Unlawful means’ includes crimes and tort and
breaches of statutory provisions: Trindade & Cane, The Law of Torts in
Australia, 3rd edn, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, 1999at
p 230.  A person is using unlawful
means if they are doing an act which they are not at liberty to commit: Dresna
Pty Ltd v Misu Nominees Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 169.  It is not open to a party to plead as an
alternative to a substantive cause of action already pleaded the tort of
conspiracy to commit the substantive wrong, nor can there be a common law
conspiracy to contravene the TPA outside the form of conspiracy expressly
provided for in s 75B(1)(d) of the TPA: McKellar (supra) at [195]
and [197].  But the first respondent has
not taken any objection to the ASC on this account, hence these matters can be
put to one side.

64                 
The tort requires an intention to injure.  As Kiefel and Jacobson JJ observed in Dresna
Pty Ltd v Misu Nominees Pty Ltd (supra, at [7]) an agreement to do an
unlawful act that results in damage to another party is not the same as a
conspiracy to injure that party.  In
order to prove a conspiracy a claimant must show that the wrongful act
complained of was done with a design of injuring the claimant and that it did
so.  According to their Honours, a
conspiracy could be directed not only at a particular individual, but also at a
class, in the sense of all members of the class.  Their Honours went on to say (at [123]) that
the test for an action in conspiracy is: ‘what was the object of those
combining when they acted as they did’. 
They must have acted in order that, not with the result that, the
claimant should suffer damage.

65                 
The ASC pleads the conspiracy claim as follows:

‘69.      In or about August 2004, the First, Second, Third, Fifth,
Sixth, Seventh, Ninth and/or Tenth Respondents, or any two or more of them,
combined to commit an unlawful act or acts with the intention of harming the
trade to the First to One Hundred and Fourth Applicants and/or the persons
represented by the First Applicant.



            Particulars of unlawful acts



(a)       Threatening to publish defamation;

(b)       Threatening to publish injurious falsehoods;

(c)        Threatening to publish false and misleading statements;

(d)       Publishing defamatory statements;

(e)        Publishing injurious falsehoods;

(f)        Publishing false and misleading statements;

(g)       intimidation;

(h)       interference with contractual relations;

(i)        trespass;

(j)        conduct in breach
of Section 45D and Section 45DB of the Trade Practices Act and section 45D of
the Competition Code;

(k)       conduct in breach of Section 51AA of the Trade Practices Act.



70.       In the alternative to the preceding paragraph, in or about
August 2004, the First, Second, Third, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth and Tenth
Respondents, or any two or more of them, combined to commit an act with the
intention of harming the First to One Hundred and Fourth Applicants and/or the
persons represented by the First Applicant.



            Particulars of act



Persuading potential
purchasers to boycott goods manufactured with their products.



71.       The Applicants have suffered injury, loss and damage as a
consequence of the Respondents’ said conduct.’



66                 
The deficiencies in these paragraphs identified
by counsel for the first respondent are as follows:

            (a)        the use of ‘and/or’ on the first line of
par 69 potentially renders the entire allegation meaningless;

            (b)        further, the use of those words creates
multiple possible combinations of persons involved in the alleged concerted
act.  The allegation in that form is
embarrassing;

            (c)        the persons who are said to have been
the object of the conspiracy are not clearly identified, with the paragraph
allowing for the focus to be on any one of the named applicants or the unnamed
‘represented’ parties;

            (d)        no acts are pleaded.  The ‘particulars’ are meaningless and
embarrassing; and

            (e)        the alternative claim is equally vague
and devoid of factual content.  There is
no specification of the ‘particulars of fact’.

67                 
The first respondent also submits that having
regard to the fact that some or all of the named applicants may not have been
the object of the conspiracy, the present allegation that all applicants have
suffered injury, loss and damage is unsustainable.  Further, there is no particularisation of the
alleged loss and damage suffered by each of the named applicants.

68                 
In my opinion, the pleading of each of the
conspiracy claims is deficient in the following respects:

            (a)        it fails to identify clearly the object
or objects of the conspiracy.  The
objects are said to be the first to 104th applicants and/or the
persons represented by AWIL (some 30,000 Australian wool growers).  If the objects of the conspiracy were all
Australian wool growers, a question may arise as to whether such a conspiracy
would be sufficiently targeted to be actionable at the suit of these particular
claimants.  A pleading of a single
conspiracy, the objects of which may be 104 people or 30,104 people is
embarrassing as a conspiracy takes its shape and scope from its objects, and a
conspiracy defined in that way is shapeless;

            (b)        it fails to plead the primary facts on
which the conclusion of combination is based;

            (c)        it fails to plead the overt acts which
were carried out pursuant to the combination with the intention of injuring the
claimant;

            (d)        assuming the overt acts are the pleaded
conduct, further facts need to be pleaded so as to show how that particular
conduct is capable of injuring all of the applicants.  The linkage referred to earlier in these
reasons is not there; and

            (e)        the ASC par 70 fails to plead that
the conspirators had the sole or dominant intention of injuring the applicants.

69                 
The ASC should be struck out insofar as it
pleads a claim for damages for conspiracy, with liberty to replead.

Intimidation claim

70                 
The tort of intimidation is available when a
claimant suffers a loss because the defendant has threatened a third party with
an unlawful act as a result of which the third party acts to the financial
detriment of the plaintiff: Trindade & Cane (supra) at p 223: Latham
v Singleton (1981) 2 NSWLR 843 at 858. 
The claimant must show that although the threats are directed at a third
party they are really aimed at the claimant: Bullen & Leake
Vol 1 (supra) at [33-04].  A
necessary ingredient of the tort of intimidation is the intention to harm the
claimant: Trindade & Cane (supra) at 224.

71                 
The intimidation claim pleads a number of
communications sent by particular respondents to particular retailers
threatening adverse consequences to the recipients of the communications unless
they agreed not to purchase products containing Australian wool.

72                 
The claim as pleaded is defective in the
following respects:

            (a)        it fails to allege that any of the
respondents had the intention to harm the 104 applicants or any of them;

            (b)        with the possible exception of
Abercrombie & Fitch (ASC par 72) it fails to allege that the recipients
of the communications complied with the demand;

            (c)        it fails to allege that the retailers
were threatened with an unlawful act, or to plead facts (including foreign law)
from which an inference to this effect can be drawn.  For example, the ASC par 73 simply
alleges that a letter was sent to Marks & Spencer urging it to no longer
trade in products made of Australian wool; and

            (d)        it fails to plead any link between the
conduct complained of and any loss sustained by the 104 applicants.  For example, if it be shown that Abercrombie
& Fitch succumbed to PETA’s demands, how does that occasion loss to all or
any of the applicants?

73                 
This claim should also be struck out, with leave
to replead.

Conclusion

1.         The ASC should be struck out, with
liberty to the applicants to replead.

2.         The applicants
should pay the first respondent’s costs of the motion, and any costs thrown
away as a result of the making of these orders.

3.         The parties
should confer, and bring in short minutes of order to give effect to the
conclusions reached in this judgment, including a timetable for the preparation
of any proposed further amended statement of claim.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

1                    
The appellant appeals from a decision of the
Federal Magistrates Court (McInnis FM, Tran v Minister for Immigration and
Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs [2004] FMCA 327) refusing relief under s
39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) in respect of a decision of the
respondent Minister made on 20 February 2003 to cancel the appellant’s visa
under s 501(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).  Senior counsel for the appellant did not
attack any of the reasoning of the learned magistrate and the hearing of the
appeal was conducted without any reference to those reasons.  This is not a course to be encouraged, since
the whole point of an appeal is to determine whether or not the court below
fell into error: Branir Pty Ltd v Owston Nominees Pty Ltd (No 2) (2001)
117 FCR 424 at [21]-[22].  Nevertheless,
I shall deal with the issues as they were argued by the parties.

2                    
The appellant, born in 1976, has been a
permanent resident of Australia since August 1990.  He has never taken Australian citizenship and
remains a citizen from Vietnam.  It is
not in dispute that the appellant does not pass the character test as
prescribed by s 501(6)(a).  He has a
“substantial criminal record” within the meaning of subs 7(c), having twice
been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of more than 12 months.  The question is therefore whether there was
jurisdictional error in the Minister’s exercising his discretion to cancel the
visa.

3                    
A case officer within the Department prepared an
Issues Paper dated 20 February 2003.  The
Issues Paper was not provided to the appellant. 
However, it was not suggested that that in itself amounted to a breach
of the rules of natural justice: Dagli v Minister for Immigration and
Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 497 at [47]; Firlais v
Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003]
FCA 725 at [25], Tuncok v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and
Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1069 at [35]. 
The Issues Paper is an integral part of the decision making process
itself and is not to be equated with information obtained from a third party
about the appellant which is required to be disclosed to him in accordance with
ordinary principles:  Tuncok at
[41]. The appellant did however receive a copy of a lengthy Direction, issued
by the Minister under s 499, which discusses the considerations to be applied
in the exercise of the discretion. 
Amongst other things, under the heading “The seriousness of the conduct”
the Direction gives examples of offences “which are considered by the
Government to be very serious”.  These
include crimes against children and any other crimes involving violence or
threats of violence.

4                    
Nevertheless, senior counsel for the appellant
submitted that there was “an imbalance” in the presentation in the Issues Paper
requiring the appellant to be given an opportunity to answer the matters
alleged.  There was said to be a discussion
of irrelevant material and an obscuring of relevant material.  On the appellant’s case this arose primarily
from the treatment of two matters, an incident of 6 October 1999 and the
sentencing remarks of a County Court judge when the appellant was sentenced on
20 June 2002.

5                    
The Issues Paper revealed that the appellant was
sentenced on two occasions to terms of imprisonment in excess of 12
months.  They were as follows:

Events of 6 October 1999

6                    
Among the matters dealt with at the Melbourne
Magistrates’ Court on 11 April 2000 were charges arising out of events which
occurred on 6 October 1999.  They are
recorded in the Issues Paper as follows:

“10.     On 6 October 1999,
Mr Tran was in Sunshine at the intersection of Hampshire Road and Hertford
Road.  A Ford Fairlane driven by
Ms Margaret Bower was stationary at a red light in Hertford Road waiting
to turn right into Hampshire Road.



11.       On seeing Mr Tran
approach her vehicle, Ms Bower used her elbow to lock the driver’s door.  Mr Tran who was holding a syringe in his hand
tried to open the driver’s door.  As he was
unable to gain entry, Mr Tran started banging on the driver’s window with the
palm of the hand in which he held the syringe. 
While doing this Mr Tran said to Ms Bower the word “money” three or four
times.



12.       Ms Bower,
frightened and in fear for her safety and that of her two year old daughter who
was in the backseat of the vehicle, realised that the other doors of the
vehicle were unlocked and sped through the red traffic light to get away from
Mr Tran.  Shortly after Ms Bower telephoned
the police and Mr Tran was detained and searched at the Sunshine Railway
Station.  The search located a syringe, a
pocketknife and two small balloons containing heroin.



13.       On 1 November
1999, Mr Tran voluntarily took part in a formal identification parade where Ms
Bower identified him.”



At Annexure D of the Issues Paper is a memorandum dated 26
July 2001 from Senior Constable Jaason Wallace of Victoria Police dealing with
the events of 6 October 1999.  A summary
of the facts, substantially to the effect of the passage quoted in [6] above,
is attached.  The memorandum states,
amongst other things:

“1. On 11/04/2000 this matter was finalised at the Melbourne
Magistrates Court which resulted in imprisonment of TRAN….



 2. The primary charge of
attempted armed robbery was withdrawn solely due to the principle [sic] victim in
this matter refusing to attend court due to her traumatisation from the
incident.”



Also included in the Issues Paper are certified extracts of
convictions of the appellant at the Melbourne
Magistrates Court on 11 April 2000, one of which records



“Defendant at SUNSHINE on 6/10/1999 did commit a breach of Act
7405.24.2 ASSAULT WITH WEAPON”.



7                    
It was submitted that the allegations concerning
the events of 6 October 1999 and made in the Issues Paper were not the subject
of any charge and that the summary attached to Senior Constable Wallace’s
memorandum refers to matters in respect of which the appellant was not
convicted.  The appellant was not
convicted of robbery in respect of the events of 6 October 1999.  It was submitted therefore that the Issues
Paper was inaccurate and misleading and that irrelevant matters may have been
taken into account and relevant matters may not have been taken into
account.  The Issues Paper may “suffer
from imbalance resulting in a failure of natural justice”.

8                    
However it seems clear that the appellant was
convicted in relation to the events of 6 October 1999, but on the lesser
charge of assault with a weapon.  From
Senior Constable Wallace’s memorandum it appears that the more serious charge
of attempted armed robbery was withdrawn because of the non-appearance of the
victim.  The inference is that the
appellant pleaded guilty to the lesser offence. 
But there is no substance in the argument that the Issues Paper was
wrong in stating that the appellant was convicted for his conduct on 6 October
1999.  He was also convicted on 11 April
2000 at the Melbourne Magistrates Court of robbery, but this was in respect of
an offence committed on 28 May 1999 at Springvale.

 

Sentencing remarks of Judge Anderson

9                    
The other ground of alleged jurisdictional error
is said to arise from the treatment in the Issues Paper of the sentencing
remarks of his Honour Judge Anderson in the County Court at Melbourne on 20
June 2002.  In par 31 of the Issues Paper
it is said:

“In his sentencing remarks his Honour Judge Anderson of the
County Court said the following with regard to the offences for which Mr Tran
was convicted on 20 June 2002:”



There then follows a quotation from the sentencing remarks
extending for about a page.  The
sentencing remarks in full appear as Annexure E.  They are as follows (those parts which appear
in the quotation at par 31 are underlined):

“HIS HONOUR:  Tran Doi Bui
has pleaded guilty to two counts of armed robbery (maximum penalty 25 years’
imprisonment) and two counts of intentionally 
cause injury (maximum penalty ten years’ imprisonment).



The offences were committed at the high rise flats in
Richmond.  One of the victims, a
schoolboy, lives at the flats.  He and
three school friends were returning home from school on 4 June 2001 at about
4.00 p.m.  They entered the flats.  The four boys entered a lift, the
offenders followed.  The prisoner
produced a pair of pliers and asked for money. 
The offenders included the prisoner, a co-offender, Shane Paul Victor,
and another man who has not been identified. 
Further demands were made for money and a boy’s wallet and blazer.

 

The prisoner took $50 from the wallet.  He punched one of the boys in the face and
elbowed the second boy in the chin. 
Later, when the prisoner tried to take one of the boy’s watch, he
punched him in the eye and further punched him. 
He tried to kick the other boy and punched him in the mouth causing
three of his teeth to be slightly pushed in.  The counts of armed robbery relate to the
taking of the blazers and wallets from each of the boys and the counts of
intentionally  cause injury relate to the
punching of each of the two boys.  All of
the items were recovered except for $50 cash. 
The boys’ blazers were damaged.



The prisoner was arrested. 
The pliers were found.  He
admitted they belonged to him.  A record
of interview was conducted.  He said he
could not recall the incident that day because of his drug use.



The prisoner has a long term drug problem and has a large
number of previous convictions for drug offences mainly relating to heroin.  I was informed by his counsel, Mr Lavery,
that on the day of the offending he had been using a prescription drug,
Normison, as a substitute for heroin and the drug was injected by him.  It was apparently only the second time he had
used the drug and it had a serious effect upon him.  I was also informed that at the time of the
offending he was upset because a person whom he had lent a significant sum of
money had gambled the money away.



The co-offender, Shane Paul Victor, pleaded guilty on 4 December
2001 before His Honour Judge R.P.L. Lewis. 
He faced two counts of robbery relating to the incidents which comprised
the first two counts before me and two further counts of theft which related to
the theft of a motor vehicle and the contents of the vehicle.



In respect of the counts of robbery Victor was sentenced on each
count to imprisonment for one year.  On
the additional theft counts, he was sentenced on each count to three months’
imprisonment.  In respect of the robbery
convictions six months of the second robbery conviction was made cumulative on
the first period of imprisonment.  In
addition the second of the sentences for theft of three months was also made
cumulative making a total of 21 months’ imprisonment of which nine months was
to be served immediately and 12 months was suspended for a period of three
years.



Each of the victims has filed a Victim Impact Statement.  The statements were before His Honour Judge
Lewis at the time of the sentencing Shane Victor.  Both of the victims indicate that apart
from their physical injuries they have also been effected [sic] by the assaults
upon them.  The boys were aged 13 and
14.  The boy who lived at the flats said
his friends no longer feel safe to visit him at the flats and he is reluctant
to venture out of the flat apart from his attendance at school.  Both say they do not feel safe at other times.



The prisoner is aged 25. 
He was born on 12 December 1976 in Vietnam.  His father came to Australia before the
prisoner was born.  He has no memory of
his mother.  She left him shortly after
his birth.  When he was aged about 13 or
14, his father returned from Australia and brought him to Australia.  He moved in with his father and step-mother
who worked as sewing machine operator. 
He attended language courses and the Brunswick Secondary College to Year
9.  I was informed by his counsel, Mr
Lavery, that although he was capable of going further he was involved with
other young men and had been getting into trouble primarily because of the time
he spent on the streets and because of his drug use.  He commenced smoking heroin at about the age
of 15 or 16.



He has an extensive criminal history from about the age of 17
involving 16 appearances in the Magistrates’ Court for a total of 57
convictions including 21 convictions for drug matters.



On 11 April 2000 he was convicted in the Magistrates’ Court at
Melbourne of a number of offences including assault with a weapon and
robbery.  As a result he was sentenced to
a total of 16 months imprisonment with a minimum to serve of ten months.  By the time he was sentenced he had
apparently served an extensive period in custody and had been released some
months before the present offending.  No
breach of parole is involved in the present offending.



A number of other offences were dealt with on 30 May 2002 in the
Magistrates’ Court at Melbourne.  He was
sentenced on that day to six months’ imprisonment.  He had been in custody from 15 June 2001
until he was sentenced for the other offences. 
At the end of May he had served 350 days per-sentence detention in
respect of the present offences.



During the plea I was informed that a young woman in court was a
person with whom the prisoner has had a relationship for some time including
prior to his incarceration.  She has
maintained telephone contact whilst he has been in prison although she has not
been allowed to visit him.  The reason
for this is unclear although she apparently has a prior conviction
herself.  She has a five year old
daughter and I was informed that before he went into custody the prisoner had
assumed some responsibility for the child during the four or five months he had
lived with his partner.



Mr Lavery conceded that the sentence imposed on the prisoner
must bear some relationship to the sentence imposed on the co-offender by His
Honour Judge Lewis.  Victor had eight
prior appearances before the Magistrates’ Court between January 1995 and
January 2001 for a total of 17 offences including driving matters and offences
involving drugs and dishonesty.  Victor
had one conviction for making a threat to inflict serious injury for which he
was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment as part of an aggregate term of
imprisonment of six months in September 1998.



There are a number of similarities between the two
offenders.  They both had heroin
addictions, they both have prior convictions. 
There are, however, some differences. 
The prisoner has pleaded guilty to two counts of armed robbery
because he was in possession of a pair of pliers whereas Victor was charged
with robbery and it was accepted that Victor was unaware that the prisoner had
a pair of pliers.



I have referred to the two counts of theft for which Victor was
dealt with.  The prisoner faces two
counts of intentionally causing injury. 
It appears that during the incident he was the primary aggressor and the
person who inflicted injury on both of the victims.  One of the victims notes in his police
statement that the offender who can be identified as Victor punched him in the
face a couple of times.  There is no
reference in the police statement of the other victim to any offender
inflicting any physical violence apart from the prisoner.



The pleas were made by Victor on 24 August 2001 at the time of
the committal mention whereas the prisoner’s pleas were indicated on 17 May
2002.  I have referred in general terms
to the nature and extent of the prior convictions of each of the offenders.  His Honour Judge Lewis heard evidence from
Victor’s elder brother who runs a business in Portland and with whom Victor had
been living and working prior to being sentenced.  His Honour, in sentencing Victor, referred to
his “relative youth and the compelling evidence of your brother [which] have
persuaded me that you do have some prospects of rehabilitation”.



Mr Lavery submitted that it was an appropriate case to be
adjourned so that a pre-sentence report in the form of a psychological or
psychiatric assessment could be undertaken. 
I indicated at the time I considered, in light of the fact that it was
inevitable the prisoner would be sentenced to a significant period in gaol,
that such an assessment would be inappropriate at this stage.  However, in view of the matters raised in the
plea, it would be appropriate to ensure that the prison authorities are made
aware of those matters so that the maximum advantage can be taken by the
prisoner of the time he will inevitable [sic] spend in custody.  To that end a copy of my sentencing remarks,
when revised, will be sent to both the prison authorities and to the Adult
Parole Board.



The matters referred to by Mr Lavery were the disrupted
upbringing of the prisoner, the fact that he has only one family member in
Australia, his father, with whom apparently he lost contact soon after his
incarceration; his extensive offending record since shortly after he came to
Australia; his limited education; his involvement in the drug sub-culture; the
lack of success of all efforts at rehabilitation in the past notwithstanding
the fact that on a number of occasions court orders provided opportunities for
treatment and rehabilitation.



Mr Lavery also informed me that the time the prisoner had spent
on remand had been difficult for him because it was the longest period he had
spent in gaol.  He submitted that the
fact his partner had maintained contact during this period indicated there was
some substance in the relationship and perhaps provided some hope for the
rehabilitation of the prisoner in the future.



The prosecutor, Mr Robinson, submitted the respective roles of
the offenders were different primarily because of the more serious offences of
armed robbery the prisoner faced and further charges of intentionally causing
injury.  The prisoner has a worse criminal
history and because of these differences and the early plea by Shane Victor, it
is appropriate and indeed necessary that the prisoner receive a more severe
sentence.



The prosecutor also referred to the fact that the offences
were committed on 13 or 14 year old boys, and money was demanded with threats
in a public place.  A weapon was used and
each of the boys was physically assaulted and injury resulted.

 

The offending is very disturbing.  It occurred at the high rise flats in
Richmond where large numbers of people live in reasonably close proximity.  They are entitled, as are their visitors, to
feel that they are secure in their own homes and the environs.  The offending was no doubt a result of the
drug addiction of the offenders.  Whilst
this provides an explanation, it provides no excuse.  The prisoner has a long and extensive history
of criminal behaviour including many drug and dishonesty offences.  There is the previous conviction I have
referred to for robbery and assault with a weapon.



It is appropriate that the sentence I impose reflect the
demands of both general deterrence, specific deterrence and appropriate
punishment in all the circumstances including the sentence imposed on the
offender by His Honour Judge Lewis.



Stand up please, Mr Tran: 
on Count 1 you will be convicted and sentenced to two years’
imprisonment.  On Count 2 convicted and
sentenced to two years’ imprisonment. 
Count 3 convicted and sentenced to six months’ imprisonment.  Count 4 convicted and sentenced to six
months’ imprisonment.  Nine months of the
term of imprisonment on Count 2 and three months of the term of imprisonment on
Count 3 are to be served cumulatively upon the term of imprisonment imposed on
Count 1.  The total effective sentence s
three years’ imprisonment and I direct that you serve 21 months before you
become eligible for release on parole. 
So that is a head sentence of three years and a minimum sentence of 21
months.



I make a declaration in relation to 350 days pre-sentence
detention.  I make a disposal order in
relation to the pliers.  An order was
sought by the prosecutor pursuant to s.464ZF of the Crimes Act, directing that
the prisoner undergo a forensic procedure for the taking of an intimate sample
from his body limited to a saliva sample, which order was not opposed.  I will make the order in relation to the
prisoner and I will publish separate reasons for that decision.  I am required to inform you that to enable
the forensic procedure to be conducted a member of the police force may use
reasonable force for that purpose.



Be seated please.  Do you
have copies of those orders?



MR ROBINSON:  Yes I do,
Your Honour, there is [sic]
three copies of each order, one for the record and then to be returned ---



HIS HONOUR:  Are there any
other matters, Mr Robinson?



MR ROBINSON:  I don’t think
so, Your Honour.  If I could just perhaps
indicate, Your Honour, my learned friend just raised the question of whether
the sentence would be automatically concurrent with the sentence he received on
30 May and I have just checked the Sentencing Act.  That does appear to be the case and that is
probably what Your Honour intended as well.



HIS HONOUR:  Yes:  I think it is necessary that I specifically
relate the non-parole period that I have imposed.  I must say that that is a matter I had
overlooked.  It is necessary for me to –
is it necessary for me to set a non-parole period?



MR ROBINSON:  No, Your
Honour:  it is s.16(1) of the Sentencing
Act indicates that unless otherwise directed a sentence will be served
concurrently with any uncompleted sentence so that this sentence will just be
served concurrently with that Magistrates’ Court sentence and that appears to
me to be a reasonable outcome.



HIS HONOUR:  Thank you, Mr
Robinson.  That is certainly the effect
so that the sentence I impose will by operation of the Sentencing Act be served
concurrently with the sentence imposed on 30 May and he will be eligible to be
released on parole in 21 months taking into account the period of pre-sentence
detention.



MR ROBINSON:  If Your
Honour pleases.



HIS HONOUR:  Mr Tan [sic] can be taken
down.”

10                 
In general the complaint of the appellant was
similar to that made in Re Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs;
Ex parte Palme (2003) 201 ALR 327 at [16] where it was said that the
prosecutor (ie the person seeking constitutional writs) “had not the
opportunity to see how the authors of the submission had ‘distilled’ the
relevant material and commented on it”.

11                 
The majority, Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ
(with whom on this point McHugh J agreed at [59] and the dissentient Kirby J at
[131]-[132] did not disagree), seemed to doubt the conceptual basis of this
argument.  Their Honours said at [21]:

“Further, it does not readily appear how the principles of
procedural fairness could be engaged in a manner contended for by the
prosecutor.  It may be accepted, as the
prosecutor submitted, that his entitlement extended to the rebuttal, and
comment by way of submission of, adverse material received by the decision
maker from other sources.  That stops
short of supporting a complaint of the nature essentially involved here of the
‘pitch’ or ‘balance’ in the statement of relevant considerations in the
submission.”



12                 
To my mind, the concept of natural justice, at
least in the context of an allegation of jurisdictional error, does not require
the court to engage in a kind of sub-editing process whereby a person affected
can argue that material submitted to the decision-maker (being material of
which the person is aware) could have been arranged more persuasively for his
or her benefit. 

13                 
In the present case it was said that the
presentation of the trial judge’s sentencing remarks at par 31 would lead to
the belief that full substance of the sentencing remarks were set out in that
paragraph with some small excision after the reference to the victim impact
statement.  

14                 
I see no reason to assume that the Minister
would ignore the full text of the sentencing remarks set out at Annexure
E.  I do not read Naidu v Minister for
Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 184 as
laying down any rule or presumption that this would have been the case.

15                 
It is apparent at a glance that par 31 does not
purport to set out the whole of the sentencing remarks.  It is inherently unlikely that a judge’s
sentencing remarks would commence “The four boys entered a lift, the offenders
followed”.  At four places in the body of
the Issues Paper (pars 22, 32, 39 and 82) it is stated that the transcript of
the County Court proceedings are in Annexure E. 
In any event, the parts quoted at par 31 give a fair indication of the
nature of the offence and the view his Honour took of it.

16                 
It was said at par 32 of the Issues Paper:

“His Honour Judge Anderson sentenced Mr Tran to a term of
imprisonment of 3 years with a non parole period of 21 months.  In a separate trial, His Honour Judge Lewis
sentenced Mr Tran’s co-offender, Mr Shane Victor to a term of imprisonment of
21 months but suspended 12 months for a period of 3 years.”



17                 
It was submitted that no mention is made of the
fact that the term of the imprisonment imposed had regard to parity in
sentencing.  But as already indicated,
his Honour’s remarks relating to parity are fully set out in Annexure E.  In any event, the relevance for present
purposes of this issue may be doubted. 
It might be conceivably relevant if a person facing visa cancellation
had received a heavier sentence than might have been expected because a
co-offender had earlier received a heavy sentence.  This might ground the comment that the
sentence imposed, viewed in isolation, exaggerated the sentencing court’s
assessment of the person’s criminality. 
However, in the present case the appellant’s role in the crime was more
serious than that of his co-offender, he had a worse criminal history and his
plea of guilty was entered later.  All
these were logical reasons why he should receive a more severe sentence.  

18                 
It was said that no mention was made of the fact
that the sentences imposed in the County Court would be served concurrently
with the sentences earlier imposed in the Magistrates Court.  His Honour noted that pursuant to s 16(1) of
the Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic), the sentence would be served
concurrently with the earlier sentences. 
I do not see how this was of any relevance to the discretion the
Minister had to exercise and in any event is apparent in Annexure E.

19                 
It was said that Annexure E did not contain the
substance of the plea made by counsel on the appellant’s behalf before Judge
Anderson.  But his Honour did summarise
matters put on the appellant’s behalf by his counsel and in any case the body
of the Issues Paper contains a detailed account of the appellant’s education,
difficult home life, financial problems, addiction to heroin and other
mitigating factors.  

20                 
There is no statement in the Issues Paper that
the influence of the drug Normison seemed to have been accepted by the trial
judge.  Again, his Honour makes reference
to the use of Normison and certainly does not indicate that this material was
rejected.  There is no substance to the
argument that the material in litigation was presented “not as an objective
fact” but in terms of what the appellant had stated.

 

Conclusion

21                 
The application will be dismissed with costs.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

THE COURT:

1                    
This is an appeal from a judgment of
Heerey J (“the primary Judge”) dismissing under O 20 r 2 of the Federal
Court Rules (“the FCR”), a proceeding brought by the appellant (“Mr
Kalaba”) against the Commonwealth of Australia (“the Commonwealth”) and the
Australian Postal Corporation (“Australia Post”).  The primary Judge decided that the proceeding
was without legal foundation, and in dismissing it ordered Mr Kalaba to pay the
costs of the respondents.

2                    
The parties have requested the Court to consider
the matter on the papers without the necessity for any oral hearing.

3                    
We have agreed to this course and have
considered the submissions of the parties, the judgment of the primary Judge
and the appeal papers.

4                    
The judgment of the primary Judge is an
interlocutory one and it is therefore necessary for Mr Kalaba to obtain leave
to appeal.  In order to obtain such leave
it is common ground that it is necessary for Mr Kalaba to satisfy the Court
that in all the circumstances the decision is attended with sufficient doubt to
warrant its reconsideration on appeal, and that it must further be asked whether substantial injustice would result from a
refusal to grant leave to appeal, supposing that decision to be wrong: see Decor
Decoration Pty Limited v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397.

5                    
It is alleged in the Statement of Claim that Mr
Kalaba filed in the High Court that the Commonwealth refused to assist Mr
Kalaba’s application for a compensation claim, but later wrongly interfered in
Mr Kalaba’s affairs without his consent. 
The full terms of the Statement of Claim are set out in the judgment
below and it is not necessary to repeat them. 


6                    
The first claim by Mr Kalaba is that the
Commonwealth owed him a duty of care to protect his privacy and not to
interfere in or prejudice his claims for compensation and a concentration camp
pension in respect of his internment during World War II.  

7                    
In his reasons the primary Judge examined the
relevant authorities and concluded there was in fact an attempt by the
Commonwealth to assist Mr Kalaba by inquiring as to records concerning his
concentration camp internment, in the course of which there was incorrect
reference to the name of the camp by referring to it as “Sirvir” rather than
“Sarvar”.  The primary Judge held that
the circumstances considered as a whole could not give rise to any breach of
privacy.  

8                    
The primary Judge referred to the authorities
concerning the question of whether Australian law recognised a tort of breach
of privacy and found that on the present state of the authorities there was no
tort of privacy, although he noted that in Australian Broadcasting
Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd (2001) 208 CLR 199 at [132], three
members of the High Court left the possibility open.  In a subsequent case before the Victorian
Supreme Court, Giller v Procopets [2004] VSC 113 at [187]-[189], the
Court held that the law has not developed to the point where an action for
breach of privacy is recognised in Australia. 
The primary Judge was not prepared to foreclose the possibility of an
argument that Australian law should recognise a duty of privacy, provided that
there were circumstances in which such an argument could reasonably be
raised.  In his Honour’s opinion, there
were no such circumstances in the present case. 


9                    
In addition, the primary Judge found that the
damages claimed by Mr Kalaba turned on his imprisonment for five years for two
serious offences of arson in 1991 when he set fire first to a lift in a
building occupying his solicitor’s office in Canberra, and later to a vehicle
outside the Prime Minister’s office.  For
these offences Mr Kalaba was charged, convicted, and sentenced by the Supreme
Court of the Australian Capital Territory on 27 August 1991.  He served five years in prison.  In the view of the primary Judge, these
considerations showed that the damages and loss sought to be recovered were too
remote, as they could not be said to flow from the alleged breach of
privacy.  This is a further, alternative,
cogent reason for his Honour’s rejection of Mr Kalaba’s case as set out in his
Statement of Claim.

10                 
In his submissions on appeal, Mr Kalaba alleges
that the lawyers for both the respondents told lies under oath.  In support of the contention that the lawyer
for Australia Post told lies, Mr Kalaba refers in the transcript to a summary
of the Statement of Claim, and compares it with par 20 of the Statement of
Claim itself.  There is a
discrepancy.  However, in our view
nothing turns on the discrepancy raised by Mr Kalaba since the Statement of
Claim was before the primary Judge as he treated it as a basis of the
claims.  Nothing has been shown to flow
from the alleged mis-statement.  This
matter does not support a claim that there was a “fabricated Statement of
Claim.”  

11                 
There is also an incorrect statement in the
transcript on the hearing before the primary Judge, wherein, outlining the
Statement of Claim, Counsel refers to a period of five months imprisonment
although the Statement of Claim referred to five years imprisonment as a
consequence of Mr Kalaba’s conviction. 
However, the Statement of Claim, which is quoted in full in the
judgment, is clear and specific on this point, and there is a later reference
in the transcript by Counsel and the primary Judge to Mr Kalaba serving the
five year term.  Nothing has been
shown to flow from the mis-statement by Counsel regarding the term of
imprisonment, as recorded in the transcript. 
It can readily be seen that par 26 of the Statement of Claim
specifically refers to the five years sentence of imprisonment on 27 August
1991.

12                 
The claim against Australia Post, framed in
negligence for breach of a duty of care, as alleged in par 22 of the
Statement of Claim, is that Australia Post is said to have caused loss and
damage as a consequence of its failure to deliver correspondence in a timely
manner.  In his reasons for judgment the
primary Judge relied on s 34 of the Australian Postal Corporation Act
1999 (Cth), which provides that no proceeding lies against Australia Post
in relation to any loss by any act or omission, whether negligent or otherwise,
in relation to the carriage of a letter or other article by means of the letter
service.  This is, and was seen by the
primary Judge, to be a complete answer to Mr Kalaba’s claim in negligence.  The present case on the allegations in the
Statement of Claim, falls squarely within the defence provided by
s 34.  We agree with the primary
Judge that on the material before us there is no arguable case to the
contrary.  Nothing alleged in the
Statement of Claim, or in the appeal papers, could establish any sufficient connection
between the breach of duty alleged and the loss claimed of an opportunity to
seek compensation for war-time internment, or for imprisonment in the five year
period.

13                 
Having regard to the above reasons, appeal
papers and submissions of the appellant, both in chief and in reply, and to the
written submissions of the respondents, we are not persuaded that the judgment
below is attended by sufficient doubt in the present case to warrant the grant
of leave to appeal.  Accordingly, we
refuse the application for leave to appeal in this matter and we dismiss the
appeal.

  paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the
  Honourable Justices Tamberlin, North and Dowsett.

The applicant’s case is that she continues to suffer symptoms which are attributable to the thromboembolisms and their aftermath. The symptoms deny her much of the enjoyment of life and of her capacity to earn income. The applicant’s case is brought against the first respondent in its capacity as the supplier in Australia, at the relevant time, of the valve; against the second respondent as her cardiologist; and against the third respondent as her surgeon.  A. background 2                     The applicant was born on 23 March 1962. At the age of 13 she was diagnosed as having Barlow’s syndrome which involves a partial prolapse of the mitral valve of the heart. Her condition was monitored in the years following and from June 1983 by the second respondent. An echocardiogram examination conducted at the time confirmed mitral valve prolapse involving both leaflets of the valve.  3                     In the period 1989 to 1996 the second respondent continued to monitor the applicant’s condition and further examinations were conducted. The applicant also consulted neurologists about various other symptoms and in particular problems with her balance and vision. It is not necessary to detail them at this point. They will be further considered in connexion with her medical history. In this period the applicant was involved in two motor vehicle accidents, the first in March 1991 and the second in March 1993. On both occasions the applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck. In the second accident her back and thigh were injured. In 1994 and 1995 she received radio frequency blocks on the cervical spine and right sacroiliac joint which had the effect of minimising her pain for some time.  4                     In January and May 1996 the applicant and the second respondent discussed the prospect of surgery to the applicant’s mitral valve. The applicant was subsequently referred by the second respondent to the third respondent and she consulted him on 16 June 1996. On 20 June 1996 the applicant underwent surgery at the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Perth. Attempts to repair the mitral valve were unsuccessful and a mechanical mitral valve was implanted. The valve was one manufactured by St Jude Medical Inc (‘the St Jude Medical valve’). Its place of business is in Minnesota USA. It does not have a place of business in Australia. The first respondent was the importer and supplier of the valve in Australia at the relevant time.  5                     As explained by Prof Hirsh, a physician and haematologist, it is generally accepted that implanted mechanical mitral heart valves carry a risk of developing thrombi, or blood clots, upon the surface of the valve because of its foreign nature. A thrombus is formed from blood which undergoes physical changes wherein it is converted from a liquid to a solid state. Thrombi can produce complications by obstructing vessels where they occur or by breaking off from the site where they have formed and travelling to and obstructing small vessels distant from the original thrombus. The latter is referred to as an embolism. The process by which the embolism obstructs the vessel is called a thromboembolic event. The resultant sudden insufficiency of blood supply can cause tissue necrosis, or an infarction. The area of tissue damaged is called an infarct. When a thromboembolic event interrupts the blood supply to the brain, which occurs when an embolus travels to a cerebral artery, it can result in a stroke.  6                     In order to minimise the risk of thromboembolic complications patients with mechanical heart valves are treated with anticoagulant drugs. The applicant was treated with the anticoagulant Warfarin. It is necessary that such a person remain on anticoagulants for the rest of their life. Even with anticoagulant therapy patients are still at risk of thromboembolic events.  7                     To ensure the appropriate level of anticoagulant is maintained in a patient’s blood it is monitored by a blood test known as prothrombin time, from which an International Normalized Ratio (‘INR’) is calculated. The INR level reflects the effect of the anticoagulant. If the blood is not sufficiently anticoagulated this is indicated by a low INR level. In this circumstance the patient is at risk of thromboembolism. If the INR level is too high, and the blood therefore too thin, they are at an increased risk of bleeding.  8                     In patients with mechanical mitral valves it is generally recommended that their INR level be maintained at between 2.5 and 3.5. Persons not receiving anticoagulant therapy have an INR level of 1.00. It is not known why it is difficult to maintain the target INR level in some people.  9                     The applicant was discharged from hospital on 27 June 1996. She had difficulty maintaining her INR levels within therapeutic range and experienced some thromboembolic events. In October 1996 infarcts to the spleen and left kidney were discovered on radiological examination. In March 1997 she suffered a midbrain stroke.  10                  A conference of specialists reviewed the applicant’s case and recommended that the St Jude Medical valve be removed. On 26 June 1997 the third respondent did so and replaced it with a porcine tissue valve. Generally speaking tissue valves have a lower incidence of the development of thrombus on them than mechanical valves and a patient with such a valve may not require life-long anticoagulant therapy. A disadvantage of tissue valves is that they require replacement about every eight to fifteen years. In younger persons they may require replacement more often. For this reason they are not usually recommended by surgeons for implant in persons under 65 years of age.  11                  The St Jude Medical valve is a mechanical valve composed of four parts: an outer ring or orifice, a sewing ring and two leaflets which are hinged inside the outer ring. The outer ring and the leaflets are made from graphite which is covered with a layer of pyrolytic carbon. No issue arises as to the suitability of those materials. The orifice is the housing in which the left and right leaflets sit. The leaflets are semi-circular flaps which open and close to permit blood to flow through in a single direction. The sewing ring is made of fabric. It enables the valve to be sewn into the patient’s heart tissue.  12                  One of the surfaces of the leaflet is the ‘bevelled edge surface’ or outflow surface, characterised by the bevelled edge of the long straight side of the leaflet. The other semi-circular surface is known as the ‘knife edge’ or inflow surface. The long straight side of the leaflet is not bevelled on the knife edge surface. On each semi-circular flap there are two small modules known as ‘ears’ which protrude from each side of the flap near the long straight side of the leaflet. At the time of explant it was observed that the surface of the valve was covered with a thrombus in the nature of a white fibrinous tissue.  13                  The explanted valve was returned to St Jude Medical Inc by the hospital for testing and was received on 25 July 1997. Microscopic examinations were undertaken by the field experience report analyst who received it and later by St Jude Medical Inc’s consultant pathologist, Dr Titus. No abnormalities or defects were observed on the surface of the valve. In August 2001 the valve was subjected to further microscopic examination and analysis by a scanning electron microscope. The latter, but not the former, revealed the presence of a small chip on the left ear of the bevelled edge of the right leaflet.  14                  The applicant brought these proceedings against the respondents on 13 March 2001. It is not disputed that the applicant’s injuries, namely the infarcts to the spleen and left kidney and her stroke, and other thromboembolic events, were caused by thromboembolisms likely to have originated at the site of the St Jude Medical valve. The first respondent however denies that the chip found could have been responsible for the thrombus seen on explant and there is a further issue about when the chip came into existence. The cases against the second and third respondents relate to advices the applicant says that she should have received but did not - as to the problems associated with clotting on mechanical valves, that they required a lifetime of anticoagulant drugs, and as to the alternative of a tissue valve where the risk of clotting was less.  B. THE ISSUES 1. CONCERNING THE FIRST RESPONDENT 15                  Part VA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth)(‘the Act’) concerns liability for defective goods. Section 75AD provides a remedy where a person suffers injury as a result of defective goods supplied by a manufacturer:  ‘Liability for defective goods causing injuries—loss by injured individual    If:  (a) a corporation, in trade or commerce, supplies goods manufactured by it; and (b) they have a defect; and (c)  because of the defect, an individual suffers injuries; then: (d)  the corporation is liable to compensate the individual for the amount of the individual's loss suffered as a result of the injuries; and (e)  the individual may recover that amount by action against the corporation; …’ 16                  It is not in dispute that a consequence of s 74A of the Act is that the first respondent is deemed to be a manufacturer of the St Jude Medical valve. Section 74A(4) provides:  ‘If:  (a) goods are imported into Australia by a corporation that was not the manufacturer of the goods; and  (b) at the time of the importation the manufacturer of the goods does not have a place of business in Australia;   the corporation shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Division, to have manufactured the goods.’    Section 75AC gives the meaning of goods having a defect:    ‘(1)  For the purposes of this Part, goods have a defect if their safety is not such as persons generally are entitled to expect.    (2)  In determining the extent of the safety of goods, regard is to be given to all relevant circumstances including:  (a) the manner in which, and the purposes for which, they have been marketed; and  (b) their packaging; and  (c) the use of any mark in relation to them; and  (d) any instructions for, or warnings with respect to, doing, or refraining from doing, anything with or in relation to them; and  (e) what might reasonably be expected to be done with or in relation to them; and  (f) the time when they were supplied by their manufacturer.    (3)  An inference that goods have a defect is not to be made only because of the fact that, after they were supplied by their manufacturer, safer goods of the same kind were supplied.    (4)  An inference that goods have a defect is not to be made only because:  (a) there was compliance with a Commonwealth mandatory standard for them; and  (b) that standard was not the safest possible standard having regard to the latest state of scientific or technical knowledge when they were supplied by their manufacturer.’  17                  This aspect of the applicant’s case has two bases: in the information provided to her and in the existence of the chip, which is alleged to be a defect arising during manufacturing. The latter defect is alleged to have caused a thrombus to form on the valve whilst it was implanted. The warnings which are said to have been absent from the first respondent’s booklet, which is provided to patients, are that the risk of thromboembolism associated with the implant of the St Jude Medical valve exists despite a patient taking the anticoagulant drugs and that that risk was between 2 to 5 per cent per patient per anum. It is also alleged that the Patient Booklet published by St Jude Medical Inc contains an implied representation, by omission of the warning, that such a risk does not exist.  18                  At least so far as concerns the applicant’s case based on s 75AD of the Act, it is not alleged that warnings should have been provided by the first respondent to her at an earlier time so that it might have informed any choice she made regarding valves. Rather the applicant here focuses only upon what is contained in the booklet which she received after surgery. She alleges that had she been told of the risks at the time she received the booklet she would have urgently obtained advice and that advice may have avoided her subsequent injuries.  19                  The first respondent admits that there was and is a risk of thromboembolism associated with the implantation of all artificial heart valves and that that risk existed regardless of whether a patient had optimal anticoagulation therapy. This risk was well known and recognised within the medical profession. The first respondent denies that the applicant was optimally anticoagulated.  20                  The first respondent denies a lack of warning about the risk of thromboembolism. It alleges that the material it provides to cardiac surgeons contains advices as to the risk of thromboembolism as a potential side effect of its use. Further, the St Jude Medical Inc Patient Booklet entitled ‘Living with your new heart valve: an educational booklet for recipients of the mechanical valve’, published 1990, which was provided to the applicant contained a warning about the prospect of blood clots. The first respondent also relies upon the warnings which the second and third respondents say were given to the applicant. The first respondent denies that the Patient Booklet contains the alleged implied representation. And it denies that the lack of warning or information can constitute a ‘defect’ within the meaning of the Act. 21                  So far as concerns the chip discovered on one of the leaflet ears of the valve, the first respondent contends that the chip was not present when the valve was released from St Jude Medical Inc’s manufacturing facility; it was not present when the valve was returned after it had been explanted from the applicant; and it occurred during evaluation and testing of the valve after its return to St Jude Medical Inc. The first respondent relies upon s 75AK(1)(a) of the Act which provides:  ‘Defences    (1)  In a liability action, it is a defence if it is established that:  (a)  the defect in the action goods that is alleged to have caused the loss did not exist at the supply time; …’ 22                  So far as is relevant subs (2) provides that ‘supply time’ means the time when the goods were supplied by their actual manufacturer.  23                  The first respondent also pleads that the claim is statute-barred, having been brought more than three years after the applicant knew, or ought reasonably to have known, of the existence of the matters said to give rise to the alleged defect or of the existence of the chip. Section 75AO(1) of the Actprovides:  ‘Time for commencing actions   (1)  Subject to subsection (2), a person may commence a liability action at any time within 3 years after the time the person became aware, or ought reasonably to have become aware, of the alleged loss, the defect and the identity of the person who manufactured the action goods.’ 24                  Section 74B, in Part V of the Act, provides that a manufacturer may be liable to a consumer who suffers loss or damage by reason that goods are not reasonably fit for their purpose: ‘Actions in respect of unsuitable goods   (1) Where:  (a) a corporation, in trade or commerce, supplies goods manufactured by the corporation to another person who acquires the goods for re-supply;  (b) a person (whether or not the person who acquired the goods from the corporation) supplies the goods (otherwise than by way of sale by auction) to a consumer;  (c) the goods are acquired by the consumer for a particular purpose that was, expressly or by implication, made known to the corporation, either directly, or through the person from whom the consumer acquired the goods or a person by whom any antecedent negotiations in connexion with the acquisition of the goods were conducted;  (d) the goods are not reasonably fit for that purpose, whether or not that is a purpose for which such goods are commonly supplied; and  (e) the consumer or a person who acquires the goods from, or derives title to the goods through or under, the consumer suffers loss or damage by reason that the goods are not reasonably fit for that purpose;  the corporation is liable to compensate the consumer or that other person for the loss or damage and the consumer or that other person may recover the amount of the compensation by action against the corporation in a court of competent jurisdiction.    (2) Subsection (1) does not apply:  (a) if the goods are not reasonably fit for the purpose referred to in that subsection by reason of:  (i) an act or default of any person (not being the corporation or a servant or agent of the corporation); or  (ii) a cause independent of human control;  occurring after the goods have left the control of the corporation; or (b) where the circumstances show that the consumer did not rely, or that it was unreasonable for the consumer to rely, on the skill or judgment of the corporation.’    In s 74B a manufacturer also includes a deemed manufacturer by reason of s 74A(4).  25                  It is alleged that the conclusion about lack of fitness for purpose is reached because, notwithstanding that the applicant took the anticoagulant drugs as prescribed, clotting occurred on the surface of the St Jude Medical valve resulting in thromboembolisms. Alternatively the valve contained a chip on one of its leaflets which enabled a thrombus to form.  26                  The first respondent denies that the applicant has suffered loss and damage ‘by reason of’ the unfitness for purpose of the valve. It contends that if the applicant did suffer symptoms attributable to thromboembolism, it does not follow that the valve was not reasonably fit for its purpose within the meaning of s 74B or defective within the meaning of s 75AC. The first respondent contends that if they were symptoms of thrombosis attributable to the valve, they were recognised complications. That does not render the device unfit for its purpose. The first respondent also pleads the defence of limitation of action to this claim. Such an action is to be commenced when the consumer first became aware, or ought reasonably to have become aware, that the goods were not reasonably fit for their purpose. 27                  The applicant also claims against the first respondent for breach of its common law duty of care owed to her. That duty is said to arise because of the supply of the valve and is alleged to have been breached because the St Jude Medical valve was not fit for the purpose for which it was supplied and it had a defect which caused the thrombus which in turn caused thromboembolisms. Further the first respondent failed to warn the applicant and/or the second respondent and third respondent prior to implantation of the risks associated with the valve, including the risk of thromboembolism.  28                  The first respondent denies that a duty of care was owed to the applicant. In that respect it is contended that Parts V and VA of the Act operate as a statutory ‘pre-emption’ of the general law of negligence in relation to the supply, including the deemed supply, of defective goods. It is further contended that, in any event the applicant was advised of the risks by the second respondent and the third respondent.  2. CONCERNING THE SECOND RESPONDENT 29                  The applicant alleges that at the consultation with the second respondent on 20 May 1996 she indicated to him that she had felt weak and faint for some time and wished to have the mitral valve surgical repair without delay. She alleges that the second respondent said that the surgery was not required at that time and he would reassess her condition on a six monthly basis but that he agreed that she should undergo such surgery. Subsequent to the consultation she says that she spoke with the second respondent by telephone insisting that the surgery be performed as soon as possible and the second respondent then said that he would arrange it.  30                  The second respondent agrees that the later telephone call occurred and says that he advised the applicant that the plans for surgery were not being brought forward because of any medical urgency, but at her request. As to the consultation on 20 May 1996, he says that the applicant spoke of having frequent episodes of fainting and palpitations, that she expressed a wish to have the surgery without delay and that he discussed the timing of the surgery with her and her husband. The second respondent says that he advised the applicant that he considered surgery was a difficult decision to make when she had only moderate mitral valve regurgitation and that he was not convinced that her symptoms were due to mitral valve prolapse or mitral regurgitation, but since there was now a trend towards earlier repair he would consider surgery.  31                  The applicant alleges that the second respondent was under a duty to warn her of any material risks associated with the mitral valve repair procedure. The second respondent agrees and says that he discharged that duty by informing the applicant during the 20 May consultation of those and other risks, namely that:  (a) mitral valve surgery involved a risk of mortality and a risk of stroke of 5 per cent;  (b) the usual operation in this situation would be mitral valve repair but sometimes this was not possible and mitral valve replacement was sometimes necessary;  (c) if the applicant underwent mitral valve replacement anticoagulants would be necessary for life as a prophylactic against the possibility of a stroke; and  (d) mitral valve replacement entailed a risk of clot formation on the valve with a possibility of dislodgement of the clot with serious consequences.  32                  The applicant denies that she was so advised. She alleges that the second respondent breached his duty of care to her by failing to advise her that there was a risk that repair was not possible and a valve replacement would be required. The applicant alleges that the second respondent was obliged to advise her specifically of the risk of thromboembolism associated with the use of a St Jude Medical or other mechanical valve. The risk associated with the St Jude Medical valve is alleged to occur in between 2 to 5 per cent of patients every year, even where they are optimally anticoagulated. Further, he failed to advise her of the alternative of a tissue valve and that the risk of thromboembolism with such valves was significantly less.  33                  The applicant also alleges that she had told the second respondent, during consultations in 1994 and 1995, that she suffered from debilitating neck and back pain which was treated and controlled by surgical nerve block treatment. This treatment allowed her to live and work normally. The second respondent is alleged to have owed a duty to warn the applicant that if a mechanical, and not a tissue, valve was implanted the applicant would be required to take anticoagulant medication which would prevent her from having the nerve block treatment.  34                  The second respondent says that the only mention made by the applicant that she was having nerve block treatment was on 25 July 1995. He denies that he was under a duty to warn that anticoagulants necessitated by a prosthetic mitral valve would make nerve block treatment impossible. And he denies that he was under a duty to warn of the risk of thromboembolism if a mechanical valve were used or to advise that a tissue valve was an alternative and the risk of thromboembolism lesser. He also alleges in his defence that tissue valves would not have been an appropriate procedure for someone of the applicant’s age.  An allegation that the second respondent should have recommended surgery earlier than 1996 is not now pursued.  3. CONCERNING THE THIRD RESPONDENT 35                  At the consultation with the third respondent on 14 June 1996 the applicant says that the only advices the third respondent gave her after listening to her heart were:  (i) that he agreed she should undergo surgical repair of her mitral valve as soon as reasonably possible;  (ii) that there was a small chance that when surgery was commenced it may become evident that her mitral valve had deteriorated to such an extent that he would not be able to repair it;  (iii) that in such circumstances the third respondent would have to replace the mitral valve with a mechanical valve and that such a valve would never need to be replaced and would outlive the applicant;  (iv) that if this was necessary he would use a St Jude Medical valve;  (v) that if a mechanical valve was inserted the applicant would require medication for life which would preclude her from having any further pregnancies.  36                  She says that she enquired about the risks associated with such a procedure and the third respondent advised that she had about a 1 per cent chance of dying during it. The applicant does not allege that she advised the third respondent about her nerve block treatment, but she contends that he was obliged to make enquiries of her so that he would be properly informed about it.  37                  The applicant alleges that the following warnings or advices were necessary but were not provided by the third respondent: (a) of the material risks inherent in the valve repair and the replacement procedures;  (b) of the risk of a thromboembolism if a St Jude Medical or other mechanical valve was used to replace her valve;  (c) of the alternative of a tissue valve to the use of a mechanical valve and that the risk of a thromboembolism was significantly less with a tissue valve;  (d) that if a mechanical and not a tissue valve was implanted the applicant would be required to take anticoagulant medication which would prevent her having nerve block treatment.  38                  The third respondent admits that he was obliged to advise the applicant of the matters in (a), (b) and (c) but says that he did so. The third respondent also says that at the June 1996 consultation he advised the applicant:  (a) that there was a 20 per cent chance that he would be unable to repair her valve; (b) that if it were necessary to replace it the applicant could choose between a mechanical or a tissue valve;  (c) that the advantages of the tissue valve were that it produced no sound which she would be able to hear and it had less of a tendency to produce blood clots and emboli than a mechanical valve, although it was the third respondent’s practice to prescribe anticoagulant therapy even where a tissue valve was implanted;  (d) that the disadvantages of a tissue valve were that it would have to be replaced every 6 to 14 years and there was an increasing risk of death with each operation to replace the tissue valve;  (e) that the advantage of a mechanical valve was that, so far as was known, it did not undergo gradual deterioration like a tissue valve and therefore would not require replacement unless a problem arose such as an infection or thrombosis, and these were always possibilities;  (f) that the disadvantages of a mechanical valve were that it created more noise and there was a greater risk that it would cause blood clots and to lower this risk as much as possible it would be necessary for the applicant to take anticoagulants. This would mean that she should not become pregnant, should avoid vigorous or heavy contact sports, should advise doctors that she was on anticoagulants prior to undergoing any surgical or dental procedure and she would require antibiotic cover during those procedures. Any tendency to bleeding would contra-indicate a mechanical valve.  39                  The third respondent says that the applicant chose to have a mechanical valve in the event that replacement became necessary.  40                  An allegation that the third respondent breached his duty of care by chipping the mechanical valve during surgery is not now pursued.  41                  In each of the cases against the second and third respondents the applicant says that, had she been made aware prior to surgery that a mechanical valve would require lifelong anticoagulant medication, she would have elected to have a tissue valve in the event that replacement was necessary.  4. THE CLAIMS RELATING TO LOSS AND DAMAGE 42                  The applicant alleges that she suffered the following injuries:  (a) splinter haemorrhages;  (b) kidney and spleen infarcts; (c) stroke; (d) occluded left vertebral artery and partially occluded right vertebral artery; (e) loss of life expectancy; (f) scarring to the heart associated with the surgery;  (g) permanent visual injury, including blurred and double vision and blotching of vision and areas of loss or partial loss of vision; and  (h) pericarditis. 43                  There would not appear to be any doubt about (b) and (c).  44                  As particulars of her pain, suffering and disability the applicant alleges that she suffers: ‘i) Symptoms associated with the various medical complications the Applicant suffered prior to removal of the Applicant’s St Jude Mitral Valve …;  ii) symptoms associated with the surgery to remove the Applicant’s St Jude Mitral Valve;  iii) profound lethargy;  iv) scarring to the heartin the region of the Applicant’s St Jude Mitral Valve removal procedure;  v) loss of reproductive organs through hysterectomy procedure;  vi) anxiety and depression due to symptoms and effects of surgery;  vii) increased symptoms due to an inability to receive nerve blocks for an unrelated condition, due to medication now prescribed for the Applicant by reason of her symptoms, injuries and surgery referred to above;  viii) the Applicant has suffered and continues to suffer profound loss of enjoyment of life due to reduced social, recreational and other activities and loss of enjoyment due to her symptoms and disability resulting from the injuries she suffered because of the implantation of the Applicant’s St Jude Mitral Valve;  ix) risk of future operative death;  x) loss of expectation of life;  xi) limits on working capacity;  xii) Arrhythmia with either a rapid or slow heart beat or erratic patterns different from her pre-1996 conditions;  xiii) Risks of infection and the need to take antibiotics;  xiv) Limits on driving due to visual problems pleaded herein, and  xv) Sleep problems particularly associated with variations of heart beat.’ 45                  The applicant says that she suffered from only the following symptoms prior to her heart surgery:  (a) intermittent pain in the neck and back;  (b) reduced levels of fitness;  (c) mild fatigue;  (d) intermittent vision disturbance involving ‘squiggly lines’ or spots of bright colour;  (e) intermittent palpitations;  (f) intermittent faintness occurring every few months and with increasing frequency.  46                  Apart from those in (a) and perhaps (d) I infer that the applicant’s contention is that the other symptoms are attributable to her heart condition and should have been remedied by the first surgical procedure.  47                  The applicant says that she now has the following symptoms and that she did not have them before:  (a) sustained fatigue;  (b) vision loss;  (c) double vision;  (d) slow heartbeat or an erratic pattern of heartbeat;  (e) generalised weakness;   and the following continue, but more frequently:    (f) faintness;  (g) neck and back pain. 48                  The applicant says that she is now unable to work more than ten hours per week because of her fatigue. She is unable to undertake any activity for more than a few hours. She tires easily and this increases her neck and back pain and she gets headaches, vision disturbances and palpitations. Her neck and back pain, which she is unable to treat with nerve blocks, also contribute to her inability to work as does the medication she takes for them. The symptoms of headaches, visual disturbances, palpitations, weakness, feeling faint, anxiety and erratic heartbeat also contribute. The applicant claims damages for pain and suffering and loss of the enjoyment of life and of her expectation of life.  49                  The applicant’s claim for economic loss is now based upon her loss of the opportunity to earn income as an Investment Development Manager with Westpoint Pty Ltd or Westpoint Corporation (the company was referred to by various names in the course of the proceedings. I shall refer to it as ‘Westpoint’). The company was one controlled by the applicant’s brother. The claim for the net past value of the opportunity is $1,466,000.00 based upon the remuneration for such a position being $500,000.00 per year gross, before tax. After contingencies the value of the future loss of opportunity is said to be between $4,087,747.60 and $4,289,517.70. The only other claim is an unquantified claim for the cost of domestic care.  C. the evidence 1. THE APPLICANT’S MEDICAL AND WORKING HISTORY prior to the implant (a) Medical History 50                  In 1986 the applicant saw Dr Gubbay, a neurologist. He noted at that time that she complained of a loss of balance, of a feeling of falling to the left, of what was a classic migraine with a blind spot and headaches at the back of her head and nausea. Doctor Gubbay later noted that the applicant had suffered from classic migraines, with loss of vision, on at least four occasions in the past five years. When the applicant reported that she was also suffering some loss of the co-ordination of her muscles in January 1987 Dr Gubbay considered the possibility that she was suffering from multiple sclerosis, which he discussed with her. At another point Dr Gubbay considered the possibility that the applicant was having thrombolic events and discussed with her how bits of thrombus can dislodge and enter the bloodstream. This was discounted after advices from the second respondent. On 6 April 1987 Dr Gubbay noted that she had neurological disturbances, diplopia and numbness in the left leg and right arm. Diplopia is referred to at other points in the evidence as double vision. The applicant also complained of fatigue at this point. The applicant sought to explain in her evidence that references by her to ‘double vision’ at this point, with hindsight, were really to blurred vision. The applicant says that it was not until after her stroke that she noticed the difference. Doctor Kermode, the applicant’s current neurologist says that people often refer to ‘double vision’ when they mean blurred vision.  51                  In August 1987 the applicant again saw Dr Gubbay and reported that she had difficulty judging distances, prolonged headaches, problems with vision, facial numbness and nausea. In December 1987 her knees were giving way and she had a tendency to drop (‘drop attacks’). She had an impairment to the vision in her right eye and problems with her balance. These attacks, loss of balance, double vision and grey spots in her sight continued into late 1988.  52                  Doctor Gubbay reported to her general practitioner in April 1989 that an eye specialist to whom the applicant had been referred could find nothing and he referred to the possibility of her suffering migraines. She continued to suffer migraines through to late 1998 and was at this time under a deal of stress because of problems with her first marriage. In December 1988 Dr Gubbay noted that she was still having drop attacks, occasional episodes of diplopia and grey spots.  53                  In May 1990 the applicant was feeling weak and continued to have a tendency to fall to one side. Doctor Gubbay spoke to her about her condition having a functional element, which is to say that she believed she would fall and therefore she did. After her motor vehicle accident in 1991 she saw Dr Gubbay and complained of occasional dizziness, impairment of balance, blurred vision and feeling weak. In April 1991 she collapsed. Doctor Gubbay thought that her symptoms at this time might be related to anxiety and stress and he considered the possibility of conversion hysteria. Sometime afterwards the applicant stopped seeing Dr Gubbay. She said that she found him difficult to deal with.  54                  The applicant had already seen another neurologist, Dr Carroll, in January 1991. The history she gave to him included references to intermittent transient disequilibrium and visual disturbances. She described intermittent diplopia to her doctor, he records, occurring usually when driving and she complained of blank spots in her vision. She said to him that she first experienced episodes of disequilibrium at the age of 18. In 1993, when seeing Dr Carroll again, the applicant reported that there had been no increase in her symptoms in the last two years. The motor vehicle accident in 1993 had exacerbated them slightly. She was suffering from severe headaches and loss of balance when fatigued. By April 1993 Dr Carroll considered the source of the applicant’s visual symptoms to stem from the effects of migraines and to some extent introspection on her part over her physical and neurological state. He reported to her solicitor in August 1993 that she was having headaches every two to three days and finding it difficult to study. She related the headaches to her neck injury. In 1995 the applicant saw a third neurologist, Dr Bajada, who likewise advised her general practitioner that her problems with vision and balance were likely to have been brought about by migraine.  55                  The applicant also presented to the second respondent with symptoms of palpitations, faintness and fatigue at various points from 1983 to 1996 when the second respondent periodically reviewed and monitored her cardiac condition. When the applicant consulted the second respondent in 1986 she complained of having palpitations associated with anxiety. In May 1991 the applicant undertook an exercise test in which she was found to perform at a level better than for her age.  56                  On 10 May 1994 the second respondent wrote to the solicitors acting for her in the action arising out of the first motor vehicle accident and recorded that the deterioration in her state of health, such as frequent palpitations, was not related to her heart condition but to psychological factors, anxiety and stress and the deterioration of her physical fitness. The exercise tests undertaken by the applicant periodically did not suggest a deterioration in her cardiac condition. In early 1995 the applicant reported to the second respondent that she was feeling worse, but he again did not relate her symptoms, which included occasional palpitations, to her cardiac condition. The applicant attributed what she perceived as an increase of her symptoms in 1995 to her heart condition. In her evidence she sought to explain that she thought that they were brought about by her lower level of fitness. There seems little doubt however, from the second respondent’s evidence in particular, that she was convinced her heart condition was responsible for the symptoms and this is why she was keen to have surgery.  57                  Towards 1996 the applicant believed her symptoms were worsening. The second respondent did not however detect any deterioration in the condition of her mitral valve and it was the second respondent’s opinion that most, if not all, of these symptoms were not attributable to her cardiac condition.  58                  The applicant said in evidence that she felt that she was about 75 per cent recovered from the symptoms of the first accident by the time the second accident occurred in 1993. At the end of 1993 it was however recorded in a medico-legal report that she was unable to sit for more than twenty minutes at a time because of the pain in her back and this had worried her since 1991. She was continuing to have pain in her neck and back.  59                  In about October 1994 the applicant received a radio frequency block from Dr Finch in the region of her neck injury. She mentioned to the second respondent in September 1994 that she would be having such treatment. She received a further block in June 1995 and in October 1995 to the right sacroiliac joint. She has not had any since. Doctor Finch reported to her solicitors in February 1996 that the applicant might, in his view, experience some long term problems in her cervical spine and her lower back. He was of the view that it was causing her some psychological problems as well. The applicant said in her evidence that Dr Finch referred her to a psychologist for counselling.  (b) Work History 60                  Following her secondary schooling the applicant worked part time as a model. She says that she intended nevertheless to take up a career in business at some point in the future. Commencing in about 1982 and for about 14 months the applicant worked for her brother’s company, Westpoint, as a marketing manager for its City Markets for a period. The centre had approximately 27 retail outlets and a food hall. She also maintained her own investments and in 1989 she completed a securities course which she had undertaken so as to better understand investments. In 1990 she was employed part time by Stockbridge Ltd to assist in their takeover bid of another company. Her tasks were not complex and consisted of contacting shareholders who had not lodged voting forms. As a result of this experience she subsequently engaged in buying small shareholdings in companies undergoing capital reconstruction, until a regulatory authority contacted her. She thereafter desisted from that practice.  61                  In 1989 the applicant commenced university studies towards a degree in commerce, with a double major in finance and marketing. At the same time she obtained qualifications to sell real estate. The applicant completed two years towards the degree. Her studies were interrupted by the effects of the first motor vehicle accident and she did not return to them. She and her brother say that there was an arrangement with Westpoint that it would fund her university studies on the understanding that she would take up a position with the company at the conclusion of them. This accords with claims made in the litigation concerning the two motor vehicle accidents, where it is said that she would have earned $40,000.00 per annum as a marketing consultant, a position which would have also offered her the prospect of promotion. This differs markedly from the amounts now claimed. The applicant said in evidence that the figure of $40,000.00 was only a base salary.  62                  In 1994 the applicant enrolled in a diploma of fine arts course at the Claremont Art School. The studies comprised 20 contact hours per week and she completed them in four years. She had some success in selling some of her art works, although I do not understand it to be suggested that substantial sums were involved.  63                  The applicant worked full time as a bookkeeper for her husband’s accountancy practice in May and June 1995. This appears to be the only time that she did work full time in the period prior to the first valve implantation. By 1996 she was only working ten to twelve hours per week. In the five years prior to the implantation of the St Jude Medical valve her highest income, including some social security payments, earned in the financial year ended 30 June 1996 was $15,662.00.  2. THE SECOND AND THIRD RESPONDENTS’ advices 64                  The second respondent has practised as a cardiologist since 1972, currently practises at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital and is a Clinical Professor of Medicine and Population Health. The third respondent practised as a cardiac surgeon for twenty-four years, until his retirement in 2000.  65                  The accounts given by the applicant and her husband as to what was discussed by the second respondent at the consultation on 20 May 1996 differ from that of the second respondent. It is not disputed that the applicant was very keen to undertake the surgery and that the second respondent recommended she wait a further period.  66                  The first discussion about mitral valve repair surgery between the applicant and the second respondent had taken place in January 1996. The applicant and her husband do not appear to have a good recollection of this consultation. At this point the second respondent said that such surgery might be necessary in the future. Her mitral regurgitation had remained moderate. The second respondent did not consider surgery to be warranted. The second respondent says that he stressed that open heart surgery was a major undertaking and that it was often possible to preserve a mitral valve for many years before undertaking what was a risky procedure. Nevertheless she wanted the second respondent to consider the prospect of surgery at this juncture.  67                  The applicant says that at the outset of the consultation on 20 May 1996 she told the second respondent that she wanted to have surgery as soon as possible because she was feeling unwell; she felt that if her health deteriorated further should would have difficulty recovering from the operation; she needed surgery to her left knee and her orthopaedic surgeon had said to wait until after her heart surgery; and her poor health was making it difficult to care for her children who were getting older and were interested in physical pursuits and she wanted to join in them.  68                  The applicant also said in her statement of evidence that she explained to the second respondent that nerve blocks had resolved her neck and back pain to a significant degree and she was looking forward to getting on with her life. She and her husband felt that if she had to have surgery at some time in the future it would be best to have it as soon as possible. The second respondent denies that there was any discussion about her nerve block treatment. The only time he had heard of it was in 1994. He agrees that he did not ask her questions which might have revealed that she intended to have further such treatment.  69                  The applicant’s evidence is that she left the second respondent’s rooms that day on the basis of his recommendation that a review be had in 6 months and she was to have further holter monitoring, by a device which she was to wear. She returned the monitor after the requisite period. A few days later the second respondent telephoned her and said the results did not indicate any significant cardiac arrhythmia. She advised the second respondent that she and her husband had discussed the matter and wanted her to have surgery immediately. The second respondent agreed to arrange it and call her back. On this version of events there was no discussion of the details of the surgery, of the prospect of replacement rather than repair and what that involved. The applicant says the consultation was short. Her husband’s evidence about what was not advised accords with that of the applicant.  70                  The second respondent’s evidence is quite different. It is to some extent based upon his practice with patients considering surgery. In other respects he said that he had a specific recollection of the meeting.  71                  The second respondent says that the applicant reported to him that she was having frequent episodes of fainting and palpitations and that she could feel her heart beating hard, fast and irregularly. She said that she wished to undergo mitral valve surgery without delay. His initial advice was that they should investigate the cause of her tachycardia, or racing of the heart. She was convinced that many of her symptoms, particularly the fainting and palpitations, were directly related to her mitral valve disease. Given her complex medical history and the stress that had been caused to the applicant after the motor vehicle accidents the second respondent was not convinced that her symptoms were attributable to a worsening of her mitral valve regurgitation. He explained to her that her palpitations and fainting were not necessarily related to the mitral regurgitation. He said that he considered it to be unlikely that surgery would result in an improvement of her symptoms.  72                  The second respondent says that he then turned to the timing of the surgery and the ‘pros and cons’ of proceeding with surgery at that time. He emphasised that it was not necessary to undergo surgery where the mitral regurgitation was only moderate, but that her condition would progress and it was feasible to consider surgery. Because the applicant was keen to proceed the second respondent says that he took particular care to emphasise to her that this was a relatively hazardous undertaking which should not be undertaken lightly. He explained that surgery would cause considerable pain and discomfort and also carried a 4 to 5 per cent risk of mortality and other complications including stroke. He explained that there had been an international trend in recent years towards earlier surgery.  73                  The second respondent says that he told the applicant and her husband that, with modern techniques of cardiac surgery, he was hopeful that a mitral valve repair could be achieved. Sometimes however this was not possible and there was a small chance that the procedure might not be successful. He explained to her that mitral valve repair had come to prominence because it was superior to the alternatives of mitral valve replacement with a prosthetic valve, which carried a higher risk and required lifetime treatment with drugs to avoid clot formation on the valve and mitral valve replacement with a tissue prosthesis. In his evidence at the hearing the second respondent corrected this statement and said that he did not refer to the need for a lifetime of drugs at that point in the consultation. It was at a later point that he said that mechanical valves required drugs to be taken for life to prevent clots. He says that he did not discuss the percentage risks of blood clot formation with her as he had not discussed her care with a cardiac surgeon and did not know what type of valve might be chosen if repair surgery was unsuccessful. In his statement he said that he went on to advise the applicant that a tissue prosthesis would not be considered for young patients but at the hearing corrected this aspect of his evidence. He said that he did not in fact make such a statement.  74                  The second respondent says that he went through the details of the mitral valve repair that the surgeon would attempt and used a model of a heart to do so. He also used a diagram drawn by him to explain how the surgeon would attempt to modify the valve in order to abolish the mitral regurgitation. The applicant denies this occurred. 75                  The second respondent said he would discuss timing with the cardiothoracic surgeon, Mr Nicholls (the third respondent). He later accepted that he may not have named him but referred to him as an experienced cardiac surgeon. He said that he emphasised to her the need to discuss the details of the surgery with the surgeon. It was his usual practice to recommend that she and her husband take all of their outstanding questions to the surgeon.  76                  As was his practice, the second respondent wrote to the applicant’s general practitioner that day. He says that he always did so and dictated the letter in the presence of the patient unless it was necessary to defer the report whilst tests were undertaken. He says that he preferred patients to listen to his concluding remarks. He dictated from his notes.  77                  The second respondent’s note of the consultation recorded the applicant as looking well and that he had discussed the ‘pros and cons’. The latter was said by him to refer to surgery. By the first mentioned observation he meant only that she was not looking acutely unwell. His letter dated 20 May 1996 to the applicant’s general practitioner, Dr Veling, contained the observation that she looked a little pale and run-down and that she had been under a lot of stress recently. The second respondent noted that the applicant wanted to know when surgery would be possible. The second respondent advised Dr Veling that he had arranged a holter monitor to check for arrhythmia, which might explain her fainting spells (‘syncope’). Another test might also be necessary – a ‘tilt table’ test. The letter to Dr Veling went on:  ‘I have emphasised to her that the syncope may well be unrelated to the mitral valve prolapse and she should not rely entirely on the prospect of mitral valve surgery to solve all her problems.’    78                  The applicant says that although the second respondent promised to arrange surgery when they discussed the holter monitor results a few days after the consultation of 20 May, she did not hear from him for a week or so. She then telephoned him and left a message at his rooms. When he called back he advised the name of the surgeon and the date of surgery.  79                  The letter of referral to the third respondent is dated 13 June 1996. In it the second respondent said that the applicant is now ready and very keen for surgery. He went on:  ‘I hope she is able to have mitral valve repair, but I have warned her of the possibility of mitral valve replacement and the need for long term anticoagulatation [sic] therapy.’ 80                  The applicant saw the third respondent on 14 June 1996. The applicant says that the third respondent told her that he had spoken to the second respondent, that her notes had not arrived, but that that did not matter. The third respondent listened to her heart. After that examination and as she was dressing he returned to his desk. He said there was a slight chance that when he went to repair the valve it would be beyond repair and he would replace it with a valve that would never need replacement and which would outlast her. She remembers this in particular because she wondered if the sound of her heart had led him to say that or whether he said it to all of his patients. The applicant and her husband say that they did not know, up to this point, that a prosthetic mitral valve was the alternative to repair of the applicant’s mitral valve. The applicant believed, and had told her husband, that she might need a complete heart transplant at some point. It is not apparent how she came to this belief. The second respondent did not give any such advice. They say that they expressed no surprise when they were informed about the possibility of a prosthetic valve and discussed afterwards that they were fortunate to have waited for surgery, believing the valve to be a new development.  81                  The applicant says that she asked what the risks of surgery were and the third respondent said the statistics did not apply to her as most patients were elderly and had other complicating health problems. She pressed him for a risk rate and he said because she was young, fit and otherwise healthy that the risk of not surviving the surgery was around 1 per cent. He did not refer to any risks other than those relating to the surgery itself. The third respondent told her that if the valve was replaced she would be on medication for the rest of her life and she would not be able to have any more children. He asked if this was a problem and she and her husband said it was not. The applicant says they had no time to discuss it and thought the choices were either children or death.  82                  The applicant says they were not made aware that there were tissue valves which did not exclude pregnancy. The applicant says the third respondent did not state what the medication was or what it was for. They assumed it was to stop her body rejecting the valve. Her husband had asked the third respondent what the chances were of her body rejecting the valve and he said there was no chance, as the valve did not have a blood supply. The third respondent explained pre-admission procedures, how long she would be in hospital and when it might be appropriate for her children to visit her. The third respondent discussed the nature of the incision and other details of the surgery. Again the applicant’s evidence about what was not said is supported by the evidence of her husband. His evidence with respect to the second respondent and the third respondent was characterised by little recollection of what was actually said but an apparently clear recollection of what was not.  83                  The third respondent says that the second respondent had told him that the echocardiogram of January 1996 showed a prolapse of both the anterior and posterior leaflets of the mitral valve. He says that he knew that that would be likely to make the repair of the valve more difficult and increased the chances of a prosthetic valve being necessary.  84                  The third respondent agreed that the applicant gave the impression that she believed that her mitral valve would be repaired. It was in part because of this that he told her that there was a 20 per cent chance that it would need to be replaced. He considered that, although that figure was high, it was appropriate because both leaflets were prolapsing. He recalled listening to her heart and commenting that some of her symptoms would not be relieved by surgery. He was thinking of the palpitations in particular. In cross-examination he says he did not only comment in passing about the prospect that he might be unable to repair her mitral valve, but made much of it. It is always important, he explained, that a patient knows that in this type of operation a surgeon may fail. He always made this plain to patients. He would not have said that there was only a slight chance of failure. He would not have done so because she had prolapse of both leaflets. In such circumstances no surgeon would have said so.  85                  The third respondent says that he discussed the operation at length with her, including the extent of the incision and the use of the heart-lung machine. He informed her that he would first attempt to repair the valve and if the repair did not stop the valve leaking then he would proceed to replace the valve with an artificial valve.  86                  The third respondent says that he discussed both tissue and mechanical valves with the applicant. He showed her and her husband a tissue valve, a Star Edwards valve and a St Jude Medical valve which he kept in his rooms. He said that the tissue valve had the advantage of being quiet and post-operatively it was less necessary for the patient to take anticoagulant blood-thinning tablets, although it was necessary during the first 6 to 12 weeks and it was his practice to usually carry on the anticoagulants, provided the patient was having no problem with them. He said that it would be necessary to replace a tissue valve every 6 to 14 years and there was an increasing risk of death with each operation to replace a tissue valve.  87                  The third respondent says that he advised that the mechanical valve made a clicking noise which was annoying at first but that he only had one patient who continued to complain of it. He said it was a long-lasting valve, or words to the effect that the valve would outlast her. He said that provided there was no complication such as a thrombus, or infection or a structural defect, it should last a lifetime and not need replacing.  88                  The third respondent recalls the applicant, or her husband, asking questions about ‘rejection’ and that he advised that it was not an issue. He also recalls the word ‘transplant’ being used in conversation at some earlier point. He particularly recalls these references because the words are unusual in the context of mitral valve surgery. He did say that with tissue valves changes might occur which could be regarded as rejection.  89                  The third respondent says that he explained that the disadvantage of the mechanical valve was that it was more likely to form clots and that in order to minimise this risk the applicant would have to take anticoagulants, that is blood-thinning drugs, for the rest of her life. In cross-examination he denied that he used the word ‘medication’ in connexion with anticoagulants and says he most likely ran ‘anticoagulant’ together with ‘blood-thinning drugs’. He said that he advised the applicant that the anticoagulants would be monitored with daily blood tests while she was in hospital, twice daily for two to three weeks after returning home and then at weekly intervals extending to a monthly test. The third respondent says that he advised her, as he did with all patients, that this would make her more likely to bleed with minor cuts and to bruise more easily. She would, for the most part, have to confine herself to a lifestyle which avoided hard contact activity or sport. Prior to any surgery she would have to inform the surgeon she was on anticoagulants and that she had an artificial valve.  90                  The third respondent says that he advised that anticoagulants were a great problem during pregnancy and that because of this if a person wanted to become pregnant then a mechanical valve was contra-indicated. However if this was not the case, and the applicant and her husband assured him that it was not, then he would advise her to have a mechanical valve implanted. Although this was his recommendation, he told her that it was her choice provided she understood the pros and cons and his recommendation. The applicant told him that if it were necessary to have a valve she would have a mechanical valve.  91                  The third respondent cannot recall if the applicant asked for an assessment of the risks of surgery but they did discuss it and he advised her that the risk of death from the operation was approximately 1 per cent and there was a long list of possible complications, including heart attacks, strokes, clots and infections on the lungs and many others. However the two things he considered to be specific to the operation, clots forming on the valve and infection, had been discussed earlier in the consultation.  92                  The third respondent told the applicant that the operation would last two to five hours and that she would be returned to the Intensive Care Unit afterwards where she would be closely monitored. He explained to her in some detail how she would feel and what would take place shortly afterwards. He discussed the appropriateness of her children visiting her whilst she was in the Intensive Care Unit. He discussed the length of her hospitalisation, her convalescence, the length of time for which she would need household help and that during convalescence her anticoagulant or blood-thinning regime would be stabilised. The entire consultation he says lasted one hour.  93                  The applicant did not discuss her nerve block treatment with the third respondent, he says. He said in evidence that, generally speaking, he would have expected the second respondent to advise him of any relevant continuing treatment.  94                  Prior to her surgery the applicant signed a consent form following admission to the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital which referred to ‘operation/procedure of mitral valve replacement’.  3. medical evidence as to MECHANICAL and tissue valves 95                  The expert medical witnesses were agreed that the development of a thromboembolism in a patient with a mechanical mitral valve such as the St Jude Medical valve and on anticoagulant drugs was uncommon but well known amongst cardiologists and cardiac surgeons in 1996. It was not possible to predict how a patient would react to the implant of a valve. Professor Hirsh said there had been research in recent years to determine whether some people have a genetic predisposition to the development of thrombi but it had not been established. Mr Newman is a consultant cardiothoracic surgeon at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital who was at the conference which discussed the applicant’s case and he was present when the St Jude Medical valve was explanted. His advices to the applicant when he first saw her in hospital implied that she might have some constitutional predisposition. It would seem that there is a possibility that the applicant suffers from a genetic clotting disorder. It can be put no higher. Doctor Baker, a clinical haematologist, considered that it was plausible that a particular gene mutation could increase the applicant’s risk to thrombosis but the clinical significance of the particular mutation is currently uncertain. Professor Hughes is Head of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Unit Office at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. He said that there are a number of factors which affect the way anticoagulants are metabolised by a person. The St Jude Medical valve was not said by any of the witnesses to have any higher rate of risk of creating thromboembolic events than other valves and Prof Hughes considered that its risk was somewhat lower than its competitors. The witnesses identified different rates of risk of thromboembolism but it is low and of the order of 2 to 3 per cent with anticoagulants, according to Prof Buxton. Professor Buxton is the Director of Cardiac Surgery at Austin Hospital, University of Melbourne and at Epworth Hospital. Professor Hughes considered the rate of complications to be 2 to 5 per cent per annum if a patient is taking anticoagulant drugs. If they are optimally anticoagulated the rate is 0.5 to 2 per cent. The rate of 2 to 5 per cent was contained in a letter written by Prof Hughes in February 1998 which was provided to the applicant some time in March 1998. The applicant says that this was the first time she had ever heard of the risk.  96                  The experts were also agreed that tissue valves had a lesser risk of the development of thromboembolism. Professor Hughes said that they were not immune from complications but they were rare. The evidence of the second respondent, Professors Feneley, Buxton and Hughes and Dr Bernstein is to the effect that medical studies have not established that the risk of thromboembolic events in the case of a tissue valve with no anticoagulant therapy is significantly less than the risk associated with a mechanical valve where anticoagulants are taken. Professor Feneley is the Director of Cardiology at St Vincent’s Hospital and Dr Bernstein is Staff Cardiologist at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.  97                  The second respondent gave evidence that he would always prescribe a lifelong anticoagulant regime even with a tissue valve. The opinion held by the majority of expert witnesses was that this may not be necessary. Professor Hughes said that in his experience anticoagulant drugs are rarely required. Some views were expressed that had the applicant first received a tissue valve she would nevertheless have been prescribed lifelong anticoagulants. It is not possible however to discern from the evidence whether some of these views were reached with hindsight and with knowledge of the applicant’s problems with thromboembolic events. 98                  Tissue valves are sometimes recommended where a young patient desires to have children, or to pursue a very active lifestyle or where there is some problem with their taking anticoagulants. A tissue valve may require replacement every eight to ten years or ten to fifteen years, whereas mechanical valves had lasted 20, 30 and sometimes 40 years. Failures of mechanical valves are extremely rare, Prof Hughes said. Tissue valves break down more quickly in younger patients. The risk of death in a re-operation increases. Professor Hughes said that the risk on a re-operation was twice that of the original operation and the more re-operations that are had, the greater the risk. For these reasons no witness suggested that a tissue valve was appropriate for a younger patient, which is to say someone younger that 65 years of age. He would not, in discussions with a young patient, even refer to a tissue valve as an option. In his view a cardiologist would never recommend it. If asked about it by the patient he would explain why he would not recommend it and would refer further questions to the surgeon.  99                  The doctors, apart from Dr Finch, were agreed that a regime of anticoagulants is not a contra-indication to surgery. And it was also said by Prof Hughes that the drugs should not prevent a patient pursuing a reasonably active lifestyle so long as they took some care to avoid injury. He would not recommend a tissue valve simply because a person wished to have an active lifestyle.  100               Doctors Finch and Gee are consultants in pain management and specialist anaesthetists. Doctor Gee was of the view that a condition such as the applicant’s can be managed whilst undertaking nerve block treatment without significant risk of bleeding or clotting. Professor Feneley also said that surgery is frequently performed on patients taking anticoagulants. Warfarin is replaced with intravenous Heparin therapy and the Heparin is then stopped over the time of surgery. I understand this to have been undertaken when the applicant had her second heart operation and when she had her hysterectomy. Doctor Finch however said that he would not perform a nerve block on a patient with the applicant’s history of clotting. The procedure involves the use of needles. Even with the replacement of Warfarin he would not consider injections around the spine in a patient who did not have normal coagulation. He had heard of one such patient suffering from the potentially serious complication of an epidural haematoma.  4. INFORMATION PROVIDED BY St Jude Medical INC TO DOCTORS 101               The St Jude Medical Mechanical Heart Valve Physician’s Manual, published 1995, is provided with a St Jude Medical valve when packed. It is largely concerned with technical information and techniques of implanting the valve. With respect to post-operative considerations it says that it recommends patients be maintained on anticoagulants. The potential side effects and complications with heart valves listed include thrombus or thromboembolisms.  102               More relevant in the present case is the Physician’s Reference Manual which is made available to cardiac surgeons around the world. There is evidence that the third respondent was supplied with a copy of it, and I take that to have occurred at a time prior to his seeing the applicant. Apart from technical information the manual contains a number of articles and some of them deal, in some detail, with valve-related complications including valve thrombosis and discuss rates of occurrence. One study put the rate of valve-related complications at 2.1 per cent per patient year.  5. THE EXAMINATION AND TESTING OF the VALVE (a) At Assembly 103               St Jude Medical Inc maintains a history of each mechanical mitral valve from assembly to the patient and has protocols for subsequent examinations of valves which have been the subject of complaint or adverse experience. The applicant’s valve, serial number 60242545, model number 31MEC-102 was fabricated, tested, sterilised and packed in Puerto Rico according to the Device History Record as explained by Mr Monaghan, who was then a Quality Control Inspector employed by St Jude Medical Inc.  104               The orifices and leaflets are manufactured separately. The carbon-coated components are machined and polished to a high degree and readied for inspection, sorting and assembly. Each leaflet and orifice is assigned an identification number so that it can be tracked during the manufacturing process. Each assembled valve is assigned a serial number. Each step in the inspection, testing and assembly of the valve by St Jude Medical Inc post-manufacture is recorded on documents known as ‘travellers’ which are compiled into a file for the assembled valve called the Device History Record. Mr Monaghan referred to those relating to the applicant’s explanted valve in discussing the procedures undertaken with respect to it. The procedures include inspections designed to detect and identify any irregularities on the surfaces of the leaflets and orifices such as pits, depressions, bumps, scratches, stains and discolouration.  105               The inspections include computer-aided dimensional testing, measurement of the thickness of the leaflet ears and a visual inspection at 7x magnification. A discrepancy report was generated with respect to the left leaflet of the applicant’s valve, although this appears only to have indicated that the computer was unable to detect a component due to improper positioning. The leaflet subsequently passed all tests and met specifications making it acceptable for assembly. A discrepancy report with respect to the right leaflet, after a visual inspection, noted the presence of a stain on the knife side. The presence of stains does not mean that the component should be rejected and they arise for a number of reasons.  106               The right leaflet was subjected to further assessment by a manufacturing engineer and quality assurance engineer and a decision was made to rework the leaflet to remove the stain, following the ‘Carbon Rework Procedure’. The procedure requires that the carbon surface of the valve be hand polished, using a cotton swab and diamond paste. The paste contains minute diamond particles measured in microns. The procedure is undertaken in a ‘clean room’ where the environment is controlled. A microscopic visual inspection of the reworked area is undertaken, usually at 7x magnification, following rework. The rework was completed and passed the visual inspection test. After further checks on the leaflet’s dimensions it was approved for assembly. 107               At assembly the orifice is spread open and the leaflets inserted so that they fit into a swivel within the orifice butterflies. The assembled valve is then subjected to a functional test and further cleaning and visual inspection at 7x magnification. The valve passed this inspection. The sewing cuff is then mounted onto the valve assembly. The valve and cuff are then subjected to further visual inspection at 7x magnification. The valve passed this examination. The valve was then cleaned, sterilised, packed and shipped.  (b) After Explant 108               On 3 July 1997 Ms Mitrangas received the St Jude Medical valve and completed a record of a therapeutic device problem. On 7 July 1997 the applicant’s solicitors wrote to the hospital requesting notification of the testing and that the valve not be disposed of.  109               Ms Bethel, a Field Experience Report Analyst at St Jude Medical Inc, received the valve, which was contained in a small specimen tube, and opened a file. The Field Experience Report department investigates complaints or adverse experiences regarding products. It records and investigates each adverse event regardless of whether they are subject to mandatory reporting. St Jude Medical Inc maintained a Protocol for testing and reporting. It was Ms Bethel’s responsibility to co-ordinate the activities relating to the physical handling of the applicant’s explanted valve, to analyse the condition of the valve as received and to oversee its function and dimensional testing.  110               Following the Protocol Ms Bethel photographed the packaging and the valve and documented the condition of the valve on the Returned Valve Examination Data Sheet after conducting an examination. She conducted a gross visual examination after removing the valve from the specimen tube using forceps. She looked at the pivot guards, valve orifices, valve leaflets and sewing cuff for the purpose of detecting any abnormality, breakages, cuff abnormal tissue growth, scratches or surface imperfections. She did not notice any imperfections but did notice the presence of tissue at various points. The leaflets opened and closed with some resistance, which she thought to be due to the presence of tissue growth. She then sent the valve to Dr Titus.  111               Doctor Titus also conducted a gross visual examination. He observed that the leaflets could be closed with moderate pressure and that there were fibrinous deposits on the surface of both leaflets with large amounts in both of the recessed pivot covers. His usual practice was then to gently remove the majority of the tissue and check for scratches or dents on the surface. He did not note any. He then conducted a microscopic examination at both 5x magnification and 10x magnification , aided by a dissecting light. He did not record any blemishes on the carbon surface or any imperfections. He observed that a large portion of the material observed on the leaflets and in the recessed pivot areas was fresh fibrin ‘containing moderate numbers of intact red blood cells and leukocytes in a somewhat layered and generally scattered fashion’. In his view they were only a few days old when stored in the tube. He then conducted a detailed microscopic examination but found no abnormalities or defects and noted that the valve was free from defects.  112               On 12 August 1997 the packed valve was sent to the St Jude Medical Inc engineering test laboratory for functional testing, which duplicated its operation under simulated conditions. Prior to being sent, Ms Bethel cleaned it under 10x magnification and checked for defects. She made no note of any. On its return to her Ms Bethel disassembled the valve for dimensional analysis using special equipment to preserve the integrity of the surface. She used a mechanical spreader, gently opening the orifice, so as to allow the leaflets to disassemble and fall out. It was then sent to another facility for analysis.  113               On 18 September 1997 St Jude Medical Inc sent a report to the third respondent. When the applicant did not receive a copy she contacted Mr Newman who wrote to her on 24 November 1997 and advised that the valve had appeared normal under testing except for the thrombus on it. He advised that the extent of the thrombus, despite anticoagulants, was a quite rare event, but that it had been mentioned before in connexion with mechanical valves.  114               Sometime in November or December 1997 the applicant visited Dr Nigel Buxton, a pathologist, to find out if St Jude Medical Inc’s testing of the valve had been adequate. He told her that it had been viewed under inadequate magnification and raised other issues. He helped her to compose questions which the applicant forwarded to St Jude Medical Inc on 20 January 1998. She later requested that the valve be returned to her. St Jude Medical Inc responded that it would not return the valve but some agreement for a protocol for testing might be reached. In July 1998 the applicant again indicated that she wished to have the explanted valve independently tested and in August 1998 she advised St Jude Medical Inc that she intended to pursue legal action in relation to the valve. It was not until after commencement of her action in March 2001 that the retrieval of the valve appears to have been revisited.  115               In late July or early August 2001 Ms Smentek of St Jude Medical Inc was asked to obtain the applicant’s explanted valve from storage and arrange for examination using a scanning electron microscope so that the condition of the valve could be recorded prior to the valve being released. The applicant’s valve was in a disassembled state, and the sewing cuff and each leaflet were in separate plastic bags. She retrieved the valve and undertook a normal microscopic examination at 10x magnification to assess whether the valve was in a condition suitable for scanning electron microscope photographs, having regard to the presence of any dust or other particles. She did not observe any abnormalities. She then took nine digital photographs of the valve components, but did not identify each view. She undertook this procedure using rubber-tipped forceps.  116               On 14 September 2001 Mr Long, then a materials engineer with St Jude Medical Inc, undertook a scanning electron microscope examination and reported the presence of a spall or small chip on the left ear of the bevel edge of the right leaflet under magnifications of 11x and 75x. The chip was 400 microns in length and 200 microns wide. Ms Smentek later reviewed the photographs taken by Mr Long. The chip can be seen at those numbered 813 and 814. She undertook another microscopic visual analysis at 10x magnification and could then clearly see the chip. 6. OPINIONS CONCERNING THE CHIP ON THE VALVE 117               It is necessary to interpolate here what was observed in relation to the valve on explant by those present including the third respondent and Mr Newman, who had attended because the applicant’s case was so unusual. Mr Newman described the valve as having a thin velvety coating of a sort of fibrinous material over the entire surface and on at least one side of the leaflets of the valve. It may have been on both sides. The appearance of the coating was most unusual. It was uniform over the surface. It did not appear to be localised thrombus formation around the sewing ring or the hinged areas. This accords with the third respondent’s observations. The doctor who recorded the hospital’s operation report, but who was not called as a witness, however wrote that there was ‘thrombus predominant in the area of the hinge mechanism’. 118               Part of the applicant’s case assumes that the chip later found on the right leaflet of the explanted mitral valve was present when implanted into her and was the cause of thrombus or thrombi forming on the valve. As to the latter, Prof Hirsh said that it was possible that a chip on a leaflet could cause some disturbance in the blood flow which would increase the likelihood of a thrombus developing on the valve. An important consideration here however was that on explantation the thrombus on the valve was observed to be widespread, on both of the leaflets and on both sides of the leaflets and on the sewing ring. It was not localised to the area near the chip. If the chip was the source of a thrombus one would expect the focus of the nidus of the thrombus to be at the site of the chip and perhaps spreading to the immediate area. In his view a chip such as this would not have caused thrombus to form across the valve.  119               The only evidence suggesting the chip as the source of the applicant’s thrombi was that of Prof Brandwood. Professor Brandwood has a background in biomedical engineering and is a consultant to innovators of medical devices. He did not disagree with Prof Hirsh’s view that a thrombus associated with the chip would be expected to be more closely associated to the hinged pivot area. Professor Brandwood considered one particular photograph of the leaflet (PB1010) to be particularly instructive. It showed a concentration of attached thrombus adjacent to the pivot area. It was not however possible for him to distinguish which was the right or left leaflet. He accepted in cross-examination, and with the aid of clearer photographs, that the material he was referring to was on the right side knife edge of the right leaflet and that, correctly orientated, there was no material apparent on the left ear of the bevelled edge of the right leaflet. He agreed that it provided no support for the presence of thrombus near the chip in the valve.  120               Professor Williams, Professor of Clinical Engineering and Professor of Tissue Engineering at Royal Liverpool University Hospital, England also gave evidence that all synthetic materials have an intrinsic ability to activate platelets and the blood clotting process. Further, all designs of heart valve influence the characteristics of blood flow. The greater the disturbance produced, for example by the flow of blood around leaflets or hinge mechanisms, the greater the effect on this tendency to produce clots. All manufacturers were aware of the potential for the formation of thrombus because of chips and other defects, Prof Williams explained. It is possible that surface defects might influence thrombus formation. He was not however aware of any evidence to suggest that a chip of these dimensions increases the risk of thrombus formation.  121               Professor Buxton also considered that there was no way of quantifying the risk of a chip of this size causing thrombus. He considered that the development of a thrombus usually commences in the area of the valve hinge mechanisms where the flow of blood is relatively low.  122               The valve in question was removed sometime after the formation of the thrombus or thrombi on it which resulted in the applicant’s stroke. Professor Hirsh pointed out that the extent of the thrombus observed at explant was not necessarily what had developed prior to the emboli moving into the applicant’s blood system. Nevertheless I understood all the witnesses to proceed upon the basis that what was seen on explant was reliably indicative of how thrombus developed on the valve implanted in the applicant. There was no other reliable evidence as to how it developed at the relevant time.  123               Professor Brandwood postulated that the widespread thrombus formation over the valve might be connected to factors affecting the area of the leaflet near the hinge where the chip existed. He thought that a thrombus at this point, which I take him to say would have originated in the chip, may have so impaired the movement of the leaflets that it caused the widespread formation of the thrombus. There was some evidence from Dr Titus that upon his examination both leaflets were nearly fixed in an open position and it had been recorded following explant that the thrombus was predominant in the hinge area. Professor Hirsh however said that it was difficult to interpret what Dr Titus saw and that more reliance should be placed on what the third respondent and others had observed at explant. The applicant also pointed to the note by Dr Maher in the hospital’s operation report which suggested a preponderance of material at the hinge. This would appear to be consistent with the view expressed by Prof Buxton and others that one might expect the development of thrombus in this area. That does not assist a conclusion that a chip in the area was the cause of the thrombus. Moreover Prof Brandwood’s theory of impaired movement of the leaflets creating the widespread thrombus, after the thrombus had developed on the chip near the hinge, requires that the impairment be substantial. Professor Hirsh however explained that if the movement of the leaflets had been so impaired one would have expected impairment of ventricular function and symptoms of heart failure, unless it occurred just at the time of surgery. Professor Hirsh was unaware of any published literature which might confirm Prof Brandwood’s hypothesis.  124               It would follow from Prof Brandwood’s theory that the chip was present when the valve was implanted. He thought this was possibly the case. In his opinion it was possible that polishing or reworking the leaflet could have resulted in damage to the brittle thin coating of the valve if the opposite, downward, side of the valve had been resting on a hard particle of grit or dust which then impacted on the surface. ‘Although unlikely’, the possibility of a defect having been introduced to the leaflet during the rework could not be ruled out, in his view.  125               Professor Brandwood’s approach was to discount various possibilities until only one feasible option remained. Generally he was of the view that the location of the chip was almost inaccessible to physical interference or impact when the valve was assembled. Therefore damage to the valve at any time following initial valve assembly and before disassembly by Ms Bethel is to be discounted. This would appear to leave the alternative possibilities of damage during manufacture prior to assembly or during handling post explant. In both these respects Prof Brandwood agreed that the methods for inspection were adequate and that 7x magnification was clearly sufficient to detect the chip. In his opinion the only feasible occasion for damage during manufacture was during reworking. As already noted, whilst the likelihood of its occurrence was low, Prof Brandwood considered that it could not be discounted.  126               Mr Monaghan said that any reworking would have been done in a clean environment and that the presence of a hard particle of dust or other material of a size sufficient to cause this chip was highly unlikely in such an area. In his view downward pressure whilst cleaning would not be enough.  127               Professor Williams did not consider that the hypothesis of damage during rework of the leaflet was open on the information available. In his view the appearance of the chip was consistent with contact between the valve leaflet and a sharp instrument, such as forceps. It seems to have been accepted by those giving evidence that damage was unlikely to have been occasioned by the use of forceps during explant.  128               Professor Buxton considered that there was also very little prospect that the chip occurred during implantation, for the same reason, namely that the site of the chip was inaccessible to instruments. In his view it was more likely that it was caused during extraction of the valve leaflet from its housing prior to electron microscopy.  129               Professor Brandwood, understandably, was not in a position to explain how no chip was seen on examination after the rework or on later examinations. He agreed that it could be seen at 7x magnification. Ms Bethel and Dr Titus, in his view, might have overlooked the chip in the assembled valve because it was on a part located within the hinge area and difficult to see when assembled. He discounted the prospect of damage by Ms Bethel during disassembly because force was then applied to the ring, not to the leaflets and she used rubber-tipped forceps. He also discounted the possibility of damage during transit to Mr Long although he conceded, when questioned, the possibility that the leaflet could have been dropped or mishandled at this point. He did not regard Ms Smentek’s photographic records to be necessarily complete because they did not identify the area being photographed. He says that it is possible that the area now known to be chipped was not photographed by her. The lack of suitable photographic evidence was considered by Prof Brandwood to affect the reliability of Ms Smentek’s visual examination. He said that it raises the ‘strong possibility’ that the valve was not completely examined and that the chip may have been overlooked. Professor Brandwood did not explain how such a conclusion was reached. I am unable to understand how any deficiency in identifying or recording the photographs should detract from the visual examination by Ms Smentek of the valve itself. Nevertheless her examination and the photographs do not support the theory that the chip occurred during disassembly by Ms Bethel.  7. the applicant’s medical history and events FOLLOWING IMPLANT (a) Medical 130               After the first operation, on 20 June 1996, the third respondent attended upon the applicant and explained to her that her mitral valve had been too badly damaged for repair to be possible. He said that he had replaced the valve with a mechanical valve.  131               A few days after surgery the applicant was shaving her legs and cut herself. The extent of the bleeding which followed was explained by a nurse as an effect of the anticoagulant drugs she was taking. The applicant says that this was the first time she realised she was taking such drugs.  132               At about this time the applicant was provided with a booklet published by St Jude Medical Inc entitled ‘Living with your new heart valve: an educational booklet for recipients of the mechanical valve’, which she read. It provided general advice to recipients as to lifestyle changes which would be necessary. It gave advice about undertaking exercise, diet, warned of fluid retention and the risk of endocarditis, an infection which can develop in the tissue around an artificial valve. It advised recipients that their doctor might prescribe anticoagulant medication to prevent blood clots forming on the valve and advised that they maintain recommended levels of anticoagulants and to check with their doctor before taking any other medication. It listed a number of symptoms and advised the recipient to consult their physician if they develop. The applicant recalls thinking that the anticoagulant medication must have been what the third respondent had discussed with her. The evidence on this topic is somewhat confusing. The applicant says that the nurse’s advice was the first time she knew about anticoagulants. In cross-examination she said that at this point she also understood that anticoagulants prevented clotting, because she had read the booklet. And she says she understood that if clots formed they could travel to other parts of her body. That advice was not given in the booklet.  133               In mid July 1996 the third respondent performed an echocardiographic examination of the applicant which showed that the mechanical valve was functioning normally. The applicant says that in this period she felt unwell and experienced pain in her fingers and patches of disturbed vision. Whilst visiting her general practitioner on one occasion she fainted. Upon recovery it was observed that she had blood under her fingernails. Her general practitioner expressed the view that they might be splinter haemorrhages, but the second respondent did not think so when the applicant saw him shortly afterwards. The applicant says that over the following months she experienced this symptom several times.  134               In this period, from discharge to 24 September 1996, the applicant’s INR levels fell below the recommended range. This was the case on three occasions between 20 and 24 September 1996. On 24 September 1996 and again on 15 October 1996 the applicant attended the hospital complaining of acute abdominal pain. On 16 October 1996 the applicant underwent tests which revealed a large infarct to the spleen and a small infarct to the left kidney. A computed tomography of the applicant’s cranium did not show any infarct to the brain.  135               During this period of hospitalisation echocardiographic examinations were undertaken. That conducted on 16 October 1996 showed some evidence of echoes on the ventricular surface of the anterior portion of the St Jude Medical valve, consistent with loose chordae or vegetations. That of 21 October 1996 revealed echoes on the atrial surface of the mitral valve ring consistent with fibrin strands, vegetation or thrombus. Upon her discharge the second respondent set the applicant’s INR goals at 3.5 to 4.  136               On 27 October 1996, whilst an in-patient, the applicant was reviewed by Dr Kermode, a neurologist. She gave him a long history of paroxysmal episodes of disequilibrium and of episodes of skew deviation when looking down. These symptoms often occur together. She had, for many years, had visual ‘squiggles’ in her eyesight of brief duration. Her other medical problems included the continuing symptoms from the motor vehicle accidents. Of more concern, in his view, prior to her admission on 14 October 1996, were the two episodes she had suffered of bilateral lower limb weakness and paraplegia. Doctor Kermode’s later evidence reveals that he believed these episodes to have been thromboembolic in origin, but that they later resolved. I infer that they may have been the precursors to the infarcts.  137               He explained to her that the infarcts had been caused by blood clots forming on the valve and travelling through her bloodstream. He advised her that she was at risk of a stroke from the same cause. The applicant was additionally prescribed the drug Heparin.  138               On 11 December 1996 the applicant was admitted to the hospital having suffered from headaches, dizziness and syncope or fainting. Her INR level at admission was 1.5. Examinations of her cranium were unremarkable.  139               On 9 January 1997 the second respondent reviewed the applicant and recommended her INR level be maintained at 3.0 to 3.5. When the applicant was referred again to the second respondent on 26 February 1997 she reported having had fainting spells and bleeding under the nails. The second respondent was of the view that there were no clinical signs of endocarditis and blood tests then taken confirmed this.  140               On 7 March 1997 an echocardiographic examination revealed that the St Jude Medical valve was functioning normally with no evidence of thrombi or vegetations. On the morning of 21 March 1997 the applicant felt unstable whilst showering at home. Her condition worsened. She experienced double vision, was unable to walk in a straight line and lost some of her motor functions. She was admitted to hospital and reviewed by Dr Kermode the following day. Scans were undertaken. She had suffered a right thalamic and midbrain infarction. Doctor Kermode says that mild vascular anomalies were also demonstrated. The second respondent recommended to Dr Kermode at this point that the applicant also take Aspirin to increase the anticoagulant effects of the Warfarin.  141               In April 1997 the applicant suffered from menorrhagia, or excessive menstrual flow. She had had this condition previously and in particular in 1992, although she said the bleeding was not then as heavy as that she had in 1997. Nevertheless it would appear that it was sufficiently heavy to confine her to her home for a time. On the morning of 4 April 1997 she awoke in a pool of blood. The heavy bleeding continued and she was admitted to hospital. The applicant continued to suffer menorrhagia on occasions thereafter.  142               When the second respondent reviewed the applicant on 8 May 1997 she reported episodes of sudden weakness, lack of co-ordination and episodic double vision. She was distressed, weak and unsteady. The second respondent was unable to detect any abnormalities in her cardiovascular system and the St Jude Medical valve sounded normal. Twenty-four hour electrocardiogram monitoring did not indicate any matter for concern.  143               On 25 May 1997 the second respondent again saw the applicant. She reported that she felt somewhat better since commencing on another drug. The applicant however says that in early June she attended upon the second respondent because she was unwell and had been collapsing frequently. She collapsed in his waiting room. She told the second respondent that she could not continue with these symptoms and says that he advised her, in effect, that she should be finding ways of coping with her life. 144               On 12 June 1997 the applicant was taking the family dog to her childrens’ school to show to the students. She felt dizzy as she left the classroom and as she walked to her car was unable to walk properly. As she got to the car she lost the use of her right arm. She was unable to get into the car. She observed in the car mirror that the left side of her face had dropped. She fell to the ground and was unable to raise herself. The applicant was admitted to hospital with right-sided weakness. An echocardiographic examination of the applicant on 16 June 1997 showed the St Jude Medical valve to be functioning normally and there was nothing to indicate material on the surface of the valve. An arch aortogram undertaken on 18 June 1997 confirmed total occlusion of the left vertebral artery. It also showed that the artery was hypoplastic, or under-developed, a condition which was probably constitutional, in Dr Kermode’s view, and lifelong. Similarly it showed the applicant’s intracranial posterior circulation to be low.  145               In 1997 the applicant’s condition was reviewed in a conference of seven specialists, including Dr Kermode. In view of the applicant’s series of thromboembolic events it was recommended that the St Jude Medical valve be replaced. The applicant was, understandably, frightened of the prospect of this surgery and her family distressed. She was concerned that she might not survive the surgery or suffer a catastrophic stroke.  146               As earlier mentioned the applicant received a replacement tissue valve on 27 June 1997. Since then she has been maintained on Warfarin and is likely to be required to take anticoagulants for the rest of her life.  147               On 8 July 1997 the second respondent reviewed the applicant. She reported feeling well. A further examination on 14 July 1997 revealed the tissue valve to be functioning normally. On 20 July 1997 however the applicant was admitted to hospital suffering chest pain which was thought to be reactive pericarditis.  148               The applicant says that after leaving hospital she wrote to the second respondent advising that she did not wish to consult him further. She says that the reason for this was that she did not believe that he was able to diagnose her condition accurately. In fact it was not until 22 February 1998 that the applicant wrote to the second respondent advising that she had asked Dr Hands to assume management of her heart condition. In the letter she said that on a number of occasions he had not been available for consultation when she was hospitalised. In cross-examination she agreed that that did not represent her true view. The true reason for discontinuing his services was because he had not believed what she had said, which she somehow equated with her earlier statement concerning his inability to diagnose.  149               There had been correspondence between the applicant, her solicitors and the second respondent productive of some disharmony in late 1997. On 11 October 1997 the second respondent provided a report, at the request of her solicitors, for the purpose of her action concerning the second accident. In it he said that her cardiovascular status had been a major limiting factor in her inability to work over the past eighteen months and she had not been capable of full time or part time work. On 17 October 1997 the applicant wrote to the second respondent saying that she was ‘shocked and dismayed’ to read the report and indicated that she had in fact been employed in the last eighteen months. She was annoyed because he had told her to return to work and resume a normal life and she had attempted to do so, but now he was saying that she was unable to work. The second respondent rang her and invited her to write to him with full details of the employment she had undertaken. She advised that she had managed to work on almost a full time basis in the past five years with Westpoint. This appears to be something of an overstatement. She related her principal inabilities to her neck and back pain. It is clear enough that she sought to have the second respondent place less emphasis upon the impact of the heart surgery on her ability to work. In his report of 11 November 1999 the second respondent outlined in more detail the work she was able to do and her return to work as a bookkeeper following the second operation and noted that she had had difficulties with her back and neck even prior to the first operation. It is not suggested that the second respondent did not believe what he wrote on the second occasion to be correct. The applicant relies upon the second respondent’s description of the changes to his report as minor when they were more substantial. I do not consider it conveys anything about the second respondent’s credit. It is however indicative of the applicant’s ability to make demands of her medical practitioners.  150               In August 1997 Dr Kermode’s differential diagnosis was either that the applicant’s congenital hypoplastic cerebral circulation was predisposing her to intermittent neurological disturbance at times of mild hypotension or that the episodes may have been due to migraine sine hemicrania. The intermittent neurological disturbances to which the doctor refers in this connexion are the positive visual disturbances, the disequilibrium and incoordination of the limbs with nausea and disruption of coordination. By January 1998 Dr Kermode had a third differential diagnosis, namely that the disturbances resulted from emboli having a cardiac origin, although he considered this to be the least likely of the causes. Scans taken in July 1998 showed no evidence of any cerebral infarct apart from that which had occurred in March 1997. That scan, and those undertaken since, do not provide any evidence to support the third differential diagnosis, Dr Kermode accepts.  151               In the period October 1997 to mid-January 1998 the applicant presented to the hospital with facial numbness and loss of balance, palpitations associated with dizziness, collapse, episodic double vision, visual disturbance, dizziness and occasional fainting and ‘muddy spots’ over the sight in the right eye. The second respondent’s clinical examinations did not reveal any cardiac problems.  152               On 20 January 1998 the applicant attended to the hospital again with chest pains, shortness of breath, light-headedness and palpitations and on 17 February 1998 with left upper quadrant pain. The second respondent reviewed the applicant in hospital and on 18 February 1998 recommended further twenty-four hour holter electrocardiographic monitoring and advised that her current condition of anaemia could be contributing to her symptoms. The applicant first consulted Dr Hands on 19 February 1998.  153               The applicant continued to consult Dr Kermode. In June 1998 she reported experiencing diplopia rarely, but some visual phenomena once to twice a week. In July 1998 she had recurrent diplopia and disequilibrium. A further scan undertaken on 30 July 1998 showed no recent infarction of the brain. The applicant again reported to Dr Kermode on 10 August 1998 that she had woken with diplopia, loss of balance and slurred speech and that these symptoms had lasted several hours. A further scan showed no change. In a letter to Dr Anell in May 1999 Dr Kermode noted that the applicant was still having significant periods of diplopia with occasional positive visual phenomena, which he ascribed to migraine. By 17 August 2000 he was able to tell Dr Anell that she had not had any diplopia for a period of several days. The problem occurred when she looked from right to left, especially when driving. He also recorded that she had occasional pre-syncope. He expressed the view that, whilst the diplopia was migrainous, the effects of the stroke could be contributing to the risk of its occurrence.  154               On 18 August 1998 the applicant underwent a hysterectomy. In a report to her solicitor of December 1998 Dr Hands observed that prior to this time she had suffered fatigue which he thought to be secondary to anaemia caused by the heavy menstrual bleeding. She had reported as feeling much improved after the hysterectomy. The depression she had initially felt after the surgery, and for which she had received psychiatric treatment, had resolved.  155               In a report of 21 December 1998 Dr Hands summarised the other problems the applicant had had that year as including light-headedness; palpitations; diplopia (which he noted Dr Kermode was treating) and left hypochondrial pain. In the latter respect however there was no evidence of any further infarcts. The new valve was functioning normally. He went on:  ‘Other than occasional episodes of light-headedness, occasional palpitations and occasional episodes of intermittent left hypochondrial discomfort, she is well and enjoying good energy levels.’ 156               In July 1999 the doctor observed that her symptoms were unchanged and were relatively infrequent and tolerable. Her anticoagulant therapy was under control.  157               The applicant continued to suffer a number of different symptoms. On 29 January 1999 the applicant presented to the hospital with left-sided chest pain radiating to her left shoulder. Episodes of chest pain, shortness of breath and associated symptoms continued through to June 2001. The various diagnoses at discharge from the hospital on these occasions included tachycardia, atypical chest pain, chest wall pain and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  158               From September 2000 the applicant reported symptoms of syncope, palpitations, dizziness, faintness and lethargy, weakness and dizziness. In November 2001 Dr Hands considered two methods of testing for the syncope. The first, tilt table testing, did not show anything. In February 2002 the doctor arranged for her to have a specialdevice fitted. It is not apparent from the evidence to which I was taken what the outcome of that test was. By January 2003 the applicant was reporting that the episodes of weakness and dizziness, associated with palpitations, were increasing. On 23 September 2003 she presented to the hospital with chest palpitations which had occurred during the past 3 weeks and severe headaches.  159               Doctor Hands was not called to give evidence by the applicant. It would appear from a letter from the applicant to Dr Hands on 13 December 1998 that the applicant did not wish to do so. The letter explained that she was intending to ‘take court action’ against the first respondent and St Jude Medical Inc. They had previously indicated that they would defend any action by claiming that her injuries were caused by the negligence of her medical team. I interpolate that the employee of Getz Bros & Co (Aust) Pty Ltd to whom this is attributed denies giving such advice. The applicant then said:  ‘Accordingly I am planning to join Professor Thompson and Dr Nichols [sic] in this action to compel them to give evidence which I expect will support my claim and refute the claim made by Getz Bros.’  (b) Work History 160               After the two heart operations and between October 1997 and late 1998 the applicant did undertake some further work. Her brother agreed to finance her in the establishment of a chain of fashion stores. Her health did not permit her to work full time and she was only able to manage the undertaking with the assistance of a full time assistant. The four stores were not trading at a profit at the time the venture failed because of the applicant’s health. They had not however traded for a long time. She had designed a range of clothes which were manufactured in China. She was about to launch the range in the stores when she was required to have a hysterectomy as a matter of some urgency and she was unable to work for over a month. She and her brother then decided to abandon the project. In 2002 she undertook some further studies towards a degree in fine arts. The applicant otherwise continues to work for her husband’s firm for eight to ten hours per week. At the time her statement concerning her economic loss was filed, on 8 July 2002, she did not believe that she could hold a similar position in the workforce.  161               The applicant says that she is presently employed by Westpoint as the Executive Manager of its Multimedia Unit which was established in January 2003 as an independent unit. It produces Westpoint’s printed, electronic and display materials, signage and websites. She is able to organise the hours she works to suit her. She says that she is usually able to work ten hours per week but her health problems sometimes restrict the number of days she can work even further. She is not required to provide time sheets. It would also appear that she continues to work for her husband’s firm, for up to ten hours per week. The applicant also attends between four and six meetings in Canberra per year, in her role as ministerial appointee to committees concerned with cardio-vascular and stroke strategies and medical devices.  162               The applicant says that presently she is paid $52,000.00 per annum plus a performance bonus which is 10 per cent of net profit if the budget turnover target is met. It is not clear what the figure for profit is taken from. To date however she has redirected her performance bonus entitlement to her Operations Manager who carries the main burden of the work and has to assume her role when she is not available.  8. the applicant’s opportunities to earn income 163               The duties associated with the applicant’s position include the development of a business plan, monitoring costs and budgets and supervising design and production. The applicant says that were she well enough she would be able to carry out both her tasks and that of the Operations Manager. One person would normally fulfil both tasks. In addition to the income received as Executive Manager she could earn another $77,480.00 for the Operations Manager’s role.  164               The applicant’s principal case is that, had she not suffered the injuries or symptoms she attributes to the implantation of the St Jude Medical valve, she could have earned considerable sums selling financial products and earning commissions for Westpoint. This would not appear to be the same position the applicant has referred to in previous litigation, despite the applicant and her brother suggesting that it is.  165               The applicant’s brother, Mr Carey, said that a position selling financial products would have been available to her if she had been able to finish her commerce degree. An offer to that effect had been made in 1991 but had to be withdrawn in 1997 when she could not complete her studies. Nevertheless he said that she was again offered such a position in 1998. The applicant put the date at 2000. In 1998 the applicant was taken up with the fashion stores and Mr Carey’s date seems unlikely, as does the prospect that the offer was in fact made. I take it that the position is a demanding one and not one where a person can choose when they work. Indeed the applicant’s case is that she could not undertake the role. There would seem to me however to be little difference in the physical disabilities she recounts as current and her state in 1998 and 2000. This raises the question why the offer would have been made. Nevertheless Westpoint does have persons undertaking these roles and there is evidence of other commission agents and the prospect that she might have considered such a role remains to be considered.  166               Westpoint finances its developments by raising between 50 to 60 per cent of the project cost from a major bank; funds from equity investors at between 10 to 30 per cent of the project cost; and mezzanine finance of the same order. Equity investors are obtained through Westpoint and its brokers and agents. Likewise, Westpoint, agents and brokers identify investors for the ‘mezzanine finance’ which is usually facilitated by promissory notes which they negotiate.  167               Although Mr Carey said that employees of Westpoint sourced investors as well as external agents and brokers there was no evidence as to their earnings. There was a reference to ‘these project finance arrangers’, which would appear to extend to Westpoint’s employees in its Financial Products Division, earning commission. The percentage commissions he goes on to refer to however are attributed to external brokers and agents only. And while he refers to the large sums Westpoint has paid by way of commission no records were produced to show any individual’s earnings from Westpoint and none were produced with respect to Westpoint’s employees. The evidence ought to be viewed with considerable suspicion. He said that a broker or agent could expect to receive 2 to 5 per cent commission on funds invested by equity investors, 5 to 10 per cent on amounts over $100,000.00 on mezzanine finance together with a further commission of 5 to 8 per cent each time the promissory note is rolled over or the fund reinvested, and 3 to 6 per cent of the amount of direct property investments. It is these sums which he says his sister could have earned. He thinks that she could earn $500,000.00 per annum and this equates with amounts of commissions paid by Westpoint in the period 1998 to 2003. How the figure is arrived at was not gone into.  168               Mr Carey believes that his sister has the ability to earn sums of the kind mentioned. He points to the considerable network of contacts she developed whilst she was a model and the advantage she would have as a member of his family. He points to the work she performed in the early 1980s when she assisted in the management of the City Markets for Westpoint. He identifies three occasions when the applicant introduced potential or actual purchasers to Westpoint. And he refers to the experience she had in the fashion business which she was unable to pursue.  169               Mr Beck is a person whose company, Needlers End Nominees Pty Ltd, has earned commissions of the order Mr Carey spoke of in recent years. His work as an agent includes work for Westpoint but it is not his company’s sole source of income. He is also a consultant to and a director of some companies within the Westpoint group. He has considerable experience in the Australian property industry. Mr Beck gave evidence of the earnings of a business development manager recently employed by him in his business. She is about thirty years of age with little experience in property but she has previous experience as a business development manager. Her task is to undertake necessary research work for him to enable him to attend meetings and deliver presentations to raise capital from clients. Just what is involved was not gone into in detail. She then follows up on what he has achieved. Her remuneration is 11 per cent of capital raised or $60,000.00 per annum plus superannuation and normal entitlements, whichever is the greater, according to her letter of appointment. Additionally, she is to receive 25 per cent by way of share in the net profit of the company on a quarterly basis. In evidence Mr Beck said that he anticipates that she will earn $375,000.00 in this year, of which $200,000.00 represents her 1 per cent share of commission. The balance was said to be her profit share. It was not obvious to me what use is to be made of this evidence. Mr Beck’s position would not appear to be comparable to an employee of Westpoint. There is no obvious parallel with his manager’s agreed remuneration and what Westpoint might pay.  9. THE applicant’S CURRENT symptoms AND THEIR EFFECTS 170               The focus of the applicant’s description of her symptoms which have caused and do cause her difficulty are her dizziness, weakness, fatigue and collapse. She identifies a number of occasions since 1996 or 1997 on which she has fainted or felt faint. The occasions identified continued through to 2002, although I take the applicant to say that she continues to suffer these symptoms. They prevent her from a large number of activities, including those with her children, travelling, and affect her ability to carry out work. She is nervous of driving and has an arrangement with her husband to telephone him every few minutes if the symptoms commence. Because of these and other symptoms the applicant is unable to work full time.  171               The applicant is of the view that she is obliged to remain on anticoagulants for the rest of her life, although she now has a tissue valve, because she has sustained damage to her vascular system as a result of the thromboembolisms. I infer that the applicant is maintained on anticoagulants because of her history of thromboembolic events and the possibility that she is predisposed to thrombosis. The applicant understands that she cannot risk bleeding whilst on anticoagulants and therefore cannot undertake activities such as skiing, bike riding and horse-riding. She cannot go camping with her sons. She says that she is unable to have further nerve block treatment.  172               The applicant continues to suffer from diplopia, but she says that since suffering the stroke it is different from that suffered before. The applicant also considers that she has suffered some permanent vision loss due to the accumulation of emboli in the blood vessels in her eyes. When it combines with transient vision loss she is unable to drive. There was no evidence from any eye specialist as to these matters.  173               The applicant continues to suffer palpitations. She is required to take Dioxin to assist in the stronger beating of her heart and she is of the view that she is therefore at risk of Dioxin toxicity. She also requires Flecainide acid to make her heart beat less erratically but this causes side effects. Clearly enough the applicant also attributes that condition of her heart, which these drugs are prescribed for, to the St Jude Medical valve or its aftermath, including explantation.  174               The applicant continues to suffer neck and back pain. She understands that she cannot have nerve block treatment to reduce or eliminate the pain which I infer is significant. She has not taken any other measures to reduce the pain.  10. the medical evidence as to the applicant’s symptoms 175               The applicant has not continued with any management for her neck and lower back pain. No medical practitioner was called to give evidence concerning the current status of these conditions. In October 1996 Dr Finch did however write to her solicitors advising that the pain amounted to a continuing partial disability and that it was unlikely that her symptoms would greatly improve.  176               Doctor Hands did not give evidence, as I have observed. He appears, from his written records and advices, to have been concerned that the episodes of her fainting were related to her heart functioning. It has not however been established that they have that connexion.  177               As to the applicant’s symptoms prior to 1996, Prof Buxton says that her symptoms appear to be non-specific and vague. The connexion between mitral valve prolapse and loss of balance is tenuous. The symptoms of mild chest pain and episodes of palpitations may be connected to mitral valve prolapse, but the link is vague. Holter monitoring usually clarifies whether palpitations represent the onset of atrial fibrillation. It may be recalled that the second respondent undertook this monitoring periodically and nothing was shown. I take Prof Buxton to agree with the second respondent’s opinion that the applicant’s symptoms for the most part were not caused by the prolapse of her mitral valve.  178               Professor Feneley appears to be of a like view. The applicant’s mitral incompetence at the time of her first valve surgery did not necessarily indicate that this was the cause of her symptoms. Palpitations and chest pain are reported by patients with mitral valve prolapse, but the symptoms correlate poorly with the degree of incompetence. He would have advised her that her symptoms might not be relieved by surgery, because he doubted they were caused by the condition. He notes references in her medical records to conditions of anxiety and conversion hysteria suffered by her. He considers there is considerable doubt as to the cause of the partially occluded vertebral artery.  179               Professor Feneley made another observation. The exercise test undertaken by the applicant in May 1991 showed excellent exercise tolerance, which would be expected with mild mitral incompetence. The finding does not support the attribution of the symptoms of weakness, shortness of breath and reduced energy levels to her mitral valve prolapse.  180               There is no doubt that the applicant suffered a stroke in the midbrain and infarcts to the spleen and kidney. There is no suggestion however that the latter infarcts resulted in any residual disability. Professor Hirsh is of the view that they were brought about largely because the level of anticoagulant which the applicant was able to maintain at the time was subtherapeutic.  181               Doctor Kermode was clearly of the view that the applicant had suffered symptoms having their basis in a type of migraine condition prior to her surgery in 1996. That condition had caused dizziness, visual disturbances including diplopia, paroxysmal disequilibrium and incoordination of the limbs. Doctor Kermode considered that, prior to the stroke, the applicant had suffered two episodes of neurological disturbance which were not migrainous in origin. There is no suggestion that they have resulted in any residual disability. The midbrain stroke itself initially caused her significant impairment of balance and vision and she developed dysarthria and vertical diplopia, in Dr Kermode’s view. She has made a very good recovery from the stroke. It has left her with mild impairment of equilibrium different from the paroxysmal disturbance of equilibrium. It may affect her, for example, when walking on uneven ground. And I understand Dr Kermode’s opinion to be that the structural damage caused by the stroke is likely to predispose her to an increase in the frequency and severity of the episodes of diplopia which she has suffered for some time.  D. LIABILITY 1. THE LIABILITY OF THE FIRST RESPONDENT (a) The claim under s 75AD 182               Part VA was introduced by the Trade Practices Amendment Act 1992 (Cth). The applicant submitted, in support of her contention that liability under the Part is strict, that it resulted from Report No 51, ‘Product Liability’, by the Australian Law Reform Commission (the ‘ALRC’). The Explanatory Memorandum to the Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 (Cth) does not support the applicant’s contention. It says that the purpose of the Bill is to introduce into Australia ‘a strict product liability regime based on the 1985 European Community Product Liability Directive …’. It appears from what follows in the Explanatory Memorandum however that liability was to be limited by the requirement of a defect. In JD Heydon, Trade Practices Law: Restrictive Trade Practices, Deceptive Conduct and Consumer Protection, Lawbook Co., Sydney, 2001, at [16A.80] it is observed that s 75AC(1) is a departure from strict or absolute liability. The Memorandum states that the regime of strict liability provided for, when a person suffers injury as a result of a defective product, is that they have a right of compensation against the manufacturer without the need to prove negligence on the part of the manufacturer. Another aspect of Part VA, which a Full Court observed in Glendale Chemical Products Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and Anor (1999) ATPR 41-672at 42,592, is that it permits recovery irrespective of the existence of any contractual relationship between the manufacturer and the person injured.  183               The provisions of Part VA follow closely the European Community Directive of 25 July 1985 (Directive 85/374/EEC, OJ No L210, 7.8.1985, p 29). The approach recommended by the ALRC went further. Pursuant to it a person would not need to establish that the goods did not comply with a standard of safety or quality. It rejected the need to limit liability by some concept such as ‘defect’.  184               The Outline to the Explanatory Memorandum continued:  ‘2. The key concept of the new Part VA inserted by this Bill is that a person who is injured, or whose personal property is damaged, by a defective product will have a right to compensation against the manufacturer of the product. Goods are ‘defective’ if they do not have the degree of safety which persons generally are entitled to expect in all the circumstances. ‘Manufacturer’ has the same extended definition as currently applies for the purposes of Division 2A of Part V of the Trade Practices Act.    3. The manufacturer can escape liability where it can prove one of a number of defences, the most significant being that the goods were not defective when supplied by the manufacturer or that the goods represented the “state of the art”. The Bill also provides that, where goods contain a defect only because of compliance with a mandatory standard imposed by the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth and not the manufacturer should be liable to compensate the consumer. The amount of compensation payable is reduced by contributory acts by the injured party.’   185               There are three aspects to an action brought under s 75AD: the supply of goods by a corporation in trade or commerce; the goods having a defect; and a person suffering injuries ‘because of’ the defect.  186               The standard referred to in s 75AC(1), that goods are defective if they do not provide the level of safety which persons generally are entitled to expect, was described in the Explanatory Memorandum (at par 14) as an objective standard. It is based upon what the public at large, rather than any particular individual, is entitled to expect. Further, the standard does not require that the goods be absolutely free from risk (at par 14). The subsection has been construed in this way by Emmett J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Glendale Chemical Products Pty Limited; Barnes v Glendale Chemical Products Pty Limited (1998) ATPR 41-632at 40,970 and by the Full Court on appeal (Glendale Chemical Products Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and Anor at 42,595).  187               Section 75AC(1) is intended to apply to a number of different goods. It applies even if there is no inherent defect in the goods: Heydon’s Trade Practices Law at [16A.106]. At par 15 of the Explanatory Memorandum it is said:  ‘It should be noted that there are a number of different types of potential defects. Design defects relate to matters such as the form, structure and composition of the goods. Manufacturing defects are those related to matters such as the process of construction and assembly. Instructional defects are those caused by incorrect or inadequate warnings and instructions. All these categories of “defect” fall within the definition of defect in section 75AC.’  188               In assessing the safety of the product s 75AC(2) provides that all relevant circumstances are to be taken into account. Relevant to this case is the following discussion in the Explanatory Memorandum (at par 21):  ‘As noted above, in addition to the factors specified in subsection 75AC(2), the court must take all relevant circumstances into account in determining the safety of goods. Safety expectations may also depend on matters such as the nature of the product and community knowledge of that product. For example, there are a number of known negative side effects associated with certain pharmaceuticals and vaccines. It is also generally accepted and known that these side effects cannot be avoided. Such products are known to confer substantial benefits which flow to the wider community at large. The small statistical chance of injury associated with them does not of itself mean that they are “defective”.’   189               The Explanatory Memorandum to the Trade Practices Amendment Bill 1992 (Cth) suggests that so far as instructions or warnings are concerned, it may be relevant in a particular case to take into account the role of ‘intermediaries’ such as treating doctors (at par 24):  ‘The role which intermediaries may play in the supply of goods may also need to be taken into account. For example, prescription pharmaceuticals are supplied to the consumer by a qualified pharmacists and only on the prescription of a qualified medical practitioner. Due to the complex nature and effects of these products, complete instructions and warnings may not be provided to the consumer by the manufacturer. However, detailed product information is provided to doctors and pharmacists by the manufacturer so these learned intermediaries are sufficiently informed to be able to decide whether or not it is appropriate to dispense pharmaceuticals to particular consumers. This factor will be relevant in determining whether a pharmaceutical is defective, particularly where a claim of a defect in information provided is made. …’ 190               An issue arises in this case concerning whether the applicant is obliged to prove, as part of her case concerning the chip, that it was present when the valve was implanted. The first respondent submits that the applicant cannot establish, as s 75AD(c) requires, that she suffered injury ‘because of the defect’ unless she establishes this fact. The applicant counters that the legislature could not be taken to have intended that an injured person be required to prove the existence of the defect at the time of the supply.  191               The applicant’s submission must be correct, in my view. A person bringing a claim under s 75AD is to establish the existence of a defect in the goods and the fact of their injury. Additionally they must prove causation, which is to say that the injury came about ‘because of’ the defect. I shall return to that question shortly. If the manufacturer has no statutory defence, the scheme of Part VA is that liability is established. It would not be consistent with the requirements of the defence provisions, such as s 75AK(1), to require an applicant to establish the existence of the defect at a point before injury. If the necessary link between defect and injury is established it is to be inferred that the defect was present at the time of the injury, unless the manufacturer shows otherwise. The first respondent’s defence, relevant to these proceedings (under s 75AK(1)(a)), is that the defect did not exist when the goods left the control of the actual manufacturer, St Jude Medical Inc (‘the supply time’). The Explanatory Memorandum to the Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 (Cth) described the nature of the evidence that a manufacturer might have to give in this connexion (at par 39):  ‘To succeed in this defence, the manufacturer must show, on the balance of probabilities, that the (admittedly) defective goods were defect free when they left the manufacturer’s control. Factors such as the nature of the goods, the level of use of the goods, and the length of time between the goods leaving the control of the manufacturer and the damage will be important. Depending on the nature of the defect, the manufacturer may also need to provide detailed evidence on the manufacturing process and quality control to which the alleged defective good (not just goods of that type generally) was subjected, in order to show that this particular good was not defective when it left the manufacturer’s control.’  192               The applicant also submitted that it may be that the extent to which she is required to prove a link between a defect in the valve and her injuries is lessened by the subsection. The submission rests upon the choice of the words ‘because of’ (the defect) in s 75AD(c), which may be contrasted with the use of the word ‘by’ in s 82(1). It has been suggested that there may be differences in terms of causation, remoteness and the measure of damages flowing from the use of the various terms ‘because of’ and ‘as a result of’ in different sections in Pt VA and ‘by’ in s 82: see Heydon’s Trade Practices Law at [16A.150] and at [18.1260]. 193               Gummow J in Elna Australia Pty Ltd v International Computers (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 2) (1987) 16 FCR 410at 418 held that the nature or quality of the causation of which s 82 speaks is to be determined as a question of statutory construction. In his Honour’s view common law analogies would not offer appropriate guidance to a statute such as the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth)(at 419). The use of the word ‘by’ is to be understood in a context where a contravention of Parts IV or V need not be the only cause of the loss or damage.  194               Deane J in Wardley Australia Limited & Anor v The State of Western Australia (1992) 175 CLR 514at 542 (‘Wardley’) adopted a similar approach to s 82. The majority however did not. They do not appear to have considered that the word ‘by’ conveyed anything apart from the notion of causation. Their Honours (at 525) held that ‘by’ should be understood as taking up the ‘common law practical or common-sense concept of causation’ discussed in March v Stramare(E. & M.H.) Pty Limited (1991) 171 CLR 506(‘March v Stramare’). In March v Stramare Deane J considered that the question of causation is:  ‘… whether an identified negligent act or omission of the defendant was so connected with the plaintiff’s loss or injury that, as a matter of ordinary common sense and experience, it should be regarded as a cause of it …’   (at 522 and see 515 per Mason CJ).   In the context of s 82(1) acts done in reliance upon a misrepresentation furnish a sufficient connexion.  195               The words in s 75AD denote clearly the requirement of causation. The approach taken in Wardley and in March v Stramare does not permit consideration of the strength of the link required. In the context of s 75AD the defect must be shown to have caused an applicant’s injuries by applying a common sense approach. In any event, were reference to the words and statutory context possible, there is nothing in the subsection which would support the applicant’s contention of there being some lesser link necessary.  196               The applicant’s case relies upon instructional defects and defects which can be taken to have occurred in the manufacturing process. In the former regard reliance is placed upon the lack of warning about the risk of thromboembolism developing on the valve in the Patient Booklet. It is also alleged that the booklet was misleading in that it conveyed that there was no risk. The first respondent contends that these do not render the valve defective within the meaning of s 75AC(2). It is however accepted that the chip is a defect if it was present after manufacture and when supplied by St Jude Medical Inc to the first respondent. I should add that in final submissions for the applicant it was sought to widen the applicant’s case to allege a defect arising because the first respondent had failed to warn the applicant prior to implant. This does not arise from the pleading and was not part of the case opened for the applicant. I will not take it into account in relation to the case concerning s 75AD. It does however arise for consideration with respect to allegations of breach of duty at common law.  197               There are a number of facts which are relevant to a consideration as to whether the safety of the St Jude Medical valves generally is such as might be expected by the public. And it is important to bear in mind that the fact that a risk of complication attends their use would not of itself render them defective, as the Explanatory Memorandum to the Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 (Cth) points out. Goods are not required to be completely free of defect.  198               The evidence shows that the product has been made available to many persons. The incidence of complications shows that many people have benefited from it. The valve is not particularly prone to the development of thrombus and it was described by one witness as relatively thrombus-resistant and perhaps even more so than other valves. The risk cannot be eliminated, even with optimal anticoagulation. The risk which is present is, and was at the relevant time, well known by cardiologists and surgeons even without the Physician’s Reference Manual. They were in a position to convey information concerning the risk in a meaningful way to their patients. In these circumstances I do not see how it is possible to conclude generally that the St Jude Medical valve was defective. The fact that it was the cause of thromboembolisms in the applicant establishes only that she unfortunately fell within a small number of persons who suffer such a complication.  199               In any event the applicant’s case, apart from reliance upon the chip, is not based upon the general quality of the valve but upon what she was told about it after implant. In some cases a failure to warn might render a product defective in the sense spoken of in the subsection. Without a warning or instruction its use might be unsafe. A warning might be necessary to remove some inherent dangerous quality. A warning of the risk and rate of risk of thromboembolism despite anticoagulation could have no such effect here. Assuming however that the concept of goods being defective is much wider, and extends to any warning relevant to a person’s informed choice, this does not avail the applicant. The decision to have the valve has been made at the point when she receives the booklet. The applicant does not and cannot allege that the failure to warn afterwards was causally connected to the injuries she sustained save that she may have sought further advice.  200               The chip on the valve can be considered a defect. The first question which arises with respect to it is whether it could itself cause the development of a thrombus which then broke away from the valve, travelled through the applicant’s system and caused the infarcts and stroke from which most, if not all, of her injuries are alleged to stem.  201               Some evidence suggests that there is a theoretical possibility that a chip such as this could cause a thrombus to develop. Had that been the case one would have observed at explant a localised build-up of material at the site of the chip, whereas here it was quite generalised across the whole surface of the valve. Professor Brandwood did not disagree with this and conceded that one would expect a concentration of clotting at the site of a chip. Professor Brandwood’s hypothesis accepts that the thrombus is widespread across the valve. He considered that there is evidence that at explant it was greater and more concentrated near the hinge which is close to the site of the chip. This is to be derived from the evidence of Dr Mahon’s notation and the observations of Dr Titus.  202               Doctor Mahon was not called as a witness and Dr Titus was not questioned on this topic. The observation that a thrombus first develops, or develops to a greater extent, in the hinge area is unreasonable. It does not take the matter of the possible relationship with a chip in the area very far. Even if it be accepted as likely that a thrombus first formed in the hinge area, this does not establish that the chip was the cause of it. A thrombus is more likely to be created because of the effects on the movement of blood through that area. Professor Brandwood’s thesis concerning the build up in the hinge area requires that it be substantial and such as would impede the movement of the leaflets and create the spread of the thrombus across the whole of the valve. Professor Hirsh however explained that if the movement of the leaflets had been so impeded the adverse effects upon the applicant would have been noticeable and serious, approaching heart failure. Further, one would have expected to see some indication of the problem in the echocardiograms which were taken.  203               The development of a thrombus because of the chip found on the leaflet of the St Jude Medical valve in question is a scientific possibility. There is however no scientific literature or other evidence which can elevate it to a higher level. The observations made of the valve on explant suggest to the contrary. The applicant therefore cannot establish that the chip was the cause of the thromboembolic events she suffered from.  204               There remains the question whether the chip was present at the time of supply to the first respondent, on the assumption that the evidence did establish causation. This has been the subject of considerable evidence.  205               Professors Brandwood and Williams are at least agreed that of the three possible mechanisms by which a chip could be caused the more likely is local physical impact. Professor Brandwood considers that the only periods in which it could have been caused were during manufacture and assembly or during post-explantation handling associated with testing. He did not explain why he initially discounted the latter and later conceded it was also a possibility. His view would appear to be based upon the prospect that Ms Smentek had not completely examined each aspect of the surfaces. This conclusion is arrived at because her recording of the photographs was not full and it could not be said that she photographed each ear of the disassembled valve. This failure on her part may have removed the confirmation of her visual inspection at 10x magnification which the photographs provided. It cannot in my view be said to follow that her examination and the record of it is to be taken as wholly unreliable. There is therefore evidence that the valve leaflet, viewed in a disassembled state, did not disclose a chip prior to the analysis by Mr Long using a scanning electron microscope. As against that it should be added that the hypothesis favoured by some of the other witnesses, namely that the chip occurred when it was disassembled post-explant, would have the chip present when Ms Smentek viewed it. There remains the possibility however that it occurred between the time Ms Smentek undertook her examination and packaged it for testing and when the further testing by Mr Long was undertaken.  206               Accepting for present purposes that there may have been some difficulty in viewing the chip on the valve leaflet in its assembled state, the only other occasion when its component parts were viewed and examined was prior to initial assembly. Professor Brandwood suggests the possibility that the chip occurred during the reworking process, but does not put it at higher than a possibility. It is clearly a hypothesis which is unsupported by evidence. There was no criticism made of the procedures for testing, reworking and re-testing prior to assembly. Mr Monaghan’s evidence is that the reworking took place in an especially clean environment. It is not possible to infer that a hard particle was likely to have been present during the reworking of the leaflet surface or that the pressure involved in the cleaning would have created this chip. The evidence simply does not permit it. Moreover the theory does not take account of the further visual examination at 7x magnification after reworking. No defect was then recorded.  207               The defence under s 75AK(1)(a) requires that it be shown that the defect found in the goods did not exist at the time they passed from the manufacturer’s control. It does not require the manufacturer to establish that it occurred at a later time, although if this were possible it would obviously deny the earlier existence of the defect. The first respondent cannot establish as a fact that the chip occurred during or subsequent to Ms Smentek’s examination, although they would appear to be the most likely of the scenarios. The number of examinations prior to the scanning electron microscope examination, at which such a chip would have been visible under the magnifications used, strongly suggests the absence of a chip up to this point.  208               The evidence of the examinations of the valve’s component parts prior to assembly establishes the likelihood that any chip present would have been detected. The prospect of a chip being created in the reworking process is only a hypothesis. The evidence concerning the process does not point to it as a very likely prospect. In any event it cannot stand the detailed records of examinations after the rework and the many examinations undertaken after explant. The first respondent would therefore succeed on its defence.  209               It is not necessary to deal with the first respondent’s alternative defence, that the applicant brings this action outside the period limited for its commencement, but I make the following observations. It is accepted that the applicant did not have actual knowledge of the existence of the chip until 26 June 2003. The first respondent’s point is that the applicant could have known of it earlier had she followed up on her request to have tests conducted on the valve released to her for that purpose. It is to be noted however that it is most unlikely that St Jude Medical Inc would have released the valve, but it may be that it would have agreed to testing in conjunction with the applicant if a protocol had been agreed. The difficulty with the defence is that it assumes that the chip was in existence and available to be discovered by 13 March 1998. The evidence does not establish this.  (b) The claim under s 74B 210               Section 74B provides that a manufacturer, which includes a deemed manufacturer, is liable to compensate a consumer who acquires goods which are not reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were acquired and suffers loss or damage by reason that they were not reasonably fit for that purpose.  211               The purpose which the applicant says should be seen as accompanying her acquisition of the St Jude Medical valve was to replace her damaged natural mitral heart valve and provide, for life, an effective, safe, functioning mitral heart valve. She alleges that it was not fit for this purpose because it caused her to suffer injury despite her being on anticoagulant drugs, and it contained a chip. My findings as to the presence of the chip at the time of supply and as to whether it could be regarded as causative of the thromboembolisms exclude the latter allegation.  212               This is not a case where the purpose was made known to the manufacturer. Given that the only purpose of the valve is to replace damaged natural mitral valves it would not seem to be necessary that there be communication. In such a case the manufacturer’s knowledge may be assumed: Grant v Australian Knitting Mills, Ltd (1936) AC 85at 99. The St Jude Medical valve cannot however be regarded as unfit for that purpose because there was a known risk that thromboembolisms might develop and cause injury of the kind the applicant suffered. The applicant has identified only that she fell within the category of persons who develop such a complication. The question whether goods which have a use are reasonably fit for it must be assessed not only by reference to the fact that they failed to accomplish their purpose, but also by reference to what a consumer could reasonably expect from the goods.  213               The evidence here clearly establishes that the risk in question was well known to medical practitioners. The applicant was advised of this risk, as I later discuss. In my view, for the reasons I give later it could not therefore have been reasonable for the applicant to expect that there was no prospect that the valve would cause the development of thrombi. This claim is not made out.  214               The first respondent additionally relies upon the fact that, on the applicant’s own evidence, she knew of the risk when she received Prof Hughes’ report dated 13 February 1998. Her claim is therefore statute-barred. The evidence however is that the applicant did not receive the report until 25 March 1998. This defence is not made out.  (c) The claim for breach of duty 215               The first respondent’s threshold contention is that any action under the common law is not available to the applicant because the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) should be seen as the only source of liability for manufacturers of goods. The submission rests upon the doctrine of ‘pre-emption’ developed in the United States, referred to in Perre v Apand Pty Ltd (1999) 198 CLR 180at 247 and more recently in Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan (2002) 211 CLR 540at 591 (‘Graham Barclay Oysters’). Sections 75 and 75AR provide that nothing in Parts V and VA shall affect any right or remedy that a person would have had if those Parts had not been enacted. Gummow and Hayne JJ in Graham Barclay Oysters however considered that the question whether alternative claims could be made in negligence and under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth)was an open one, and one not yet considered by the High Court (at 591). In view of my findings on the facts of this case it is not however necessary for me to further consider this question.  216               The first breach of duty alleged is that the first respondent supplied a valve which was not fit for the purpose for which it was supplied. My findings in connexion with the claim under s 74B apply here. No breach is established.  217               The third alleged breach is one of failure, on the part of the first respondent, to warn the second and third respondents of the need to warn the applicant of the risks of using the St Jude Medical valve including the risk of thromboembolism despite anticoagulants. If it were necessary to do so, the Physician’s Reference Manual conveyed this warning to the third respondent. In any event, like other practitioners in their field, the second and third respondents were well aware of the risks and did not need instruction. This claim fails.  218               The remaining allegation is that a failure to warn the applicant herself of the risks constitutes a breach of the first respondent’s duty of care owed to her. The first respondent responds that no such duty was owed to the applicant. It relies upon the defence of the provision of advice or warnings to ‘learned intermediaries’, to which reference was also made in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Trade Practices Amendment Bill 1992 (Cth).  219               The effect of a ‘learned intermediary’ upon a manufacturer’s duty has been the subject of considerable case law in the United States. In Sterling Drug, Inc. v Cornish 370 F.2d 82 (8th Cir 1966)the term was used in relation to a physician who acted as a liaison between patient and drug manufacturer. The content of the manufacturer’s duty was to warn prescribing physicians. The doctrine has since been extended to medical device cases: Phelps v Sherwood Medical Industries 836 F.2d 296 (7th Cir 1987)(which involved the manufacturer of a heart catheter) and Brooks v Medtronic, Inc. 750 F.2d 1227 (4th Cir 1984)(a cardiac pacemaker). It has been explained that the reason for describing the duty in this way is because it is a physician’s duty to remain abreast of product characteristics and to decide which facts should be told to the patient. Once adequate warnings are given to the physician, the choice of treatment and the duty to disclose properly fall upon the doctor. And it has been held in Australia that the duty to warn rests with the treating physician not the manufacturer or distributor: see H v Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children (1990) Aust Torts Reports 81-000.  220               In my view it is not necessary to resort to the doctrine. The risks were well known to doctors and the second and third respondents in fact conveyed this to the applicant. If there be a duty owed to the applicant as alleged any failure to warn her could have no effect, given the information she received from others.  2. THE LIABILITY OF THE SECOND AND third respondentS 221               The law imposes upon a medical practitioner a duty to exercise reasonable care and skill in the provision of professional advice. The standard of reasonable care and skill required is that of the ordinary skilled person exercising and professing to have that special skill: Rogers v Whitaker (1992) 175 CLR 479at 483 (‘Rogers’). In the provision of relevant information the skill is not so much medical as it is in communicating the relevant information to the patient in terms which they are likely to understand: Rogers at 490. The Courts, in adjudicating on what was necessary to be said, give weight to the fact that a person is entitled to make their own decisions as to whether they will accept the treatment proposed: Rogers at 487 and at 486, referring with approval to the judgment of Lord Scarman in Sidaway v Govenors of Bethlem Royal Hospital [1985] AC 871at 876. The question whether a patient would have declined the treatment or taken another course, which is necessary to be addressed in connexion with causation, is to be approached subjectively and from their perspective, not objectively: Ellis v Wallsend District Hospital (1989) 17 NSWLR 553at 559, 580-582. This approach is consistent with the observations made in Rogers as to the relevance of the advice to a patient’s decision-making.  222               Their Honours in Rogers (at 490) agreed with King CJ in F v R (1983) 33 SASR 189at 192-193, that the amount of information or advice which a careful and responsible doctor would disclose would depend upon a number of factors including the nature of the treatment, the desire of the patient for information and the health of the patient. Their Honours went on (at 490):  ‘The law should recognize that a doctor has a duty to warn a patient of a material risk inherent in the proposed treatment; a risk is material if, in the circumstances of the particular case, a reasonable person in the patient’s position, if warned of the risk, would be likely to attach significance to it or if the medical practitioner is or should reasonably be aware that the particular patient, if warned of the risk, would be likely to attach significance to it. This duty is subject to the therapeutic privilege.’   223               No issue here arises concerning privilege from providing the necessary information.  224               In the present case it was necessary that the applicant be told of the risks associated with the surgery itself, including the risk that repair of her mitral valve might not be possible. It was necessary that she be apprised of the procedure which would be undertaken in that event including the implant of a prosthetic valve. The risk of thromboembolism occurring, because of the possibility of clots forming on a valve, and the consequent risk of stroke and other complications had to be explained to her. It would follow that she would need to be advised of the need to take anticoagulants for life and what this might mean to her. I do not understand the second and third respondents to deny their duty extended to these advices. I do not however consider that it was necessary that the applicant be advised of the rate of risk of thromboembolisms developing on a St Jude Medical or other mechanical valve. A patient would need to know that the risk is a real one, but I do not think reference to statistics such as 2 to 5 per cent would inform them further in any meaningful way . 225               I have had some doubt that it would be necessary to advise a patient about tissue valves where a doctor would not recommend it and indeed is likely to be wholly opposed to it in the case of a young patient who is able to have a mechanical valve and to take anticoagulants. The evidence suggests that if a young patient made a wrong choice, for a tissue valve, they would be counselled. I took this to mean counselled until persuaded to a contrary view. It is not clear though whether a surgeon would proceed to implant it if the patient remained firm as to their choice.  226               Most of the medical witnesses said that it is their practice to usually provide information about tissue valves. Whilst this is not conclusive of there being a legal obligation to do so, it may show that they recognise that there is some element of choice for the patient. It may be inferred that they wish patients to be well-informed. Further, there are both advantages and disadvantages to each of the types of valves. Whilst doctors may seek to influence a young person’s choice, the choice remains the patient’s. In these circumstances it seems to me, on further reflection, that advices concerning tissue valves, the advantages and the disadvantages should also be given.  227               So far as concerns treatments such as nerve blocks it seems to me that a doctor or surgeon ought to enquire of a patient whether they are intending to have further surgery or treatment, where an intended drug regime is likely to have an effect upon surgery or treatment. The question which arises in this case is whether anticoagulants do prevent such treatment being undertaken. I shall return to it later in these reasons.  228               On 20 May 1996 the second respondent was not referring the applicant for surgery. He was arranging more tests and arranging to review her condition in six months. It was only when she later rang and, in effect, demanded surgery, that he agreed to that course. In these circumstances it must be considered as possible that he did not discuss the surgery in any detail or discuss what would happen if repair was not possible. There are a number of factors however which suggest that he did so.  229               If, as he noted and advised her general practitioner, he spoke of the ‘pros and cons’ of surgery it is likely that he discussed the prospect that the repair might be unsuccessful. It is difficult to imagine that a cardiologist would not. The evidence shows that it is a known risk, especially with a prolapse of the mitral valve of the kind that the applicant was suffering from. If he did so, he must surely have mentioned the only alternative - the implant of a prosthetic valve. He may however have done so in terms of the valve being replaced, rather than discussing a prosthetic valve. The terms of his letter of referral of 13 June 1996 suggest this. That may account for the applicant and her husband failing to appreciate just what was involved until the consultation with the third respondent. I add that the fact of that advice by the third respondent would negate any causal effect of a failure on the part of the second respondent to himself advise the applicant. 230               The letter of referral stands as strong evidence of what was said by the second respondent to the applicant and her husband. It is sufficiently close enough in time to 20 May 1996 to stand as a reliable record of what the second respondent had discussed. It gives the impression that he is recalling his conversation with her as he writes. The second respondent is not likely to have conveyed a conversation which he did not actually recall.  231               It may be taken from the letter that the second respondent discussed the possibility that the valve may need to be replaced and the need for anticoagulant drugs. Just how much detail was provided and whether the second respondent provided explanations by sketches or otherwise is less certain. It is not however necessary to determine the complete content of his advices. The issues raised by the applicant require only an additional consideration as to what advices he may have given about the risk of complications such as stroke.  232               It would not appear that the second respondent advised the applicant that the risk of the development of thromboembolisms, associated with a mechanical valve or the St Jude Medical valve, was between 2 to 5 per cent, as the applicant alleges he should have. He did not know which valve the third respondent would choose and says that he did not therefore discuss the percentage risks of blood clot formation on the valve and the risks of failure of anticoagulation. The risks of complications of which he spoke, and put at between 4 to 5 per cent, related to the surgery itself. However I do not consider the second respondent was obliged to furnish such advice, for the reasons I have given. 233               I do not consider it likely that the applicant’s nerve block treatment was discussed at the meeting with the second respondent on 20 May 1996. There would seem to me no reason why the applicant would raise it. There was no need to. She would not connect it as relevant to anticoagulant therapies. The prospect that the applicant just happened to mention that nerve block had resolved her neck and back pain to a significant degree and that she was looking forward to getting on with her life is not high. Her evidence in this respect suggests reconstruction when she later discovered that Dr Finch would not allow her to have further nerve blocks. 234               I accept however that the applicant and her husband did not appreciate fully what they were told by the second respondent. The fact that they were still speaking of a transplant when they came to see the third respondent tends to support this, although they might have been referring to the implantation of a prosthetic valve. The evidence is not clear. When they saw the third respondent they appeared to be of the firm belief that the applicant was to undergo mitral valve repair surgery. The applicant had been convinced of this and that the surgery would resolve her symptoms for some time, and they are likely to have been focussed upon it. This may explain, in part, why they did not absorb the information the second respondent was providing. Another factor would appear to be that the consultation with the second respondent was relatively short, even on his account of what was discussed.  235               The third respondent is, in my view, likely to have said that there was a real possibility that he would be unable to repair the applicant’s mitral valve. He had every reason to ensure that she understood this. I accept that it would not be in a surgeon’s interest to have a patient facing serious surgery unaware of this. Further there seems no reason to doubt the third respondent’s evidence that any surgeon would have warned her of the risk given that she had a prolapse of both leaflets which rendered the risk of failure higher. To have referred to it as a ‘slight chance’ would be inconsistent with the opinion the third respondent held. The third respondent, I accept, stated the risk at 20 per cent, a figure which he regarded as high. The applicant may not however have appreciated that.  236               Accepting that the prospect that the applicant’s mitral valve might need to be replaced with a prosthetic valve was discussed, one would have expected the second respondent and the third respondent to discuss the regime of anticoagulant drug therapy which would then be necessary. It was life-long, required management and some lifestyle changes. Were a female patient to take the drugs she would be advised not to have children. These are matters which would call for discussion by a treating doctor or surgeon. I have accepted that the second respondent discussed anticoagulants, although the evidence as to the extent of the discussion was not clear. The evidence of the applicant and her husband shows that the need for her to take drugs for life and the effect on her ability to have children was discussed with the third respondent. What they have not recalled is the content of the advices and the context in which the question about having children was put to them.  237               I accept the third respondent’s evidence that he spoke of the mechanical mitral valve as more likely to form clots and therefore necessitate the taking of anticoagulants or ‘blood-thinning drugs’. He had every reason to advise a patient of these matters. It is difficult to imagine why he would not. 238               The evidence of the applicant and her husband concerning their understanding of what the third respondent was telling them about the drugs she would need to take is somewhat confusing. She said that, at the time of the consultation with the third respondent, the applicant and her husband assumed that the drugs were to stop her body rejecting the valve. But they also say that the third respondent told them rejection was not an issue, so this could not be a basis for their understanding about the drugs. It may suggest reconstruction about what they thought. Then the applicant said that she did not know she was taking anticoagulant drugs until the nurse told her after she cut herself whilst in hospital some days after surgery. She said that she then appreciated that this was what the third respondent had been talking about, which suggests perhaps that there was more said by the third respondent which she was then able to recall. And she said that at the time of the conversation with the nurse she appreciated that clots could form and travel through her system. The applicant attributed this to the Patient Booklet which presumably she had read. The booklet did not refer to clots moving through a person’s system. If she had read the booklet she would however have appreciated that she was likely to have been prescribed anticoagulant drugs.  239               I also consider it unlikely that neither the applicant nor her husband would not have enquired about the purpose and nature of the drugs at the consultation. This is especially the case so far as concerns the applicant. It is also unlikely that the applicant suddenly discovered she was taking them post-operatively and made no mention of it to, nor made an enquiry of, either the second respondent or third respondent.  240               I accept that the third respondent did discuss the different types of valves and their advantages and disadvantages before enquiring of the applicant and her husband whether they intended to have children. That enquiry by the third respondent was brought about because anticoagulants would be necessary if a mechanical valve were used. It is likely to have arisen in the context of a discussion about mechanical valves. The third respondent is also likely to have discussed the alternative of a tissue valve, in my view. Whilst he was going to recommend a mechanical valve, and he may therefore have spent only a little time discussing tissue valves, I see no reason to doubt that he did discuss tissue valves. He customarily did so and there were good reasons for such a practice. There is some support for a conclusion that it was likely to be his practice from the evidence of the practice of other surgeons.  241               Given that the third respondent did provide advices concerning tissue valves, any failure on the second respondent’s part to do so has played no part in the applicant’s choice or her ability to understand the types of valves prior to surgery. The second respondent also contended that he was under no duty to advise about different types of valves as he was not sure which the surgeon would recommend. This would not have prevented him from discussing generally mechanical and tissue valves, but he says that he knew that their respective advantages and disadvantages would be discussed by the third respondent. It seems to me however that if there was a choice to be made about valves and they carried different risks he was under a duty to advise of them. He could not assume the advice would be given by the third respondent. Any omission on his part to do so has however had no effect upon the applicant’s choice or understanding about the valves. She had the necessary advice from the third respondent.  242               I do not consider the applicant or her husband to have a complete or accurate recollection of what was conveyed at either consultation, although they recall some particular advices. Mr Hazell in particular seemed to recall little of what was said. The applicant did not recall the second respondent’s fairly firm advice that repair surgery was not likely to resolve her symptoms. She construed his advice in a selective way to be that not all her symptoms would be resolved. Similarly the applicant discounted the advice the third respondent gave her about the possibility that repair might not be possible. She appears to have been convinced that it would. The applicant and her husband have recalled elements of the third respondent’s advice but not the detail and not the sequence in which it was given. In particular they did not recall the connexion between anticoagulants, mechanical valves and childbirth. They did not recall either the second respondent or third respondent speaking about anticoagulant drugs when they almost certainly would have done so. When prompted in cross-examination the applicant was able to recall some further topics. Their evidence suffers from the further difficulty that they have discussed it with each other over a long period of time. I substantially discount Mr Hazell’s evidence as corroboration for that reason. The applicant and her husband may have convinced themselves that many things were not discussed, but I am unable to have confidence in their recollection.  243               It was submitted for the applicant that she and her husband were more likely to have a memory of what was said because the consultations were important to them, and were ‘one-off events’, as compared with the second respondent and the third respondent who had no reason in particular to recall the occasions. The consultations were obviously of importance to the applicant and her husband. It may be accepted that they were concerned, if not anxious, although the applicant was quite determined to have surgery. It does not follow that they took in all of what was said to them. Indeed they recalled little of the January consultation, which was also important.  244               The consultation with the third respondent was more lengthy than the applicant and her husband recall, in my view. Even the topics which they recall being discussed would have taken longer to discuss than the fifteen to twenty minutes they refer to. It is more likely to have taken the hour that the third respondent says it did. The advice was detailed and much of the information was new to the applicant and her husband. It is quite possible in such circumstances that they recall only those parts which were of importance to them and which they understood. The fact that the applicant was so focussed on the surgical repair of her mitral valve is also likely to have affected this process.  245               It was also submitted for the second and third respondents that the applicant made no complaint of their lack of advice until these proceedings were brought and expressed no surprise when she found herself with the implanted valve and on a life-long regime of anticoagulant drugs. I would usually be cautious about drawing too much from the fact of lack of complaint from a person such as a patient to their doctor. In the case of the applicant however she is an intelligent and confident woman. She has had a lengthy medical history and has some medical knowledge. She does not present as a person likely to be daunted by the position or authority of medical specialists and she has shown herself to be quite capable of voicing her opinion or criticism and demanding corrections of the second respondent. In these circumstances it seems to me most unlikely that the applicant would have remained silent if she felt that she had not been properly advised.  246               At the time the applicant wrote to the second respondent in February 1998, in effect terminating his services, she had not received Prof Hughes’ advice about the rate of risk of thromboembolism. When she did receive it she says that she thought to herself that she had not been advised of this. She was now aware of the effects and lifestyle changes brought about by anticoagulants and she knew about the alternative of tissue valves. She made no mention of the lack of advice she had received on these matters. In the letter she wrote to Dr Hands in December 1998 she made no mention of them. By then she also knew about the rate of risk of thromboembolism associated with mechanical valves. If she had some sensitivity about giving the true basis for her case against the second and third respondents to Dr Hands, a matter which I should add she did not raise, it is difficult to understand why the applicant did not make some complaint to the second or third respondent directly. It may be inferred from the letter that the main target of her intended litigation was St Jude Medical Inc and that she believed by this point that the problem had been with its valve. There is nothing to suggest that the applicant and her husband were focussed upon claims against the second and third respondents at this time. This is likely to have had the consequence that they did not attempt to recall the content of conversations with them until a point closer to the commencement of proceedings. Their recollection is therefore likely to be impaired.  247               The second and third respondents’ evidence is in part, and perhaps even a substantial part, based upon their practice in advising patients. The third respondent at least however impressed me with a reasonably clear independent recollection of his consultation with the applicant. Reliance upon their customary advice to patients facing surgery of this kind does not seem to me to be poorly based. It may be accepted that a cardiologist, and perhaps even more so a surgeon, would have a mental list of matters that they would ensure they discussed. It is in their own interests that a patient is made aware of the prospect of an implant being necessary and what this would involve. They were well aware of the rate of risks of complications and what anticoagulant therapy means to the lifestyle of a patient. It does not seem sensible to me that they would make no mention of these matters to a patient.  248               The applicant’s allegation that she was not told that there was a risk that repair of her mitral valve might not be possible is not made out. Both the second respondent and third respondent brought this to the attention of the applicant and her husband and the third respondent emphasised it. Indeed the applicant’s evidence on the point was not that no mention was made, but that it was made only in passing by the third respondent. If that is her recollection it is faulty and explained perhaps by her focus upon having a successful repair operation.  249               Similarly the applicant’s allegation that she was not advised of the risk of clotting and stroke and the need for anticoagulants is not established. I have found that both the second respondent and third respondent did so and the third respondent in some detail. What the respondents’ evidence does not however establish is that the rate of risk was of the order of 2 to 5 per cent. I have however held that their duty to advise did not extend to this detail. I do not consider the information would have meant much to a patient. I have also found that the third respondent is likely to have discussed tissue valves with the applicant and her husband.  250               Neither the second respondent nor third respondent made an enquiry of the applicant which would have revealed her intention to have further nerve block treatment. In my view it was not necessary for them to do so. The evidence does not establish that the taking of anticoagulant drugs is a contra-indication to treatment such as nerve blocks or surgery. Whilst a treating doctor might be more circumspect, the withdrawal of anticoagulants for a short time can be managed without significant risk of bleeding or clotting. Whilst Dr Finch holds his view that nerve blocks should not be undertaken on the applicant, the majority of the medical witnesses had not experienced difficulties in managing risks in other patients. And it will be recalled that the applicant had undertaken this process when she had her second valve implant and when she had her hysterectomy. It is not to be expected that a doctor would have advised the applicant that she would be unable to have surgery in the future or treatment such as a nerve block. Neither the second respondent nor the third respondent were therefore obliged to do so. They may have been under a duty to advise that surgery carried additional risks and would require a change in her drug regime but the third respondent did convey this to the applicant.  251               The applicant’s case against the second respondent and third respondent for failure to advise or warn of material risks fails. It is nevertheless necessary to consider what the applicant would have done had she been fully aware of what she was being told. The applicant says that she would have chosen a tissue valve even if it was not recommended. It is difficult however to accept that she would have done so when told of the need for continual replacement of a tissue valve, with an increasing risk to her life on each re-operation, when a mechanical valve might not need replacement in her lifetime. The applicant says herself that she was afraid of the second operation and she is now fearful of re-operations.  252               The perceived benefits that the applicant says she would have taken into account are misconceived and would not have been the subject of advices to her. She would not have been told that nerve block treatment would not be possible if she took anticoagulants. And the advice would not have been that the implant of a tissue valve unaccompanied by anticoagulant drugs carries a risk significantly less for a person than would be the case if they had a mechanical valve and anticoagulants. The only advantage which would have been conveyed to her would be that she may not need to take anticoagulant drugs. But the applicant’s belief that she is unable to undertake a number of activities because she is on anticoagulants is also largely erroneous. The medical evidence is that the taking of anticoagulants means only that she should exercise care.  253               Regard must be had to what a person says they would have done. This issue is not to be approached on the basis of what a reasonable person would have done. Nevertheless the applicant’s case is unrealistic. In my view the applicant has reached the views she holds because of her experience with the thromboembolisms. She is unable to place herself in a position where she is exercising a choice prior to surgery and when she would have been told that there was some risk of thromboembolism developing and stroke. Even if she had been told it was between 2 to 5 per cent this would not have added much to the warning. There was nothing at that point to indicate that she had any predisposition to clotting or that her INR levels would be difficult to maintain.  254               The applicant’s case against each of the second and third respondents is not made out.  3. THE APPLICANT’S INJURIES 255               Although no respondent has been found to be liable, it is necessary for me to deal with what injuries were suffered by the applicant as a result of the thromboembolisms which emanated from the St Jude Medical valve.  256               The applicant suffered two infarcts to her spleen and kidney and a midbrain stroke as a result of thromboembolisms. Doctor Kermode is also of the view that she may have suffered further thromboembolic events prior to her stroke but these resolved without injury. The infarcts did not produce any residual disability and the applicant made a good recovery from the stroke. Doctor Kermode however considers that the stroke has now predisposed her to an increase in the frequency and severity of her diplopia and has produced mild impairment to her equilibrium, different from the disequilibrium she had previously experienced.  257               The applicant has clearly suffered from diplopia for many years. The applicant gave evidence that what she had reported to medical practitioners prior to the implantation of the mechanical valve as double vision was actually blurred vision and that the nature of this condition changed after her stroke. Doctor Kermode’s evidence does not support this. He said that when he saw her prior to her first stroke she gave a good description of true diplopia. Further the applicant herself appears to have drawn the distinction between blurred and double vision on occasions when she reported her symptoms to the neurologists over the years. And it is difficult to accept that what was recorded by the neurologist as diplopia or double vision is instead blurred vision, especially in the absence of any evidence from Dr Gubbay and others. If patients can confuse the descriptions of the two conditions and neurologists know this, it would seem to me likely that neurologists would be careful to ascertain just what a patient was reporting. Further there is no evidence to explain the change in the state of the applicant’s vision since the stroke. This aspect of the applicant’s evidence does not reflect well upon her credit.  258               The symptoms from which the applicant suffers which appear to have the most impact upon her is her fainting, or feeling that she may faint, combined with fatigue. There is however no evidence which connects these symptoms to the injuries sustained by the applicant as a result of the thromboembolisms or to the need for the second operation. Indeed the applicant’s case was characterised by an absence of medical evidence as to her present medical state and the cause of her symptoms. It appears to rely largely upon her own evidence. It is however plain that she has suffered these symptoms for many years prior to the events in question, at least since 1987, albeit that their cause does not appear to have been determined despite the second respondent conducting tests from time to time. The applicant appears to have believed that her fatigue at least would be resolved by the repair to her mitral valve, although the second respondent counselled her against such a hope.  259               The applicant’s disequilibrium and problems with incoordination, headaches and vision disturbances including diplopia are shown to have a cause, but it is not associated with her heart nor the effects of the St Jude Medical valve. They most likely stem from a type of migraine condition. The applicant has suffered from diplopia since 1987 and has had intermittent episodes of disequilibrium since she was 18 years old.  260               It may also be accepted that the applicant suffered splinter haemorrhages after the first implant, but the evidence does not make it clear whether they are linked to the thromboembolisms. The evidence relating to the dangers of replacement surgery provides some support for the allegation that the applicant has sustained some adverse effects to her heart because she had to have a second operation. This might affect the extent to which she is at further risk when she has to have further surgery and it may affect her life expectancy. It is not clear. There is no evidence to support the contention that she suffered an occluded left vertebral artery as a result of the thromboembolisms. The evidence is that it is constitutional in nature. There is no evidence as to partial occlusion of the right vertebral artery. The applicant did suffer pericarditis after the tissue valve was implanted. It has not however been established that this was due to the aftermath of the implant of the mechanical valve.  261               The applicant suffered arrhythmia prior to her surgery but no cause was determined for this condition. There is no evidence linking the arrhythmia she suffers now to the thromboembolisms or surgery. I notice that an article in the Physician’s Reference Manual refers to patients with mechanical valves suffering from arrhythmia on occasions and it may be that this is the case with tissue valves. No witness however referred to the cause of the applicant’s condition or connected it with the injuries she suffered.  262               The applicant felt depressed following her hysterectomy in April 1997 and received some counselling. This aspect of the applicant’s case, that her hysterectomy was causally related to the mechanical mitral valve, is based upon her taking anticoagulant drugs which caused her excessive menstrual bleeding, which in turn led to the need for a hysterectomy. There was some evidence that when she suffered from menorrhagia in April 1997 it was thought that the combination of Warfarin and another drug were contributing to or causing it. This is not however sufficient to establish that Warfarin was the cause of her condition and the need for surgery. She had suffered from this condition in the past and before she took anticoagulants. 263               It follows in my view that the applicant’s inability to undertake many activities, household tasks and her inability to work are not causally connected to the effects of the stroke. The symptoms which render her unable to work and enjoy life are largely pre-existing conditions of either undetermined cause or attributed to her migraine condition. To those symptoms need to be added the effects of the injuries to the applicant’s neck and back from the motor vehicle accidents.  264               In addition to the pain and suffering caused to the applicant by the thromboembolic events the applicant required hospitalisation on two occasions. It may be accepted that she was very anxious at their occurrence. Although she made a good recovery from the stroke she may experience more severe diplopia and experience it more often. Her balance is mildly impaired. In all, I would have assessed the applicant’s damages under this head at $40,000.00.  4. economic loss 265               It follows from my findings as to the extent of the injuries suffered by the applicant as a result of the thromboembolic events, and what causes her inability to work, that she has not suffered any substantial loss of earnings or earning capacity. The infarcts and stroke resulted in hospitalisation and required a period for recovery in which time the applicant was not able to work. That work was however limited to ten hours per week for her husband’s firm. The applicant now undertakes that work and also works for her brother’s company for about the same number of hours.  266               There is no basis shown for attributing the applicant’s inability to earn other than a limited income to the problems which arose from the implant of the St Jude Medical valve. I should however make some observations on the evidence concerning her capacity to earn, assuming for present purposes that she would have been fit to work if those events had not occurred.  267               There are two aspects to the claim that she would be able to earn of the order of $500,000.00 as an Investment Development Manager. The first concerns her experience and ability to do so, the second concerns the reliability of the evidence concerning what she might earn in such a position.  268               The respondents submitted that the applicant’s background and limited exposure to financial transactions at this level would not suggest that she would be able to undertake this role and, I infer, that she would not be likely to be offered a position in her brother’s company to do so. I do not think that her lack of experience would be a complete bar. The applicant is a very intelligent and confident woman. She was able to successfully complete part of a degree in commerce. She has an understanding of business. The role of investment managers did not seem to me to involve complex concepts and the transactions are readily understandable. The applicant did not strike me as unable to undertake them. The role of such a person, at least at the level of a consultant such as Mr Beck, obviously requires more than an understanding of how transactions work. There needs to be an ability to communicate with clients and to persuade them. The applicant has obtained investors for her brother and for others in the past. I do not therefore discount the prospect that she could successfully undertake this role  269               Mr Beck’s income does not in my view furnish a very reliable basis as to what the applicant might earn in a position in her brother’s company. There was no suggestion that she would undertake a business such as Mr Beck’s. He has considerable experience and his business involves many clients. Even so, I observe that his earnings, at a level referable to that spoken of by Mr Carey, have not been earned over a long period and he has earned less at some points. And, whilst her brother gave evidence of a figure of $500,000.00 as capable of being earned, no evidence was led as to what investment managers within the company in fact earn. His evidence, of earnings of $1m and in one case much more, related to persons external to the company and whose work might extend beyond Westpoint’s investors. The fact that no evidence was called confirms me in the view which I formed, that the figure to which Mr Carey referred is not reliable and is one which has been chosen to advance the applicant’s interests rather than reflecting what is reasonably achievable. I am confirmed in that view by the fact that in the litigation arising out of the motor vehicle accidents the applicant and her brother did not suggest that she would earn more than $40,000.00. That figure is likely to be somewhat higher now. Neither of them however explained how the much more lucrative position within the company was not earlier thought of by them, if such a position exists and persons are earning the sums spoken of. I take it that I am intended to infer from Mr Carey’s statement that there has been some expansion of Westpoint’s business which has allowed for this, but I do not consider it a satisfactory explanation. When the applicant’s original claim, for just over $7.8m for economic loss based upon commissions related to individual products, was not sought to be proved Mr Carey provided the figure of $500,000.00 as that which she might earn in his company. This does not give me confidence in his evidence. I assess the amount she would have earned, by reference to the figures used in the earlier litigation, at $50,000.00 per annum.  270               The applicant’s alternative case was that she could have undertaken the role of Operations Manager in addition to the role she presently undertakes and for which she receives $52,000.00. On her case she would earn another $77,480.00 although there is no documentary record of these salaries. I accept that if she were well she would be capable of undertaking both roles, but I do not have confidence that she would be paid in the order of $120,000.00 for it. The position she presently occupies has apparently been created for her by her brother in the course of litigation and relatively close to trial. It is difficult to accept that most employers would pay $52,000.00 for ten hours work in such a role. In the absence of other evidence to suggest this figure and a combined figure for the two roles as realistic, I do not accept the evidence.  271               The only other claim was with respect to domestic expenses. There was no evidence which would permit an assessment of them.  e. summary and orders 272               The applicant has been unable to establish liability in any of the respondents. So far as concerns the first respondent it has not been shown that the St Jude Medical valve was defective or unfit for its known purpose. The first respondent did not otherwise breach a duty of care owed to the applicant under the common law, assuming that such a claim remains open to her. The necessary advices about the prospect of a prosthetic valve being necessary, the risks associated with it and the need for a lifetime regime of anticoagulant drugs were provided by the second or third respondents. If it was necessary to advise the applicant of the alternative of a tissue valve, the third respondent did so. The applicant was therefore sufficiently informed. In any event I do not accept that she would have elected to have a tissue valve and not a mechanical valve. Almost all of the applicant’s present symptoms and inability to work are caused by her pre-existing conditions. Had she established liability her damages would be limited.  273               The application will be dismissed with costs.       I certify that the preceding two hundred and seventy-three (273) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Kiefel.        Associate:   Dated: 6 July 2004         Counsel for the Applicant:   Mr BHK Donovan QC with Mr CP Shanahan                Solicitor for the Applicant:   Wojtowicz Kelly               Counsel for the First Respondent:   Mr NC Hutley SC with Mr D Villa               Solicitor for the First Respondent:   Minter Ellison               Counsel for the Second and Third Respondents:   Mr WS Martin QC with Mr AS Derrick               Solicitor for the Second and Third Respondents:   Clayton Utz               Dates of Hea",2004-07-06 00:00:00,Federal Court of Australia

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

BLACK CJ, WILCOX AND GYLES JJ:

1                    
This is an appeal pursuant to s 52 of the Defence
Force Discipline Appeals Act 1955 (Cth) (the Appeals Act) from a
decision of the Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal (the Tribunal)
dismissing an appeal against the conviction of the appellant by a Defence Force
Magistrate for common assault contrary to s 61 of the Defence Force
Discipline Act 1982 (the Discipline Act) (Hoffman
v Chief of Army [2003] ADFDAT 4).

Proceedings before the Tribunal

2                    
The charge, the proceedings before the
Magistrate and the relevant statutory provisions are set out in the judgment of
Beaumont J which we have had the advantage of reading in draft.  The appellant was legally represented before
the Magistrate and pleaded guilty.

3                    
The notice of appeal to the Tribunal was as
follows:

‘The applicant appeals from
an order of a Defence Force Magistrate at RAAF Base Williamtown made on 10
March 2003.



Grounds
of the appeal



1.                 
The learned Defence Force Magistrate erred in law by
purporting to exercise jurisdiction under s.129 and s.115 of the Defence Force Discipline
Act (‘the DFDA’) by trying the charge and by convicting the applicant
under s.135 of the DFDA, by taking action under part 4 of the DFDA and by
imposing punishment on the applicant pursuant to s.75 of the DFDA because the
proper construction of s.61(1) and s.190(5) of the DFDA is that it does not
proscribe as a service offence conduct that would constitute a civil offence
under s.26 of Crimes
Act 1900 (ACT) when ss.33(a) and 34 of the DFDA specifically provide for
a service offence for substantially the same physical and mental elements and
accordingly there was as a matter of jurisdiction no charge of a service
offence and no conviction of a service offence.



2.                 
Alternatively, the learned Defence Force Magistrate
erred in law by purporting to exercise jurisdiction under s.129 and s.115 of
the DFDA by trying the charge and by convicting the applicant under s.135 of
the DFDA, by taking action under part 4 of the DFDA and by imposing
punishment on the applicant pursuant to s.75 of the DFDA because s.61 of the
DFDA is beyond the legislative power of the Commonwealth and invalid and / or
should be read down in so far as it purports to proscribe as a service offence
conduct that would constitute a civil offence under s.26 of Crimes Act 1900
(ACT) and accordingly the conviction is invalid and of no effect.



3.                 
Alternatively, the learned Defence Force Magistrate erred
in law by purporting to exercise jurisdiction under s.129 and s.115 of the DFDA
by trying the charge and by convicting the applicant under s.135 of the DFDA,
by taking action under part 4 of the DFDA and by imposing punishment on
the applicant pursuant to s.75 of the DFDA because the Defence Force Magistrate
was purporting to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth.  In so far as s.129 of the DFDA purports to
vest in the Defence Force Magistrate jurisdiction to exercise the judicial
power of the Commonwealth in respect of the hearing and determination of an
offence against s.26 of Crimes Act 1900 (ACT) as a service offence, it is contrary to
ss. 71 and 72 of the Constitution and accordingly the conviction is invalid and
of no effect.



4.                 
Alternatively, the learned Defence Force Magistrate
erred in law by purporting to exercise jurisdiction under s.129 and s.115 of
the DFDA by trying the charge and by convicting the applicant under s.135 of
the DFDA, by taking action under part 4 of the DFDA and by imposing
punishment on the applicant pursuant to s.75 of the DFDA because the charge
against the applicant pursuant to s.61 of the DFDA applying s.26 of Crimes Act 1900
(ACT) was an indictable offence against a law of the Commonwealth and was
required to be tried by a jury pursuant to s.80 of the Constitution and
accordingly the conviction is invalid and of no effect.



5.                 
Alternatively, the learned Defence Force Magistrate
erred in law by trying the charge and by convicting the applicant under s.135
of the DFDA, by taking action under part 4 of the DFDA and by imposing
punishment on the applicant pursuant to s.75 of the DFDA because it was an
abuse of process to permit the applicant to be charged and convicted under s.61
of the DFDA applying s.26 of Crimes Act 1900 (ACT) when:



a)     
ss. 33(a) and 34 of the DFDA provide for a service
offence for substantially the same physical and mental elements; and



b)     
at the time that the applicant was charged in 2002 with
an offence against s.61 of the DFDA, s.96 prohibited him being charged with an
offence against either of ss.33(a) and 34 of the DFDA.



6.                 
Alternatively, the learned Defence Force Magistrate
erred in law by trying the charge and by convicting the applicant under s.135
of the DFDA, by taking action under part 4 of the DFDA and by imposing
punishment on the applicant pursuant to s.75 of the DFDA because it was an
abuse of process to permit the applicant to be charged and convicted under the
DFDA in circumstances where:



a)     
there had been extraordinary and unexplained delay between
the commission of the alleged offence in 1996 and the hearing before the
Defence Force Magistrate on 10 March 2003;



b)     
at the time that the applicant was charged in 2002 with
an offence against s.61 of the DFDA, s.96 prohibited him being charged with an
offence against either of ss.33(a) and 34 of the DFDA.



7.                 
By reason of the matters above, the applicant’s
conviction resulted in a miscarriage of justice and should be quashed because
in law he could not be convicted by the Defence Force Magistrate of the offence
charged.



8.                 
Alternatively, the applicant’s conviction resulted in a
miscarriage of justice and should be quashed because he was not fully advised
of:



a)     
his right to raise each of the matters set out above
and have them determined by the Defence Force Magistrate expeditiously;



b)     
the existence of reasonable prospects of success of the
matters set out above;



and in
the premises his right to plead not guilty.



9.                 
Alternatively, the applicant’s conviction resulted in a
miscarriage of justice and should be quashed because if the conviction be set
aside, having received further advice the applicant disputes the elements of
the offence and seeks to plead not guilty.’



4                    
Evidence was admitted by the Tribunal from the
appellant and a legal officer who represented the appellant during the course
of proceedings in support of grounds 5 to 9 (inclusive).

5                    
The most comprehensive reasons in the Tribunal
were given by Duggan J.  His Honour
rejected the constitutional arguments reflected in grounds of appeal 2, 3 and 4
by reference to established authority in the High Court.  He also rejected the legal argument
underpinning ground of appeal 1 and, in particular, distinguished the
decisions in Saraswati v The Queen (1991) 172 CLR 1 and Anthony
Hordern & Sons Ltd v Amalgamated Clothing and Allied Trades Union of
Australia (1932) 47 CLR 1.  His
Honour then proceeded to examine in detail and reject each of the remaining
grounds of appeal, taking into account the evidence which had been tendered
before the Tribunal and referring to relevant authorities.  Heerey J agreed generally with
Duggan J that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by his
Honour.  Heerey J added some reasons
of his own in relation to ground of appeal 1 and said (at [10]):

‘No question of abuse of
process arises.  There is no suggestion
in the material before the Tribunal of personal animus against the appellant,
nor of any ulterior or improper purpose to be achieved by bringing the charge
against him.  The appellant was legally
represented and pleaded guilty after the question of limitation periods was
specifically raised by the Defence Force Magistrate.’



Mildren J upheld ground of appeal 1, substantially
basing himself upon the reasoning in Saraswati.  His Honour did not need to deal with the
remaining grounds of appeal.

The appeal to this Court

6                    
The Notice of Appeal to this Court is as
follows:

‘The appellant appeals from
the whole of the judgment of the Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal given
on 1 September 2003 at Melbourne.



GROUNDS:



1.                 
The Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal (‘the
Tribunal’) erred in law by failing to hold that the learned Defence Force
Magistrate erred in law by purporting to exercise jurisdiction under s.129 and
s.115 of the Defence
Force Discipline Act (‘the DFDA’) by trying the charge and by convicting
the appellant under s.135 of the DFDA, by taking action under part 4 of
the DFDA and by imposing punishment on the appellant pursuant to s.75 of the
DFDA because the proper construction of s.61(1) and s.190(5) of the DFDA is
that it does not proscribe as a service offence conduct that would constitute a
civil offence under s.26 of Crimes Act 1900 (ACT) when ss.33(a) and 34 of the DFDA
specifically provide for a service offence for substantially the same physical
and mental elements and accordingly there was as a matter of jurisdiction no
charge of a service offence and no conviction of a service offence.



2.                 
Alternatively, the Tribunal erred in law by:



a)     
taking into account at [10] that for an abuse of
process to arise, it was necessary for there to have been personal animus
against the appellant;



b)     
failing to take into account that the learned Defence
Force Magistrate erred in law by trying the charge and by convicting the
appellant under s.135 of the DFDA, by taking action under part 4 of the
DFDA and by imposing punishment on the appellant pursuant to s.75 of the DFDA
because it was an abuse of process to permit the appellant to be charged and
convicted under s.61 of the DFDA applying s.26 of Crimes Act 1900 (ACT) when:



i)              
ss. 33(a) and 34 of the DFDA provide for a service
offence for substantially the same physical and mental elements; and



ii)            
at the time that the appellant was charged in 2002 with
an offence against s.61 of the DFDA, s.96 prohibited him being charged with an
offence against either of ss.33(a) and 34 of the DFDA.



3.                 
Alternatively, the Tribunal erred in law by failing to
hold that the learned Defence Force Magistrate erred in law by trying the
charge and by convicting the appellant under s.135 of the DFDA, by taking action
under part 4 of the DFDA and by imposing punishment on the appellant
pursuant to s.75 of the DFDA because it was an abuse of process to permit the
appellant to be charged and convicted under the DFDA in circumstances where:



a)     
there had been extraordinary and unexplained delay
between the commission of the alleged offence in 1996 and the hearing before
the Defence Force Magistrate on 10 March 2003;



b)     
at the time that the appellant was charged in 2002 with
an offence against s.61 of the DFDA, s.96 prohibited him being charged with an
offence against either of ss.33(a) and 34 of the DFDA;



4.                 
Alternatively, the Tribunal erred in law by:



a)     
failing to hold that the appellant’s conviction
resulted in a miscarriage of justice and should be quashed because the instructions
provided to his legal officers were inconsistent with his plea of not guilty;



b)     
taking into account at [65] that there was a change of
instructions by the appellant to his legal officers by the time the agreed
facts were prepared.



5.                 
Alternatively, the Tribunal erred in law by:



a)     
holding at [66] that the appellant had not been placed
under pressure by the advice that it would take up to a further 12 months to
deal with his case if he pleaded not guilty;



b)     
failing to take into account that the appellant’s conviction
resulted in a miscarriage of justice and should be quashed because he was not
fully advised of:



i)              
his right to raise each of the matters set out above
and have them determined by the Defence Force Magistrate expeditiously;



ii)            
the existence of reasonable prospects of success of the
matters set out above;



                and in the premises his right to
plead not guilty.



6.                 
Alternatively, the Tribunal erred in law by failing to
hold that the appellant’s conviction resulted in a miscarriage of justice and
should be quashed, because he was induced into pleading guilty as a result of
the incorrect advice from the head of the Australian Defence Force (“ADF”)
Prosecutions Cell to the appellant’s legal officer, that the only record of any
conviction of the appellant would be within the ADF.



7.                 
Alternatively, the Tribunal erred in law by failing to
hold that the learned Defence Force Magistrate erred in law by purporting to
exercise jurisdiction under s.129 and s.115 of the DFDA by trying the charge
and by convicting the appellant under s.135 of the DFDA, by taking action under
part 4 of the DFDA and by imposing punishment on the appellant pursuant to
s.75 of the DFDA because s.61 of the DFDA is beyond the legislative power of
the Commonwealth and invalid and / or should be read down in so far as it
purports to proscribe as a service offence conduct that would constitute a
civil offence under s.26 of Crimes Act 1900 (ACT) and accordingly the conviction is invalid
and of no effect.



8.                 
Alternatively, the Tribunal erred in law by failing to
hold that the learned Defence Force Magistrate erred in law by purporting to
exercise jurisdiction under s.129 and s.115 of the DFDA by trying the charge
and by convicting the appellant under s.135 of the DFDA, by taking action under
part 4 of the DFDA and by imposing punishment on the appellant pursuant to
s.75 of the DFDA because the Defence Force Magistrate was purporting to
exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth and in so far as s.129 of the
DFDA purports to vest in the Defence Force Magistrate jurisdiction to exercise
the judicial power of the Commonwealth in respect of the hearing and
determination of an offence against s.26 of Crimes Act 1900 (ACT) as a service offence,
it is contrary to ss. 71 and 72 of the Constitution and accordingly the
conviction is invalid and of no effect.



9.                 
Alternatively, the Tribunal erred in law by failing to
hold that the learned Defence Force Magistrate erred in law by purporting to
exercise jurisdiction under s.129 and s.115 of the DFDA by trying the charge and
by convicting the appellant under s.135 of the DFDA, by taking action under
part 4 of the DFDA and by imposing punishment on the appellant pursuant to
s.75 of the DFDA because the charge against the appellant pursuant to s.61 of
the DFDA applying s.26 of Crimes Act 1900 (ACT) was an indictable offence against a law of
the Commonwealth and was required to be tried by a jury pursuant to s.80 of the
Constitution and accordingly the conviction is invalid and of no effect.’



The first ground of appeal: the application
of s 61

7                    
The question raised by this ground is
narrow.  The appellant was charged
pursuant to s 61 of the Discipline Act  (picking up s 26 of the Crimes Act
1900 (ACT) (the Crimes Act)) that he, ‘[b]eing a defence member at
Shoalwater Bay Training Area, Queensland … did assault … Captain Paul Barrie
Higgins, by pointing a pistol at him during an orders group on Exercise NIGHT
CROCODILE 96’.  That is the manner in
which a charge pursuant to s 33(a) of the Act would have been framed.  The elements of the charged offence were
identical to the elements of a charge, in respect of the same conduct, that
might have been laid under s 33(a). 
However, there are two important differences between the charge as laid
and any charge that might have been brought under s 33(a).  First, the maximum penalty for breach of
s 33 is six months’ imprisonment whereas the maximum penalty for breach of
s 61 is two years’ imprisonment. Secondly, a charge pursuant to s 33 would
have been time barred if laid at the time when the s 61 charge was
brought.  

8                    
The question that arises here concerns the
construction of the one statute.  It is
not a  question of inconsistency between
different statutes.  The offence charged
is a breach of s 61 of the Discipline Act, a service offence, and
not a breach of s 26 of the Crimes Act.  As Dixon J pointed out in South
Eastern Drainage Board (SA) v Savings Bank of South Australia (1939)
62 CLR 603 at 626:

‘…when two apparently
inconsistent provisions occur in one Act of Parliament, to reconcile them by
interpretation is the only course open. 
They cannot both receive their full meaning as it is expressed.’



9                    
In Network Ten Pty Limited v TCN Channel
Nine Pty Limited [2004] HCA 14, (2004) 205 ALR 1, McHugh ACJ, Gummow
and Hayne JJ, after discussing various sections of a statute, said of the
preferred interpretation (at 18 [61]):

‘In this way, effect is
given to each provision, while maintaining the unity of the statute in the
sense discussed in Project
Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355
at 381–382 [69]–[70].’



10                 
The question of inconsistency and the related
question of double jeopardy have often been discussed in relation to similar
offences created by different statutes (eg, Butler v Attorney-General
(Vic) (1961) 106 CLR 268; Rose v Hvric (1963) 108 CLR 353; Parramatta
City Council v Stauffer Chemical Co (Aust) Pty Ltd [1971] 2 NSWLR 500;
Environment Protection Authority v Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd
(1992) 28 NSWLR 502).  Sometimes the
statutes are of different legislatures, giving rise to a constitutional
question (eg Clyde Engineering Co Ltd v Cowburn (1926) 37 CLR 466; Hume
v Palmer (1926) 38 CLR 441; Ex parte McLean (1930) 43 CLR 472; The
Queen v Loewenthal; Ex parte Blacklock (1974) 131 CLR 338; The
Queen v Winneke; Ex parte Gallagher (1982) 152 CLR 211).  Even in such circumstances, the provision for
a different penalty for the same act in different statutes is regarded as
inconsistent, unless there is a relevant point of distinction (see Isaacs J
in Clyde Engineering v Cowburn at 489; Starke J in Hume v Palmer
at 462; Mason J in Ex parte Blacklock at 347; and
Gleeson CJ in Environment Protection Authority v Australian Iron
& Steel Pty Ltd at 507G–508B).  

11                 
Providing two different penalties for an offence
with the same elements in two sections of the same statute gives rise to a
question of construction that cannot be resolved otherwise than by choosing one
section over the other.  It is hardly
likely that the legislature intended to allow the same conduct to be treated
differently, where there is no relevant aggravating or distinguishing
circumstance, dependent upon the whim of the prosecuting authority.  Such a result would be capricious and
arbitrary.  As Isaacs J pointed out
in Clyde Engineering v Cowburn (at 489):

‘If an Act of Parliament,
for instance, prescribed 25 lashes for robbery under arms and a later Act
prescribed that such an offender should be punished with 20 lashes, it could,
of course, … be said that both provisions could be obeyed, and therefore,
applying the suggested test [as to whether the two provisions were inconsistent], the
offender must receive 45 lashes.  But
surely the vital question would be:  Was
the second Act on its true construction intended to cover the whole ground and,
therefore, to supersede the first?’



It is, of course, commonplace that the one act or course of
conduct might lead to a variety of offences created by the same statute.  However, those offences would all be
different in character, one from the other, usually with an ascending order of
gravity.  

12                 
A conventional method of resolving such an
inconsistency as arises here is for the general to yield to the particular,
whether this be attributed to the maxim ‘expressum facit cessare tacitum’ or
the maxim ‘generalia specialibus non derogant’ (Pearce and Geddes, Statutory
Interpretation in Australia, 5th Ed, para [4.28]–[4.30]).

13                 
The matter was put by Deane J in
Refrigerated Express Lines (A/Asia) Pty Ltd v Australian Meat and
Live-Stock Corporation (1980) 29 ALR 333 at 347 as follows:

‘As a matter of general
construction, where there is repugnancy between the general provision of a
statute and provisions dealing with a particular subject matter, the latter
must prevail and, to the extent of any such repugnancy, the general provisions
will be inapplicable to the subject matter of the special provisions.  “The rule is, that wherever there is a
particular enactment and a general enactment in the same statute, and the
latter, taken in its most comprehensive sense, would overrule the former, the
particular enactment must be taken to be operative …” (per
Romilly MR:  Pretty v Solly (1859) 26 Beav
606 at 610).  Repugnancy can be present
in cases where there is no direct contradiction between the relevant
legislative provisions.  It is present
where it appears, as a matter of construction, that special provisions were
intended exhaustively to govern their particular subject matter and where
general provisions, if held to be applicable to the particular subject matter,
would constitute a departure from that intention by encroaching on that subject
matter.’



(See
also White v Mason [1958] VR 79 per Herring CJ at 81–82.)

14                 
In Smith v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR
338, Mason CJ, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said at 348:

‘…where there is a conflict
between general and specific provisions, the specific provision prevails
(generalia specialibus non derogant). 
That principle is based upon the presumed intention of Parliament and
has, we think, a particular application where the conflict arises from different
sections in the same Act. … It is but common sense that Parliament having
before it two apparently conflicting sections at the same time cannot have
intended the general provision to have deprived the specific provision of
effect.’



15                 
In No 20 Cannon Street Ltd v Singer
& Friedlander Ltd [1974] 1 Ch 229 Megarry J said at 235G:

‘Put formally, it seems to
me that the proper principle to apply if an enactment contains two similar
prohibitions, one wide and the other applying only to a limited class of case
wholly within the wide prohibition, is to treat the wide prohibition as not
applying to cases within the limited prohibition, especially if the limited
prohibition is made subject to some exception and the wide prohibition is not.’



16                 
It becomes clear when the structure of the Act
is considered that s 33 is a particular provision and s 61 is a
general provision for present purposes. 
Part III creates offences.  There
are nine divisions in the Part.  The last
division, headed ‘Miscellaneous’, does not create any primary offence.  Division 8 headed ‘Other Offences’ is
the last division that creates offences. 
It is constituted by s 61 which in terms picks up and incorporates
the criminal law of the Jervis Bay Territory.

17                 
It is correct to say that s 61 incorporates
a series of particular offences.  That
does not detract from the proposition that the preceding provisions, such as s
33, each relate to a topic to which the legislature has given particular
attention, whereas s 61 is a catch-all provision.  The provisions of Part III which precede
Division 8 can readily be recognised as offences which may reasonably be
regarded as having a particular relevance to military discipline.  The same cannot be said of s 61.  

18                 
This conclusion is supported by the reasoning in
Saraswati v The Queen (1991) 172 CLR 1 which had some prominence in
the reasons of members of the Tribunal. 
The facts of that case are stated in the report (at 2–3) as follows:

‘Akhandananda Saraswati was
convicted before the District Court of New South Wales upon three counts of
committing an act of indecency with a person under the age of sixteen years
contrary to s. 61E(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (N.S.W.). 
The offences were all alleged to have occurred between 8 April and
3 November 1983.  No prosecution was
commenced until 1987.  The evidence led
in support of two of the counts amounted to evidence of indecent assault, an
offence created by s. 61E(1).  The
evidence led in support of the third count amounted to unlawful carnal
knowledge under s. 71.  Saraswati
could not have been prosecuted for offences against s. 61E(1) or
s. 71 because s. 78 required prosecutions for such offences to be
commenced within twelve months from the time of the alleged offence.  Saraswati appealed to the Court of Criminal
Appeal (Mahoney J.A., Hunt and Badgery-Parker JJ.) on the ground that
a charge of committing an act of indecency with a person under the age of
sixteen years could not be brought under s. 61E(2) when the conduct relied
on was an indecent assault for the purpose of s. 61E(1) or an act of
carnal knowledge for the purposes of s. 71.  The appeal was dismissed.’



19                 
McHugh J (with whom Toohey J agreed)
accepted the appellant’s argument which he summarised as follows (at 20):

‘Mr. Porter Q.C., counsel
for the applicant, did not dispute that the touching of the complainant’s
breasts, buttocks and vagina and the act of sexual intercourse each constituted
an “act of indecency” within the meaning of that term as it has been judicially
interpreted:  see R. v. Sorlie (1925) 42 W.N.
(N.S.W.) 152; Reg.
v. Valence (1958) 76 W.N. (N.S.W.) 137; R. v. Hare (1933) 24 Cr. App. R.
108.  He submitted, however, that, in the
context of the Act, the term “act of indecency” in s. 61E(2) did not cover
a case which fell within the terms of ss. 71, 72 or 61E(1).  He submitted that, if s. 61E(2) was
construed to cover a case which fell within any of those provisions, an accused
person could lose the benefit of the protection given by s. 78 of the Act,
and that it could not have been the intention of Parliament in enacting
s. 61E(2) to permit a prosecution which s. 78 specifically
prohibited.’



20                 
McHugh J summarised his opinion as follows
(at 23):

‘Two considerations persuade
me that in the present case “the ordinary meaning” of the words “act of indecency”
in s. 61E(2) is not their literal meaning. 
The first is that, when one has regard to the history of s. 61E(2),
it is clear that the purpose of Parliament in enacting s. 76A, the
predecessor of s. 61E(2), was to deal with cases which did not constitute
indecent assaults.  The second is the
rule that, when a statute specifically deals with a matter and makes it the
subject of a condition or limitation, it excludes the right to use a general
provision in the same statute to avoid that condition or limitation.’



21                 
As to the second of the two considerations
identified, His Honour said (at 24):

‘The Act makes it an offence
for a person to have carnal knowledge of or to indecently assault a girl under
the age of sixteen.  But if the girl is
over fourteen years of age, the Act requires the prosecution to be instituted
within twelve months of the commission of the offence.  It is difficult to accept that, when
Parliament enacted s. 61E(2) and authorized the institution of
prosecutions for acts of indecency under s. 61E(2), it intended that
general power to be used to circumvent the limitation which s. 78 placed
on ss. 61E(1), 71 and 72 of the same Act. 
To use the words of Gavan Duffy C.J. and Dixon J. in Anthony Hordern & Sons
Ltd. (1932) 47 C.L.R., at p. 7, the enactment of ss. 61E(1),
71, 72 and 78 “excludes the operation of general expressions in the same
instrument which might otherwise have been relied upon for the same
power”.  Accordingly, in my opinion, the
context of s. 61E(2) indicates that Parliament did not intend the words
“an act of indecency” to cover conduct which constitutes an indecent assault or
carnal knowledge.  And as s. 34 of
the Interpretation
Act makes plain, “the ordinary meaning” of a legislative provision in
New South Wales can be ascertained only after taking account of its context in
the Act.’



22                 
Gaudron J, the other member of the
majority, arrived at the same result by different reasoning.  Her Honour said (at 17–18):

‘It is a basic rule of
construction that, in the absence of express words, an earlier statutory
provision is not repealed, altered or derogated from by a later provision
unless an intention to that effect is necessarily to be implied.  There must be very strong grounds to support
that implication, for there is a general presumption that the legislature
intended that both provisions should operate and that, to the extent that they
would otherwise overlap, one should be read as subject to the other:  see Butler v Attorney-General (Vict.)  (1961) 106 C.L.R. 268, at p. 276, per
Fullagar J., and per Windeyer J. (1961) 106 C.L.R., at
p. 290.  More particularly, an
intention to affect the earlier provision will not be implied if the later is
of general application (as is the provision by which indecent dealing is
constituted an offence under the Act) and the earlier deals with some matter
affecting the individual (as does the limitation provision in s. 78).  Nor will an intention to affect the earlier
provision be implied if the later is otherwise capable of sensible operation.

…

If s. 61E(2) of the Act
has the meaning for which the respondent contends, it necessarily derogates
from the protection earlier afforded by s. 78.  So much may be seen from the present case
for, although, by force of s. 78, the applicant could not be charged with
carnal knowledge and indecent assault, his prosecution under s. 61E(2)
required him, as a matter of practical reality, to answer those very
charges.  In my view s. 61E(2) has
neither the meaning nor the effect for which the respondent contends.’



23                 
Dawson J gave the leading judgment for the
minority.  After stating that at common
law the applicant might have been convicted of committing an act of indecency
when charged only with that offence, notwithstanding that the facts amounted to
carnal knowledge or indecent assault, His Honour went on to say (at 14–15):

‘The applicant placed great
reliance upon the fact that the offence of committing an act of indecency was
created to cover the gap left by the fact that the offence of indecent assault
requires not only indecency, but also something in the nature of an
assault.  However, sexual offences are of
their very nature progressive rather than mutually exclusive, so that the more
serious offence includes the elements of the less serious offence.  For the legislature to have sought to exclude
from an act of indecency offences which otherwise would have included the act
of indecency would have been to depart from the approach hitherto adopted by
the law.  Moreover, whilst the object of
the legislature in creating the offence of committing an act of indecency
appears to have been to close a gap which it perceived in the law, it does not
follow that it chose to close that gap in a way which would give rise to
incongruous results.



If the applicant’s argument
is correct, a person charged only with committing an act of indecency would be
able to defeat that charge by proving by way of defence that he had in fact
committed an indecent assault or unlawful carnal knowledge.  If the defence were successful, he could not,
upon the principles which I have endeavoured to explain, be subsequently
convicted of either of the more serious offences whether or not the time for
the commencement of prosecution had expired. 
But more than that, even if the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt that an act of indecency (in the ordinary sense and not the confined
sense contended for as a matter of construction) had been committed, if they
entertained a doubt whether the accused was guilty of indecent assault or
unlawful carnal knowledge – that is, if they considered that he might have
committed those offences – it may be they must acquit upon the charge of
committing an act of indecency (in the confined sense) because they would
necessarily entertain a doubt whether what he had done amounted only to the
commission of the latter offence …’



24                 
Deane J agreed with Dawson J and added
some comments of his own in which he examined the charging of greater and
lesser offences.  His Honour said (at 4):

‘There are, upon analysis,
compelling practical reasons why a statutory provision creating an offence
should not be construed as inapplicable to circumstances where conduct which
otherwise falls within its terms is aggravated by some circumstance (being part
of a single transaction or course of action) which makes the overall conduct a
more serious offence under some other statutory provision.’



His Honour further said (at 5):

‘Common sense, the efficient
working of the administration of criminal justice, and the presumption that the
Legislature intends that its words be given their ordinary meaning, combine to
dictate that, in the absence of an identified legislative intent to the
contrary, a general statutory provision which makes specified conduct an
offence should be construed in accordance with its terms and should not be
confined so as to be inapplicable to a case where, in its context within a
single transaction or course of action, the designated conduct also constitutes
an element of a more serious offence.  In
such a case, the offender is guilty of both the basic offence and the more
serious offence notwithstanding the fact that, as a matter of basic principle,
he cannot be convicted of them both.’



25                 
Saraswati did not involve identical
offences, and nothing said by any of the Justices is contrary to the conclusion
that there is inconsistency in this case because of the differing
penalties.  

26                 
The use by Toohey and McHugh JJ in Saraswati
of the principle that a general power cannot be used to circumvent the
limitations on a specific power, did not command a majority of the Court.  However, that does not cast doubt upon the
principle itself.  Indeed, a similar
result was arrived at by Gaudron J using reasoning that is directly
applicable to the present case and which did not depend upon the legislative
history in that case.

27                 
In the present statute the existence of the time
limitation in relation to s 33 is an indicator that the legislature would
not have contemplated that the same offence in substance could be pursued
outside the prescribed limitation period. 
This provides independent support for the conclusion that the s 61
charge was not open that would anyway be indicated by the existence of
different maximum penalties for the same conduct.  There are a myriad of offences against
s 61 of the Discipline Act. 
The policy that s 96 of the Discipline Act embodies is that
an offence against s 61 will be governed by the same limitation period as
would have applied if that offence had been charged as a civilian offence.  That policy says nothing as to the  availability of a charge under s 61.

28                 
It has not been necessary to resort to extrinsic
material or to history to resolve the question of construction that arises in
this case.  However, if there were a
necessity to do so, support would be obtained for the appellant’s
position.  Consideration of the
historical excursus by Brennan and Toohey JJ in Re Tracey; Ex parte
Ryan (1989) 166 CLR 518 at 554–563 is sufficient to indicate that
incorporation of the general criminal law of England was supplementary to the
particular codes of military discipline. 
The Report of the Working Party which preceded the Discipline Act,
and which was referred to in the Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill (at
paragraphs 63–65, 575), makes it clear (at page ix) that Territory criminal law
was to be substituted for the English criminal law for the same purpose in
Australia.  

29                 
Before the Discipline Act was enacted
Australian defence personnel were subject to what was described in the
Explanatory Memorandum as a compound of United Kingdom and Australian
legislation. The Army had two codes of discipline, one for war service and
another when serving in Australia in peacetime. There were different codes
again for members of the Air Force and for members of the Navy.

30                 
A central problem identified by the Working
Party was the deeply seated differences in the summary punishments that could
be imposed for service offences in the three Services.  The Report of the Working Party records the
negotiation between the Services of “an acceptable compromise on summary
punishments” (see Report at (ii) to (iii)). 
The levels of summary punishments incorporated in the draft legislation
proposed by the Working Party were said to “represent a consensus achieved
within the Working Party and … are regarded as workable by the Navy, the Army
and the Air Force.” That consensus was reflected in the penalty provisions of
the Discipline Act.

31                 
The Working Party also proposed the reduction of
maximum punishments to modern levels and “the demarcation of serious offences from
breaches of discipline by the provision of appropriate maximum punishments
...”. In explaining its approach the Working Party observed (at page v):

“Part of the value of
setting out offences in a disciplinary code lies in their declaratory
significance as a code of military conduct. Their educational and preventative
value have been obscured or distorted by unrealistic maximum punishments. It
does not enhance discipline to hold out minor breaches as serious crimes and we
have not hesitated to reduce drastically maximum punishments.”  (emphasis added)



32                 
The recommendations of the Working Party that
there should be a demarcation of serious offences from breaches of discipline
were adopted in the Discipline Act, as the Explanatory Memorandum
recites and as its provisions make plain.

33                 
The offences created by s 33 of the Discipline
Act were evidently intended to be regarded as breaches of discipline, since
the section was intended to embody the important elements of the former Navy
offence of fighting and quarrelling (Navy Act 1957 (UK) s 33) whilst
reducing the maximum penalty from imprisonment for 2 years to imprisonment for
6 months.  

34                 
The offences of assaulting a member of the
Defence Force of inferior rank (s 34(1)) and assaulting a superior officer
(s 25(1)) were plainly to be regarded as more serious.  The two-year maximum term of imprisonment for
a offences of obvious importance to discipline in the Defence Force takes on an
added significance in the present context when it is seen that under the former
law the maximum penalty for assaulting a superior officer, if committed in the
Navy, was life imprisonment.

35                 
The history of the legislation thus underlines
the inconsistency between the intention of the Parliament to make specific
provision for particular offences, both as to content and as to penalty, when
introducing a uniform modern “code” for the discipline of the Defence Force and
the application, in a case like the present, of a general provision such as
s 61.   

36                 
A further and related consideration that also
underlines the inconsistency contended for by the appellant is that the policy
objectives of laws imposing penalties for offences relating to the discipline
of the Defence Force and providing for time limits for the bringing of charges
are necessarily different from the objectives of the general criminal law
applying from time to time in the Jervis Bay Territory. The different
objectives are, in any event, mandated by the fundamentally different
constitutional foundations of the two types of law.   

37                 
In our opinion the decisions of the High Court
in Re Tracey; McWaters v Day (1989) 168 CLR 289; Re Nolan; Ex
parte Young (1999) 172 CLR 460 and Re Tyler; Ex parte Foley (1994)
181 CLR 18 are not inconsistent with the opinion we have expressed.  No argument to that effect was referred to by
the majority of the Tribunal which upheld the respondent’s position on this
issue or was presented by counsel for the respondent in this appeal.  The two High Court decisions examine some of
the issues thrown up by the co-existence of military and civilian systems
particularly in the light of the incorporation of certain parts of the civilian
system into the military system.  This
case does not involve such issues.  The
difference of opinion between Mason CJ and Dawson J on the one hand
and Brennan and Toohey JJ in Re Tracey which flowed through to the
other decisions is not relevant to the point at issue here.

38                 
Counsel for the respondent submitted that the
decision of the Full Court in Lawson v Gault (2002) 125 FCR 1
supports the reasoning of the majority of the Tribunal.  In our opinion that case is distinguishable
from this one.  Section 99 of the Crimes
Act 1900 (ACT) provided:

‘A person who steals is
guilty of an offence, punishable on conviction, by imprisonment for ten years.’



It had governed all charges of theft until the addition of
s 99A in 1995 which provided as follows:

‘A person who steals
property the value of which does not exceed $1,000.00 is guilty of an offence
punishable on conviction by imprisonment for six months, a fine not exceeding
fifty penalty units or both.’



By reason of other provisions of the Crimes Act, a charge
pursuant to s 99 could be heard on indictment or, in certain events (which
included the consent of the defendant), summarily.  A charge pursuant to s 99A was to be
heard summarily.  There was a 12 month
time limit for a prosecution under s 99A and no time limit in relation to
s 99.  The defendant was charged
with breach of s 99.  The value of
the property stolen did not exceed $1000. 
The charge was laid outside the 12 month time limit applicable to
charges of breach of s 99A.  The
defendant was convicted.  On appeal, the
Supreme Court held that s 99 should be read as applying only to thefts of
property the value of which exceeded $1000 and quashed the conviction.  On appeal, Spender, Miles and Dowsett JJ
(having referred to certain extrinsic material) held that the object of the
amendment was to provide a mechanism for summary prosecution of minor thefts,
distinguished Saraswati and declined to read s 99 as subject to
s 99A.  Their Honours said (at 8):

‘The amendment simply
inserted s 99A to follow s 99. 
If the intention was to exclude minor thefts from the ambit of operation
of s 99, then it is virtually certain that the legislature would have said
so expressly.’



39                 
There is no reason to review the correctness of
that decision.  It turned upon the
particular legislative context and history and the extrinsic materials that
were considered and provides no relevant guidance here.

40                 
Acceptance of the appellant’s argument in this
case does not mean that s 61 is not to be given full force and effect
where it is applicable.  Whilst, in
circumstances such as the present, a charge cannot be preferred pursuant to
s 61 with elements identical to those of a particular charge in the
earlier divisions of Part III, if the charge laid pursuant to s 61 is
truly different from (particularly if more serious than) that which might be
laid pursuant to a particular earlier provision, then the fact that the conduct
could have been charged pursuant to the earlier provision would be no answer,
in itself, to the different charge pursuant to s 61.  

41                 
The appellant has established Ground 1 and so is
entitled to succeed on the appeal.  The
Tribunal erred on a question of law in rejecting this ground of appeal.  That is sufficient to dispose of the
appeal.  However, it is appropriate that
we indicate our opinion as to the other grounds of appeal in the event that the
matter goes further.

The second to sixth grounds of appeal:
abuse of process

42                 
In our opinion these grounds should be
rejected.  They do not give rise to any
appeal on a question of law arising out of the decision of the Tribunal as is
required by s 52 of the Appeals Act.  The appellant was represented before the
learned Defence Force Magistrate.  The
Magistrate squarely raised the issues relevant to the abuse of process argument
before a plea was taken.  No application
was made to stay the proceeding as an abuse of process.  The appellant pleaded guilty.  There was an agreed statement of facts.  

43                 
The available grounds of appeal to the Tribunal
pursuant to the Appeals Act were as follows:

‘23.  (1)   … where in an appeal it appears to the
Tribunal:



(a)  
that the conviction or the prescribed acquittal is
unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence;

(b)  
that, as a result of a wrong decision on a question of
law, or of mixed law and fact, the conviction or the prescribed acquittal was
wrong in law and that a substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred;

(c)   
that there was a material irregularity in the course of
the proceedings before the court martial or the Defence Force magistrate and
that a substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred; or

(d)  
that, in all the circumstances of the case, the
conviction or the prescribed acquittal is unsafe or unsatisfactory;

it shall
allow the appeal and quash the conviction or the prescribed acquittal.’



44                 
Leaving aside grounds of appeal 1, 7, 8 and 9,
relieving the appellant of the consequences of a plea of guilty could only be
justified in the present case if the Tribunal were satisfied that, in all the
circumstances of the case, either s 23(1)(c) or (d) was satisfied.  Deciding such questions is traditionally the
role of a court of criminal appeal and involves judgments of fact and degree
and the balancing of various factors. 
These tasks require a good knowledge of the practical workings of the
trial system.  This Court does not
exercise a general supervisory jurisdiction (per Gummow and Callinan JJ in
 Hembury v Chief of the General
Staff (1998) 193 CLR 641 at 653) and it is important that the
jurisdictional limit be maintained.  It
is, of course, possible that questions of law can arise before the Tribunal
even in the exercise of such practical judgments about the application of s
23(1)(c) or (d) of the Appeals Act. 
However, it would be wrong to permit the ingenious extraction of alleged
errors upon questions of law from the language in which such a balancing
exercise is expressed so as to permit civilian interference with the military
system of justice supervised by the Tribunal.

45                 
The general approach of courts of criminal
appeal to quashing a conviction based upon a plea of guilty by a represented
party was summarised by Wood CJ at CL in R v Kouroumalos
[2000] NSWCCA 453 at [19]–[21] as follows:

‘What is required, for an
exercise of the relevant discretion is the identification of some circumstance
which indicates that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a
genuine consciousness of guilt or that otherwise the integrity of the plea is
bona fide in question:  Cincotta NSW CCA
1 November 1995, Ganderton
NSWCCA 17 September 1998, Favero, [[1999]
NSWCCA 320], and Vergara [1999] NSWCCA 352. 
However, as Kirby P pointed out in Liberti at 122:



“For good reasons, courts
approach attempts at trial or on appeal in effect to change a plea of guilty or
to assert a want of understanding of what was involved in such a plea with
caution bordering on circumspection. 
This attitude rests on the high public interest in the finality of legal
proceedings and upon the principle that a plea of guilty by a person in
possession of all relevant facts is normally taken to be an admission by that
person of the necessary legal ingredients of the offence:  see O’Neill [1979] 2 NSWLR 582; (1979) 1 A Crim R
59; Sagiv (1986)
22 A Crim R 73 at 81.”



Relevantly for the present
case, it may be noted that in Sagiv (1986) 22 A Crim R 73, Lee J, said:



“the substantial general
proposition which emerges from these cases is that it is a matter for the
discretion of the judge presiding as to whether a plea of guilty should be
permitted to be withdrawn and that each case must be looked at in regard to its
own facts and a decision made whether justice requires that that course be
taken.



It is clear that in the case
of mistake of [sic] other circumstances affecting the integrity of the
plea as an admission of guilt, the court should readily grant leave. 
But if the plea has been entered in full knowledge of all the
facts and
intentionally as a plea to the charge which is made, the court is plainly
entitled to exercise its discretion against a withdrawal of the plea.  The law regards a plea of guilty made by a
person in possession of all the facts and intending to plead guilty as an admission of
all the legal ingredients of the offence (O’Neill) and as the most cogent admission of guilt
that can be made, for the court is prepared to act upon it and proceed to
conviction or final disposal of the proceedings. [emphasis added]”



This passage was cited with
approval in Davies
NSWCCA 16 December 1993 and again in Lars (1994) 73 A Crim R 91.



The onus of establishing
that there has been a miscarriage of justice lies on the applicant:  Boag (1994) 73 A Crim R 35 at 36–37.’



(See
also, R v Murphy [1965] VR 187 at 188–189;  Birks v R (1990) 48
A Crim R 385 at 392; Miladinovic v R (1993) 47 FCR 190 at
198–199; and Meissner v R (1994) 184 CLR 132).

46                 
We have considered the reasons of Duggan J
for rejecting the arguments now encompassed by grounds 2–6 (inclusive) in the
light of those authorities and can find no error on any operative question of
law disclosed by those reasons. 
Heerey J agreed generally with those reasons.  We do not read what Heerey J said at
[10] to be a comprehensive statement of reasons for rejecting the claimed abuse
of process or as intended to be a complete statement of the requirements of law
as to what is needed to be found to constitute abuse of process.  Rather, we read what Heerey J said as
being remarks that were supplementary to the reasons of Duggan J with
which Heerey J expressly agreed. 
Furthermore, assuming that a particular charge is available to be
preferred, it is difficult to see how an abuse of process could arise merely
from use of that charge, absent the kind of factors to which Heerey J
adverted.  Mildren J did not need to
discuss those issues.

The seventh to ninth grounds of appeal:
constitutional issues

47                 
The constitutional arguments reflected in these
grounds were formally put to the Tribunal, it being accepted for the purpose of
argument that it was bound to the contrary by the High Court authorities
referred to in [37] above.  Duggan J
(agreed with by Heerey J) held accordingly (at [29]–[33]).  We cannot see any basis upon which it can be
held that this Court is not bound by the same line of authority (see also
Gummow and Callinan JJ in Hembury v Chief of the General Staff
at 654).

Conclusion

48                 
We agree with Mildren J that the appeal to
the Tribunal should have succeeded and a verdict of not guilty entered.  The appellant could not have been convicted
in law of the offence with which he was charged, and is entitled to the benefit
of an acquittal.  Section 52(4) of
the Appeals Act enables appropriate orders to be made.  The orders of the Tribunal should be set
aside; in lieu thereof the appeal from the conviction of the appellant should
be allowed, the conviction quashed and a verdict of not guilty
substituted.  The respondent should pay
the appellant’s costs of this appeal. 
Pursuant to s 37 of the Appeals Act, the Commonwealth should
pay to the appellant such sums for the costs of the appeal to the Tribunal and
of carrying on his defence against the charge out of which the appeal arose as
may be agreed, failing agreement, such sum to be assessed by the Registrar of
the Tribunal.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

BEAUMONT J:

Introduction

49                 
This is an appeal on a question of law only (see
s 52 of the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Act 1955 (Cth)), from
a decision of the Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal (‘The Tribunal’) given
on 1 September 2003, dismissing an appeal against the conviction of the
appellant for the offence of common assault contrary to s 26 of the Crimes
Act 1900 (ACT) (see Hoffman v Chief of Army [2003] ADFDAT 4).

50                 
The issues arising in the appeal are complex and
cannot be shortly described.  However,
one of the arguments advanced by the appellant, upheld by Mildren J in dissent
in the Tribunal, is that the appellant could not, for substantive reasons which
will appear, have been charged with the offence mentioned.  The appellant also advanced alternative
arguments, including a procedural contention that, even if the charge were
technically available, it amounted to an abuse of process.

51                 
Before coming to the appellant’s arguments, it
is necessary to describe the statutory scheme and the trial process itself.

The charge

52                 
Pursuant to the provisions of s 103(1)(c)
of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 (Cth) (‘the Discipline Act’), a
convening authority, appointed under s 102 of the Discipline Act by a
chief of staff for the purpose of convening courts martial, referred the
following charge to a Defence Force magistrate for trial:

 ‘[The appellant], an officer in the Australian Army and, at the
time of the offences specified in the following charges, a Defence member under
the ...  [Discipline Act], is charged as follows:

 


 
  
  Discipline
  Act section 61 & Crimes Act 1900 (ACT) s.26
  
  
  Other Offences – Commission of Territory offences being
  the offence of common assault.
  Being a defence member at Shoalwater Bay Training Area,
  Queensland, on a date unknown, between 31 July, 1996 and 1 September 1996,
  did assault 240262 Captain Paul Barrie Higgins, by pointing a pistol at him
  during an orders group on Exercise NIGHT CROCODILE 96.’
  
 




Discipline Act ‘offence’ provisions

53                 
Section 61 of the Discipline Act is included in
Part III of the Discipline Act (ss 15 – 65).  The Part is entitled ‘Offences’.  In order to understand the arguments in the
appeal, it is necessary to explain next the structure, and some of the detail,
of Part III.

54                 
Division 1 (ss 15 – 19) of Part III creates
several specific offences as ‘Offences relating to operations against the
enemy’.  Division 2 (ss 20 – 24) of
Part III creates several specific offences as ‘Offences relating to mutiny,
desertion, and unauthorised absence’. 
Division 3 (ss 25 – 34) of Part III creates several specific
offences as ‘Offences relating to insubordination and violence’.

55                 
As Division 3 assumed some significance in
argument, it is necessary to say something more about it.  The table of provisions for Division 3 gives
the following indication of those provisions:

‘Division 3 – Offences relating to
insubordination and violence



25.             
Assault on superior officer

26.             
Insubordinate behaviour with respect to superior
officer

27.             
Disobedience of command

28.             
Failure to comply with direction of person in
command

29.             
Failure to comply with general order

30.             
Assault on a guard

31.             
Obstruction of service policeman

32.             
Person on guard or on watch

33.             
Assault, insulting or provocative words etc.

34.             
Assault on inferior’.

 

56                 
Sections 33 and 34 (which, along with
s 96(1) of the Discipline Act (see below) were much emphasised in the
appellant’s argument) provide:

‘Assault, insulting or
provocative words etc.



33.             
A person, being a defence member or a defence
civilian, who, on service land, in a service ship, service aircraft or service
vehicle or in a public place:



(a)              
assaults another person;

(b)              
creates a disturbance or takes part in creating or
continuing a disturbance; 

(c)              
behaves in an obscene manner within the view or hearing
of another person; or

(d)              
uses insulting or provocative words to another person;



is
guilty of an offence for which the maximum punishment is imprisonment for 6
months.



Assault
on inferior

 

34.             
A defence member who assaults, or ill-treats, a
member of the Defence Force who is of inferior rank to the defence member is
guilty of an offence for which the maximum punishment is imprisonment for 2
years.’  (Emphasis added.)



57                 
(At the time of the alleged offence, Captain
Higgins was of inferior rank to the appellant.)

58                 
Divisions 4, 5, 6 and 6A of Part III create
several specific offences relating ‘to performance of duty’; ‘to ships,
vehicles, aircraft, weapons or property’; ‘to arrest, custody and proceedings
before service tribunals’; and ‘Custodial offences’.

59                 
Division 7 of Part III creates several ‘Miscellaneous
offences’.  The table of contents
describes them as follows:

‘Division 7 – Miscellaneous offences

 

55.             
Falsification of service documents

56.             
False statement in relation to application for benefit

57.             
False statement in relation to appointment or
enlistment

58.             
Unauthorised disclosure of information

59.             
Dealing in, or possessing, narcotic goods

60.             
Prejudicial behaviour’.



60                 
Division 8, which contains s 61, was
central to the argument before us.  It
provides:

‘Division 8 – Other
offences



Other offences

 

61.       (1)        A person, being a defence member or a
defence civilian, is guilty of an offence if:



(a)              
he does or omits to do, in the Jervis Bay Territory, an
act or thing the doing or omission of which is a Territory offence;

(b)       he does or omits
to do, in a public place outside the Jervis Bay Territory, an act or thing the
doing or omission of which, if it took place in a public place in the Jervis
Bay Territory, would be a Territory offence; or

(c)        he does or omits
to do (whether in a public place or not) outside the Jervis Bay Territory an
act or thing the doing or omission of which, if it took place (whether in a
public place or not) in the Jervis Bay Territory, would be a Territory offence.



(2)              
The punishment for an offence against subsection
(1) is:



(a)              
if the relevant Territory offence is punishable by a
fixed punishment – that fixed punishment; or

(b)              
in any other case – a punishment not more severe than
the maximum punishment for the relevant Territory offence.’



61                 
A ‘Territory offence’ is defined by s 3(1)
as follows:

“Territory offence” means:



(a)              
an offence against a law of the Commonwealth in force
in the Jervis Bay Territory other than this Act or the regulations;

(b)              
an offence punishable under the Crimes Act, 1900 of the
State of New South Wales, in its application to the Jervis Bay Territory, as
amended or affected by Ordinances in force in that Territory; or

(c)              
an offence against the Police Offences Act 1930 of the Australian
Capital Territory, in its application to the Jervis Bay Territory, as amended
or affected by Ordinances from time to time in force in the Jervis Bay
Territory;... ’



62                 
Division 9 of the Discipline Act, entitled
‘Miscellaneous’, deals with punishment (ss 62, 64 and 65), and with
consent for proceedings for certain offences (s 63).

63                 
Section 63(1) provides:

‘63.      (1)        Except with the consent of the Director
of Public Prosecutions, proceedings under this Act shall not be instituted for:



(a)              
an offence against subsection 61(1) that is alleged to
have been committed in Australia and in relation to which the relevant
Territory offence is:



(i)                
treason, murder, manslaughter or bigamy;

(ia)       an offence
against section 92A, 92B, 92C, 92D or 92E of the Crimes Act 1900 of the State of New South
Wales, in its application to the Australian Capital Territory, as amended or
affected by Ordinances in force in that Territory;

(ii)              
an offence in respect of which proceedings could not be
brought in the Jervis Bay Territory without the consent of a Minister, the
Director of Public Prosecutions or a person authorised by the Director of
Public Prosecutions to give consent; or

(iii)            
an offence prescribed for the purposes of this section;
or

(b)              
a service offence that is an ancillary offence in
relation to an offence referred to in paragraph (a).’



64                 
A ‘service offence’ is defined by s 34(1)
to mean:

‘(a)      an offence against this Act or the regulations;

(b)       an offence that:



(i)                
is an ancillary offence in relation to an offence
against this Act or the regulations; and

(ii)              
was committed by a person at a time when he was a
defence member or a defence civilian; or



(c)               
an old system offence; ….’



65                 
An ‘old system offence’ is defined by
s 3(1) to mean:

‘... an offence under
previous service law that was committed by a member of the Defence Force at any
time during the period of 3 years that ended on the day immediately before the
proclaimed date; ….’



66                 
Part IV of the Discipline Act (ss 66 – 85)
deals with punishments imposed, and orders made by service tribunals.

67                 
Part V (ss 86 – 100) deals with summons,
arrest, custody and suspension from duty.

Time limitations

68                 
Section 96, which was also, as mentioned, much
emphasised in the appellant’s argument, provides:

‘Time limitation on
charges 



 96.       (1)       
A person shall not be charged with:



 (a)     an
offence against this Act (other than subsection 61 (1)) or the regulations;
or



(b)      a service offence that is an ancillary
offence in relation to an offence referred to in paragraph (a),



after the
expiration of a period of 3 years after the time at which the

offence is
alleged to have been committed.



            (2)        Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1), a person may be charged
with: 



(a)        an
offence against section 15, 16, 20 or 22; or



(b)        a service offence that is an ancillary
offence in relation to an offence referred to in paragraph (a);



at any time.



(3)        A reference in subsection (1) to a
period shall be read as not including a reference to a period during which the
person:



(a)        
was a prisoner of war;



(b)        was absent without leave; or



(c)        was
serving a sentence of imprisonment.



(4)        A
person shall not be charged with an offence against sub-section 61 (1) or a
service offence that is an ancillary offence in relation to an offence against
subsection 61 (1) if the time that has elapsed since the offence is alleged to
have been committed equals or exceeds the period of time that would bar trial
by, or institution of proceedings in, a court exercising jurisdiction in or in
relation to the Jervis Bay Territory for the relevant Territory offence.



(5)        A
person shall not be charged with, or tried for, an old system offence if he
could not have been charged with, or tried for, as the case may be, that
offence if the provisions of previous service law imposing a time limitation on
such a charge or trial were still in force.



(6)        A person who has ceased to be a
member of the Defence Force or a defence civilian shall not be charged with a
service offence unless:



(a)       the period that has elapsed since he so
ceased does not exceed 6 months; and



(b)       the maximum punishment for the service
offence is imprisonment for a period of 2 years or a punishment that is more
severe than that punishment.’ 
(Emphasis added.)



69                 
Part XII of the Discipline Act deals with
miscellaneous matters, including s 190, which provides as follows:

‘Jurisdiction of civil courts in relation to offences



190.     (1)        Subject to the Constitution, a
civil court does not have jurisdiction to try a charge of a service offence.



(2)        Subject
to sub-sections (3), (4) and (5), the jurisdiction of a civil court to try a
charge for a civil court offence is not affected by this Act.



(3)        Where
a court martial or a Defence Force magistrate has, under section 77, taken a
service offence into consideration in relation to a convicted person, the
person is not liable to be tried by a civil court for a civil court offence
that is substantially the same offence.  [See below]



(4)        A civil court does not have
jurisdiction to try a charge of a civil court offence that:



(a)        is an ancillary offence in relation to
an offence against this Act (other than sub-section 61 (1)) or the regulations;
and



(b)        was committed by a person at a time when
he was a defence member or a defence civilian.



(5)        Where
a person has been acquitted or convicted of a service offence, the person is
not liable to be tried by a civil court for a civil court offence that is
substantially the same offence.  [See below]



(6)        For
the purposes of this section:



(a)       the dismissal of a charge under section
130, 132 or 135 shall be deemed to be an acquittal of the service offence the
subject of the charge;



(b)       the dismissal of a charge under previous
service law shall be deemed to be an acquittal of the service offence the
subject of the charge; and



(c)        a direction under section 103, 110 or
111 that a charge be not proceeded with shall be deemed not to be an acquittal
of the service offence the subject of the charge.’



70                 
(In Re Tracey; Ex parte Ryan (1989) 166
CLR 518, to which reference will be made later, the High Court held that
s 190(3) and (5) were constitutionally invalid, but severable.)

‘Other offences’ – Jervis Bay ‘Territory
offences’

71                 
As mentioned, the charge referred to s 61
and s 26 of the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT), and to ‘Other offences –
Commission of Territory offences being the offence of common assault’.

72                 
It will be recalled that s 61(1)(b)
provided, inter alia, that a defence member is guilty of an offence if
he does, in a public place outside the Jervis Bay Territory, an act the doing
of which, if it took place in a public place in the Jervis Bay Territory, would
be a ‘Territory offence’.

73                 
By s 4A of the Jervis Bay Territory
Acceptance Act 1915 (Cth), the criminal law applying in that Territory was,
in effect, that enacted in the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT), as picked up in
the latter Territory.  However, upon the
grant of self-government to the Australian Capital Territory, the (ACT) Crimes
Legislation (Statutory and Citation) Act 1992 referred to the (ACT) Crimes
Act 1900.  Although par (b) of the
definition of ‘Territory Offence’ in s 3(1) of the Discipline Act refers
to an Ordinance, the Discipline Act is not such.  Nor did the (ACT) Crimes Act 1900
apply.  But, on 8 November 1996, the
Discipline Act was amended (retrospectively to 28 May 1992) to change
references in the Act to (NSW) Crimes Act 1900 to (ACT) Crimes Act
1900.  The Schedule of the amendment
provided, in case of any doubt, that the validity of steps taken between 1992
and 1996 was not unlawful.

74                 
The Crimes Act 1900 (ACT) creates, of
course, a full range of offences. 
Section 26, mentioned in the charge, is found in Part III of that Act
(ss 10 – 47) – ‘Offences against the person’.  The offences include murder (s 12);
manslaughter (s 15) and several kinds of assault, including assault
occasioning actual bodily harm (s 24 – five years imprisonment), and common
assault (s 26 – two years imprisonment) (emphasis added).  No time limit for prosecution of this offence
(s 26) is stipulated in that Act.

The Discipline
Act procedural provisions

Provisions with respect to courts martial

75                 
These provisions are in Division 3 (ss 114
– 126) of Part VII, which deals with service tribunals.  Section 115(1) of the Discipline Act confers,
subject to s 63, jurisdiction to try any charge against any person.

Provisions with respect to Defence Force
magistrates

76                 
Section 129(1) (found in Division 4 of Part VII)
provides that a Defence Force magistrate has the same jurisdiction and powers
as a restricted court martial.

Provisions as to trial by a Defence Force
magistrate

77                 
These are found in Division 2 of Part VIII,
which deals with procedure of service tribunals.  

78                 
Section 135(1) provides:

‘Trial by Defence Force
magistrate



135.     (1)         A Defence Force magistrate shall
try a charge in accordance with the following provisions:



(a)        before the Defence Force magistrate
commences to hear the evidence on the charge, the Defence Force magistrate
shall ask the accused person whether he pleads guilty or not guilty to the
charge and, if the accused person pleads guilty and the Defence Force
magistrate is satisfied that the accused person understands the effect of that
plea, the Defence Force magistrate shall convict the accused person;



(b)       if the accused person pleads not guilty
or if the Defence Force magistrate is not satisfied that the accused person, in
pleading guilty, understands the effect of that plea, the Defence Force
magistrate shall record a plea of not guilty and proceed to hear the evidence on
the charge;



(c)        if the Defence Force magistrate, after
hearing the evidence on the charge adduced by the prosecution, rules that that
evidence is insufficient to support the charge, the Defence Force magistrate
shall dismiss the charge;



(d          if the Defence Force magistrate, after
hearing the evidence on the charge adduced by the prosecution, rules that that
evidence is sufficient to support the charge, the Defence Force magistrate
shall proceed with the trial;



(e)        if the Defence Force magistrate finds the
accused person not guilty, the Defence Force magistrate shall acquit the
accused person;



(f)        if the Defence Force magistrate finds
the accused person guilty, the Defence Force magistrate shall convict the
accused person;



(g)       if the Defence Force magistrate convicts
the accused person, the Defence Force magistrate shall take action under Part
IV in relation to the convicted person.’



Provisions with respect to applications and
objections by an accused person

79                 
Section 141(1) (within the ‘General’ part of Division
3 of Part VIII) provides:

‘Applications and objections



141.     (1)        At any time before an accused
person is asked to plead at a trial by a service tribunal, the accused
person -



(a)        may
do any one or more of the following:



(i)                
apply
for an adjournment on the ground that he has not had an adequate opportunity to
prepare his defence or to choose a person to represent or advise him;



(ii)              
apply
to secure the attendance of witnesses or additional witnesses on his behalf;



(iii)            
if he
is charged with more than one service offence, apply for each charge to be
heard separately;



(iv)            
if he
is charged with one or more other persons, apply to be dealt with separately on
the ground that he would otherwise be prejudiced in his defence;



(v)              
make
such other applications as he considers relevant in connection with the trial; and



(b)         may enter an objection to the charge
on any ground, including any of the following grounds:



(i)                
that,
by virtue of section 144, he is not liable to be tried by the service tribunal
for the service offence with which he has been charged;



(ii)              
that
the charge was made in contravention of section 96;



(iii)            
that
he has, in the exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy, been pardoned for
the service offence with which he has been charged or for a civil court offence
that is substantially the same offence;



(iv)       that the charge does not disclose a
service offence or is otherwise wrong in law;



(v)        that the service tribunal does not
have jurisdiction.’ 
(Emphasis added.)



80                 
By s 141(5)  where a service tribunal is satisfied that
the interests of justice require that the application be granted, the tribunal
shall grant it.

Previous acquittal or conviction

81                 
Section 144(3) provides that where a person has
been acquitted or convicted by a civil court of a civil court offence, the person
is not liable to be tried by a service tribunal for a service offence that is
substantially the same offence.

Procedure similar to court of Jervis Bay
Territory

82                 
The procedure at a trial is similar to that
which is followed in a trial or indictment of a court of the Jervis Bay
Territory.  As Mason CJ, Wilson and
Dawson JJ said in Re Tracey at 537:

‘[I]n trying offences under Pt III of
the Act, a service tribunal has practically all the characteristics of a court
exercising judicial power.’



83                 
Section 146(1) (in Division 3 of Part VIII)
provides:

‘Rules
of evidence



146.     (1)         Subject to regulations in force
under subsection (2), the rules of evidence in force in the Jervis Bay
Territory apply to proceedings before a service tribunal as if: 



(a)              
the
tribunal were a court exercising jurisdiction in or in relation to that
Territory; and



(b)              
the
proceedings were criminal proceedings in such a court.’



Events leading to the trial

84                 
In
his affidavit sworn 24 July 2003 read to the Tribunal, the appellant said:

‘6.        …[M]y legal officers also advised me
that there was an issue about the legal validity of the charge.  My legal officers advised me that they could
argue that the charge was legally invalid, however, if that argument failed, I should
plead guilty because I was technically guilty of assaulting CAPT Higgins.  I agreed to take that course.



7.                 
On
the day of my trial my counsel, FLTLT Booth, said to me words to the effect:



“I have spoken to the prosecutor about the objection to the validity of
the charge.  They are not prepared to
deal with that issue today.  If we want
to run that argument the matter will have to be adjourned for up to 12
months.  The prosecutor also told me that
a senior barrister had already considered the argument I propose to make about
the validity of the charge and he thinks that it is wrong.  Your options are to either plead guilty today
and get it over and done with, or have the matter adjourned for 12 months.  I think you should plead guilty.”



8.                 
As a
result of what my defending officer told me, I did not feel that I had any
other realistic option but to plead guilty. 
I was conscious of the fact that having had this matter hang over my
head for the past five years was causing my family and me significant stress and
depression.  So much so we had been seeking
counselling from a psychologist.  I
decided that I could not subject myself and my family to another 12 months of
that trauma, for the sake of advancing what I was told was a wrong argument
about the validity of the charge, only then to have to plead guilty
anyway.  For those reasons, I told my
defending officers I would plead guilty. 
If I was aware that there were reasonable prospects of succeeding on a
challenge to the charge on the grounds proposed to be advanced in this appeal
and that I was entitled to have those arguments put to the Defence Force
magistrate much sooner than 12 months time, I would not have pleaded guilty.’



The trial before the Defence Force
magistrate

85                 
At the commencement of the hearing, the
appellant pleaded guilty to the charge.

86                 
The following exchange then took place between
the Defence Force magistrate (Lt Col Hevey) and Flt Lt Booth (for the
appellant):

‘COL HEVEY:            One of the points that is exercising
my mind is that the charge relates to events which occurred almost 7 years ago.



LTCOL HOLLES:       Yes, sir.



COL HEVEY:              As the Act stood at that stage,
there was a time limit of 3 years for any offence pursuant to the Defence Force
Discipline Act.



LTCOL HOLLES:       That is correct, sir.



COL HEVEY:              There was a specific offence of assault
in relation to an inferior, which this offence seems to relate to, and in
normal accord – start again.  In accord
with normal principles, one would expect that an offence of this type would
have been prosecuted in accord with the specific offence as provided for under
the Act itself, rather than incorporating it under the Territory offence.  Do you see where I’m coming from?



LTCOL HOLLES:       Yes, sir, I do.



COL HEVEY:              And I am just concerned that the
accused is being – and I use this in no pejorative sense but simply a statement
of an apparent fact on the face of it, seems to be being caught by the
territorial provisions of the Act to escape, and I use that not in a pejorative
sense, to escape the time limits which are otherwise imposed by the Defence
Force Discipline Act.  Could you assure
me that this matter has been looked at, rather than simply – and I use this
term neutrally, “glossed over”?



LTCOL HOLLES:       Sir, it has been the subject of a
considerable amount of research by the current prosecution team and the issue
identified somewhat earlier in the piece, advice from a very senior
representative of the Melbourne Panel was sought, specifically to address the
concerns which you have raised, sir, and the opinion of that Senior Member of
the Panel, and with great respect to that Senior Member which is shared by the
entire prosecution team, was that the nature and effect of the Act upon which
the prosecution relies to found the charge was more adequately expressed in
terms of the Territory defence rather than the disciplinary defence under the
DFDA.



COL HEVEY:  Yes, thank you.  Flight Lieutenant Booth, I ask of you the
same question and specifically give you the opportunity for the sake of the
transcript to take objection should you wish at this stage.  Now, I know that you have considered this
matter but I would like it on the transcript that this matter is effectively
being dealt with today despite any problem that might otherwise have existed
with time limits.



FLTLT BOOTH:         Upon my instructions, sir, I take no
objection.’



87                 
Lt Col Holles (for the prosecution) then
tendered a statement of agreed facts, as follows:

‘Agreed Facts



In August 96 MAJ Hoffman
(the accused) was the OC 2 Coy 1 Cdo Regt. 
At that time the unit was taking part in Exercise Night Crocodile 96 in
the Shoalwater Bay training area (SWBTA). 
240262 CAPT P. B. Higgins was at that time a LT in 1 Cdo Regt.  Higgins was present at a briefing in the 1
Cdo Regt briefing tent at Samuel Hill, SWBTA together with other officers and
senior NCOs, including the accused.



During the briefing, the
accused made a comment that prior to the exercise he had been receiving many
calls from a Media Liaison Officer in Melbourne and that he was tired of
receiving such calls.  Higgins suggested that
the accused get the calls put through to Higgins.  Higgins intended this comment as a joke.  He was on exercise and could not receive
calls.



The accused drew his pistol
and pointed it at Higgins.  The accused
then made a comment to Higgins which had the effect of causing alarm to
Higgins.  The accused did not intend to
alarm Higgins.  He then returned the
weapon to its holster.



Higgins felt shock.  He also felt threatened and scared.  Higgins was unaware of the state of the
weapon.  He was not aware as to whether
the weapon was at load, action or instant. 
He was aware that at that range even a blank cartridge could cause
injury or worse.



The accused has stated that
he did not intend to assault Higgins by this action.  The accused concedes that he was reckless as
to the consequences of his action. 
Immediately after the incident Higgins spoke to a number of his fellow
junior officers and because of his position as a recent officer graduate he
believed that the matter if reported may affect his subsequent career.



A formal complaint was made
in late 1999 and a service police statement was taken on 19 sep 00, which has
led to the present proceedings.’



88                 
The Defence Force magistrate then decided to convict the appellant, but
without punishment.

89                 
In his sentencing remarks, the Defence Force magistrate said:

‘In the normal course of
events, one would have expected that this charge would have been preferred
under [s] 34
of the [Discipline
Act], assault on an inferior.  Had
that occurred, then the offence would be now statute barred.  At the time that the offence was committed,
that is somewhere in August 1996, the time limit which was then in place was a
period of 3 years.  In 1999, the [Discipline Act] was
amended to extend that period to 5 years, so on either version of thoselimitation
periods, the charge being preferred in 2002 would have been out of time.



However, the prosecution
have bought this charge by reason of [s] 61 of the [Discipline Act], which allows the inclusion of what is known
as, “territorial offences”, and by relying on the charge of common assault as
it appears in [s] 26
of the [ACT]
Crimes Act, then, the prosecution are able to bring this offence, despite the
fact that it is more than 6 years old.  I
go into that in some detail because it is a very relevant factor in the
sentencing options which I must consider.’



90                 
He later added:

‘I will not attach blame to
the delay which has occurred, but it is my very strong view that the delay is
inexcusable.  That any person, pardon me,
be they Major, a Private, or General, could have an investigation hanging over
their heads since, at the very earliest 1999 through today, brings no credit to
the Defence Force.



Had this man been properly
dealt with and properly punished in 1996, or seven, or indeed in 1998, or nine,
then the effects of any punishment which may have been awarded would have been
today effectively overcome.  Even if
dealt with in 1999, then the accused would currently still have at least three
or four clear reporting periods at that time and would be now in a position
where he would be eligible for consideration for promotion.  All of his reporting periods sine this
offence have been clear.  All of them
have been, as I have mentioned before, of the very highest standing.’



The decision of the Defence Force Discipline
Appeal Tribunal

91                 
By a majority (Heerey and Duggan JJ, Mildren J
dissenting) the appeal was dismissed.

92                 
The leading reasons for decision were given by
Duggan J.

93                 
His Honour rejected the appellant’s argument,
which was based on the reasoning of McHugh J (Toohey J concurring) in Saraswati
v The Queen (1991) 172 CLR 1 at 30 (see below), that a Territory offence
(such as s 26 of the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT)) could not be used where
the conduct alleged also amounted to specific service offences, e.g. ss 33
or 34 of the Discipline Act;
that is, the argument went, s 61 was intended to supplement, but not
duplicate the specific service offences created by the Discipline Act, so that, it was said, s 61 must be read
down so as to pick up Territory offence only where there is (as here) no
service offence under ss 15 to 60 with substantially the same physical and
mental elements.

94                 
Referring to the principle explained by Gavan
Duffy CJ and Dixon J in Anthony Hordern & Sons Ltd v Amalgamated
Clothing and Allied Trades Union of Australia (1932) 47 CLR 1 at 7 that a
‘statutory power, expressed in general form, is not to be construed so as to
avoid any condition or limitation placed on the exercise of a specific power’,
relied on by the appellant, Duggan J said (at [49]):

‘The principle of
interpretation expressed in Anthony Hordern does not govern the present case.  Section 61 is expressed in general terms in
the sense that it picks up all offences applicable to the Territory.  However, the effect of the section is to add
an extensive group of offences to those which may be charged against a defence
member.  In those cases where the conduct
could amount to the commission of more than one offence, the particular offence
to be charged is left to prosecutorial discretion.



I am also of the view that
the existence of a limitation period for charging offences other than s 61
offences does not advance the appellant’s argument.  I have pointed out that in Saraswati McHugh J
took into account the principle that a general expression of power is not to be
used to defeat a limitation on the exercise of a specific power.  However, the issue of limitation periods is
dealt with in detail in s 96 of the [Discipline Act] ….’



95                 
Duggan J turned next to the appellant’s argument
that the proceedings constituted an abuse of the process of the court, since
the prosecutor charged the appellant with the s 61 offence so as to avoid
the limitation period applicable to the offences under ss 33 and 34
of  the Discipline Act.

96                 
Rejecting the argument, Duggan J said (at [53] –
[55]):

‘It would appear that the
limitation period for the offences under ss 33 and 34 had expired by the
time the victim reported the matter.  It
is stated in the agreed facts that he delayed reporting the incident because he
was a recent officer graduate and believed that if he reported the matter it
could [a]ffect
his subsequent career.



In these circumstances and
bearing in mind that the charging of an s 61 offence was one of the
options available to the prosecuting authority, it cannot be said that the
exercise of that option was an abuse of the process of the court.



In any event, the defence
force magistrate drew attention to the time limit issue at the commencement of
the proceedings before him.  He gave the
defending officer the opportunity to object on this ground but the latter
stated that, upon his instructions he took no objection.’



97                 
In considering the appellant’s claim for a stay
of proceedings because of the delay of almost seven years since the alleged
offence, Duggan J said (at [56]):

‘There will be some cases in
which delay and its consequences render a fair trial impossible:  Watson v Gardiner  (1993)
177 CLR 378, Jago v
District Court (NSW) (1998) 168 CLR 23. 
However, there was no evidence to support that conclusion in the present
case.  There was no application before
the defence force magistrate to stay the proceedings.  Instead, the appellant pleaded guilty to the
charge.  The appellant cannot succeed on
this ground.’



98                 
Duggan J added (at [57]):

‘I would reject the further
argument that the conviction should be set aside because the appellant was not
advised that he could apply to have the charge stayed as an abuse of
process.  The grounds upon which it was
suggested that such an application might have been made could not have
succeeded for the reasons I have canvassed.’



Conclusions on this appeal

99                 
It is submitted, on behalf of the appellant,
that a plea of guilty should be set aside on an appeal against conviction if a
substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred (see Hembury v Chief of the
General Staff (1998) 193 CLR 641); 
and that such miscarriage will have occurred where the accused could not
in law have been convicted of the offences charged (see R v Kouroumalos
[2000] NSWCCA 453 at [16];  R v
Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 at 121 – 122;  R v Caruso (1988) 37 A Crim R 1);  or where it appeared that the accused had not
been properly advised by counsel and had ‘an arguable case’ for acquittal, or
by logical extension, to have the charges stayed for an abuse of process (see R
v Favero [1999] NSWCCA 320;  R v
Whitehead [2000] NSWCCA 400 at [25] – [29]).  That is to say, the argument goes, little
significance may attach to the plea of guilty if, as the appellant contends,
the charge was wrong in law or an incorrect exercise of jurisdiction.  Such defects go to the heart of the
conviction.  The appellant cannot give
validity to a charge merely by pleading guilty. 
A valid charge for an offence within the jurisdiction of the Defence
Force magistrate was
an essential jurisdictional fact, so that the erroneous exercise of
jurisdiction in this case amounts to a substantial miscarriage of justice.  If the charge and conviction in the
circumstances of the present case was a serious abuse of process that should
never have been allowed, this amounts to a substantial miscarriage of
justice.  

100              
These general principles are not, and could not
be, in issue.  But their application in
the present circumstances is seriously disputed by the respondent.

Ground 1 of the appeal

101              
In his first ground of appeal, the appellant
contends that the Tribunalshould have held that the Defence Force magistrate erred in law by
purporting to exercise jurisdiction under s 129 and s 115 by trying the
charge;  convicting the appellant under
s 135;  and taking action under Part
IV and by imposing punishment pursuant to s 75 – because upon their proper
construction, s 61(1) and s 190(5) of the Discipline Act do not proscribe as a service offence conduct
that would constitute a civil offence under s 26 of the Crimes Act 1900
(ACT), when ss 33(a) and 34 of the Discipline
Act specifically provide for a service offence for substantially the same
physical and mental elements. 
Accordingly, it is said, there was, as a matter of jurisdiction, no
charge of a service offence and no conviction of a service offence. 

102              
The appellant again relies upon the passage from
the reference in the judgment of McHugh J in Saraswati (at 30)
(mentioned above) – 

‘... to the context rule of statutory construction
which holds that a general provision in a statute is not to be construed so as
to avoid the conditions or limitations contained in a specific provision in the
same statute.’



103              
The appellant submits that the circumstances of
this case are almost indistinguishable from Saraswati:  that is to say, ss 15 – 60 of Part III of the
Discipline Act set out a number
of specific military offences;  most of
those provisions proscribe specific military conduct that, by their very
subject matter, meet the requirement of ‘substantially serving the purpose of
maintaining or enforcing service discipline’ as held in Re Tracey;  s 61 is a more general provision in the
context of military discipline, in that the offence provisions that it picks up
do not, on their face, have any service connection;  s 61 must, the argument goes, have been
intended to supplement rather than duplicate the specific service offence
provisions of the Discipline
Act;  indeed, the Explanatory Memorandum
for the Bill at par 577 (see below) speaks of the provision being
‘complementary’ and there is no apparent intention or purpose in a construction
amounting to duplication;  nor, the
argument runs, did s 190 in its original form address the consequence of
this type of duplication.

The 1973 Working Party Report

104              
The origins of the Discipline Act are found in the Defence Force Disciplinary
Code:  Report of the 1973 Working Party
(1974) Parliamentary Paper No. 48 (‘the 1973 Working Party Report’) which
reported with a proposal for a Defence (Discipline and Justice) Bill 1974.  The Working Party Report stated that it had
‘tried to produce a disciplinary code which is uniform [i.e. unifying the codes
of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force], Australian and modern’.

105              
In its description of the ‘major changes’ in its
proposed draft, the Party said, inter alia:

‘An analysis of offences of
conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline tried by court martial
led to the creation of additional specific offences (section 61 – driving
offences, section 62 – assaults and disturbances ... ) which should minimise the use of charges of “conduct to
the prejudice”.



... 



Part of the value of setting
out offences in a disciplinary code lies in their declaratory significance as a
code of military conduct.  Their
educational and preventative value has been obscured or distorted by
unrealistic maximum punishments.  It does
not enhance discipline to hold out minor breaches as serious crimes and we have
not hesitated to reduce drastically maximum punishments.’



106              
In its description of ‘collateral matters’, the
Party referred to the Australian Capital Territory Criminal Laws and said:

‘Disciplinary codes
traditionally rely on the ordinary criminal law for the less frequently
committed criminal offences.  One of the
more striking anomalies of the present service codes is their dependence on the
criminal law of England.  We have
proposed in section 68 to substitute the criminal law of the Australian Capital
Territory.’



107              
In Part III of the Report’s draft Bill, dealing
with ‘offences’, Division 1 dealt with ‘service offences’.  Section 61 dealt with ‘offences in relation
to vehicles’;  and s 62 with
‘assaults, insulting words etc.’.

108              
Division 2 dealt with ‘civil offences’, and
s 68 dealt with that topic specifically.

109              
Section 68 provided:

‘68.      (1)        A person who
commits a civil offence whether in Australia or elsewhere shall be guilty of an
offence.



(2)              
In this Division, the expression “civil offence” means
an act or omission punishable by a law in force in the Australian Capital
Territory (other than this Act) or which if committed in that Territory would
be punishable by that law.



(3)              
a person convicted of a civil offence is liable to be
sentenced in accordance with the following provisions –



(a)              
if the civil offence is punishable by a fixed
punishment, he shall be sentenced to that punishment; and



(b)              
if the civil offence is punishable by a maximum
punishment, he may be sentenced to that punishment or to a punishment that
under this Act is less severe.



(4)              
The regulations may provide that notwithstanding
sub-section (2) –



(a)              
a specific provision of a law in force in the
Australian Capital Territory is not to be incorporated, in this Division; or



(b)              
the provisions of a specific law in force in the
Australian Capital Territory are not to be, or are to cease to be, incorporated
in this Division.’



The Explanatory Memorandum for the Defence
Force Discipline Bill 1982

110              
The Memorandum noted (par 7) that the procedure
under the Bill by which charges against an accused person are heard and brought
to trial ‘is in many respects analogous to that by which an alleged offence is
heard and tried by the civil courts’.

111              
In relation to the offences and punishments, the
Memorandum explained that the principal changes from existing law were:

‘Offences and punishments



a.                 
Revision of all service offences, including the discarding
of outmoded offences, the introduction of new offences in order to reduce the
reliance on charges of “conduct to the prejudice” and a systematic review of
the mental elements of each offence.



b.                 
Reduction of maximum punishments to modern levels, the
demarcation of serious offences from mere breaches of discipline by the
provision of appropriate maximum punishments and the correlation of the mental
elements of offences and maximum punishments.



c.                 
Substitution of the law of the Australian Capital
Territory for the law of England as the appropriate law for the purposes of
providing offences, not purely military in character, that may be tried by
service tribunals.’



112              
In its explanation of ‘other offences’ in
Division 8 of Part III, the Memorandum said (of cl 61 of the Bill):

‘576.    This clause creates certain offences triable by service tribunals
that are offences against the ordinary law. 
The offences are applicable to defence members and defence civilians.



577.         
The selection of offences for this purpose is, to a
degree, dictated by the scope of the Crimes (Overseas) Act 1964, to which the
Bill is, in this respect, complementary . ...’



113              
The Memorandum added:

‘578.    Sub-clause (1) creates offences of acts or omissions which would
be Territory offences if they took place in the Australian Capital
Territory.  The definition of “Territory
offence” in sub-clause 3(1) identifies the offences that are to be offences for
this purpose as being offences against the laws of the Commonwealth (excluding
this Bill and the Criminal Investigation Bill 1982), the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)
in its application in the Australian Capital Territory, and the Police Offences
Ordinance 1930 (ACT). ...’



114              
The Memorandum noted (par 585) that cl 68 of the
Bill made similar provision to that under the previous law (which picked up
offences against the laws of England) except that it provided for any offence
under the law in force in the Australian Capital Territory to be triable.

Decisions of the High Court on the operation
of the Discipline Act

115              
The operation of the Discipline Act has been considered by the High Court on several
occasions.  In my opinion, it is
essential to have regard to the reasoning in these cases.  Although the issues before the Court were
constitutional in form, the substance of the reasoning adopted bears upon the
appellant’s argument, at least by necessary implication.

Re Tracey

116              
The prosecutor there was charged with three
offences under the Discipline
Act:  one of making a false entry in a
service document, contrary to s 55(1)(b); 
and two charges of being absent without leave, contrary to
s 24(1).  The charges came before a
Defence Force magistrate.  In the High Court the prosecutor claimed,
firstly, that the Defence Force magistrate
was exercising the judicial power of the Commonwealth, contrary to Ch III of
the Constitution;  secondly, that each of
the charges was an indictable offence against a law of the Commonwealth and, as
such, was required by  s 80 of the
Constitution to be heard before a jury as a trial on indictment;  and thirdly, that s 190 of the Discipline Act was invalid as
contrary to Ch III.  The Full High Court
(Mason CJ, Wilson, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ) held that
trials for service offences were not, under the Discipline Act, trials on indictment.

117              
A majority of the Court (Mason CJ, Wilson,
Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ) held that although a service tribunal exercised
judicial power, it did not exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth
since the defence power (s 51(vi)) contained power to enact a disciplinary
code standing outside Ch III, and to impose upon those administering it a duty
to act judicially.

118              
Deane J was of the opinion that jurisdiction
could be validly conferred on a service tribunal for exclusively disciplinary
offences only.

119              
Gaudron J was of the opinion that jurisdiction
could be validly conferred only for service charges in respect of conduct
outside Australia which were not substantially the same as civil court
offences.

120              
It was further held by Mason CJ, Wilson and
Dawson JJ that s 61 is valid on the ground that it is within the power of
the Parliament to provide that any conduct which constitutes a civil offence
shall constitute a service offence if committed by a member.

121              
(As mentioned above) Mason CJ, Wilson, Brennan,
Dawson and Toohey JJ held that the provisions of ss 190(3) and (5) are
beyond the defence power since they interfere with the exercise by State courts
of their general criminal jurisdiction, but that they are severable from the
Act’s valid provisions.

122              
In rejecting the prosecutor’s submission that
s 61(1) of the Discipline
Act exceeded the defence power, Mason CJ, Wilson and Dawson JJ noted (at 541)
first, that the scope of s 61(1) is ‘severely limited’ by s 63,
requiring the Attorney-General’s consent for certain proceedings; and,
secondly, the circumstance that pre-1900 in the United Kingdom and in the
Australian colonies, there was legislation conferring powers upon
courts-martial to try members of the forces for civil offences, including a
provision that a person might be convicted in a civil court, having been
sentenced by a court martial for the same offence, but that any military
punishment that he had already undergone should be taken into account (at 542).

123              
Their Honours said (at 543 – 544):

‘[B]oth as a matter of history and of
contemporary practice, it has  commonly
been considered appropriate for the proper discipline of a defence force to
subject its members to penalties under service law for the commission of offences
punishable under civil law even where the only connexion between the offences
and the defence force is the service membership of the offender.  Such legislation is based upon the premise
that, as a matter of discipline, the proper administration of a defence force
requires the observance by its members of the standards of behaviour demanded
of ordinary citizens and the enforcement of those standards by military
tribunals.  To act in contravention of
those standards is not only to break the law, but also to act to the prejudice
of good order and military discipline. 
It is appropriate that such conduct should be punished in the interests
not only of the community but of the defence force as well.’



124              
Their Honours went on to say (at 544) that ‘it
is not possible to draw a clear and satisfactory line between offences
committed by defence members which are of a military character and those which
are not’.

125              
It followed, their Honours said (at 545), that –

‘... it is for Parliament to decide what it considers
necessary and appropriate for the maintenance of good order and discipline in
those forces.  And Parliament’s decision
will prevail so long at any rate as the rule which it prescribes is
sufficiently connected with the regulation of the forces and the good order and
discipline of defence members.’



126              
It further followed, their Honours held (at
545), that ‘the selection of a law or laws defining such civil offences for
that purpose must also be a matter for Parliament’.

127              
Accordingly, Mason CJ, Wilson and Dawson JJ held
(at 545) that s 61 is validly enacted.

128              
As mentioned, Brennan and Toohey JJ were of the
same conclusion, but with somewhat different reasoning.

129              
Their Honours said (at 569 – 570):

‘There are two sets of
constitutional objectives to be reconciled. 
The first set of objectives, dictated by s. 51(vi), consist of the
defence of the Commonwealth and of the several States and the control of the
armed forces.  To achieve these
objectives, it is appropriate to repose in service authorities a broad authority,
to be exercised according to the exigencies of time, place and circumstance, to
impose discipline on defence members and defence civilians.  The second set of objectives, dictated both
by Ch. III and s. 106 of the Constitution and by the constitutional history we
have traced, consist of recognition of the pre-ordinate jurisdiction of the
civil courts and the protection of civil rights which those courts assure alike
to civilians and to defence members and defence civilians who are charged with
criminal offences.  To achieve these
objectives, civil jurisdiction should be exercised when it can conveniently and
appropriately be invoked and the jurisdiction of service tribunals should not
be invoked, except for the purpose of maintaining or enforcing service
discipline. These two sets of constitutional imperatives point to the limits of
the valid operation of the Discipline Act. 
It may not impair civil jurisdiction but it may empower service
tribunals to maintain or enforce discipline. 
Therefore proceedings may be brought against a defence member or a
defence civilian for a service offence, if, but only if, those proceedings can
reasonably be regarded as substantially serving the purpose of maintaining or
enforcing service discipline.



In the application of
this test, much depends on the facts of the case and the outcome may depend
upon matters of impression and degree, especially on the needs of service
discipline.’  (Emphasis added.)



130              
Brennan and Toohey JJ noted, however, that the
test is an objective one and added (at 570 – 571):

‘It must be applied by those
in whom the Discipline Act vests certain procedural powers.  The repositories include the Attorney-General
(s. 63(1)), a convening authority (ss. 103(1), 129a(1)), a
commanding officer (s. 110(1)) and a summary authority (ss. 109, 110(1), 111(2))
who may have a discretion to decide whether or not a step in proceedings for
the prosecution of a service offence should be taken.’



131              
Their Honours noted (at 571) that any such
decision is examinable under s 75(v) of the Constitution, and added (at
571):

‘Section 51(vi) does not
support a jurisdiction standing outside Ch. III of the Constitution except to
the extent that the jurisdiction serves the purpose of maintaining or enforcing
service discipline.  That being the
purpose which is essential to the jurisdiction, it is the purpose to which its
exercise must be directed.’



132              
Brennan and Toohey JJ went on to say (at 574):

‘Just as the scope of s.
51(vi) changes according to time, place and circumstance, so does the
jurisdiction of service tribunals.  But,
when that jurisdiction falls to be exercised, the power which is exercised is
not the judicial power of the Commonwealth; 
it is a power sui generis which is supported solely by s. 51(vi) for the
purpose of maintaining or enforcing service discipline.’



McWaters v Day

133              
Re Tracey was applied by the Full High
Court (Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) in McWaters
v Day (1989) 168 CLR 289.  The
respondent, a member of the defence forces, was involved in a traffic accident
within Army barracks, and charged under a State Traffic Act.  It had been held in the Supreme Court that
the respondent’s behaviour was relevantly governed by s 40(2) of the Discipline Act, which creates a
number of offences which may be committed by a defence member in connection
with the use of a vehicle;  and that this
provision was inconsistent with the State Act, which was therefore invalid to
the extent of the inconsistency by reason of s 109 of the Constitution.  However, it was held by the Full High Court
that there was no inconsistency.

134              
Of the decision in Re Tracey, the Court
said (at 297):

... [A]
majority of the Court found that the Discipline Act was to be interpreted so as
to ensure that the military disciplinary code it enacted was cumulative upon
and not exclusive of the ordinary criminal law ...’



135              
Their Honours added (at 298):

‘... [I]t is clear that the Discipline Act contemplates parallel
systems of military and ordinary criminal law and does not evince any intention
that defence force members enjoy an absolute immunity from liability under the
ordinary criminal law, notwithstanding that the Discipline Act addresses the
question of double jeopardy.  As is
implicit in the judgments in Re Tracey, the Discipline Act does not seek to do other than
enact a system of military law in accordance with the traditional and
constitutional view of the supplementary function of such law.  The different purposes underlying military
discipline and the ordinary criminal law were emphasized.’



136              
The Full High Court went on to say (at 298 –
299):

‘Parliament included in the
Discipline Act provisions which were designed to prevent civil courts from
hearing charges of civil offences which were substantially the same as service
offences.  The operation of these provisions
depended upon a trial for the service offence having taken place: s. 190(3),
(5).  Their purpose was not to exclude
the criminal law, but rather to enact a statutory rule against double jeopardy.  But s. 190(3) and (5) were held in Re Tracey to be
invalid because they involved an impermissible ouster of the jurisdiction of
the courts to try charges of civil offences. 
The Court found that their invalidity did not affect the validity of the
Discipline Act as a whole.  Nor does it
prevent the Court from making reference to the provisions as they were enacted,
for the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the Parliament in enacting the
remainder of the Act:  see Davis v. Wallace [(1922)
257 O.S. 478 at 483 – 485].



But even had s. 190(3) and
(5) been held valid, they would not have demonstrated a legislative intention
that the disciplinary code established by the Discipline Act operate to the
exclusion of the ordinary criminal law. 
Similarly, s. 144(3) provides that where a person has been tried for a
civil offence he shall not subsequently be tried for a service offence which is
substantially the same offence.  Viewed
in their context, these provisions do not suggest that the Discipline Act
intends to exclude the operation of State criminal law.’



Re Nolan

137              
Re Tracey was further considered by the High Court in
Re Nolan; Ex parte Young (1991) 172 CLR 460.  A member of the defence forces was charged
before a service tribunal with falsifying a service pay list, contrary to
s 55(1)(a) of the Discipline Act, and with using that list contrary to
s 61(1) of the Discipline Act. 
Conduct of this kind was also contrary to comparable provisions of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).  Moreover, in respect of
the second charge, of using a false instrument, the charge was laid under
s 61(1) of the Discipline Act, which adopts s 135C(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) in its application to the Australian Capital Territory.

138              
The
prosecutor sought prohibition against the Commonwealth and the Defence Force
magistrate upon these grounds (at 462):

‘1.        The offences with which the prosecutor has been charged are
all offences for which a civilian equivalent exists.  2. 
There is no reason, pertinent to the maintenance of military discipline,
why the charges should not be laid, heard and determined under the civilian
law.  3. 
That being so – (a) the Defence Force Magistrate lacks jurisdiction to
hear and determine the charges;  or (b)
in the alternative, if the Defence Force Magistrate does have jurisdiction to
hear and determine the charges, he should nevertheless decline to exercise that
jurisdiction on the ground that there exists a forum (namely, the civilian
court) by which jurisdiction might more appropriately be exercised.’



139              
Mason CJ and Dawson J said (at 472 – 473):

‘Re Tracey presented the Magistrate
with a very considerable problem.  There
was no majority for any one of the three opinions expressed in the judgments;
indeed, there was a majority rejection, at least by way of preferred view, for
each of the three opinions.  However, the
Magistrate seems to have thought, mistakenly as we understand their Honours’
judgment, that Brennan and Toohey JJ. considered that, “upon a service
authority or a tribunal finding that a sufficient service connexion exists,
then prosecution of [a service] offence automatically serves a substantial
disciplinary purpose”.  The Magistrate
therefore treated the “serving of a substantial disciplinary purpose” as
synonymous with a “sufficient service connection” and, on this footing, thought
that there was some identity of approach between their Honours and Mason C.J.,
Wilson and Dawson JJ.  However, we do not
find anything in the judgment of Brennan and Toohey JJ. which suggests that the
presence of a sufficient service connexion means automatically that the
prosecution will serve a substantial disciplinary purpose.  The Magistrate’s reasoning was mistaken in
this regard.’



140              
Having heard further argument on the scope of
the power conferred by s 51(vi) and its interrelationship with Ch III,
their Honours could ‘see no reason to resile from the view which we expressed
in Re Tracey as to the scope of the legislative power ... [that is to say]
it is open to Parliament to provide that any conduct which constitutes a civil
offence shall constitute a service offence, if committed by a defence member’
(at 474).

141              
Brennan and Toohey JJ said (at 482):

‘The doctrine that
military law is supplementary and subordinate to the general law is not
expressed in the text of the Constitution any more than the doctrine of
responsible government, yet both doctrines underpin the Constitution, inform
its interpretation, and are calculated to secure the democratic freedom to
which the Constitution and the nation it formed aspire.  A power in the Parliament, acting in aid of
the executive, to enact a criminal law binding on defence members and defence
civilians in times of peace which would prevail over the ordinary criminal law
would be destructive of the discipline which the power to enact a supplementary
criminal law is calculated to achieve. 
The creation of a military class immune from the general criminal law
would be antithetical to the constitutional function of the Defence Force “to
execute and maintain the laws of the Commonwealth” (s. 51(vi) and to be
available to protect a State against domestic violence (s. 119).’  (Emphasis added.)



142              
Their Honours added (at 483):

‘A law creating a service
offence is denied an operation inconsistent with the operation of an ordinary
criminal law of a State, not because the will of the State legislature prevails
over the will of the Commonwealth legislature but because the support of s.
51(vi) of the Constitution for the creation of service offences vanishes when
it is impracticable to obey simultaneously the law creating the service offence
and the ordinary criminal law enforceable by the courts of this country.’



143              
Reiterating the view they had expressed in Re
Tracey, Brennan and Toohey JJ said (at 484 – 485):

‘In some circumstances
conduct amounting to a service offence calls for proceedings to be taken before
a service tribunal in order to maintain or enforce service discipline;  in other circumstances, it does not.  That being so, Pts III and VII of the
Discipline Act, which are drawn in general terms, must be held invalid unless
they can be read down to apply only in the circumstances in which their
application is constitutionally supportable.



Though it may be
impossible to prescribe a priori the times and circumstances in which
proceedings before a service tribunal will be regarded as substantially serving
the purpose of maintaining or enforcing service discipline, it does not follow
that a failure by the Discipline Act expressly to restrict the application of
these general provisions destroys its validity.  Though the Discipline Act appears to
authorize an exercise of jurisdiction in every case literally falling within
its terms, and thus to authorize an invalid as well as a valid exercise of the
jurisdiction to hear and determine charges of committing service offences, the
distributive operation of the Discipline Act is confined by s. 15a
of the Acts Interpretation Act so that the
jurisdiction conferred on service tribunals is available for exercise only on
occasions when there is constitutional support for its exercise.’ 
(Emphasis added.)



Re Tyler

144              
Re Tracey was further considered by the
High Court in Re Tyler; Ex parte Foley (1994) 181 CLR 18.  A defence member was charged before a general
court martial with dishonestly appropriating Commonwealth property in New South
Wales (by receipt of a temporary rent allowance (‘TRA’) improperly claimed in
connection with his posting to the RAAF base, Richmond) contrary to
s 47(1) of the Discipline Act
(an offence substantially the same as s 71 of the Crimes Act 1914
(Cth)), and s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  The basis of the application for prerogative
relief was that, the offence under s 47(1) being inherently criminal in
character and there being an appropriate civil court to determine the charge
against the defence member, the general court martial lacked jurisdiction.  Specifically, the defence member asserted
that the offence with which he was charged was substantially the same as an
offence against s 71 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and as an offence
against s 178ba of the Crimes Act 1900
(NSW).  He further contended that the
general court martial was not constituted in accordance with Ch III of the
Constitution and had no authority to exercise the judicial power of the
Commonwealth.  Moreover, the contention
added, a trial by general court martial was not trial by jury as required by
s 80 of the Constitution.

145              
Mason CJ and Dawson J disposed of the
application in accordance with their reasoning in Re Tracey, but added
(at 26 – 27) that, in accordance with the views expressed by Brennan J and
Toohey J in Re Tracey, Mason CJ and Dawson J would themselves have held
that the proceedings against the prosecutor in this case served the purpose of
maintaining or enforcing service discipline.

146              
Brennan J and Toohey J (at 29) maintained the
view they held in Re Nolan. Their Honours continued (at 30):

‘We do not accept the
argument that the relevant aspects of the Act cannot be supported under the
first limb of par.(vi).  The end to be
pursued is, in the words of the Constitution, the “naval and military defence of
the Commonwealth”.  Essential to that
defence is the discipline of the armed forces. 
Traditionally, the maintenance of that discipline has been through
courts martial.  The conferral of
jurisdiction on general courts martial is appropriate and adapted to the end
stated when prosecution before a court martial can reasonably be regarded as
substantially serving the purpose

of maintaining or enforcing
service discipline.’



147              
In concluding that the proceedings in question
can reasonably be regarded as substantially serving the purpose of maintaining
or enforcing service discipline, their Honours said (at 31 – 32):

‘The charge involves a
misappropriation of “service property” as that term is defined in s. 3(1) of
the Act.  The TRA scheme giving rise to
the charge is a scheme administered by the Australian Defence Force for the
benefit of defence members.  The
authority for the TRA scheme is to be found in s. 58B of the Defence Act 1903
(Cth) and the elements of the scheme, in the form of INDMAN 0503, constitute a
Defence Instruction (General) which is a “general order” as defined in s. 3(1)
of the Act.  The prosecutor was
Commanding Officer of 33 Squadron and his alleged conduct related to a scheme
instituted for the benefit of defence members, including those under the
prosecutor’s command.  The effect on
service morale and discipline by a breach of the kind alleged[ly] committed by a
commanding officer might reasonably be regarded as substantial.’



148              
McHugh J said in Re Tyler (at 38) that in
Re Nolan, he agreed with Deane J in both Re Tracey and Re
Nolan that, unless a service tribunal is established under Ch III, it has
jurisdiction to deal with an ‘offence’ only if that ‘offence’ is exclusively
disciplinary in character, or is concerned with the disciplinary aspects of
conduct which constitute an offence against the general law.  However, that conclusion, whilst still his
Honour’s view, was, McHugh J acknowledged, rejected by a majority of Justices
in both cases.  McHugh J added (at 39 –
40):

‘Furthermore, for the Court
now to hold that a service tribunal had no jurisdiction to try this case after
reaching the opposite conclusion twice in the past five and a half years would
defeat the expectations of the Parliament and

those concerned with the
administration of discipline in the defence forces.  Both the Parliament and those responsible for
the administration of service discipline could be fairly excused for thinking
that the constitutional question had been settled.  Moreover, the two decisions are confined to
the special position of the defence forces and give effect to a tradition that
has existed in this country from its earliest days.  The decisions have no authority outside the
situation of the defence forces.



Accordingly, in my opinion,
the Court should continue to follow Re Tracey and Re Nolan in any case whose circumstances are not readily
distinguishable from the circumstances of those two decisions, notwithstanding
that they contain no binding ratio decidendi.’



149              
If, for the moment, one puts aside the possible
application here of the ‘context’ rule of statutory construction mentioned by
McHugh J in Saraswati, it is, in my view, difficult to maintain, from
any of these High Court decisions, a reading down interpretation of the kind
now advanced by the appellant.  Mason CJ
and Dawson J were not prepared to read down s 61 at all.  Brennan J and Toohey J read s 61 down in
a different sense, that is to say, by requiring that the proceedings in
question can reasonably be regarded as substantially serving the purpose of
maintaining or enforcing service discipline. 
Deane J and McHugh J would also read the Discipline Act down to offences which are exclusively
disciplinary in character, or concerned with the disciplinary aspects of
conduct.

150              
None of the High Court Justices has suggested,
in any of these decisions, that the reading down construction now propounded by
the appellant applied to s 61 of the Discipline Act.  Although
the specific issue did not, of course, then squarely arise for decision, it is
only reasonable to expect that the four Justices who did allow some reading
down would, in their reasons, have adverted to any other possible reading
down.  But they did not.  At the same time, as has been said, Mason CJ
and Dawson J were against any reading down at all.

151              
Again, if for the moment, one leaves aside the
‘context’ rule of statutory construction mentioned by McHugh J in Saraswati,
it must, in my view, be accepted in this Court that no Justice of the High
Court, has expressly accepted the appellant’s contention, and, in my opinion,
each Justice has, by necessary implication, declined to do so.  In those circumstances, it is not open to
this Court to hold to the contrary, as ground 1 now asks us to do.

Saraswati

152              
Turning now to Saraswati, the appellant,
as mentioned, relies upon the reference by McHugh J there to the observations
of Gavan Duffy CJ and Dixon J in Anthony Hordern (at 7);  that is to say, the rule that when Parliament
‘explicitly gives a power by a particular provision which prescribes the mode
in which it shall be exercised and the conditions and restrictions which must
be observed, it excludes the operation of general expressions in the same
instrument which might otherwise have been relied upon for the same
power’.  His Honour described this as the
‘context’ rule (at 23).  However, McHugh
J also relied upon a purposive interpretation of the relevant statutory
provision.  In this connection, his
Honour considered the history and purpose of the particular legislation.  Toohey J agreed with McHugh J.  However, although Gaudron J also concurred in
allowing the appeal, she placed much emphasis (at 17) upon the different ‘basic
rule of construction that, in the absence of express words, an earlier
statutory provision is not repealed, altered or derogated from by a later provision
unless an intention to that effect is necessarily to be implied’.  Deane J and Dawson J dissented.

153              
Saraswati is, even on the approach taken
by McHugh J, a decision upon the construction and interpretation of a statutory
provision with no connection or analogy with the present legislation.  When, as here, the High Court has considered
the operation of the Discipline Act
on four occasions in a ‘context’ quite different from Saraswati, but
without any suggestion or mention of the reading down (significant as it is)
now propounded by the appellant, it is not, I think, open to this Court to
follow the path urged upon us by the appellant.

154              
I should add, for completeness, that, in my
view, there is nothing in the 1973 Working Party Report or the Explanatory Memorandum
which assists either party here.  No
mention is made there of any  need to
‘read down’ the operation of s 61 in the way the appellant now suggests.  It is true that par 577 of the Explanatory
Memorandum speaks of s 61 as ‘complementary’, but this is quite consistent
with the reasoning of Mason CJ and Dawson J, and of Brennan J and Toohey J.

155              
Accordingly, I would reject ground 1 of the
appeal.

Grounds 2, 3 and 5(b)(i) of the appeal

156              
In his second ground of appeal, the appellant
submits that these proceedings were an abuse of process, and should have been
stayed.

157              
The appellant contends that the Tribunal erred
by holding that for an abuse of process to arise, it was necessary for there to
have been ‘personal animus’ against the appellant;  by failing to take into account that the
Defence Force magistrate erred
in law by trying the charge and by convicting the appellant under s 135 of
the Discipline Act;  by taking action under Part 4 of the Discipline Act;  and by imposing punishment on the appellant pursuant
to s 75 of the Discipline Act.  The appellant contends that it was an abuse
of process to permit the appellant to be charged and convicted under s 61
of the Discipline Act, applying
s 26 of the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT), when ss 33(a) and 34 of the
Discipline Act provide for a
service offence for substantially the same physical and mental elements and,
when, at the time that the appellant was charged in 2002 with an offence
against s 61 of the Discipline
Act, s 96 prohibited him from being charged with an offence against
either of ss 33(a) and 34 of the Discipline
Act.

158              
Specifically, the appellant submits that:

·                   
Australian superior courts have inherent
jurisdiction to stay criminal proceedings which are an abuse of process (citing
Williams v Spautz (1992) 174 CLR 509); 
and a Defence Force magistrate
has the power to stay proceedings pursuant to the provisions of
s 141(1)(a)(v) and s 141(5) of the Discipline
Act.

·                   
The only rational reason why the appellant was
charged under s 61 instead of ss 33 and 34 was to avoid the time
limitation applying to those latter sections by s 96.  The issue of whether s 61 was being used
in this way was of obvious concern to the Defence Force magistrate.  The
prosecutor’s answer to the Defence Force magistrate
(above) was indirect and empty.  No
legitimate rational purpose was advanced by the prosecutor.  It is for all practical purposes impossible
to conceive of how in the circumstances of this case, s 26 of the Crimes
Act 1900 (ACT) expressed an offence of common assault more adequately than
ss 33 or 34 of the Discipline Act,
other than to avoid the time limitation set by s 96(1).

·                   
To use s 61 to defeat the prohibition provided
by s 96 was undoubtedly a serious abuse of process and an error of law by the
Defence Force magistrate to
allow and convict the appellant. 
Reference is made to sentencing remarks (cited above) and to Maxwell
v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 501 at 512 – 513, 535.

·                   
It was not necessary, as was held by Heerey J,
to find that the use of s 61 in the way that it was in this case was
motivated by ‘personal animus’ against the appellant.  The power to stay criminal proceedings on the
ground that they constitute an abuse of process is not confined to
circumstances giving rise to unfairness or oppression to the accused (citing R
v Brown (1989) 17 NSWLR 472 at 478G – 479G).  It can be an abuse of process for the
prosecution to charge an offender with a less serious offence than that which
he or she had allegedly committed;  or to
use s 60 in substitution for or on the same alleged facts together with a
substantive offence under another section of the Discipline Act.  A Defence
Force magistrate has a clear
legal obligation to prevent a patent abuse of process and the exercise of
powers recording the conviction in the present case by the Defence Force magistrate was an error of law.

159              
It will be convenient to consider ground 2 in
conjunction with grounds 3 and 5(b)(i) of the appeal.

160              
By ground 3, the appellant contends that the
Tribunal should have held that the Defence Force magistrate erred in law since it was an abuse of process to
permit the appellant to be charged and convicted under the Discipline Act in circumstances where
there had been extraordinary and unexplained delay between the commission of
the alleged offence in 1996 and the hearing before the Defence Force magistrate on 10 March 2003;  and where, at the time that the appellant was
charged in 2002 with an offence against s 61 of the Discipline Act, s 96 prohibited
him being charged with an offence against either s 33(a) or s 34 of
the Discipline Act.

161              
By ground 5(b)(i), the appellant contends that
the Tribunal erred in law by failing to take into account the fact that the
appellant’s conviction resulted in a miscarriage of justice and should be
quashed because he was not fully advised of his right to raise each of the
matters set out above and have them determined by a Defence Force magistrate expeditiously;  and, in the premises, his right to plead not
guilty.

162              
In support of these grounds, the appellant
submits that:

·                   
The basis upon which proceedings might be stayed
are not limited to cases where the proceedings have been brought for an
improper purpose or where there is no possibility of the party being afforded a
fair hearing.  Proceedings can and should
be stayed if the continuation of them would involve unacceptable injustice or
unfairness (citing Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378).

·                   
According to the charge sheet, the alleged
offence occurred ‘on a date unknown between 31 July 1996 and 1 September
1996’.  There can be no doubt that the
elapse of almost seven years by the time of the hearing before the Defence
Force magistrate would have
dramatically reduced the probative value of the witnesses’ evidence.  (As mentioned), it was the Defence Force magistrate’s ‘very strong view that
the delay [was] inexcusable’.  Heerey J
also criticised the delay.

163              
In my opinion, the Defence Force magistrate should have considered
whether, in the unusual circumstances of this case, a stay of proceedings
should have been granted.

164              
It will be recalled that in Re Tracey,
Brennan and Toohey JJ held (at 570) that proceedings may be brought ‘if, but
only if, those proceedings can reasonably be regarded as substantially serving
the purpose of maintaining or enforcing service discipline,’ and that in the
application of this test, ‘much depends upon matters of impression and degree,
especially on the needs of service discipline’. 
It will further be recalled that their Honours said (at 570 – 571) that
the test was an objective one, and that it must be applied by those (including
a convening authority) in whom the Discipline
Act vests certain procedural powers, who may have a discretion to decide
whether or not a step in proceedings ‘should be taken’.

165              
In my opinion, these observations are pertinent
here.  Yet, the proceedings before the
Defence Force magistrate
indicated that no real, or any, consideration was given to the responsibilities
carried by the convening authority here, in endowing the proceedings with the
specific purpose described by Brennan J and Toohey J;  that is to say, of substantially serving the
purpose of maintaining or enforcing service discipline.  In particular, no proper consideration was
then given to the question whether, by virtue of the long delay in prosecution,
and the impact of that delay on the maintenance and enforcement of service
discipline, a stay of proceedings should have been granted.

166              
The power to stay criminal proceedings,
permanently if necessary, to prevent an abuse of the court’s process exists in
order to ensure that its processes are used fairly by State and citizen
alike.  The power is available to every
court of justice (see R v Carroll (2002) 77 ALJR 157 per McHugh J at
[145]).  The statutory framework for
taking this objection is contained within s 141 of the Discipline
Act.  Examples may be given of the width
of the court’s power.

167              
One example of abuse by the Crown in
manipulating or misusing procedural practices in criminal proceedings may be
seen in Rona v District Court (SA) (1995) 77 Crim R 16, where King CJ
said (at 18 – 19):

‘…That the power of a Court
to stay criminal proceedings for abuse of process includes the power to stay
permanently, has been authoritatively settled; 
... . Although the cases
have been mostly concerned with preventing the prosecution of proceedings which
will result in an unfair trial, …which is strictly speaking a distinct rubric
from that of abuse of process, and with preventing the prosecution of
proceedings brought for an improper purpose, …“it is not possible to state
exhaustively all the categories of abuse of process” ….  The underlying principle was stated in wide
terms in the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ in Williams v Spautz at
520; 437: 



    “As Lord Scarman said in Reg v Sang [1980]
AC 402, at 455; ...  every court is ‘in duty bound to protect
itself’ against an  abuse of its
process.  In this respect there are two
fundamental policy considerations which must be taken into account in dealing
with abuse of process in the context of criminal proceedings.  Richardson J referred to them in Moevao v Department of
Labour [1980] 1 NZLR 464, at 481 in 
a passage which Mason CJ quoted in Jago [(1989) 168 CLR 23], at 30.  The first is that the public interest in the
administration of justice requires that the court protect its ability to
function as a court of law by ensuring that its processes are used fairly by
State and citizen alike.  The second is
that, unless the court protects its ability so to function in that way, its
failure will lead to an  erosion of
public confidence by reason of concern that the court’s processes may lend
themselves to oppression and injustice.”



The remedy may be granted
where “the prosecutor can be said to have manipulated or misused the rules of
procedure”;  R v Derby Crown Court;  Ex parte Brooks (1985) 80 Cr App R 164
at 168;  R v Horsham Justices;  Ex parte Reeves (1982) 75 Cr App R
236, R v Brentford
Justices;  Ex parte Wong (1981) 73
Cr App R 67.



Case management rules are
now essential equipment for courts exercising criminal jurisdiction, just as
they are for Courts exercising civil jurisdiction.’



168              
In Rona, a stay of a criminal prosecution
was granted, before trial, on the ground that the Crown had misused pre-trial
procedural directions.

169              
Another example of an abuse of process, perhaps
more analogous to the case now advanced by the appellant, is Whitten v Hall
(1993) 29 NSWLR 680.  The Justices Act
1902 (NSW) (s 56) allowed an information to be ‘laid or made at any
time within six months ...’ from the time the matter arose, but there was no
provision about when the summons should issue. 
It was held that it is an abuse of process to lay an information before
a decision to prosecute is made and to delay the issue of the summons to allow
further information to be collected.

170              
Campbell J said (at 685):

‘Mr Lakatos has put that
there has been no relevant prejudice to the plaintiff, in particular because he
does have his own analysis. Further, he submitted that there has been no
deliberate manipulation by the prosecution: 
see R v Derby
Crown Court; Ex parte Brooks (1984) 80 Cr App R 164.



In R v Newcastle-upon-Tyne Justices: Ex parte
John Bryce (Contractors) Ltd [1976] 1 WLR 517; [1976] 2 All ER 611, May
J, who gave the judgment with which the other two judges agreed, said (at 520;
614):



“In my
view the six months’ limitation provision in section 104 of the Magistrates’
Court Act 1952 is to ensure that summary offences are charged and tried as soon
as reasonably possible after their alleged commission, so that the recollection
of witnesses may still be reasonably clear, and so that there shall be no
unnecessary delay in the disposal by magistrates’ courts throughout the country
of the summary offences brought before them to be tried.”



I
respectfully agree.  I would, however,
add that one effect, if not a purpose, of the provision, is to allow persons
who might be involved in the type of offences to which this limitation applies
to put them behind them after a reasonably short and defined time.



In my
view the events which occurred in this case, albeit not knowingly intended to
be so by the first defendant and those who gave him his instructions, amounted
to an abuse of process of an order such that it is a proper exercise of my
discretion to permanently stay the proceedings.’



171              
Whitten may also be seen as an
application of the principle that ‘whatever is prohibited by law to be done
directly cannot legally be effected by an indirect and circuitous contrivance’
(see, H Broom, A Selection of Legal Maxims, 10th ed, Sweet
& Maxwell, London (1939) at 315;  Bank
of NSW v The Commonwealth (1948) 76 CLR 1 per Dixon J at 350;  Container Terminals Australia Ltd v Xeras
(1991) 23 NSWLR 214 at 217 and the cases there cited).

172              
None of these questions was properly raised
before the Defence Force magistrate.  In my opinion, they should have been put to
him, in the form of an application brought under s 141(5) of the Discipline Act, seeking a direction
that the interests of justice required that the proceedings be permanently
stayed.

173              
In Barton v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 75,
Gibbs CJ and Mason J said (at 95 – 96):

‘It is one thing to say that
the filing of an ex officio indictment is not examinable by the courts;  it is quite another thing to say the courts
are powerless to prevent an abuse of process or the prosecution of a criminal
proceeding in a manner which will result in a trial which is unfair when judged
by reference to accepted standards of justice. 
The courts exercise no control over the Attorney-General’s decision to
commence criminal proceedings, but once he does so, the courts will control
those proceedings so as to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial.’



174              
So here, it may be said that, even if it was
technically open to the convening authority to lay a charge under s 61,
the Defence Force magistrate
was not powerless to prevent an abuse of process or the prosecution of a
criminal proceeding in a manner which would result in a trial which is unfair,
when judged by reference to accepted standards of justice.

175              
In my opinion, although some prima facie
evidence in this connection is provided in the appellant’s affidavit (pars 6 –
8, cited above), the whole question of abuse of process should be remitted back
to a Defence Force magistrate
to decide finally whether a stay of the proceedings ought to be granted (see,
as to the similar course taken in Barton, above, per Gibbs CJ and Mason
J at 103).

Grounds 4, 5(a), (b)(ii) and 6

176              
In these grounds, the appellant seeks, in
essence, to challenge the Tribunal’s finding that he had not been placed under
pressure to plead guilty.  In view of my
conclusion, based on grounds 2, 3 and 5(b)(i), that the matter be remitted, it
is not necessary for me to consider this challenge.

Grounds 7, 8 and 9

177              
In these grounds, the appellant now seeks, in
essence, to challenge in this Court the constitutional validity of
s 61.  However, as has been seen,
the High Court has rejected similar challenges on several recent
occasions.  It is not, in my opinion, a
claim which this Court can entertain.

Orders proposed

178              
I would order that:

1.         The
appeal be allowed in part, but with costs.

2.         The
orders made by the Defence Force Disciplinary Tribunal be set aside;  in lieu thereof, the appeal to that Tribunal
be allowed, and that the orders made by the Defence Force magistrate be set aside;  and in lieu thereof, order that the matter be
remitted back to a different Defence Force magistrate to decide, in accordance with this judgment, whether
a stay of proceedings should be granted.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

LINDGREN J:

179              
I have had the benefit of reading drafts of the
reasons for judgment of Black CJ, Wilcox and Gyles JJ and of Beaumont J,
and am relieved of the necessity of summarising the background to the appeal.

Ground of appeal 1 – the construction
question

180              
I agree with Black CJ, Wilcox and Gyles JJ in
relation to the first ground of appeal, and add the following observations.

General

181              
The historical background to the relationship
between military law and the general law is recounted in Re Tracey; ex parte
Ryan (1989) 166 CLR 518 (‘Tracey’) at 541-547 per Mason CJ,
Wilson and Dawson JJ, and at 554-563 per Brennan and Toohey JJ.  The approach of English law has long been
that members of the armed forces are amenable to the ordinary criminal law
enforced in the ordinary criminal courts, and that military law creates an
additional set of rights and duties which are enforced in special courts:  Groves v The Commonwealth (1981) 150
CLR 113 at 125;  Tracey per
Mason CJ, Wilson and Dawson JJ at 546, per Brennan and Toohey JJ at
575-576, per Deane J at 585-586; but cf Gaudron J at 599-600.

182              
It was never in question in the present case
that Major Hoffman was amenable to Queensland’s Criminal Code (‘the
Code’).  The misdemeanour of unlawful
assault was provided for by s 335 of the Code with a maximum penalty of
imprisonment for one year  -the period
was increased to three years by s 56 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1997 (Qld)
(s 245 of the Code defined ‘assault’, and s 246 provided that an
assault was unlawful unless it was authorised or justified or excused by
law).  The misdemeanour of unlawful
assault was a ‘civil court offence’ within s 3(1) of the Defence Force
Discipline Act 1982 (Cth) (‘the Discipline Act’).

183              
Indeed, in Tracey it was held that
ss 190(3) and (5) were invalid as being beyond the legislative power
conferred on the Commonwealth Parliament by s 51(vi) of the Constitution,
because they interfered with the exercise by the ordinary courts of their
general criminal jurisdiction. 
Accordingly, subject to any operation of the general law principles of autrefois
convict and autrefois acquit, conviction or acquittal before a
Defence Force Magistrate would not prevent the laying and prosecution of a
charge against Major Hoffman for the misdemeanour of unlawful assault under the
Code in an appropriate Queensland ‘civil court’ (in the Discipline Act, the
expression ‘civil court’ was used to mean ‘a federal court or a court of a
State or Territory’:  s 3(1)).  Section 144 of the Discipline Act, however,
provided that acquittal or conviction of a service offence before a service
tribunal, or of a civil court offence before a civil court (or of an overseas
offence before an overseas court) rendered the person acquitted or convicted
not liable to be tried by a service tribunal for a service offence that was
substantially the same offence.

184              
The purpose of the Discipline Act is ‘to create
a disciplinary code for the promotion of the efficiency, good order and
discipline of the defence forces and no more’: 
McWaters v Day (1989) 168 CLR 289 at 297, citing Tracey at
538.  That is the purpose of s 61,
as well as of ss 33 and 34 of the Discipline Act.  The Constitutional underpinning of all three
sections is s 51(vi), rather than Ch III, of the Constitution:  Tracey;  Re Nolan; ex parte Young (1991) 172
CLR 460.

185              
The question to be resolved is one of the proper
construction of provisions within the same Act, with the same purpose and
supported by the same Constitutional provision. 
The provisions are those relating to the two service offences created by
ss 33 and 34(1), and the single general service offence created by
s 61, of the Discipline Act.  All
three are service offences created by the Discipline Act.

Legislative history

186              
Section 55 of the Defence Act 1903 (Cth)
(‘the Defence Act’), in its original form, provided:

‘55.      The Military Forces shall at all times, while on active
service, be subject to the Army Act save so far as it is inconsistent with this
Act;  but so that the regulations may
prescribe that any provisions of the Army Act shall not apply to the Military
Forces.’



The expression ‘Army Act’ appearing in this provision was
defined in s 4 of the Defence Act to mean the Imperial Act so called (this
was the Army Act 1881 (UK) (44 & 45 Vict c58) and any Act amending,
or in substitution for, that Act and for the time being in force.

187              
Section 55 was amended over the years, and
immediately prior to the commencement of the relevant provisions of the
Discipline Act on 3 July 1985, it provided:

‘The Army shall at all
times, whilst on war service, whether within or without the limits of
Australia, be subject to the Army Act save so far as it is inconsistent with
this Act and subject to such modifications and adaptations as are prescribed,
including the imposition of a fine not exceeding $40 for an offence either in
addition to or in substitution for the punishment provided by the Army Act, and
the increase or reduction of the amount of a fine provided by the Army Act.’



The reference to ‘the Army Act’ was still to the Army Act
1881 (UK), as in force on 29 October 1956, even though the Army Act 1955
(UK) had been enacted in the meanwhile with a commencing date of 1 January
1957.

188              
Neither of the provisions set out above would
have applied in the circumstances of the present case. ‘Active service’ and
‘war service’ were defined so as to be referable, in various ways, to times of
war or to a state of war. A member of the Army, such as Major Hoffman, who was
within Australia and not on war service, would have been subject only to the
specific offence provisions of the Defence Act and of the Australian
Military Regulations, as well, of course, as to the ordinary criminal law
of the State of Queensland. 

189              
From the beginning, the Army Act 1881
(UK) created both specific service offences, and a general service offence by
reference to ‘the law of England’.  Thus,
immediately prior to the commencement of the Discipline Act, s 41 of the Army
Act 1881 (UK) provided, relevantly, as follows:

‘41.      Subject to such regulations for the purpose of preventing
interference with the jurisdiction of the civil courts as are in this Act after
mentioned, every person who, whilst he is subject to military law, shall commit
any of the offences in this section mentioned shall be deemed to be guilty of
an offence against military law, and if charged under this section with any
such offence (in this Act referred to as a civil offence) shall be liable to be
tried by court-martial, and on conviction to be punished as follows;  that is to say,

(1)       If he is convicted of treason, be liable to suffer penal
servitude, or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned; and

(2)              
If he is convicted of murder, be liable to suffer penal
servitude; and

(2A)     If he is convicted of an offence under the Treachery Act, 1940,
be liable to suffer penal servitude;

(3)       If he is convicted of manslaughter or treason-felony, be
liable to suffer penal servitude, or such less punishment as is in this Act
mentioned; and

(4)       If he is convicted of rape, be liable to suffer penal
servitude, or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned; and

(5)       If he is convicted of any offence not before in this section
particularly specified, which when committed in England is punishable by the
law of England, be liable, whether the offence is committed in England or
elsewhere, either to suffer such punishment as might be awarded to him in
pursuance of this Act in respect of an act to the prejudice of good order and
military discipline, or to suffer any punishment assigned for such offence by
the law of England …’

190              
It is noteworthy that ss 70(1), (2) and (6)
of the Army Act 1955 (UK) provide:

‘70       (1)  Any person subject
to military law who commits a civil offence, whether in the United Kingdom or
elsewhere, shall be guilty of an offence against this section.



(2)       In this Act the expression “civil offence” means any act or
omission punishable by the law of England or which, if committed in England,
would be punishable by that law; and in this Act the expression “the
corresponding civil offence” means the civil offence the commission of which constitutes
the offence against this section.’



‘(6)      A person subject to military law may be charged with an offence
against this section notwithstanding that he could on the same facts be charged
with an offence against any other provision of this Part of this Act.’



No provision to the effect of subs (6) was taken into the
Discipline Act by the Australian Parliament, even though that subsection had
been inserted in the United Kingdom Act of 1955 by the Armed Forces Act 1971
(UK) s 34(1).

191              
The limitation that a member of the Army must be
serving outside Australia, or on war service within Australia, noted at [10]
above, did not apply to members of the Navy or Air Force: they were made
triable with offences against the ordinary laws of England generally, and, in
the case of the Navy, also with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth
(see the Explanatory Memorandum which accompanied the Bill for the Discipline
Act (‘the Explanatory Memorandum’) at par [584]).

192              
The introduction of the Discipline Act was preceded
by a report in 1973 of a Working Party on the ‘Defence Force Disciplinary
Code’.  This report recommended a single
disciplinary code relating to Army, Navy and Air Force. Accordingly, the
difference just mentioned, as between the Army on the one hand and the Navy and
the Air Force on the other, was to disappear. The report also noted that:

‘Disciplinary codes
traditionally rely on the ordinary criminal law for the less frequently
committed criminal offences.  One of the
more striking anomalies of the present service codes is their dependence on the
criminal law of England.  We have
proposed … to substitute the criminal law of the Australian Capital
Territory.’ (my
emphasis) 



193              
The Explanatory Memorandum noted that these two
changes were adopted in the Bill.  The
expression ‘Territory offence’ was defined in s 3(1) of the Discipline
Act, as originally enacted, by reference to the Australian Capital Territory
(‘ACT’), rather than, as now, by reference to the Jervis Bay Territory (‘JBT’).

194              
Major Hoffman was charged with having
committed an offence ‘on a date unknown, between 31 July 1996 and
1 September 1996’.  At that time
s 4A of the Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1991 (Cth) provided
that, subject to that Act, ‘the laws … in force from time to time in the [ACT]
[were], … in force in the [JBT] as if the [JBT] formed part of the [ACT]’.  This provision was not much different from
s 4 of that Act in its original form (No 19 of 1915), which provided
that the JBT was to be annexed to and be deemed to form part of the ACT ‘to the
intent that all laws, ordinances and regulations … from time to time in force
in the [ACT] [should] so far as applicable apply to and be in force in the
[JBT]’.  In 1915, it was contemplated
that only laws, ordinances and regulations of the Commonwealth would be made
for the ACT: self-government of the ACT was not in prospect.

195              
At the time of the alleged offence by Major
Hoffman at some time between 31 July 1996 and 1 September 1996, the
definition of ‘Territory offence’ in s 3(1) of the Discipline Act referred
to ‘(b)  an offence punishable under the
Crimes Act, 1900 of the State of New South Wales, in its application to the
[JBT]’.  As will appear below, the Crimes
Act 1900 of the State of New South Wales was not applicable in the JBT at that
time:  the (ACT) Crimes Act 1900 was.

196              
The ACT became self-governing in 1988 by the
operation of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cth).  Section 22 of that Act gave the ACT
Legislative Assembly power to make laws for the peace, order and good
government of the ACT. 
Subsection 34(4) of that Act had the effect that the Crimes Act
1900 (NSW) continued to apply in the ACT, but was taken to be a law made by
the ACT Legislative Assembly, and could be amended or repealed by that Legislative
Assembly.

197              
Section 3 of the Crimes Legislation
(Status and Citation) Act 1992 (‘the CL(S&C) Act’), an Act of the ACT
Legislative Assembly, which was gazetted and commenced on 28 March 1992,
provided that the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (‘the applied State Act’), in
its application in the ACT immediately before the commencement of the
CL(S&C) Act, was to be ‘taken to be, for all purposes, a law made by the
Legislative Assembly as if the provisions of the applied State Act had been
re-enacted in an Act passed by the Assembly and taking effect on the
commencement of [the CL(S&C) Act]’. 
Section 4 of the CL(S&C) Act provided that the applied State
Act might be ‘cited as the Crimes Act 1900’.  This last Act has been referred to variously
as the (ACT) Crimes Act 1900 and as the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT).  It is this (ACT) Crimes Act 1900 which
s 4A of the Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915 (Cth) caused
to be in force in the JBT at the time of Major Hoffman’s alleged offences in
1996.  The terms of the charge against
Major Hoffman correctly referred to the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT).  The problem was that the definition of
‘Territory offence’ in s 3(1) of the Discipline Act continued to refer, at
the time of Major Hoffman’s alleged offence in 1996, to an offence punishable
under the ‘Crimes Act, 1900 of the State of New South Wales, in its application
to the [JBT]’.  At the time of Major
Hoffman’s alleged offence in 1996, the Crimes Act 1900 of the State of
New South Wales did not apply to the [JBT].

198              
The discrepancy was addressed by the Defence
Legislation Amendment Act (No 1) 1996 (Cth) (No 56, 1996)
(assented to on 8 November 1996) which:


 amended the definition of ‘Territory offence’ by
     substituting for the words just quoted the words ‘Crimes Act 1900 of the
     Australian Capital Territory, in its application to the Jervis Bay
     Territory’; and 
 provided that this amendment was ‘taken to have
     commenced on 28 May 1992’.


Provisions of the Discipline Act
relating to the two service offences created by ss 33 and 34(1)

199              
Sections 33 and 34(1) of the Discipline Act
provided, relevantly, as follows:

‘33.      A person, being a defence member … who, on service land …:

(a)       assaults another person;

(b)       …;

(c)        …; …

(d)       …;

is guilty
of an offence for which the maximum punishment is imprisonment for
6 months.’



‘34.   (1)  
A defence member who [anywhere] assaults …a member of the Defence Force who is of
inferior rank to the defence member is guilty of an offence for which the
maximum punishment is imprisonment for 2 years.’



(A defence to the
s 34(1) offence is provided for in s 34(2).)

200              
The time within which a person may be charged
with an offence against s 33 or s 34 was fixed by s 96(1):

‘96
(1) A person shall not be charged with:

            (a)        an
offence against this Act (other than subsection 61(1)) …;…

            (b)        …;

after
the expiration of a period of 3 years after the time at which the offence
is alleged to have been committed.’



Subsections (2) and (3)
of s 96 qualified this provision as follows:

‘(2)      Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1), a person may be
charged with:

            (a)        an
offence against section 15, 16, 20 or 22; or

            (b)        a service offence that is an ancillary
offence in relation to an offence referred to in paragraph (a);

at any time.



(3)              
A reference in subsection (1) to a period shall be
read as not including

a
reference to a period during which the person:

            (a)        was a prisoner of war;

            (b)        was absent without leave; or

            (c)        was serving a sentence of imprisonment.’

Provisions of the Discipline Act
relating to the service offence created by s 61(1)

201              
Subsections 61(1) and (2) of the Discipline Act
were as follows:

’61.   (1)  
A  person, being a defence member
… , is guilty of an offence if:

(a)       …

(b)       …

(c)        the person does
or omits to do (whether in a public place or not) outside the Jervis Bay
Territory an act or thing the doing or omission of which, if it took place
(whether in a public place or not) in the Jervis Bay Territory, would be a
Territory offence.’



‘(2)      The punishment for
an offence against subsection (1) is:

(a)        if the relevant
Territory offence is punishable by a fixed punishment – that fixed punishment;
or

(b)        in any other case
– a punishment not more severe than the maximum punishment for the relevant
Territory offence.’



202              
By reason of the definition of ‘Territory
offence’ in s 3(1) of the Discipline Act and the legislative provisions
referred to by Beaumont J, the offence of common assault, being the
offence described in s 26 of the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT),was
a ‘Territory offence’.  That section was
as follows:

‘A person who assaults another
person is guilty of an offence punishable, on conviction, by imprisonment for
two years.’ 



In so far as ss 61(1) and (2) refer to s 26 of the Crimes
Act 1900 (ACT), the punishment for an offence against s 61(1) was not
to exceed imprisonment for two years.

203              
The time within which a person might be charged
with an offence against s 61(1) was provided for in s 96(4):

‘96.   (4)  
A person shall not be charged with an offence against subsection 61(1)
…if the time that has elapsed since the offence is alleged to have been
committed equals or exceeds the period of time that would bar trial by, or
institution of proceedings in, a court exercising jurisdiction in or in
relation to the Jervis Bay Territory for the relevant Territory offence.’

 

There was no period of
time that would bar trial by, or institution of proceedings in, a court
exercising jurisdiction in or in relation to the JBT for the crime of common
assault described in s 26 of the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT).  Therefore, there was no time bar to the charging
and prosecuting of the service offence created by s 61(1) in so far as
that subsection referred to s 26 of the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT).

204              
The appellant was, at the relevant time (between
31 July 1996 and 1 September 1996) a Major in the Australian Regular Army.  The person whom he was alleged to have
assaulted, Captain Paul Barrie Higgins, was a Captain in that Army.  Major Hoffman was ‘a defence member’ as
defined in s 3(1) of the Discipline Act and Captain Higgins was ‘a member
of the Defence Force who [was] of inferior rank to [Major Hoffman]’.  According to the charge sheet, the assault
took place at Shoalwater Bay Training Area, Queensland (on a date unknown
within the period mentioned).  That
Training Area was ‘service land’ because it was used or occupied by the Defence
Force or by an institution of the Defence Force (see the definition of ‘service
land’ in s 3(1) of the Discipline Act).

205              
It follows that the charge sheet alleged facts
which showed, not only an offence against s 61(1), but also offences against
ss 33 and 34(1) of the Discipline Act.

206              
By reason of ss 33 and 96(1) of the
Discipline Act:

·       
a defence member who assaulted any other person
on service land committed a service offence;

·       
the defence member was liable to imprisonment
for a maximum period of six months; and

·       
there was a three-year time bar on charging the
defence member with the offence against s 33.

207              
By reason of ss 34(1) and 96(1) of the
Discipline Act:

·       
a defence member who (anywhere) assaulted a
member of the Defence Force of inferior rank (‘an Inferior’) committed a
service offence;

·       
the defence member was liable to imprisonment
for a maximum period of two years; and

·       
there was a three year time bar on charging the
person with the offence against s 34.

208              
By reason of ss 61(1) and (2) (invoking
s 26 of the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT)) and 96(4) of the Discipline Act:

·       
a defence member who (anywhere) assaulted any
other person committed a service offence;

·       
the defence member was liable to imprisonment
for a maximum period of two years; and

·       
there was no time bar on charging the defence
member with the offence against s 61(1).

Is there inconsistency?

209              
According to s 33 of the Discipline Act,
the maximum penalty that could be imposed on a defence member for assaulting
anyone on service land was imprisonment for six months, but according to
s 61(2), the maximum penalty that could be imposed on a defence member for
assaulting anyone anywhere was imprisonment for two years.  The two provisions are inconsistent.  The additional nexus with Defence present in
s 33 makes no difference.  The
‘assault by a defence member anywhere’ provided for in s 61(1) is not a
more serious offence than the ‘assault by a defence member on service land’
provided for in s 33 – a factor which might have been seen to attract a
heavier penalty.  

210              
In s 96(1) the legislature expressed an
intention that a defence member should not be able to be charged with having
assaulted a person on service land (s 33) later than three years after the
alleged assault, yet s 96(4) allows such a defence member to be charged
under s 61(1) (by reference to the offence described in s 26 of the Crimes
Act 1900 (ACT)) at any time.  In this
respect, ss 96(1) and 96(4) are inconsistent.

211              
I turn now from s 33 to s 34(l).  According to s 34(1), the maximum
penalty that could be imposed on a defence member who assaulted (anywhere) an
Inferior was imprisonment for two years. 
According to s 61(1) the maximum penalty that could be imposed on a
defence member for assaulting anyone was also imprisonment for two years.  Notwithstanding the identical maximum terms
of imprisonment, there is inconsistency, because inconsistent legislative
intentions are exposed.  The reason is
that ss 33 and 34(1), read together, reveal a legislative intention that
assault by a defence member of an Inferior was to be treated as a more serious
offence than assault by a defence member of persons in general and was to
attract a greater maximum penalty.  This
policy is defeated by the intention expressed in s 61(1).

212              
Subsection 96(1) provided, in effect and
relevantly, that a defence member was not to be charged with having assaulted
an Inferior (s 34(1)) more than three years after the alleged assault, yet
s 96(4) provided, in effect and relevantly, that a defence member might be
charged under s 61(1) of the Discipline Act (by reference to s 26 of
the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT)) with having assaulted (anywhere) any person
(including an Inferior) at any time.  In
this respect, ss 96(1) and 96(4) are inconsistent with each other.

213              
It is not possible to construe the provisions to
which I have referred as working harmoniously towards the same goal: cf Project
Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355.

How is the inconsistency to be
resolved?

214              
Two competing answers to this question have been
suggested.  Major Hoffman submits that
ss 61(1) and 96(4) are ‘general’ provisions which must yield to the
‘specific’ provisions of ss 33, 34(1) and 96(1).  He calls in aid the maxim generalia
specialibus non derogant.  The
respondent submits that the legislative intention is that it is a matter of
prosecutorial discretion under which provision to lay a charge.  I do not think the latter solution available
in a case of irreconcilably conflicting expressions of the legislature’s
intention.

215              
The generalia specialibus maxim has a
particular application when the question is whether a specific provision is to
be regarded as repealed by an inconsistent general provision of a later
enactment:  see, for example, Pearce and
Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia (5th ed,
Butterworths, 2001) at [7.18]–[7.21]; 
Bennion, Statutory Interpretation (4th ed,
Butterworths, 2002) at 255-257;  Craies
on Statute Law (7th ed, Sweet & Maxwell, 1971) at
377-380.  The same general means of
resolving inconsistency may, however, also be invoked where the inconsistency
occurs within the one enactment:  cf Pearce
and Geddes at [4.30];  Bennion
at 998-999;  Craies at 222-223,
and cases referred to in those works, such as, Refrigerated Express Lines
(Australasia) Pty Ltd v Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (No 2) (1980)
44 FLR 455.  If the legislature can be
seen to have provided for the specific kind of factual circumstances that have
occurred, its ‘special’ provision for them will prevail over an inconsistent
general provision in the same Act, within which those circumstances also
fall.  ‘The generalia specialibus maxim,
… , is not a technical rule peculiar to English statutory interpretation.  Rather it represents simple common sense and
ordinary usage’:  Effort Shipping Co
Ltd v Linden Management SA (‘The Giannis NK’) [1998] 1 All ER 495
at 513 per Lord Cooke.

216              
No doubt the reason why the generalia
specialibus maxim has had a particular application in the context of
separate Acts is that the legislature is more likely to have overlooked an
inconsistent specific provision located somewhere within the vast corpus of
earlier statutes, than it is to have overlooked an inconsistent specific
provision within the same statute.  

217              
Once it is accepted that the approach indicated
by the maxim may be invoked to resolve internal inconsistency, there is no
reason why cases of external inconsistency may not illuminate those, such as
the present case, of internal inconsistency. 
The Danube II [1921] P 183, concerned the Public
Authorities Protection Act 1893 (UK) and the Maritime Conventions Act
1911 (UK).  Section 1 of the
earlier Act provided for a limitation period of six months in respect of, inter
alia, any action, prosecution or proceeding against persons in respect of
an act done in intended execution of any Act of Parliament, public duty or
authority.  Section 8 of the later
Act, however, provided for a limitation period of two years for any action to
enforce any claim against a vessel or her owners in respect of damage to, or
loss of, another vessel.  An action was
brought against the master of tug which was in the service of the Crown.  It was towing a battle target to a place for
the practice of the fleet.  Allegedly
because of the negligent navigation by the master of the tug, the battle target
collided with a ship belonging to the plaintiffs and sank her.

218              
The Court of Appeal held that the six-month time
bar availed the master.  The Court so
held, disavowing any finding of inconsistency, preferring to say that under the
later Act there was a general time bar of two years, while under the earlier
Act there was a special time bar of six months in the particular circumstances
provided for in that Act.  With respect,
I would have preferred to characterise the two provisions as inconsistent, but
this is not of present importance.

219              
The Court of Appeal’s conclusion would have been
the same if the two provisions had occurred within the one Act.

220              
Sections 33 and 34(1) are specific provisions
and s 61(1) is a general provision for the purposes of the application of
the maxim.  All three provisions are
concerned with conduct by, relevantly, defence members.  The concern of s 33 is specifically with
assaults at places of certain kinds while the concern of s 34 is
specifically with such assaults upon an Inferior.  The concern of s 61(1), by contrast, is
with nothing less than all Territory offences, a notion which happens to
include the offence of common assault.

221              
This ‘specific-general’ relationship between
s 33 and 34(1) on the one hand and s 61(1) on the other, also
suggests a conclusion that s 96(1) is a specific provision and
s 96(4) a general one for present purposes.  In any event, that the legislature attended
specifically to the question of the appropriateness of the three-year
limitation period for the ss 33 and 34(1) offences is shown by the
qualification of s 96(1) found in ss 96(2) and (3) (set out at [20]
above).  In contrast, s 96(4) (set
out at [25] above) adopts, by reference and without qualification, whatever
time bars may happen to apply to the many Territory offences.

222              
With respect, I do not share Beaumont J’s view
that the course of High Court authority to which his Honour refers precludes a
‘reading down’ of s 61.  The process of
construction in question is one which makes s 61 yield to ss 33 and 34(1) in
order to resolve the inconsistency.  The
High Court has not had occasion to address the question of the resolution of
inconsistency between constitutionally valid offence provisions of the Discipline
Act.

223              
For the above reasons, and the reasons which
Black CJ, Wilcox and Gyles JJ have given, I agree with their conclusion in
relation to the first ground of appeal.

Grounds of appeal 2–9 (inclusive)

224              
In relation to these grounds too, I agree with
the reasons and conclusions of Black CJ, Wilcox and Gyles JJ, and add this
observation.

225              
Senior counsel for Major Hoffman submitted that
once the three-year period for the charging of an offence against s 33 or
s 34(1) had expired, it became an abuse of process to charge Major Hoffman
with having committed an offence against s 61(1).  But the abuse of process argument must
assume, contrary to senior counsel’s argument on the first ground of appeal and
my acceptance of it, that there is no inconsistency, and that it was a matter
of legitimate prosecutorial discretion whether to charge under s 33, 34(1)
or 61(1).  On that assumption, the expiry
of the three year period would not, without more, characterise the charging of
an offence against s 61(1) as an abuse of process.

CONCLUSION

226              
For their reasons and for mine above, I agree
with the conclusion reached, and orders proposed, by Black CJ, Wilcox and
Gyles JJ.

The applications are brought by notice of motion. The first notice of motion was filed on behalf of the first to fifth respondents on 20 August 2003. An amended notice of motion was filed in Court on 15 October 2003. The second notice of motion was filed on behalf of the sixth and seventh respondents on 20 August 2003. The third notice of motion was filed on behalf of the sixteenth to nineteenth respondents on 28 August 2003.  2                     The applicant, Energex Limited (“Energex”), is an electricity utility that has, for many years, engaged in the purchase of electricity transformers. There are two types of electricity transformers: power transformers, which are used to transform large amounts of electrical power at high voltages; and distribution transformers, which are used in applications for smaller amounts of electrical power at lower voltages. 3                     Energex was originally known as the South East Queensland Electricity Board (“SEQEB”) being a body corporate established under the Electricity Act 1976 (Qld). On 1 July 1977, SEQEB was constituted as a body corporate capable of suing and being sued. On 9 September 1994, the South East Queensland Electricity Corporation (“SEQEC”) was established under the Government Owned Corporations (Queensland Transmission and Supply Corporation) Regulation 1994 (Qld), and assumed the rights and liabilities of SEQEB. On 1 July 1997, SEQEC became an unlisted public company, and was renamed the South East Queensland Electricity Corporation Limited. On 29 July 1998, the company changed its name to Energex Limited.  4                     Energex has existed, in one form or another, since at least 1 July 1977. Since 1993, it has been a state owned corporation operating under the provisions of the Government Owned Corporations Act 1993 (Qld). It carries on the business of distributing and retailing electricity and other energy products. It supplies these products in Queensland, as well as other parts of Australia.  5                     The respondents to this proceeding are either companies engaged in the manufacture and supply of power and distribution transformers, or individual members of their senior management.  6                     The first respondent, Alstom Australia Limited (“Alstom”), was formerly named GEC-English Electric Pty Ltd from 1 October 1957 until 17 July 1989. It was renamed GEC Alsthom Australia Limited, and kept that name between 18 July 1989 and 21 June 1998, when it became known as Alstom. It has carried on business from its factory site at Rocklea, in Queensland, since 1989.  7                     The second respondent, Rexel Australia Limited (“Rexel”), was formerly named GEC Australia Limited from 7 February 1978 until 4 February 1998. Between 1980 and 1989 it carried on business from the Rocklea site.  8                     The third, fourth and fifth respondents, Messrs Richard Elliot, Paul Brabham and Colin James, are all executives or directors, past or present, of Alstom.  9                     I shall refer to the first, second, third, fourth and fifth respondents as “the Alstom respondents”. 10                  The sixth respondent, Wilson Transformer Company Pty Ltd (“WTC”), has carried on business from its two factories in Glen Waverley and Wodonga, in Victoria, since at least 1980.  11                  The seventh respondent, Mr Robert Wilson, has at all relevant times been the managing director of WTC.  12                  I shall refer to the sixth and seventh respondents as “the Wilson respondents”.  13                  The eighth respondent, Mr David Peck, was formerly a sales and marketing manager with WTC. He ceased employment with that company in 1995. He is not a party to any notice of motion presently before the Court. 14                  The ninth respondent, ABB Transmission and Distribution Limited (“ABBTDL”), was formerly named Tyree Industries Ltd from 2 February 1956 until 21 April 1993. On that date, its name changed to ABB Transmission Limited. On 21 December 1995, it changed its name again and became ABBTDL. ABBTDL, under whatever name, was at all times the holding company of an entity originally named Tyree Electrical Co Ltd (“TEC”), which later changed its name to ABB Power Transmission Pty Ltd (“ABBPT”). That company carried on business from its various factories in Moorebank in New South Wales, in Darra in Queensland, and in Perth. ABBPT eventually went into liquidation. 15                  The tenth, twelfth and fourteenth respondents, Messrs Douglas Pitt, David Toogood, and Russell Ellen, all at various times held senior managerial positions at ABBPT or ABBTDL. So too did the eleventh and thirteenth respondents, Messrs Chris Tape and Graham Jones. Neither Mr Tape nor Mr Jones have yet been served with any process. They are not therefore formally parties to this proceeding and, self evidently, are not parties to any notice of motion currently before the Court.  16                  I shall refer to the ninth, tenth, twelfth and fourteenth respondents as the “ABB respondents”. The ABB respondents are not parties to any notice of motion before the Court. They were, however, represented briefly before me at the commencement of the hearing of these applications. They indicated that they proposed to await the outcome of the various challenges brought by the other respondents before deciding upon their own course of action. 17                  The fifteenth respondent, Mr Raymond Boyce, has not yet been served by the applicant. Nothing more need be said about his position at this stage. 18                  The sixteenth respondent, Schneider Electric (Australia) Pty Ltd (“Schneider”), was formerly named Telemecanique (Australia) Pty Ltd from 19 December 1972 until 29 December 1992. It was named Schneider Pty Ltd from 30 December 1992 until 1 March 1999, and has been named Schneider Electric (Australia) Pty Ltd since 2 March 1999. In 1993, Schneider acquired all the issued shares in Australian Standard Electrical Transformers Pty Ltd (“ASET”), a company that from 1980 to 1993 manufactured and supplied distribution transformers from a factory in Benalla, in Victoria. Since 1993, Schneider has carried on that business that from factory.  19                  The seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth respondents, Messrs Russell Stocker, and Ashley Smout and Ms Wendy Minne, have all, at various times, held senior management positions with Schneider.  20                  I shall refer to the sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth respondents as “the Schneider respondents”.  the factual Background  21                  Energex claims that since about 1980, it, together with others, has engaged in the purchase of electricity transformers from the various corporate respondents. It identifies those from whom it has purchased the transformers as being: ·                    GEC from 1980 to 1989, and Alstom thereafter;  ·                    WTC since 1980; and ·                    ABBPT from 1980 to 1996, and ABBTDL thereafter.  22                  In addition, Energex claims that it purchased distribution transformers from ASET from 1980 to 1993, and from Schneider thereafter.  23                  Energex claims that there has, at all material times, been a market in Australia for the supply of power and distribution transformers. The purchasers of these transformers have included electricity utilities, and large industrial and mining companies. Energex describes this market as “the transformer market”. Alternatively, it alleges that two separate markets, one for the supply of power transformers, and the other for the supply of distribution transformers, have, at all material times, existed in Australia.  24                  Energex claims that there was competition among the corporate respondents in relation to the supply of these transformers. It alleges that, from 1980 onwards, acting under the auspices of Australian Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers Association Limited (“AEEMA”), a company limited by guarantee, and through a Division known as the “Power and Distribution Transformers Division”, the corporate respondents entered into a series of unlawful agreements, arrangements or understandings relating to the supply of transformers. Energex describes these agreements, arrangements or understandings as “the Transformer Arrangement”.  25                  The Transformer Arrangement was, in substance, a classic case of collusive tendering. The corporate respondents agreed that they would allocate tenders for the production and supply of transformers among themselves with a view to each of them maintaining their share of sales of power and distribution transformers. They would achieve this object by ensuring that the selected manufacturer submitted a tender at a lower assessed annual value (“AAV”) than the tenders submitted by other manufacturers, or by those manufacturers not submitting a tender. The lower AAV would be achieved by the manufacturers discussing their tenders with each other, thereby ensuring that those tenders yielded a higher AAV than that of the selected manufacturer. Energex sets out in its statement of claim a series of detailed particulars from which the existence of such an agreement, arrangement or understanding is to be inferred. 26                  Alternatively, Energex pleads the existence of a “Pre-1993 Power Transformer Arrangement”. The parties to that arrangement are said to have been GEC, WTC and TEC. Energex claims that the arrangement involved those companies agreeing to allocate forthcoming tenders for the production and supply of power transformers amongst themselves with a view to each maintaining its share of sales. The shares of sales to be maintained were 45% to TEC, 32% to GEC, and 23% to WTC. The method by which this would be achieved was essentially the same as for the Transformer Arrangement.  27                  The statement of claim sets out, in voluminous detail, the circumstances under which it is alleged that either the Transformer Arrangement, or the Pre-1993 Power Transformer Arrangement, came to be implemented.  28                  Energex also pleads a third case, once again in the alternative. It alleges in par 179 of the statement of claim that in 1993, ABBPT, WTC and Tyree Transformers Pty Ltd (“Tyree”) (a company not a party to these proceedings) made an agreement or arrangement, or arrived at an understanding. It refers to this arrangement as “the 1993 Distribution Transformer Arrangement”. As with the other arrangements alleged, it pleads that those companies agreed that they would not compete with each other for contracts let to tender for the production and supply of distribution transformers, with a view to each of them maintaining their share of sales of those transformers. Again, the method adopted was similar to that previously outlined.  29                  To complicate matters further, Energex also pleads a fourth alternative case. It alleges that in 1995, there came into existence what it describes as “the 1995 Distribution Transformer Arrangement”. It is unnecessary, for present purposes, to attempt to summarise the salient features of that arrangement. They are broadly similar to those of the first three arrangements pleaded. the statement of claim 30                  The statement of claim is a complex document. It runs for 121 pages and contains 408 paragraphs. Many of these paragraphs contain a large number of sub-paragraphs. It refers to literally hundreds of meetings, conversations, or other communications, and it would take an inordinate amount of time even to attempt to summarise the broad scope of the allegations contained therein. It should be noted, however, that the allegations of unlawful conduct extend over a period of about twenty years, throughout the 1980s and 1990s.  31                  There are, in substance, two causes of action pleaded. The first involves numerous breaches of s 45 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (“the Act”). As is well known, that section proscribes the making of contracts, arrangements or understandings that restrict dealings or affect competition. The second is a series of claims for the tort of deceit.  32                  As against the various corporate respondents, Energex claims that their conduct, as specified in its statement of claim, constituted in each case the making of an agreement, arrangement or understanding which contained an exclusionary provision in contravention of s 45(2)(a)(i). It further claims that this conduct constituted in each case the making of an agreement, arrangement or understanding which contained a provision to which s 45A(1) applied, and which accordingly had the purpose, or had or was likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition for the supply of transformers in one or other of the markets pleaded. This is said to constitute a contravention of s 45(2)(a)(ii). Energex also relies upon s 45(2)(b)(ii). It alleges that the conduct of the corporate respondents fell within ss 80(1)(a), 82(1) and 87(1).  33                  Energex also claims that the conduct of the corporate respondents constituted in each case the giving effect to a provision of an agreement, arrangement or understanding which was an exclusionary provision in contravention of s 45(2)(b)(i), with the same consequences.  34                  Energex then pleads that it suffered loss or damage by reason of these contraventions. It identifies that loss or damage in the following way: “381. The conduct referred to in paragraphs 362 to 380 hereof constituted the making of or the giving effect to arrangements between: (a)                GEC, WTC, ABBPT, and Tyree from 1983 until early 1989; (b)                Alstom, WTC, ABBPT, and Tyree from early 1989 until May 1995; (c)                Alstom, WTC, ABBPT, Tyree and Schneider from May 1995 until 1 January 1996; (d)                Alstom, WTC, ABBTDL, Tyree and Schneider since 1 January 1996. 382. In light of the matters referred to in paragraphs 31 to 60, and in light of accepted economic principles, such conduct resulted in the suppliers of transformers charging higher prices than they otherwise would have charged. 383. During the period from 1983 until 2002, the prices paid by SEQEB and ENERGEX for power transformers and distribution transformers exceeded the prices which would have prevailed but for the conduct referred to in paragraphs 362 to 380 hereof. Particulars  The best particulars of those prices which can be provided by the Applicant before the completion of discovery are set out in Annexure B to this Statement of Claim. 384. The prices which would have prevailed but for the conduct referred to in paragraphs 362 to 380 hereof have been estimated by: (a)                isolating the prices paid by SEQEB and ENERGEX for transformers over the period from 1983 to 2002; (b)                estimating the costs of manufacturing transformers over the period from 1983 to 2002; (c)                calculating the contribution margin, being the ratio of the price paid less the variable cost to the price paid, over that period; (d)                identifying the lowest contribution margin to the transformer manufacturers over that period; (e)                using the lowest contribution margin as an upper bound to the contribution margins which would have prevailed but for such collusive conduct; (f)                 adding that contribution margin to variable costs to estimate the prices which would have prevailed but for the collusive conduct. 385. SEQEB and ENERGEX have suffered damage as a result of the price paid by them for power transformers and distribution transformers exceeding the prices which would have prevailed but for the conduct referred to in paragraphs 362 to 380 hereof. Particulars  The damages are particularised in Annexure B to this Statement of Claim.” 35                  Finally, Energex turns to the ancillary liability of the individual respondents. This is particularised at pars 386-399 of the statement of claim.  36                  As noted earlier, Energex also pleads the tort of deceit. It alleges that from 1985 until 2002, it purchased transformers from GEC, Alstom, WTC, ABBPT, ABBTDL, Tyree and Schneider, pursuant to contracts awarded by the selection of a tenderer after completion of a public tender process. It alleges that each tenderer, by submitting a tender in response to an invitation to do so, represented that the price and other terms of the tender had been arrived at by the tenderer without any knowledge of the price and terms of any other tender, and was not the subject of any agreement, arrangement or understanding between the tenderer and any other manufacturer or supplier. It claims that these representations were implied, and that they were made with the intention of inducing either SEQEB or Energex to accept one of the tenders. It alleges that the representations were false, and that they were known to be false. It pleads dishonesty, in terms. It claims that it relied upon the representations, and suffered consequential loss and damage.  37                  The claim for deceit is set out at pars 400 to 406. Those paragraphs are in the following terms: “400. During the period from 1985 until 2002, SEQEB and ENERGEX purchased transformers from GEC, Alstom, WTC, ABBPT, ABBTDL, Tryee and Schneider pursuant to contracts awarded by the selection of a tenderer after completion of a public tender process. Particulars Particulars of the tender reference numbers, the closing date for tenders, the tenders submitted and the identity of the successful tenderer are contained in Annexure A to this Statement of Claim. 401.          In relation to each such tender process: (a)              Invitations to tender were published in a newspaper circulating in the Brisbane area. (b)              The invitations specified the place at which copies of the tender documents would be provided. (c)              The invitations specified that tenders had to be sealed. (d)              The invitations specified the closing date and hour for tenders. (e)              The invitations specified that tenders would be publicly opened immediately after the closing time for the tender. 402.          In submitting a tender in response to the invitation by SEQEB or ENERGEX, each tenderer, in respect of those tenders set out in Annexure A hereto, represented that the price and other terms of the tender submitted by it: (a)              had been arrived at by the tenderer without any knowledge of the price and terms, or likely price and terms, of any other tender; and (b)              was not the subject of any agreement, arrangement or understanding between the tenderer and any other manufacturer or supplier of the goods the subject of the tender; Particulars The representations are to be implied from the submission of a tender in the circumstances specified in paragraph 401 hereof. 403.          Those representations were made with the intention of inducing the person who issued the invitation to tender to accept one of the tenders. 404.          Those representations were false in that: (a) each tenderer had arrived at the price and other terms of the tender submitted by it after discussing that price and other terms with another manufacturer or supplier of the goods the subject of the tender; (b) the price and other terms of the tender submitted by it was the subject of an agreement, arrangement or understanding between the tenderer and another manufacturer or supplier of the goods the subject of the tender. 405.          Those representations were made dishonestly, in that they were made with knowledge of their falsity. 406.          The person issuing the invitation to tender acted in reliance on those representations and was induced thereby to accept one of the tenders.”  38                  The loss or damage alleged to have been suffered is particularised at par 407 of the statement of claim: “407. By virtue of the matters specified in paragraphs 400 to 406 hereof, SEQEB and ENERGEX suffered loss and damage. Particulars (a) If the representation had not been made, the person issuing the invitation to tender would have investigated why that tenderer was unwilling to participate in a public tender process, and further or alternatively would have referred the matter to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, or its predecessor the Trade Practices Commission. (b) There was a chance that such investigation or referral would have disclosed the existence of one or more of those arrangements, in which event SEQEB or ENERGEX could have prevented the Respondents from continuing to give effect to those arrangements. (c) SEQEB and ENERGEX lost the opportunity to prevent the Respondents from continuing to give effect to those arrangements. (d) Had the Respondents been prevented from continuing to give effect to those arrangements, SEQEB and ENERGEX would have paid less than they did for their purchases of transformers.” the alstom respondents’ contentions 39                  The Alstom respondents contend that the allegations pleaded against them should either be dismissed under O 20 r 2(1) of the Federal Court Rules (“the Rules”), or alternatively, struck-out under O 11 r 16. They contend that: ·               Energex has failed to plead the essential elements required to establish a cause of action in deceit; ·               a significant number of the allegations do not “deal with” the applicant and do not disclose a cause of action maintainable by it; ·               a significant number of the allegations in reliance on s 82(1) are statute barred; and ·               the claims based on ss 80 and 87 of the Act constitute an abuse of process in that they serve no independent purpose other than an attempt to avoid the limitation period in relation to claims that are statute barred under s 82. 40                  In order to understand these contentions, it is necessary to set out a few historical matters. The present application brought by Energex followed two earlier proceedings brought by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (“the ACCC”). Those proceedings were commenced in October 1999. The first, ACCC v ABB Transmission and Distribution Limited (2001) ATPR ¶41-815 concerned power transformers, and led to orders being made by consent against the first, third, fourth and fifth respondents. The second, ACCC v ABB Transmission and Distribution Limited (2001) ATPR ¶41-839 concerned distribution transformers, and led to orders being made by consent against the first, fourth and fifth respondents. In each of those proceedings, injunctions were granted against the first respondent, restraining it from engaging in certain conduct in relation to the supply of transformers that would otherwise be in breach of s 45 for a period of four years. 41                  As already indicated, one of Energex’s primary claims is that the corporate respondents engaged in conduct in breach of s 45. As regards the individual respondents, the applicant alleges that each was knowingly concerned in, or party to, the contraventions by their respective employers. 42                  It is important to note that Energex seeks injunctive relief against the respondents, under s 80. It also claims damages under ss 82(1) and/or 87(1), as well as in respect of its alternative claim for damages for deceit. 43                  Turning first to the challenge made to the pleading of deceit, Mr Hilton SC who appeared with Mr Elliott, on behalf of the Alstom respondents, submitted that the essential elements of that cause of action included the making of a false representation, knowledge of the falsity, an intention that the person to whom the representation is made act upon it, reliance upon the representation, and loss or damage thereby sustained. 44                  Mr Hilton submitted that Energex had failed in its pleading to “establish that a representation was made by ALSTOM or Rexel”. The meaning of that submission is not entirely clear. However, in substance, the point seems to be that although a representation can be made in circumstances where there has been no express statement, ordinarily silence, no matter how deceptive, cannot give rise to a cause of action in deceit. Absent a duty to disclose, silence cannot constitute the making of a representation.  45                  Mr Hilton submitted that pars 400 to 402 of the statement of claim failed to plead that either Alstom or Rexel had a duty to disclose anything to Energex in relation to the tender process. The fact that Energex may genuinely have believed that the details of each tender were secret, and confidential to each tenderer, could not in the absence of a specific representation by the tenderers, or any of them, found a cause of action.  46                  Mr Hilton also submitted that Energex’s pleading in relation to deceit should be struck out on the basis that the damage claimed in par 407 of the statement of claim was insufficiently connected, in a causal sense, with the deceit pleaded. He submitted, with reference to par (c) of the particulars of damage in par 407, that the statement of claim essentially pleaded that Energex had lost the opportunity to prevent the corporate respondents from giving effect to the anti-competitive arrangements previously alleged. However, he submitted, in an action for deceit, the general principle is that “the plaintiff is to be put, so far as possible, in the position he would have been in if he had not acted on the fraudulent inducement”: Gould v Vaggelas (1985) 157 CLR 215 at 220-221. In State of Queensland v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd (1999) ATPR ¶41-691 it was held at 42,840 and 42,841 that damages could not be recovered for lost opportunity. Accordingly, this limb of Energex’s case should be struck out.  47                  In addition, Mr Hilton complained that an allegation of deceit, involving as it did, a claim of dishonesty, was a serious matter, and should be properly particularised. He submitted that Energex had failed to particularise at least two critical elements of its claim, namely the alleged intention with which the representations were made (par 403), and the alleged dishonesty of those representations (par 405).  48                  Turning from the claim in deceit, Mr Hilton mounted a more general attack upon the pleading. He pointed out that the statement of claim identified forty-five separate tenders that were let by parties other than Energex or its predecessors. He submitted that these allegations had nothing whatever to do with Energex’s supposed loss or damage, and should for that reason be dismissed or struck out.  49                  Perhaps more fundamentally, Mr Hilton submitted that many of the price fixing allegations in the present proceeding related to tenders that were awarded more than six years prior to the filing of the statement of claim. As a result, he submitted, a large number of those claims were now statute barred.  50                  Mr Hilton developed his argument in the following way. Energex was seeking damages pursuant to s 82(1) of the Act. Its claim for damages under that section was contained in par 3 of the application by which this proceeding was initiated. Section 82(1) is, however, subject to a statutory limitation period that is now of six years. It was, at one time, three years. The effect of the limitation period was that any claims that related to tenders prior to 26 July 1998 were statute barred.  51                  Mr Hilton noted that Energex also claimed damages pursuant to s 87(1). He acknowledged that this section, unlike s 82(1), was not subject to any limitation period. However, he submitted that the claim under s 87(1) had been made solely in order to avoid the limitation period in s 82(2), and was therefore an abuse of process.  52                  Mr Hilton recognised that there was often a reluctance on the part of courts to deal with limitation defences at the interlocutory stage, it being thought preferable to consider them only after all the evidence had been led, or at least only at a final hearing. See for example Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia (1992) 175 CLR 514 at 533 (“Wardley”). He submitted, however, that there were strong reasons for departing from that course in the present case. He contended that the allegations related to causes of action that were so old, and so clearly time barred, that they should be disposed of at the interlocutory stage. He distinguished those cases in which there was an element of uncertainty as to when the relevant loss occurred, accepting that it would not be appropriate to deal with limitation issues in those cases until a final hearing. In the present case, he submitted, any loss sustained by Energex must have been suffered, at the latest, at the moment that each transformer was purchased.  53                  In order to understand this submission, it is necessary to have regard to s 82, in its present form. That sections provides: “82. Actions for damages  (1) A person who suffers loss or damage by conduct of another person that was done in contravention of a provision of Part IV, IVA, IVB or V or section 51AC may recover the amount of the loss or damage by action against that other person or against any person involved in the contravention.  (2) An action under subsection (1) may be commenced at any time within 6 years after the day on which the cause of action that relates to the conduct accrued.’  54                  Section 82(2), in its present form, came into force on 26 July 2001. Prior to that, the limitation period under that section was three years. Transitional provisions were enacted in the Trade Practices Amendment Act (No 1) 2001 (Cth). Item 21 of Sch 1 to that Act provided: “21 Application of item 20  (1) The amendment made by item 20 [ie the amendment to s 82(2)] applies in relation to conduct engaged in on or after the commencement of that item.  (2) The amendment made by item 20 also applies in relation to conduct engaged in before the commencement of that item, but only if the period that:  (a) relates to the conduct; and  (b) applied under subsection 82(2) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 before the commencement of that item;  had not ended when that item commenced.” 55                  Mr Hilton submitted that the effect of these transitional provisions was that the new six year limitation period applied to all causes of action that had not already been barred under the previous three year limitation period, as at 26 July 2001. Accordingly, any cause of action that accrued prior to 26 July 1998, which would have been barred by the time the amendments to s 82 were made, was statute barred. 56                  Mr Hilton then submitted that there were two elements in the cause of action established by s 82. They were a contravention, inter alia, of a provision of Pt IV of the Act and resultant loss or damage suffered by such conduct. 57                  Mr Hilton contended that a cause of action accrues as soon as all of the necessary elements are present. Accordingly, a cause of action under s 82 accrues once an applicant first suffers loss or damage by reason of the contravention: Arcadi v Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd (1984) ATPR ¶40-473 at 45,454. The loss must be actual loss or damage, rather than merely potential or likely loss or damage: Sellars v Adelaide Petroleum NL (1994) 179 CLR 332 at 348. By contrast, and by reason of s 87(1), actions under s 87 accrue on the date on which an applicant has suffered, “or is likely to suffer”, loss or damage. It was submitted that the distinction in the wording between these two provisions suggested that a cause of action under s 87 accrues from the date on which the contravention occurred.  58                  Critically, Mr Hilton submitted, that it is not an essential ingredient of a cause of action under s 82(1) that an applicant be aware that he or she has a right to sue. He referred to Torrens Aloha Pty Ltd v Citibank NA (1997) 72 FCR 581 at 595 per Sackville J, with whom the other members of the Full Court agreed, in support of that contention.  59                  It followed, so it was submitted, that in the present case, any claim that Energex might have under s 82(1) would have accrued as soon as loss or damage was first sustained. On Energex’s own case, that would have been at the moment that the transformers were accepted, and payment at an inflated price was made.  60                  Mr Hilton submitted that the limitation period established by s 82(2) was a condition of the right to damages under that section, and not merely a limitation on that right. Notably, he pointed out that there was no discretion vested in the Court to extend the limitation period under that section on what might be described as equitable grounds. See Keen Mar Corporation Pty Lt v Labrador Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd (1988) ATPR ¶40-853 at 49,196 and Australian Iron & Steel Ltd v Hoogland (1962) 108 CLR 471 at 488. It followed that any cause of action that accrued prior to 26 July 1998 was statute barred.  61                  Mr Hilton noted that pars 64, 65, 66 and 68 of the statement of claim alleged the existence of a number of agreements in relation to the fixing of tender prices, all of which preceded that date. Paragraphs 67 and 69 to 355 alleged that those agreements were all put into effect. All of the tenders referred to in those paragraphs had been let, and accepted, prior to 26 July 1998. They were therefore statute barred, and should either be dismissed under O 20 r 2(1)(a), or alternatively struck out under O 11 r 16. 62                  Mr Hilton then turned specifically to Energex’s claim under s 87(1) of the Act. That subsection provides: “(1) Without limiting the generality of section 80, where, in a proceeding instituted under this Part, or for an offence against Part VC, the Court finds that a person who is a party to the proceeding has suffered, or is likely to suffer, loss or damage by conduct of another person that was engaged in (whether before or after the commencement of this subsection) in contravention of a provision of Part IV, IVA, IVB, V or VC, the Court may, whether or not it grants an injunction under section 80 or makes an order under section 82, 86C or 86D, make such order or orders as it thinks appropriate against the person who engaged in the conduct or a person who was involved in the contravention (including all or any of the orders mentioned in subsection (2) of this section) if the Court considers that the order or orders concerned will compensate the first-mentioned person in whole or in part for the loss or damage or will prevent or reduce the loss or damage.” 63                  Section 87(2) provides that the orders referred to in s 87(1) include a number of orders specifically identified in s 87(2)(a) to (g). Section 87(2)(d) provides that among the orders that can be made in a claim under s 80, which provides for injunctive relief, is an order: “… directing the person who engaged in the conduct or a person who was involved in the contravention constituted by the conduct to pay to the person who suffered the loss or damage the amount of the loss or damage.” 64                  At first glance, the orders that may be made under s 87(2)(d) are the same as those that can be made under s 82(1). However, as noted earlier, actions brought under s 87(1), requesting loss or damages under s 87(2)(d), appear not to be subject to any limitation period.  65                  Mr Hilton submitted that the only reasonable inference to be drawn was that Energex, by seeking damages pursuant to s 87(2)(d), was attempting to circumvent the limitation period contained in s 82(2). He pointed out that the claim brought under s 87(1) and s 87(2)(d), was actually ancillary to the primary claim for injunctive relief under s 80. Indeed, s 87 was headed “Other Orders”, thereby signifying its ancillary nature.  66                  Mr Hilton contended that a similar tactic had been considered by a Full Court in Mayne Nickless Ltd v Multigroup Distribution Services Pty Ltd (2001) 114 FCR 108. There, the Court dealt with the question whether a claim under s 87(1) could be made in conjunction with a claim under s 82 that was out of time. The Court (Wilcox, French and Drummond JJ) noted that s 87(1) contained no time limit, but emphasised that this was because the sub-section provided for ancillary relief. Their Honours said at 123: “If a proceeding is brought out of time under s 82 and the limitation is pleaded and the application dismissed, then there will have been no finding of a contravention which is a necessary condition of the exercise of the power under s 87(1). If the time limitation under s 82(2) is not pleaded or is waived, or if the respondent is estopped from raising it, then a finding of contravention may be made and damages awarded under s 82. Such other orders as may be open under s 87 can also be made. That possibility is open as the time limitation imposed by s 82(2) does not in terms operate as a jurisdictional limitation but rather as a procedural bar.” 67                  Their Honours went on to say that it followed that the time limitation under s 82 did not exclude the possibility of orders being made under s 87(1) in a proceeding commenced after the expiration of three years from the date when the cause of action occurred. In proceedings for injunctive relief under s 80, no time limitation applied, although discretionary considerations might arise in relation to undue delay in seeking that relief.  68                  Mr Hilton noted their Honours’ comment at 124 that the absence of any time limitation under s 87, in relation to claims for damages under s 87(1), might render the time limit imposed by s 82(2) too easily avoidable.  69                  However, the Court went on to say at 124: “… So much may be accepted but does not provide a basis for writing into s 87(1) words that are not there. Indeed, to import into the subsection a time limitation on claims for damages under it would be to introduce an element inconsistent with its character as providing relief ancillary to a primary cause of action. The same is true of any attempt to import by analogy or otherwise the time limits imposed on claims for relief under s 87(1A) by s 87(1CA). There are, in any event, significant differences between the relief which may be awarded under s 87(1) and that which is recoverable under s 82. The primary difference is that the relief awarded under s 87(1) is discretionary. In the exercise of that discretion, a court would be entitled to have regard to whether the subsection had been invoked merely to overcome a time problem in proceedings that could, absent that problem, have been brought under s 82. The answer to the question whether proceedings have been brought on that basis may be informed by the extent to which the primary injunctive relief would be of any utility. If the primary injunctive relief were to be refused on discretionary grounds, including lack of utility, then there would be a real issue as to whether any award for damages should be made particularly where the case is one in which a claim under s 82 would have been out of time. It is also to be noted that the relief that may be awarded under s 87(1) includes relief which compensates only in part for loss or damage suffered. Section 82 on the other hand provides a right to complete recovery of loss or damage. Section 87(1) also allows for orders to be made to reduce or prevent likely loss or damage, a remedy not available under s 82. Having regard to the range of ancillary remedies available under s 87(1) and the range of circumstances to which it may be applied there is no warrant for importing into it any selective time limitation for any class of the relief available under it.” (emphasis added) 70                  Accordingly, Mr Hilton submitted that although Mayne Nickless might be thought, at first glance, to support Energex’s case that it could rely upon s 87(1) to recover damages, notwithstanding that its claim under s 82(2) might be time barred, that interpretation of the case had to be heavily qualified. On balance, Mayne Nickless at least suggested that caution ought to be exercised before permitting a claim under s 87(1) to be pursued, thereby avoiding the difficulties posed by s 82(2). 71                  Mr Hilton next submitted that, on any view, there had been undue delay in bringing the claim. He pointed to the fact that the ACCC had commenced proceedings against the Alstom respondents in 1999, and in 2000. Those proceedings had been settled by early 2001. Yet, Energex did not file its present application, or its statement of claim, until more than two years later on 26 May 2003.  72                  Importantly, Mr Hilton submitted that the injunctive relief sought by Energex under s 80, which formed the basis of the claim under s 87(1), would be of no utility. The terms of the injunction sought were substantially the same as those of the injunction that was already in force as a result of the judgment of the Court in ACCC v ABB Transmission and Distribution Limited (2001) ATPR ¶41-815. The only difference between that injunction, and the injunction sought, was that the injunction currently in force would expire at the end of four years from the date on which it was granted, whereas the injunction sought was one in perpetuity. Mr Hilton submitted that it was an abuse of process for Energex to seek essentially the same relief as had already been granted in other proceedings, purely in order to circumvent a limitation period: Williams v Spautz (1992) 174 CLR 509 at 528 and 536.  73                  Finally, Mr Hilton submitted that it would be “unjustifiably vexatious and oppressive” to permit Energex to litigate anew a case that had already been disposed of by earlier proceedings: Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 393. He submitted that it would be contrary to public policy to permit that course, with all its attendant risks. He pointed, in particular, to the danger that there might be inconsistent judgments if this matter were permitted to proceed. the wilson respondents’ contentions 74                  Mr Archibald QC, who appeared with Mr Collinson on behalf of the Wilson respondents, joined with Mr Hilton in submitting that all causes of action for damages pursuant to s 82(1) (other than those arising from one specific tender, No QESI 30/98) were statute barred because they had not been commenced within the time specified by s 82(2). Mr Archibald further submitted that both the claim for injunctive relief under s 80, and the claim for loss or damages under s 87(2)(d) be dismissed as disclosing no reasonable cause of action, or as being frivolous or vexatious, and as constituting an abuse of process. Finally, Mr Archibald submitted that the claim for deceit should also be summarily dismissed. 75                  In substance, Mr Archibald submitted that the relevant question to be determined was whether the conduct alleged against his clients had occurred before 26 July 1998. He submitted that, if so, any claim brought against them under s 82(1) was time barred date.  76                  Mr Archibald joined with Mr Hilton in submitting that a claim under s 82 had two elements. It required proof of a contravention of a provision of the Act, and also proof that loss or damage had been suffered as a result of that contravention. Accordingly, he submitted, a cause of action under s 82(2) accrued, not at the moment that a breach of a section of the Act had occurred, but only when loss or damage was suffered by reason of that breach. Mr Archibald cited, in addition to Acardi, James v ANZ Banking Group Ltd (1986) 64 ALR 347 at 392. 77                  Mr Archibald next submitted that the date on which loss or damage occurred was a question of fact, to be determined in all the circumstances of the case. He referred to Wardley, and to Karedis Enterprises Pty Ltd v Antoniou (1995) 55 FCR 35. He submitted that loss or damage could be suffered at the moment an applicant first entered into an agreement. A classic instance was where an asset was purchased and, by reason of an inherent defect, it was worth less than the price paid: Potts v Miller (1940) 64 CLR 282 at 298. Similarly, where an agreement imposed upon an applicant an obligation to pay a particular amount of money, without gaining any corresponding benefit, and the amount to be paid was quantified by “no factors extrinsic to the agreement save for the passing of time”, the loss would be suffered as soon as the agreement to pay became binding upon the applicant.  78                  Mr Archibald contrasted these examples with the case where the actual loss that an applicant suffered depended not only upon the making of an agreement, but also upon circumstances extrinsic to that agreement. In such a case, he submitted, the loss would not be suffered until those circumstances had transpired. Thus, in Wardley, where the State of Western Australia gave an indemnity to a bank which entitled the bank to demand the payment of money upon certain contingencies, the State was not under any liability to pay until those contingencies occurred. The relevant loss or damage was not suffered merely by giving the indemnity.  79                  Mr Archibald submitted that, in the present proceeding, Energex alleged that combinations of transformer manufacturers had in various ways reached agreements, arrangements or understandings which affected the tender prices they submitted in response to tenders issued by Energex. The allegations in relation to each tender followed a common pattern with a series of tender contracts being pleaded in pars 69 to 355 of the statement of claim. On the basis of such conduct, various contraventions of the Act were alleged in pars 362 to 390 so as to attract liability under ss 80(1)(a), 82(1) and 87(1). Loss or damage was then said to arise as set out in pars 381 to 385. 80                  Mr Archibald contended that this was a case where any loss or damage suffered by the applicant necessarily arose immediately upon entry into each tender contract pleaded in the statement of claim. Unlike Wardley, no question arose of contingent liabilities, or of unfairness in compelling an applicant to institute a proceeding before the existence of its loss could be ascertained. There was no possibility that the Court would be put in the difficult position of having to estimate damages on the basis of probabilities, rather than assessing damages by reference to established events: Wardley at 527. Each agreement imposed upon Energex an obligation to pay an amount of money without acquiring a corresponding benefit. The amount to be paid was not quantified by factors extrinsic to the agreement, save for the passing of time. It followed that each cause of action for loss or damage arose upon the date of entry into each tender contract.  81                  Mr Archibald submitted that all of the contracts, except one, QESI 30/98, had been made before 26 July 1998. They were therefore statute barred. All that was left was a claim for damages arising out of QESI 30/98, an amount totalling $441,113.  82                  Mr Archibald acknowledged that the High Court had made it clear in Wardley that it was ordinarily undesirable that limitation questions should be decided in interlocutory proceedings, in advance of the hearing of the action. The Full Court made the same point in Mayne Nickless, at [26] when it observed that: “Generally speaking a statutory time limitation will not support an order striking out a claim for failure to disclose a reasonable cause of action or on the basis that the proceeding is frivolous or vexatious or an abuse of the process of the Court: see Carey-Hazell v Getz Bros & Co (Aust) Pty Ltd. (2001) 112 FCR 336 and the cases reviewed there.”  83                  The reason why courts are reluctant to deal with limitation issues at an interlocutory stage is because, generally speaking, not enough is known about the damage sustained by an applicant, and the circumstances in which it was sustained, to justify a confident answer to the question whether the proceeding should be statute barred before all of the evidence has been heard. However, Warldey recognised that there were exceptions to this rule. That case concerned contingent liabilities, and that issue did not arise here.  84                  Mr Archibald submitted that where, as in the present case, it was clear that an applicant could not succeed on its claim, as pleaded, because s 82(2) would be a complete answer to that claim, the Court should not defer the inevitable. As the action must fail, the Court should not hesitate to say so. He referred to Jobbins v Capel Court Corporation Ltd(1989) 25 FCR 226 at 231. 85                  In addition, Mr Archibald submitted that there would be considerable utility in striking out the claim for damages under s 82(1) at this stage. Removing that claim from the proceeding would have a major impact upon the preparation and future conduct of the case. Apart from the claim for injunctive relief, it would leave only the claim for damages for deceit, and the claim for damages pursuant to s 87. Although these claims might have to be tried, the issues raised would be considerably narrowed.  86                  Mr Archibald then turned to the claim for injunctive relief. He submitted that Energex had simply fashioned a claim under s 80 in order to enable damages to be obtained under s 87(1). He noted that the claim for damages pursuant to s 82 had been pleaded as though it were nothing more than an alternative claim to that made under s 87(1). That was transparently nothing more than a device, designed to circumvent the limitation period in s 82(2). All of this had occurred against the background of this Court having already granted injunctive relief against the Wilson respondents, in favour of the ACCC, in terms that were almost identical to those sought by Energex in the present proceeding. 87                  Mr Archibald further noted that it was not suggested that his clients had engaged in any contravening conduct after February 1999. Yet the present application had not been instituted until more than four years later, in May 2003, following the final disposition of the ACCC proceedings. There was no allegation by Energex of any threat by the Wilson respondents to engage in any further contravening conduct. Indeed, Finkelstein J, in his judgment in proceeding no V868 of 2000, on 3 May 2002, found that it was unlikely that the Wilson respondents would offend again. His Honour therefore concluded that specific deterrence was not a relevant consideration when fixing an appropriate penalty.  88                  Mr Archibald acknowledged that the Court could grant injunctive relief restraining a person from engaging in conduct in contravention of the Act irrespective of whether it appeared that the person intended to engage again, or to continue to engage, in conduct of that kind: see s 80(4)(a). He submitted, however, that the risk that such conduct might recur was relevant to the exercise of the discretion: see ACCC v CG Verbatis Holdings Pty Ltd (2001) ATPR ¶41-802 at 42,638. He further submitted that the present proceeding was unique, in some respects. Energex was seeking a perpetual injunction against his clients notwithstanding the fact that there was already in place an injunction in similar terms for a period of four years.  89                  Mr Archibald submitted that it was an abuse of process to bring such a claim. He submitted that it was also frivolous or vexatious to do so. The claim for injunctive relief was, in his submission, “clearly foredoomed to fail”: Walton v Gardiner. There was no realistic prospect that the Court would grant the injunctive relief sought, given the existence of an injunction in almost identical terms, and given also the absence of any risk that the contravening conduct would be repeated. It was obvious that the claim for injunctive relief had been included purely in order to gain a collateral advantage.  90                  Finally, Mr Archibald submitted that the claim for deceit, as pleaded, should not be permitted to stand. He submitted that the tort required proof that a representation had been made which is not in fact genuinely believed to be true. Representations were usually made by statements, whether oral or written. Sometimes representations could be implied from acts and conduct. The law also recognised that a half-truth could amount to a falsehood. Notwithstanding qualifications of these kinds, mere silence, or non-disclosure of certain facts could not ordinarily give rise to a claim in deceit. There had to be more. For example, there might be cases where, by reason of the existence of a particular relationship, there was a duty to disclose. Such relationships might include trustee and beneficiary, solicitor and client, and principal and agent. They did not, however, include vendor and purchaser. The question whether silence alone could constitute misleading or deceptive conduct under s 52 of the Act raised an entirely different issue.  91                  Mr Archibald submitted that Energex had done no more than allege that the mere act of submitting a tender in response to its invitation constituted a representation by each tenderer that the price and other terms of the tender had been arrived at independently, and without any knowledge of the price and terms of any other tender. The alleged representations could not be distilled from the mere submission of a tender in these circumstances.  92                  In State of Queensland v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd, one issue was whether the tort of deceit had been adequately pleaded. The statement of claim alleged that the respondents had committed that tort in impliedly representing that the various offers to provide pre-mixed concrete were competitive and non-collusive, and complied with the State’s Standard Code of Tendering. It was alleged that these were not representations capable of supporting a claim in deceit. Drummond J rejected that contention, and held that the conduct of the respondents in submitting tenders was “capable of” amounting to a representation that the prices at which they were prepared to supply concrete were competitive and non-collusive.  93                  Mr Archibald submitted that Pioneer Concrete was readily distinguishable. In that case, the claim for deceit was struck out, at least in part, because of a difficulty with causation. The applicant in that case had pleaded that, by virtue of the deceit, it had lost the opportunity to take such steps as it was advised, including bringing proceedings under s 80, or requesting the Trade Practices Commission to bring such proceedings, to prevent the respondents from continuing to give effect to the collusive agreements alleged. The applicant’s case therefore assumed that when a person makes a fraudulent misrepresentation, the victim’s damages in deceit are assessed on the basis of the gains the victim might have made, or the detriment it might have avoided, had the fraudster disclosed the true position. That was not, and never had been, the law. In an action for deceit, the plaintiff could only seek to be put, so far as possible, in the position he would have been in had he not acted on the fraudulent inducement: see generally Pioneer Concrete at [85] to [86].  94                  Mr Archibald submitted that Energex, having failed to plead the existence of a duty of full disclosure, could not recover the wider damages claimed in this case unless it could say that those damages flowed directly from, i.e. were caused by, the respondents’ misrepresentations. However, what caused Energex’s subsequent losses was not the initial representation, but rather the agreement made beforehand between the respondents, and the implementation of that agreement. Energex had not pleaded, and sought to avoid pleading, a duty of full disclosure. It only alleged that had the representations not been made, it would have investigated why the tenderers were unwilling to participate in a public tender process. the schneider respondents’ contentions 95                  Mr Gray, who appeared on behalf of the Schneider respondents, submitted that the statement of claim was seriously deficient in setting out Energex’s involvement in the various arrangements with the respondents, and with other transformer manufacturers. He submitted that the claims made against his clients suffered from the vice of uncertainty, containing many allegations that he described as “rolled up”, and therefore impossible to meet.  96                  Mr Gray also joined with Mr Hilton and Mr Archibald in attacking the pleading in deceit, and in asserting that the claims for damages pursuant to s 82 were time barred. 97                  Mr Gray developed his submissions by noting that Schneider had commenced manufacturing electrical transformers in December 1993, after it acquired the shares in ASET. Energex claimed that Schneider contravened s 45(2)(a)(i) and s 45A(1) by entering into arrangements with other transformer manufacturers to tender for the supply of transformers, which resulted in those suppliers charging higher prices than would otherwise have been the case. He submitted that the statement of claim was drawn in an unsatisfactory manner because the case against his clients could not clearly be discerned. He pointed specifically to pars 64, 179, 276, 379, 382, 383, 384, 397, 398 and 388 as containing “rolled-up” pleas.  98                  It is unnecessary, for present purposes, to summarise all of the many complaints that Mr Gray made regarding the form of the pleading. It is sufficient to provide the flavour of those complaints by summarising what he said about two specific paragraphs. 99                  Mr Gray submitted that par 64 should be struck out on the basis that it was a “rolled-up” plea which failed to identify and single out those material facts that were alleged against the Schneider respondents, as opposed to those facts alleged against the other respondents.  100               Paragraph 64 of the statement of claim reads as follows: “ARRANGEMENT   64. By no later than 1982, transformer manufacturers had made an agreement or arrangement or arrived at an understanding (“the Transformer Arrangement”) whereby: (a) they would allocate tenders for the production and supply of transformers amongst themselves with a view to each of them maintaining their share of sales of power transformers and distribution transformers; (b) the maintenance of each manufacturer's share of sales would be achieved by the manufacturers agreeing to the allocation of tenders for the production and supply of transformers to a particular manufacturer (“the selected manufacturer”) in the expectation that the selected manufacturer would be awarded the contract resulting from the tender; (c) the allocation of a contract to the selected manufacturer would be sought to be achieved by the selected manufacturer submitting a tender at a lower AAV than the tenders submitted by other manufacturers, or by the other manufacturers not submitting a tender; (d) the submission of the tender by the selected manufacturer at a lower AAV would be achieved by the manufacturers discussing their tenders with each other, and the manufacturers other than the selected manufacturers ensuring that their tenders yielded a higher AAV than the tender of the selected manufacturer. Particulars The best particulars that the Applicant can currently provide are that the existence of such an agreement, arrangement or understanding is to be inferred from the overt acts specified in paragraphs 75, 79, 104, 110, 118, 130, 142, 146, 150, 158, 176, 182, 186, 189, 194, 196, 197, 199, 203, 205, 207, 216, 219, 227, 231, 233, 237, 241, 243, 249, 251, 253, 255, 257, 259, 261, 263, 265, 267, 269, 271, 276, 283, 285, 287, 289, 291, 293, 295, 298, 300, 303, 308, 311, 319, 329, 333, 335, 343, 345, 347, 350, 355, 383 and 384 hereof. In relation to the acts specified in paragraphs 75, 79, 104, 110, 118, 130, 142, 146, 150, 158, 176, 182, 186, 189, 194, 196, 197, 199, 203, 205, 207, 216, 219, 227, 231, 233, 237, 241, 243, 249, 251, 253, 255, 257, 259, 261, 263, 265, 267, 269, 271, 276, 283, 285, 287, 289, 291, 293, 295, 298, 300, 303, 308, 311, 319, 329, 333, 335, 343, 345, 347, 350, 355, 383 and 384 hereof, the Applicant relies on them both as overt acts from which the existence of the Transformer Arrangement can be inferred, and as separate agreements, arrangements or understandings.   101               Mr Gray submitted that a pleading drawn in this manner made it impossible to understand what role, if any, his clients were alleged to have played in relation to the “Transformer Arrangement”, to which the paragraph referred. He complained that the reference, in the particulars, to the numerous paragraphs of the statement of claim, from which such an agreement, arrangement or understanding could be inferred, reinforced the “rolled-up” nature of the plea. The problem was exacerbated by the fact that Energex asserted that it relied upon each and every one of the overt acts specified in order to infer the existence of the Transformer Arrangement. At the same time, Energex relied upon those same overt acts as the basis for the inference that there were “separate agreements, arrangements or understandings”. This inconsistency in approach was said to be the source of some confusion. 102               Mr Gray claimed that par 179 of the statement of claim was defective in that it contained no allegations against the Schneider respondents in relation to the 1993 Distribution Transformer Arrangement, whereas subsequently, in par 272, Energex referred expressly to the Schneider respondents as having participated in the Transformer Arrangement, or alternatively, the 1993 Distribution Transformer Arrangement.  103               Paragraph 179 reads as follows: “179. Further and alternatively to paragraph 64 hereof, in about early 1993, ABBPT, WTC and Tyree made an agreement or arrangement or arrived at an understanding (“the 1993 Distribution Transformer Arrangement”) whereby: (a) ABBPT, WTC and Tyree agreed that they would not compete with each other for contracts let to tender for the production and supply of distribution transformers, with a view to each of them maintaining their share of sales of distribution transformers; (b) ABBPT, WTC and Tyree agreed that they would allocate such tenders so that usually the company which had an existing contract to supply that particular purchaser would be awarded the new contract to result from the letting of the tender. (c) the awarding of the new contract to the existing supplier would be sought to be achieved by the selected supplier submitting a tender at a lower AAV than the tenders submitted by other manufacturers, or by the other manufacturers not submitting a tender, in the expectation that the selected supplier would be awarded the contract resulting from the tender; (d) the submission of the tender by the selected supplier at a lower AAV would be achieved by the manufacturers discussing their tenders with each other, and the manufacturers other than the selected supplier ensuring that their tenders yielded a higher AAV than the tender of the selected manufacturer. Particulars (i) The agreement or arrangement was made, or the understanding was arrived at, at a number of meetings and telephone conversations between Pitt and Jones on behalf of ABBPT, Wilson on behalf of WTC, and Boyce on behalf of Tyree. (ii) The meetings and telephone conversations which took place included: (A) a meeting on 25 February 1993 at the ABB premises at Darra, Brisbane, between Pitt and Boyce. (B) a meeting on 26 March 1993 at the ABB premises at Moorebank, Sydney, at which Pitt, Jones and Boyce were present. (C) Telephone conversation and/or meetings in the period of late 1992 to mid 1993 between Ptitt and/or Jones and Wilson that the Applicant is not yet able to particularise. (iii) The submission of tenders at an appropriate AAV was to be achieved by:  (A) When a request for tenders was announced, and the quantity and specifications for the product were known, the parties would individually commence preparation of a tender in the ordinary course. (B) Shortly prior to the closing date for the tender, the representatives of the party with an existing contract was to contact the representative for each other party by telephone and arrange a “covering bid” for the tender process. A covering bid would involve the other parties agreeing with the party with an existing contract to provide a bid with a higher AAV so as to enable the party with an existing contract to win the tender. The covering margin was to be 2% to 5%. Alternatively, agreement was reached for another supplier to win the tender. (C) The representatives of each party were then to have a detailed discussion of their respective AAVs for each of the relevant tender items. Prices and/or AAVs could also be exchanged by facsimile. (iv) Each party would then submit a tender in accordance with and in the knowledge of the price information exchanged, the effect of which being that the bid of the selected supplier would be covered by the bids of the other parties.” 104               Paragraph 272 is in the following terms: “272. In or about May 1995: (a) ABBPT, WTC and Tyree re-committed to the Transformer Arrangement, or alternatively the 1993 Distribution Transformer Arrangement, and Schneider agreed to participate in the Transformer Arrangement, or alternatively the 1993 Distribution Transformer Arrangement; or (b) ABBPT, WTC, Tyree and Schneider made an agreement or arrangement or arrived at an understanding that they would not compete with each other for contracts let to tender for the production and supply of distribution transformers, with a view to each of them maintaining their share of sales of distribution transformers. The parties agreed as part of the agreement, arrangement or understanding that it was to be implemented in the manner pleaded in paragraph 179 above;  except that (c) due to the break up of the State-wide electricity utility in Victoria into five regionally based utilities, WTC and Schneider would need to agree on how any forthcoming tenders in Victoria for distribution transformers above 100kVA would be shared between them so as to ensure that they maintained their share of sales of distribution transformers; the conduct in this paragraph being referred to as the “1995 Distribution Transformer Arrangement”. Particulars   (i) The agreement or arrangement was made at a number of meetings and telephone conversations between Pitt and Jones on behalf of ABBPT, Wilson on behalf of WTC, Boyce on behalf of Tyree, and Stocker on behalf of Schneider . (ii) The meetings and telephone conversations which took place included: (A) A meeting on 17 March 1994 immediately before or after an AEEMA meeting at Woolloomooloo Waters, Woolloomooloo Bay, Sydney at which Pitt and/or Jones and Stocker were present. (B) A meeting on 29 July 1994 immediately after an AEEMA meeting at the Australian Chamber of Manufacturers offices, St Kilda, Melbourne at which Jones, Wilson and Stocker were present. (C) A meeting on 11 November 1994 immediately after an AEEMA meeting at Sanctuary Cove, Surfers Paradise at which Pitt, Jones, Wilson and Stocker were present.  (D) A meeting in late 1994 at the home of Wilson in Glen Iris, Melbourne at which Jones, Wilson and Stocker were present. (E) A meeting in or about May 1995 at the home of Wilson in Glen Iris, Melbourne at which Jones, Wilson, Stocker and Boyce were present. (F) Telephone conversations during the period from about March 1994 to May 1995 between Pitt, Jones, Wilson, Boyce and Stocker that the Applicant is not yet able to particularise.” 105               Mr Gray submitted that it was impossible to glean from reading these paragraphs in conjunction with each other precisely what conduct Energex alleged that the Schneider respondents had engaged in that was said to have given rise to the 1993 Distribution Transformer Arrangement.  106               Mr Gray levelled similar criticisms at numerous other paragraphs of the statement of claim. For example, he submitted that par 276 was defective because the allegation contained therein was devoid of proper particulars regarding any alleged agreement or arrangement made by Schneider with respect to a particular tender. I interpolate, at this stage, to observe that many of his criticisms can fairly be described as “pleading points”, raising matters that could be addressed by the provision of further particulars. Even if there were substance in his complaints, it would not necessarily follow that the application should be dismissed, or that the statement of claim should be struck out, in whole or in part.  107               Mr Gray largely adopted the submissions of Mr Hilton and Mr Archibald with regard to the pleading of the tort of deceit. He submitted that the tort had been pleaded in a manner that could be analysed in the following way: “(a) Paragraph 400 simply pleads that the applicant purchased transformers from transformer manufacturers, including Schneider, by the selection of a tender after a public tender process. (b)               Paragraph 401 pleads what that tender process involved. (c)               Paragraph 402 pleads that in submitting a tender each tenderer represented that the price and other terms of the tender had been arrived at by the tenderer without knowledge of the price and terms of any other tenderer and was not subject to any agreement, arrangement or understanding between them. It is pleaded that these representations are to be implied from the facts pleaded in paragraph 401. It is submitted there is no basis upon which such representations could be said to arise from the facts pleaded in paragraph 401 as to the tender process. (d)               Paragraphs 404 and 405 allege that the representations were false and that they were made dishonestly in that they were made with knowledge of the falsity. There is, it is contended, no proper basis pleaded for the allegation of dishonesty. There is, furthermore, no proper basis pleaded that the alleged representations were made with knowledge of their falsity. The pleading simply relies upon the tender process alleged in paragraph 401 as impliedly giving rise to a representation that the tender submitted had been arrived at by the tenderer without any knowledge of the price or terms of any other tender and was not the subject of any agreement or arrangement or understanding between the tenderers. That is not sustainable on the matters pleaded.”  108               Mr Gray submitted that the pleading in deceit should be struck out because the Schneider respondents had not been successful in any of the tenders set out in Annexure “A” to the statement of claim. A plaintiff could only be liable in deceit for damage actually caused on the basis that damage is the gist of the tort.  109               Finally, Mr Gray noted that par 381 of the statement of claim alleged that Schneider had been involved in contravening conduct “between May 1995 and 1 June 1996”, and then “from 1 January 1996”. According to par 354, the last tender by Energex in which it was alleged that Schneider had engaged in contravening conduct was the Aurora tender, on 8 January 1999. The only other tenders that might have occurred after 26 July 1998 were those described in pars 344, 346, 348, and 354. The tenders that occurred prior to that date were those described in pars 234, 270, 274, 282, 284, 294, 297, 299, 301, 307, 314, 316, 318, 328, 330, 334 and 342. For the reasons advanced by Mr Hilton and Mr Archibald, the claims relating to the tenders that occurred prior to 26 July 1998 should be struck out. energex’s contentions in reply  110               Mr Keane QC, who appeared with Mr O’Shea SC and Mr O’Bryan on behalf of Energex, commenced his reply by noting that O 11 r 2(a) provides that a pleading of a party shall contain, and contain only, a statement in summary form of the material facts on which the party relies, but not the evidence by which those facts are to be proved.  111               Mr Keane submitted that it was well established that the material facts are those necessary for the purpose of formulating a complete cause of action. It is not sufficient that the statement of claim simply express a conclusion drawn from facts that are not stated. Not only must all material facts be pleaded, but they must be pleaded with a sufficient degree of specificity, having regard to the general subject matter, to convey to the opposing party the case that party has to meet. It must be apparent on the face of the document that the facts pleaded, if proved, would establish the cause of action relied upon: see Multigroup Distribution Services Pty Ltd v TNT Australia Pty Ltd (1996) ATPR ¶41-522 at 42,679. 112               Mr Keane then summarised his understanding of the elements of a cause of action alleging a contravention of s 45(2)(a). He identified the following elements: ·               the making of a contract, arrangement or understanding (collectively described for convenience as an “arrangement”); ·               a party to the arrangement being a corporation; and ·               the arrangement containing either an exclusionary provision, or a provision that has the purpose or likely effect of substantially lessening competition in a market.  113               Mr Keane submitted that in relation to an arrangement containing an exclusionary provision within the meaning of s 4D, two additional elements had to be satisfied. The arrangement must be made between persons, any two of whom were in competition with each other. In addition, the provision within the arrangement must have the purpose of preventing, restricting or limiting the supply of goods or services to, or the acquisition of goods or services from, particular persons or classes of persons.  114               Mr Keane also noted that under s 45A(1), a provision of an arrangement would be deemed to have the purpose or likely effect of substantially lessening competition if it had the purpose or likely effect of fixing, controlling or maintaining the price for goods or services supplied or acquired by the parties to the arrangement, or any of them in competition with each other.  115               Mr Keane then turned to s 45(2)(b). He submitted that in order to establish a contravention of that provision, it was necessary to show that the arrangement that contravened s 45(2)(a) had been implemented. See generally Sammy Russo Supplies Pty Ltd v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (1998) ATPR ¶41-641 at 41,094.  116               Having outlined the elements of a cause of action under s 45, Mr Keane next summarised his reasons for contending that the Court should not, at this stage, entertain the respondents’ applications to dismiss, or strike out, Energex’s claims under s 82(1) as being time barred. In substance, he submitted: ·                    the claims had not been commenced outside the limitation period, having regard to the proper construction of s 82, and the nature of the loss alleged; ·                    there was no utility in dealing with summary dismissal at this stage, having regard to the fact that the same issues would have to be canvassed, in any event, in the trial when dealing with Energex’s claim against the ABB respondents. Those respondents had not sought summary dismissal on this or any other ground. Moreover, Energex’s claims under s 87 would still need to be addressed; and ·                    it was inappropriate to deal with any application for summary dismissal at this stage because the respondents had not yet filed their defences. It was possible, at least in theory, that no limitation defence would be pleaded. If limitation defences were raised, Energex would seek leave to amend its statement of claim, and seek damages for loss arising from that plea. Energex would also respond to the defence by filing a reply, relying upon a claim of fraudulent concealment.  117               Mr Keane developed these contentions in considerable detail. He challenged the respondents’ contention that each cause of action under s 45 had accrued on the date on which Energex had entered into each tender contract. He submitted that the only cause of action that s 82(2) was concerned with was that conferred by s 82(1). That cause of action was conferred on a person who suffered loss or damage by reason of certain proscribed conduct. The language by which that cause of action was conferred was not, as the respondents submitted, concerned with the moment at which loss or damage was incurred within the conceptions of the general law, or other statutes.  118               Mr Keane drew attention to the following passage from the judgment of the Full Court in Western Australia v Wardley Australia Ltd (1991) 30 FCR 245 at 255-256: “... it is unsafe in the process of statutory construction of s 82 to turn first to, or to rely too heavily upon, analogies drawn from the interpretation by other courts of statutes of limitation controlling causes of action arising under the general law or other statute. This particularly is so in circumstances where, in construing those other limitation statutes, the courts have been constrained by the terms thereof to reach, as Lord Reid pointed out in Cartledge v E Jopling & Sons Ltd [1963] AC 758 at 771-772, conclusions running against the grain of the common law, which favours conclusions consistent with common sense and basic fairness.” 119               Mr Keane submitted that the High Court had, in recent years, adopted the same approach to the interpretation of s 82: Marks v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd (1998) 196 CLR 494 and I & L Securities Pty Ltd v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Ltd (2002) 210 CLR 109 at 135. Analogies with the law of tort and contract were useful aids, but could not be substituted automatically for the “flexible and general” language of the section.  120               Mr Keane took his lead from this approach, and focused on the word “suffers” in s 82(1). He noted that the Macquarie Dictionary defines “suffer” as, inter alia: “1. to undergo or feel pain or distress. 2. to sustain injury, disadvantage or loss. 3. to undergo a penalty, especially of death, 4. to be the object of some action. 5. to endure patiently or bravely. – verb (t), 6. to undergo, experience, or be subjected to (pain, distress, injury, loss, or anything unpleasant) …” 121               Mr Keane submitted that the cause of action conferred s 82(1) was expressed in language that involved a person “feeling, undergoing, or enduring” loss or damage. A loss could not sensibly be said to be “felt or undergone or endured” unless the person said to feel or undergo or endure the loss appreciated that the loss had been incurred. In other words, one could not “suffer” loss or damage without being aware of the fact that one had done so.  122               Mr Keane submitted that it was not to the point to say, as Mr Hilton had done, that “knowledge of the right to sue is not an essential ingredient of a cause of action”. What was at issue was not whether, or when, Energex first knew that it had a cause of action. The issue was rather when that cause of action first arose. Mr Keane submitted that it did not arise until Energex suffered the loss; that is, when it discovered that the prices that it had paid were not competitive, but rigged and, in consequence, excessive.  123               Mr Keane submitted that this approach accorded with common sense, and justice. It avoided the injustice that a right of action might be lost before the party who had that right knew anything of the facts that gave rise to it. It was hardly likely that legislature would have intended such an absurd, and unfair, outcome. Mr Keane submitted that there was no authority standing in the way of this construction of s 82(1), and that there was at least implicit support to be found in some of the case law. 124               Mr Keane referred first to Cartledge v E Jopling & Sons Ltd [1963] AC 758. That case concerned the effect of s 2(1)(a) of the Limitation Act 1939 (UK) which provided that an action founded on tort should not be brought after the expiration of six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued. In that case, workmen, while employed as steel dressers in a factory, contracted pheumoconiosis, a disease in which slowly accruing and progressive damage may be done to a person’s lungs without that person’s knowledge.  125               The House of Lords held that the cause of action accrued at the date of the loss or damage when there had been a wrongdoing by the defendant from which loss or damage (not being insignificant) was suffered by the plaintiff, irrespective of whether he had any knowledge of such loss or damage. Accordingly, the claims were statute barred.  126               Mr Keane acknowledged that, superficially, Cartledge seemed to support the respondents’ contentions. However, he submitted that on a closer analysis of the reasoning, the case actually supported his argument. He referred to the speech of Lord Reid at 771-772: “It is now too late for the courts to question or modify the rules that a cause of action accrues as soon as a wrongful act has caused personal injury beyond what can be regarded as negligible, even when that injury is unknown to and cannot be discovered by the sufferer, and that further injury arising from the same act at a later date does not give rise to a further cause of action. It appears to me to be unreasonable and unjustifiable in principle that a cause of action should be held to accrue before it is possible to discover any injury and, therefore, before it is possible to raise any action. If this were a matter governed by the common law I would hold that a cause of action ought not to be held to accrue until either the injured person has discovered the injury or it would be possible for him to discover it if he took such steps as were reasonable in the circumstances. The common law ought never to produce a wholly unreasonable result, nor ought existing authorities to be read so literally as to produce such a result in circumstances never contemplated when they were decided. But the present question depends on statute, the Limitation Act, 1939, and section 26 of that Act appears to me to make it impossible to reach the result which I have indicated. That section makes special provisions where fraud or mistake is involved: it provides that time shall not begin to run until the fraud has been or could with reasonable diligence have been discovered. Fraud here has been given a wide interpretation, but obviously it could not be extended to cover this case. The necessary implication from that section is that, where fraud or mistake is not involved, time begins to run whether or not the damage could be discovered. So the mischief in the present case can only be prevented by further legislation.” 127               Mr Keane submitted that the considerations that had led the House of Lords to arrive at its reluctant conclusion were not present in this case. In particular, there was no provision in the Act analogous to s 26 of the Limitation Act making special provision for when time began to run in particular cases, such as fraud or mistake. There was therefore no need to construe s 82(1) so as to produce a result that was “an affront to common sense”.  128               Next Mr Keane referred to a passage in the judgment of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Wardley that, he suggested, supported his contention that no loss is suffered until the facts that give rise to that loss are ascertained. The Full Court said at 262: “In cases of economic loss, authorities dealing with injury to interests in tangible property will not necessarily be of immediate assistance … (W)here the economic interest of the plaintiff which is injured by the negligence of the defendant is the value of property acquired by the plaintiff, it may be appropriate to speak of the cause of action for economic loss sustained … as accruing when the … damage is manifest …” 129               Next Mr Keane submitted that there was no general rule that loss was suffered at the moment when a person paid too much for an asset. He referred, in that regard, to what Brennan J said in Wardley at 536-537: “… A plaintiff may suffer economic loss or damage in a number of ways: by payment of money, by transfer of property, by diminution in the value of an asset or by the incurring of a liability. Whether loss or damage is actually suffered when any of those events occurs depends on the value of the benefit, if any, acquired by the plaintiff by paying the money, transferring the property, having the value of the asset diminished or incurring the liability. If the plaintiff acquires no benefit, the loss or damage is suffered when the event occurs. At that time, the plaintiff’s net worth is reduced. And that is so even if the quantification of that loss or damage is not then ascertainable. But if a benefit is acquired by the plaintiff it may not be possible to ascertain whether loss or damage has been suffered at the time when the burden is borne -that is, at the time of the payment, the transfer, the diminution in value of the asset or the incurring of the liability. A transaction in which there are benefits and burdens results in loss or damage only if an adverse balance is struck. If the balance cannot be struck until certain events occur, no loss is suffered until those events occur. The quantification of the diminution in value of an asset or of a liability incurred or the value of any benefit acquired may not be ascertainable at the time when the burden of the transaction is borne. In that event, the suffering of any loss cannot be said to occur before it is reasonably ascertainable (not before it is ascertained) that the burdens which the plaintiff has borne are greater than the value of the benefits that the plaintiff has acquired or will acquire. In other words, no loss is suffered until it is reasonably ascertainable that, by bearing the burdens, the plaintiff is “worse off than if he had not entered into the transaction.” (footnote omitted) 130               Mr Keane noted that in Karedis, the Full Court had considered this aspect of the decision Wardley. In Karedis, the facts were as follows. In October 1988, the applicants leased from the respondents certain premises on which they intended to operate a café. They traded from December 1988 until February 1991. They commenced proceedings in November 1992, seeking damages under s 82(1), on the basis of a contravention of s 52 alleging misrepresentations as to the likely takings from the café. The losses claimed included trading losses from December 1988. The defendants contended that the claim under s 82(1) was statute barred.  131               The majority, Burchett and Hill JJ, held that the entry into the lease produced a situation where the applicants had only the potential to suffer loss. Whether any actual loss was suffered could only be determined by considering the receipts and outgoings of the business over time. The question for the Court was when the loss, which the applicants ultimately suffered (or a more than negligible part of it), was either ascertained by them, or reasonably ascertainable. That point would have been reached after the business was commenced, but within the first twelve months of trading.  132               Sackville J agreed with the majority, but added some additional comments. His Honour said at 45: “In Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia (1992) 175 CLR 514, the High Court considered the time at which loss had been sustained by a party who had entered into an agreement creating an executory and contingent liability. The Court held that, where a person is induced by misrepresentations to enter such an agreement, that person does not suffer a loss for the purposes of s 82 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) until the contingency is fulfilled: at 533, per Mason CJ, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ.  The precise holding in Wardley does not necessarily mean that a person suffers a loss for the purposes of s 82 only when he or she knows, or has the means of knowing, that a particular transaction has produced financial disadvantages that outweigh the advantages. The actual decision in Wardley rested on the fact that:  “[i]f an action is commenced before [the contingency is fulfilled], it will fail if the events so transpire that it becomes clear that no loss is, or will be, incurred.”  Wardley, itself, was therefore not a case where the party which had been misled had in fact sustained a loss at the relevant time (that is, in accordance with objective criteria supported by evidence at a subsequent trial), but did not then have the knowledge or the means of ascertaining that such a loss had occurred.  The reasoning of the Court does, however, support the proposition that, at least in the case where the disadvantageous character of a transaction cannot be ascertained at the outset, a loss is not sustained until the plaintiff or applicant ascertains, or has the means available to ascertain, that he or she has been prejudiced by entry into the transaction. Potential loss is not enough.” 133               His Honour then quoted from the judgment of the majority in Wardley at 527, and continued at 46: “This passage suggests that, where the applicant has been induced by misleading and deceptive conduct to enter a lease, as in the present case, no loss is sustained unless and until the existence of the loss is ascertained or ascertainable by the applicant. The significance of “events as they unfold” is that they bring home, or should bring home, to the lessee that the obligations imposed by the lease exceed the value of any offsetting benefits, such as the lessee's entitlement to conduct a business on the leasehold premises. It would seem that a loss is not sustained simply because evidence given at a subsequent hearing demonstrates, with the benefit of hindsight, that the prejudice or disadvantage in fact sustained by the lessee after taking possession and paying rent outweighed any offsetting advantage.” 134               Sackville J continued at 47: “In proceedings under ss 52 and 82 of the Trade Practices Act it is often the case that a purchaser acquires an asset on the faith of a false representation and that asset is shown, by subsequent evidence, to have been worth less at the time of the purchase than the price paid. It is also often the case that the purchaser, at the date of acquisition, neither knows nor has the means of knowing that the representations are false, nor that the business is worth less than the price paid. To use the language of the majority in Wardley, it would seem unjust to compel such a purchaser to institute proceedings before the existence of his or her loss is ascertained or ascertainable by that person.”   135               Finally, his Honour concluded at 48: “Another approach is to determine the date damage has been sustained by reference to the nature of the interest infringed, in accordance with the approach taken by Gaudron J in Hawkins v Clayton. Where a business is purchased, the interest is presumably the value of the business. On one view, the value of the business and therefore the loss is always “ascertainable” at a particular date, since it is only necessary for the purchaser to seek appropriate expert advice as to that value. On the other hand, the existence of a loss is not necessarily ascertainable by the purchaser at that time, unless the purchaser has some reason to suspect a disparity between the price paid and the true value of the business. Finally, it is arguable that the reasoning in Wardley should be extended to cases involving the purchase of an asset, even where there are no apparent countervailing benefits or detriments as the result of the transaction. From the purchaser's perspective, the existence of a loss may not be ascertainable until events unfold. On this approach, a loss would not be sustained for the purpose of s 82 until the purchaser had either ascertained or, acting reasonably, should have ascertained, that the asset was worth less than the price paid for it.  Whatever the position in relation to the acquisition of an asset, the present is a case where the Antonious obtained both advantages and disadvantages from the lease transaction, which they were induced to enter by the appellant’s misleading conduct. It was not the entry into the lease which of itself produced the loss. The lease may have enabled the lessees to pursue a profitable undertaking. The losses claimed by the Antonious flowed from the pursuit of a particular business which they were encouraged to undertake by the appellants’ representations. Only when the course of events allowed the lessees the opportunity to ascertain that the business could not succeed was loss sustained in the relevant sense.”  136               Both the Full Court of this Court, and the New South Wales Court of Appeal, have followed Karedis. See Blacker v National Australia Bank Ltd (2001) ATPR ¶41-817 at 42,970, Troulis v Vamvoukakis (unreported, NSW Court of Appeal, 27 February 1998), and Williams v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [1999] NSWCA 345 at [139].  137               Mr Keane submitted that in the present case, it was not until the respondents’ collusion had been unearthed that it was reasonably ascertainable that Energex had suffered loss by paying more for the transformers than it ought to have.  138               Mr Keane also relied upon an analogy with cases involving building defects: see, for example, Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman (1985) 157 CLR 424 at 503-505 per Deane J. He submitted that the principle was not confined to building defects but had been applied also to latent defects in title. He cited various additional authorities in support of that proposition.  139               Finally, Mr Keane relied upon the observations of Deane J in Hawkins v Clayton (1988) 164 CLR 539 regarding the need to avoid hardship and injustice when dealing with a limitation provision. Mr Keane noted in particular his Honour’s comment that it would be a travesty of justice if the law provided that a cause of action lay for damages for false imprisonment, but then went on to provide that that cause of action would be lost if the false imprisonment continued for six years after the cause of action first accrued. Indeed, his Honour observed at 590: “… It is arguable that the notion of unconscionable reliance upon the provisions of a Statute of Limitations which provides the foundation of the long-established equitable jurisdiction to grant relief in a case of concealment of a cause of action until after the limitation period has expired (cf. s. 55(1) of the Limitation Act) should, by analogy, be extended to cover cases such as these where the wrongful act at the one time inflicts the injury and, while its effect remains, precludes the bringing of an action for damages. It seems to me, however, that the preferable approach is to recognize that it could not have been the legislative intent that the effect of provisions such as s. 14(1) of the Limitation Act should be that a cause of action for a wrongful act should be barred by lapse of time during a period in which the wrongful act itself effectively precluded the bringing of proceedings. On that approach, the reference in s. 14(1) of the Act to the cause of action first accruing should be construed as excluding any period during which the wrongful act itself effectively precluded the institution of proceedings.” 140               Mr Keane then repeated his contention that there was no utility, in terms of the administration of justice, in striking out the claims made under s 82. He submitted that largely the same issues would have to be canvassed in the trial in any event. 141               Finally, Mr Keane submitted that it was inappropriate to rule upon the respondents’ applications at this stage. He submitted that s 82(2) was a procedural condition of relief, and not, as Mr Hilton had suggested, an ingredient of Energex’s right of action: see the Full Court of the Federal Court decision in Wardley at 258-259, and Mayne Nickless at [46]-[47].  142               Mr Keane submitted that if the respondents chose to plead the limitation defence, Energex would amend its statement of claim in two respects. It would contend that the reliance by the respondents on s 82(2) was conduct that was, in all the circumstances, unconscionable within the meaning of s 51AC. It would seek injunctions under s 80 restraining them from persisting in their reliance upon s 82(2). Alternatively, in the event that injunctions were not granted, it would seek orders pursuant to s 82(1) or s 87(1) directing the respondents to pay the amount of the loss or damage suffered by Energex by reason of their reliance upon s 82(2).  143               Mr Keane foreshadowed that in the event that the limitation defences were raised, Energex would rely on s 51AC(2). He submitted that reliance by any respondent upon a limitation defence would be conduct by a person, in trade or commerce, in connection with the supply of goods or services to a corporation. Such conduct would be unconscionable because the respondents had concealed their illegal collusion from Energex, as had been essential if their collusive endeavours were to succeed. One purpose of the limitation provisions was to suppress fraud, by preventing bogus claims from being brought at a time when the evidence needed to meet them was no longer available. To permit s 82(2) to be used as a bar would be to make that section, a law designed to prevent fraud, the vehicle by which fraud could successfully be perpetrated.  144               As previously noted, Mr Keane also submitted that Energex would meet any limitation defence with a plea of fraudulent concealment. He acknowledged that the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Wardley was binding authority, so far as I was concerned, for the proposition that this plea was not available in a case such as the present. Nonetheless, he formally submitted that the Full Court had erroneously rejected this doctrine.  145               Mr Keane then turned to the respondents’ contention that Energex’s claims for injunctive relief, and for damages under s 87(1), constituted an abuse of process. He submitted that this was not the case. The claim for injunctive relief was neither foredoomed to fail, nor brought to achieve a collateral advantage. The fact that there was no allegation in the statement of claim of any threat of continuing contravention was simply because s 80(4) provided that an injunction could be granted whether or not a future contravention was threatened. The fact that Finkelstein J took the view that some of the respondents were unlikely to re-offend did not lead his Honour to conclude that it was unnecessary to grant injunctive relief.  146               In any event, Mr Keane submitted that there was in fact a threat of future contravention. He submitted that no great store should be placed on submissions now made on behalf of the respondents who had admitted, in the proceedings before Finkelstein J, that they had engaged in a course of conduct over many years that involved serious wrongdoing. He noted that the position of the ABB respondents had not yet been determined. I understand that those respondents have subsequently been dealt with, and penalties of $14 million were levelled against them.  147               Mr Keane submitted that it could hardly be an abuse of process for Energex to seek the protection of an injunction that it could enforce in circumstances where, for example, the ACCC might be unwilling, or unable, to act. Energex had not been a party to the ACCC proceedings. It could not enforce the orders made in those proceedings. There was every justification for it to seek addition protection.  148               Mr Keane rejected the contention that any injunction granted to Energex would only take effect upon the expiration of the existing injunctions granted in the ACCC proceedings. The injunctions that it sought would take effect from the date of judgment. Relief of that kind was in no way inconsistent with the relief granted to the ACCC.  149               Mr Keane noted that the Act expressly conferred rights under s 80 and s 87(1) that did not attract a limitation defence. He submitted that it could hardly be illegitimate, or amount to a collateral purpose, to seek relief for which the Act expressly provided. He further submitted that it was impossible, at this time, for the Court to consider whether any relief under s 87(1) should be granted as a matter of discretion.  150               The next matter that Mr Keane dealt with concerned the pleading of the tort of deceit. He submitted that the main issue raised in the statement of claim was whether the conduct of the respondents, in replying individually to the invitations to tender, was apt to create a deliberately false impression that their bids were genuine. He submitted that it could not be said that this claim was untenable.  151               Mr Keane denied that Energex’s case involved an assertion that mere silence or non-disclosure of facts was a sufficient foundation for an action in deceit, absent a legal obligation to make disclosure. Energex relied neither on silence nor on non-disclosure, but rather upon the representations to be implied from the active steps taken by the respondents. Mr Keane cited the following comment by Priestley JA in Brunninghausen v Glavanics (1999) 46 NSWLR 538 at 540: “The only comment I wish to make concerns the proposition that mere silence by a party with superior knowledge is not a misrepresentation. I think the citation by Handley JA from Spencer, Bower and Turner, Actionable Misrepresentations, 3rd ed (1974) London, Butterworths, demonstrates the emptiness of this proposition. A case of “mere” silence is very hard to imagine. What happens in fact in the decision in litigation in which the proposition is invoked is that the court considers whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the conduct of the impugned party should be considered as having misled the other party.”  152               As regards the causation issue raised by Mr Archibald, Mr Keane noted that the statement of claim filed in this case differed significantly from that in Pioneer Concrete. It was not alleged in Pioneer Concrete, as it was in the present case, that but for the fraudulent representation, the applicant would have carried out investigations which might have disclosed the existence of the collusion. Mr Keane accepted that Energex must, in due course, prove that it had relied upon the implied representation pleaded, but damages would then be assessed by considering what the position would have been had that representation not been made. He contended that had the tenders not been submitted, the representations would not have been made. There would then have been no loss.  153               Finally, Mr Keane dealt with the more mundane pleading points raised by the respondents. He rejected Mr Hilton’s contention that the statement of claim was deficient because it contained no particulars of the intention of the tenderers, or of their alleged dishonesty. He submitted that intention was to be inferred. The statement of claim alleged that the representations were false, and that they were known to be false. It was obvious that Energex’s case was that they were made dishonestly, and it was perfectly clear what was meant by that term.  154               Mr Keane then addressed Mr Gray’s complaints on behalf of the Schneider respondents. He submitted that Energex’s case against those respondents was entirely clear. Energex alleged the existence of an agreement, arrangement or understanding based on an inference to be drawn from overt acts. As such, the principles governing the pleading, and proof of such a case, were essentially the same as those involving proof of a conspiracy. It was unnecessary, in those circumstances to single out those material facts alleged against Schneider, as distinct from the material facts alleged against the other respondents.  155               Mr Keane submitted that there were three reasons why Mr Gray’s contentions should be rejected. First, the nature of the case pleaded against all respondents was clear. Indeed, it was essentially the same as the case that the ACCC had presented against Schneider, a case that was sufficiently well understood to have enabled the Schneider respondents to have admitted having contravened ss 45 and 45A. Second, there could be no possible need for further particulars. If anything, Energex’s case was more detailed than necessary. Third, such particulars as had been provided were the best that could be given at this time. Further particulars might be provided after discovery.  156               Mr Keane dismissed various other criticisms made by Mr Gray being insubstantial, and having no merit.  conclusionS Summary dismissal and strike out 157               There is no doubt that this case has the potential to run for months if it goes to trial. The proceedings thus far indicate that it will be hard fought, with every conceivable point likely to be taken. In these circumstances, it is of some comfort to note that there is at least a measure of common ground among the parties regarding the general principles that govern applications for summary dismissal.  158               It is well accepted that the Court will not order that a proceeding be dismissed under O 20 r 2(1) except in a “very clear” case. In Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners (1949) 78 CLR 62, Dixon J, as his Honour then was, formulated the relevant principle, as follows, at 91: “A case must be very clear indeed to justify the summary intervention of the court to prevent a plaintiff submitting his case for determination in the appointed manner by the court with or without a jury. The fact that a transaction is intricate may not disentitle the court to examine a cause of action alleged to grow out of it for the purpose of seeing whether the proceeding amounts to an abuse of process or is vexatious. But once it appears that there is a real question to be determined whether of fact or law and that the rights of the parties depend upon it, then it is not competent for the court to dismiss the action as frivolous and vexatious and an abuse of process.” 159               In General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) (1964) 112 CLR 125, Barwick CJ stated the test as follows at 128-130: “The plaintiff rightly points out that the jurisdiction summarily to terminate an action is to be sparingly employed and is not to be used except in a clear case where the Court is satisfied that it has the requisite material and the necessary assistance from the parties to reach a definite and certain conclusion. I have examined the case law on the subject, to some of which I was referred in argument and to which I append a list of references. There is no need for me to discuss in any detail the various decisions, some of which were given in cases in which the inherent jurisdiction of a court was invoked and others in cases in which counterpart rules to Order 26, r. 18, were the suggested source of authority to deal summarily with the claim in question. It is sufficient for me to say that these cases uniformly adhere to the view that the plaintiff ought not to be denied access to the customary tribunal which deals with actions of the kind he brings, unless his lack of a cause of action – if that be the ground on which the court is invited, as in this case, to exercise its powers of summary dismissal – is clearly demonstrated. The test to be applied has been variously expressed; “so obviously untenable that it cannot possibly succeed”; “manifestly groundless”; “so manifestly faulty that it does not admit of argument”; “discloses a case which the Court is satisfied cannot succeed”; “under no possibility can there be a good cause of action”; “be manifest that to allow them” (the pleadings) “to stand would involve useless expense”.  At times the test has been put as high as saying that the case must be so plain and obvious that the court can say at once that the statement of claim, even if proved, cannot succeed; or “so manifest on the view of the pleadings, merely reading through them, that it is a case that does not admit of reasonable argument”; “so to speak apparent at a glance”. … [I]n my opinion great care must be exercised to ensure that under the guise of achieving expeditious finality a plaintiff is not improperly deprived of his opportunity for the trial of his case by the appointed tribunal. On the other hand, I do not think that the exercise of the jurisdiction should be reserved for those cases where argument is unnecessary to evoke the futility of the plaintiff's claim. Argument, perhaps even of an extensive kind, may be necessary to demonstrate that the case of the plaintiff is so clearly untenable that it cannot possibly succeed.”  160               See also Webster v Lampard (1993) 177 CLR 598. 161               I discussed the general principles that govern summary dismissal in McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd (1999) 165 ALR 409 at 415-417. I do not propose to repeat here what I said regarding that issue in that judgment. The power to order summary judgment in favour of a respondent must be exercised with caution, and should not be exercised unless it is obvious that there is no real question to be tried.  162               A similar approach must be taken in relation to the power to strike out, in whole or in part, a pleading under O 11 r 16. The rules that govern pleadings in this Court are set out in O 11. Order 11 r 2(a) provides that, subject to the Rules, a pleading of a party shall contain, and contain only, a statement in a summary form of the material facts on which the party relies. Order 11 r 3 requires brevity and O 11 r 9 allows a party, by his pleading, to raise any point of law.  163               Order 11 r 16 provides: “Where a pleading:  (a) discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence or other case appropriate to the nature of the pleading; (b) has a tendency to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay in the proceeding; or (c) is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court;  the Court may at any stage of the proceeding order that the whole or any part of the pleading be struck out.” 164               I dealt with the principles which govern pleadings in McKellar at [20]-[33]. In addition to the cases there discussed, there is a useful statement of the function of pleadings in Bank Commerciale SA (In Liq) v Akhil Holdings Ltd (1990) 169 CLR 279 where Mason CJ and Gaudron J said at 286: “The function of pleadings is to state with sufficient clarity the case that must be met…. In this way, pleadings serve to ensure the basic requirement of procedural fairness that a party should have the opportunity of meeting the case against him or her and, incidentally, to define the issues for decision. The rule that, in general, relief is confined to that available on the pleadings secures a party’s right to this basic requirement of procedural fairness”. (footnote omitted) 165               Once again, in the interests of brevity, I shall not go over the same ground as I did in McKellar. I will simply apply the same approach to the respondents’ challenges to Energex’s statement of claim in this case as I did in McKellar.  Are the s 82(1) claims time barred? 166               I propose to deal first with the contention that virtually all of Energex’s claims for damages under s 82(1) should be dismissed, or struck out, as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. That contention is, of course, primarily based upon the proposition that these claims are time barred.  167               As Mr Keane noted, the respondents must persuade this Court that Energex should be denied the opportunity to present these claims. Because the time bar point is raised at the interlocutory stage, the burden that they must discharge is a heavy one.  168               If the respondents are correct in their submission that Energex’s claims are time barred, it will have no recourse, by way of damages, against them no matter how strong a case it can mount that they engaged in the most flagrant breaches of s 45. There are strong reasons to think that such an outcome would not have been intended by the legislature. Collusive tendering, of the type alleged in this case, is by its very nature covert. It may take years in order to be detected.  169               In principle, a party who has engaged in fraudulent conduct should not be permitted to take advantage of a limitation defence where that conduct has not come to light until long after the victim has suffered harm. The same is true where a party has caused harm, but managed by fraudulent means to conceal it.  170               Mr Keane submitted, with some rhetorical flourish, that the outcome for which the respondents contended would be “a disgrace to our jurisprudence”. That did not prevent the House of Lords in Cartledge v E Jopling & Sons Ltd from holding that the claim in that case was statute barred, notwithstanding the fact that the result was an affront to common sense, and justice. However, as Mr Keane noted, that conclusion was arrived at by construing the relevant limitation statute in the light of the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, a consideration that is not present when considering s 82(2).  171               I accept Mr Keane’s contention that it would be contrary to basic principle to deprive an injured party of its right to compensation arising out of a fraudulent conspiracy merely because the conspiracy was not detected until after the limitation period had expired.  172               I also accept Mr Keane’s submission that s 82 should be interpreted without any of the preconceptions that would flow from the ordinary application of common law doctrines of tort and contract. In Marks v GIO, the High Court said as much. The task for the Court is to construe the expression “suffers loss or damage” in s 82(1), and the cognate expression “the conduct accrued” in s 82(2).  173               In my view, these expressions are to be given their ordinary and natural meaning. However, that meaning is to be informed by the extensive body of authority that now exists regarding when a cause of action accrues arising out of misconduct, or breach of a statute. Some of the cases suggest that this occurs only when the misconduct, or breach, comes to light.  174               The clearest example of this approach lies in the case of a defective building. It is clear that if a building with a latent defect is purchased, the plaintiff does not suffer economic loss until the defect becomes manifest. Yet the way in which such a case is typically pleaded is to assert that the loss results from the payment of a greater amount than would have been paid had the defect been known.  175               Another example is the line of cases, of which Karedis is a prime example, in which an asset is purchased, and it becomes necessary to determine, in the context of a claim under s 52, whether the transaction was disadvantageous. It may be, in such a case, that one cannot make such a finding until the benefits and burdens of the transaction have been fully ascertained. That may be long after the date on which the asset is purchased.  176               Mr Keane challenged the respondents’ contention that the gist of Energex’s claim was that it had paid more for the transformers than it ought to have done, and that but for the cartel, it would have paid less for those items. He submitted that this was a distortion of the way Energex’s case was pleaded. It claimed that it suffered damage as a result of the price paid exceeding the price that would have prevailed, but for the contravening conduct. In Mr Keane words, the difference between these propositions was as follows: “… it is not the case, as Mr Hilton suggested, that our pleading is that we paid more than the market price, or that we paid more than they were worth. We understand why our learned friends seek to reformulate our pleading, because their objective is to say that, having pleaded the case in the way in which we have, we must be taken to have pleaded that our cause of action is in respect of a loss suffered when we bought the transformers. But your Honour, just like the person who buys the building with the latent defects that one day will emerge into cracks that devalue it, we acquired transformers in the market in circumstances in which the day after we acquired them, just like the building with the canker working away at its foundations, our transformer was worth exactly what we paid for it the day before and remained so, and remained so until the fact of the cartel and the fact that the market was rigged emerged.”  177               Mr Keane submitted that Energex’s position should be regarded as analogous to that of the purchasers in the latent defect building cases. He submitted that the price paid by Energex exceeded the true value of the transformers in a market that had not been “rigged” by the respondents’ conduct. The suggestion that Energex could have sued the respondents for the difference between the price paid, and their “value”, the day after they had been purchased, was misconceived. The only measure of true market value would have been a hypothetical fair and honest market. That would have required the fact that the market had been rigged to become manifest.  178               I consider that Wardley provides some support for Mr Keane’s argument. I refer in particular to the discussion by Brennan J of the principle that a loss is suffered only when the true extent of the benefit and burden of the various transactions can be ascertained. Mr Keane’s approach is also supported by Karedis. On that analysis, Energex could not be said to have paid more than the market value for the transformers purchased until it became clear what that market value actually was. That could not have occurred until it was discovered that the market had been rigged.  179               In summary, therefore, the primary case advanced on behalf of Energex seems to me not to be that it suffered loss at the moment it paid for the transformers, but rather, that it suffered loss because it paid more than it ought to have done, in a free market. It is arguable that Energex did not suffer loss, within the meaning of that expression in s 82(2), until the market-rigging became manifest. At that point, it could be ascertained that it had suffered loss, and that loss could be quantified.  180               I should emphasise that I am making no final determination on this point. The only question that must be considered at this stage is whether Mr Keane’s submission that Energex’s claims under s 82(2) are not time barred is arguable. For the reasons set out above, in my view, that submission is tenable. 181               Mr Keane also put Energex’s case on several alternative bases. He submitted that the use of the word “suffers” in s 82(1) connotes knowledge, on the part of the victim, of the facts that give rise to the loss or damage alleged. He accepted that there was no authority directly in point that supported that contention. However, he submitted that there were highly persuasive dicta in cases such as Hawkins v Clayton, and Wardley,that broadly fortified it.  182               Hawkins v Clayton concerned a will made in 1970 appointing an executor, and leaving him the residue of the testatrix’s estate. The will was retained by the solicitors by whom it was drawn. The testatrix died in January 1975, but the solicitors made no attempt to locate the executor and inform him of the will until March 1981. In October 1982, the executor obtained a grant of probate. Between the testatrix’s death, and March 1981, the main asset of her estate, a house, was permitted to fall into disrepair and to lie vacant for a substantial time.  183               By majority, the High Court held that the solicitors were under a duty to take reasonable steps to find the executor and inform him of the existence and terms of the will. The majority also held that the solicitors were in breach of that duty, and liable in damages. They held that the action was not barred by s 14(1) of the Limitation Act 1969 (NSW).  184               Brennan and Gaudron JJ arrived at this conclusion on the ground that the cause of action did not accrue until the executor assumed office in March 1981. Deane J reasoned that the cause of action did not accrue until the expiration of the period in which the wrongful act itself effectively precluded the bringing of proceedings. 185               Wardley concerned an action by the State of Western Australia claiming damages for loss it alleged that it had suffered as a result of misleading and deceptive conduct on the part of a company called Wardley Australia Ltd. That conduct was said to have led the State to grant an indemnity to the National Australia Bank against a facility granted by the bank to Rothwells Ltd. The statement of claim alleged that at a meeting on Saturday, 24 October 1987, representations were made on behalf of Wardley to the effect that Rothwells had very substantial net assets, that it did not suffer a capital deficiency but simply a liquidity problem, and that there were no substantial amounts owed to Rothwells by Laurie Connell, or interests associated with him. It was in reliance upon those representations, that were false, that the State, on 26 October 1987, executed the indemnity. In due course, the bank called on the indemnity. The State disputed its liability, and the dispute was later settled by the State paying the bank $10.5 million.  186               On 14 January 1991, the State amended its statement of claim so as to rely on an additional representation made by Wardley at a meeting on Sunday 25 October 1987 to the effect that Rothwells was a sound financial institution that had substantial net assets. It was alleged that this was not the case, and that the State had been induced to give this indemnity on the basis of the misleading statements made by Wardley on the Sunday, as well as on the preceding day.  187               The trial judge, French J, struck out the amendment on the ground that it pleaded a cause of action that was outside the time limit prescribed by s 82(2). The Full Court allowed an appeal by the State, and Wardley appealed to the High Court from that judgment. It was held, by majority, that where as a result of misleading or deceptive conduct a person grants an indemnity under which he is obliged to make a payment when the loss of the party to be indemnified is ascertained, and quantified, the person granting the indemnity suffers no loss until the contingency is fulfilled. Accordingly, time did not begin to run under s 82(2) until that event occurred.  188               Deane J, who together with Toohey J dissented, referred to his earlier views in Hawkins v Clayton. His Honour observed at 540: “In Hawkins v Clayton, a majority of the Court implicitly or explicitly rejected a submission that the Court should recognize a general overriding qualification of the prima facie position that a requirement of loss or damage as an ingredient of a cause of action is satisfied as soon as relevant loss or damage is in fact sustained. That suggested qualification was to the effect that, at least in the case of claims in negligence for damages for economic loss, time under a limitations provision does not commence to run until the stage is reached when the plaintiff discovers, or could on reasonable inquiry have discovered, that the loss has been sustained. If such a broad overriding qualification had been adopted in relation to such claims, reasoning by analogy would have lent strong support for the conclusion that, in a case such as the present where the action under s 82(1) is for damages for economic loss caused by misleading conduct in contravention of s 52 of the Act, time does not commence to run until the plaintiff knows or reasonably ought to know that the relevant conduct has in fact caused loss. The Court’s rejection of such an overriding qualification does not, however, alter the fact that, in some of the cases where an action lies in negligence for pure economic loss, no relevant loss is actually sustained or suffered and no cause of action for damages accrues unless and until some actual adverse consequence of the negligence is known or becomes manifest. Nor does the rejection of such a qualification provide, by analogy or otherwise, a general answer to the question whether the mere incurring of a contingent liability to make a future payment of itself constitutes loss or damage for the purpose of determining when a cause of action of which loss or damage is a necessary ingredient accrues or arises.” (footnotes omitted) 189               Brennan J said at 536-537: “The cause of action created by s 82(1) has several elements, but it is a cause of action for the recovery of money representing loss or damage suffered by the plaintiff – “the amount of the loss or damage”. The loss or damage includes, of course, economic loss or damage which the plaintiff suffers. …” 190               His Honour then set out the passage contained at [129] above, to which Mr Keane referred, and continued:  “False representations contravening s 52, like fraudulent misrepresentations and negligent misstatements, may induce a plaintiff to act or to refrain from acting and the relevant loss or damage may flow from the plaintiff’s own act or omission and only indirectly from the defendant’s contravening conduct. The relevant transaction may be between the plaintiff and a third party, not between the plaintiff and the defendant. Each case requires an analysis of its particular circumstances in order to identify the transaction, the nature of the loss or damage actually suffered by the plaintiff and, where there are benefits and burdens, their components. Once the loss or damage is identified, the date when it was suffered can be ascertained.  … There is a sense in which it is right to say that, when a misrepresentation induces a plaintiff to enter into a transaction in which the plaintiff suffers a loss, the loss is suffered once the plaintiff becomes bound to the transaction. The die is then cast and what follows can be viewed as evidence proving the extent of the loss suffered when the first binding step was taken. That may be the correct analysis when the first binding step is such that, whatever extrinsic circumstances may transpire, a loss must be suffered. For example, when an asset is purchased for a price and, by reason of an inherent defect, it is worth less than the price paid, a loss may said to be suffered when the plaintiff pays the price or becomes bound to pay the price. Similarly, when an agreement imposes on a plaintiff an obligation to pay an amount of money without acquiring a benefit and the amount to be paid is quantified by no factors extrinsic to the agreement save the passing of time, it is right to say that the loss is suffered when the agreement to pay becomes binding on the plaintiff. But when the actual loss that a plaintiff suffers depends not only on the making of an agreement but also on circumstances extrinsic thereto, the loss is not suffered until those circumstances have transpired and, in benefit and burden cases, not until the loss is ascertainable. The present case does not involve any acquisition by the State of a contractual benefit: there was simply an indemnity given to the Bank which entitled the Bank to demand the payment of money upon certain contingencies.” (footnotes omitted) 191               Mr Keane accepted that on his analysis, if the cartel had never come to light, then even though Energex would have paid more that it ought to have done by reason of the cartel’s existence, it would not have “suffered” any loss or damage. That conclusion seems to me to be counter-intuitive. 192               I have difficulty in accepting this alternative variant of Energex’s case. It relies upon a somewhat strained meaning being given to the word “suffers” in s 82(1). In ordinary parlance, a person can “suffer” loss or damage without being aware of the facts that give rise to that loss or damage. The analogy between the present case, and the case of a latent building defect, is not nearly as exact as Mr Keane contends, nor is the analogy between the present case, and a contingent liability case, such as Wardley.  193               That does not detract from the force of Mr Keane’s contention that it hardly lies in the mouth of those who have engaged in serious and persistent misconduct to say that, having managed to keep their nefarious deeds secret for a sufficiently long time, they are entitled to take the benefit of a limitation defence. The miscreants, having by their conspiracy not merely injured Energex, but also prevented it from discovering what was happening, should not be permitted to take advantage of their own misconduct.  194               There is no doubt in my mind that a person who buys what he or she is told is a famous painting, but is in fact a forgery, should be able to recover damages from the fraudulent vendor, provided proceedings are brought within the relevant limitation period once the fraud has been discovered. The question is whether it requires legislation to produce this result, or whether there is some other way in which it can be achieved.  195               For reasons that are difficult to understand, s 82(2) contains no express fraud exception. Mr Keane submits that this is because the word “suffers” was intended to do the work of such an exception. Alternatively, he submits, that it is because relief is available, in any event, under s 87. These are possible explanations, though they seem to me to lack cogency.  196               It is unnecessary, at the present stage, to come to any firm conclusion about this matter. It is sufficient to say, as I have done, that it is arguable that in cases where what is claimed is economic loss arising from the purchase of an asset, no loss is suffered until there has been an actual balancing of benefits and burdens, leading to the conclusion that loss has been incurred. Alternatively, no loss is suffered until it becomes possible to ascertain that an adverse balance has been struck.  197               I consider that so much follows from the reasoning of the majority in Wardley at 527: “Economic loss may take a variety of forms and, as Gaudron J noted in Hawkins v Clayton, the answer to the question when a cause of action for negligence causing economic loss accrues may require consideration of the precise interest infringed by the negligent act or omission. The kind of economic loss which is sustained and the time when it is first sustained depend upon the nature of the interest infringed and, perhaps, the nature of the interference to which it is subjected. With economic loss, as with other forms of damage, there has to be some actual damage. Prospective loss is not enough.  When a plaintiff is induced by a misrepresentation to enter into an agreement which is, or proves to be, to his or her disadvantage, the plaintiff sustains a detriment in a general sense on entry into the agreement. That is because the agreement subjects the plaintiff to obligations and liabilities which exceed the value or worth of the rights and benefits which it confers upon the plaintiff. But, as will appear shortly, detriment in this general sense has not universally been equated with the legal concept of “loss or damage”. And that is just as well. In many instances the disadvantageous character or effect of the agreement cannot be ascertained until some future date when its impact upon events as they unfold becomes known or apparent and, by then, the relevant limitation period may have expired. To compel a plaintiff to institute proceedings before the existence of his or her loss is ascertained or ascertainable would be unjust. Moreover, it would increase the possibility that the courts would be forced to estimate damages on the basis of likelihood or probability instead of assessing damages by reference to established events. In such a situation, there would be an ever-present risk of undercompensation or overcompensation, the risk of the former being the greater.” (footnotes omitted)  198               I note that the majority in Wardley specifically disapproved of Jobbins and, in particular, the proposition in that case that loss or damage is sustained on entry into an agreement induced by a false, negligent or misleading misrepresentation. The majority said of Jobbins at 529: “But we have difficulty in accepting that the applicant suffered loss or damage on entry into the agreement merely because the investment was alleged to lack the represented qualities. On this aspect of the case, the question was whether the investment was worth less than the applicant contracted to pay for it and, if so, when the applicant first sustained loss or damage. How that question could be answered in the absence of evidence is not evident to us. Although the investment lacked the represented qualities, it may have been worth no less than the consideration provided by the applicant.” 199               The majority continued at 530-531: “In the case of a fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation which induces the plaintiff to enter into a contract to purchase property, the plaintiff’s loss, apart from any question of consequential damage, is measured by the difference between the price paid or payable under the contract and the value of the property at the date of the contract. It will be noticed that, even in such a case, Dixon J spoke in Potts v Miller (an action in deceit) of the measure of damages consisting in “the loss or expenditure incurred by the plaintiff in consequence of the inducement upon which he relied, diminished by any corresponding advantage in money or money's worth obtained by him on the other side”. It is that amount that, in such a case, represents “the prejudice or disadvantage” the plaintiff “has suffered in consequence of his altering his position under the inducement of the fraudulent misrepresentations made by the defendant”, subject to any consequential damage. Putting aside the incurring of expenditure, these statements might be thought to indicate that a plaintiff does not sustain loss until that loss is ascertained or, at least, is capable of ascertainment.  Be that as it may, the English decisions have proceeded according to the view that, where the plaintiff is induced by a negligent misrepresentation to enter into a contract and the contract, as a result of the negligence, yields property or contractual rights of lesser value, the plaintiff first suffers financial loss on entry into the contract, notwithstanding that the full extent of the plaintiff’s financial loss may be incapable of ascertainment until some later date. In part, the English approach appears to have been influenced by the general principle stated in Darley Main Colliery Co v Mitchell that damages in respect of a cause of action are awarded on a once and for all basis. But that principle tells us very little, if anything, about the time when the plaintiff first suffers loss or damage in the circumstances of a particular case, except that, properly understood, Darley Main Colliery emphasizes the need for actual, as distinct from prospective, damage before prospective damages can be included in the award.  Another element in some of the English decisions, as in Jobbins, is the conclusion that, because the subject matter of the agreement lacked the qualities which it had been represented as having, that subject matter was therefore less valuable than it would have been if the representations had been true. That conclusion is acceptable in cases in which the contract measure of damages is appropriate but it is not acceptable here where the contract measure of damages does not apply. The application of that measure of damages may, in some situations, enable a court to conclude more readily that the plaintiff first suffers loss or damage on entry into an agreement.  It has been contended that the principle underlying the English decisions extends to the point that a plaintiff sustains loss on entry into an agreement notwithstanding that the loss to which the plaintiff is subjected by the agreement is a loss upon a contingency. For our part, we doubt that the decisions travel so far. Rather, it seems to us, the decisions in cases which involve contingent loss were decisions which turned on the plaintiff sustaining measurable loss at an earlier time, quite apart from the contingent loss which threatened at a later date.” (footnotes omitted)  200               Finally, the majority in Wardley stated at 533: “The conclusion which we have reached is reinforced by the general considerations to which we referred earlier. It is unjust and unreasonable to expect the plaintiff to commence proceedings before the contingency is fulfilled. If an action is commenced before that date, it will fail if the events so transpire that it becomes clear that no loss is, or will be, incurred. Moreover, the plaintiff will run the risk that damages will be estimated on a contingency basis, in which event the compensation awarded may not fully compensate the plaintiff for the loss ultimately suffered. These practical consequences which would follow from an adoption of the view for which the appellants contend outweigh the strength of the argument that the principle applicable to the cases in which the plaintiff acquires property (or a chose in action) should be extended to cases where an agreement subjects the plaintiff to a contingent loss. In such cases, it is fair and sensible to say that the plaintiff does not incur loss until the contingency is fulfilled.” 201               Recently, the High Court has looked again at the question of when contingent losses are sustained. In Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd (2004) 204 ALR 26, the applicants took a 99-year lease over a unit in a retirement village owned and managed by Overton Investments Pty Ltd. Prior to, and at the time they entered into the lease, Overton gave them an estimate of the amount that they would be required to contribute towards outgoings. It explained that this was an estimate only, and would be subject to variation from time to time.  202               The estimate was based on figures that did not reflect the actual cost of outgoings. Nor did it take into account all of the various outgoings that Overton was entitled to recover. In 1997, Overton began charging the applicants for all outgoings that could properly be charged under the lease. The applicants brought proceedings alleging breaches of s 52 and sought orders under s 87, limiting the contributions that they were required to pay. In the alternative, they sought damages under s 82. Those damages reflected the difference between the value of the lease if contributions were calculated in accordance with Overton’s legal entitlement, and the value of the lease if contributions were charged in accordance with a restriction on its recovery entitlements.  203               The applicants succeeded at first instance in proving that Overton had engaged in conduct that was misleading or likely to mislead. His Honour also concluded that Overton’s conduct had caused the applicants to enter into the lease. However, he held that they had not proved that they had suffered any loss or damage. That was because there was no difference between the price paid under the lease, and its value at the date of the lease. Nor was there any evidence that the applicants were not receiving value for the maintenance fees that they were required to pay. An appeal to the Full Court was dismissed. However, the High Court reversed the trial judge’s decision, and remitted the matter to him for assessment of damages and interest.  204               The reasoning of the High Court can be summarised as follows. The Full Court erred in concluding that the applicants had not proved loss or damage. It is not correct to assume that in every misrepresentation case, the only type of damage that could be redressed under Pt VI of the Act was a difference between price and value, or any consequential loss. Although there was no evidence that the applicants had not received value for the maintenance fees that they paid, it did not necessarily follow that they did not incur loss.  205               The High Court also reiterated what had been decided in Marks v GIO, namely that the operation of Pt VI should not be approached by drawing analogies from the tort of deceit, or any other claims under general law. The expression “loss or damage” should not be given a narrow meaning, and was not confined to economic loss. Importantly, the Court held that if a party enters a contract that exposes that party to a contingent loss or liability (that is, the possibility of future detrimental consequences), no damage is sustained until the contingency is fulfilled and the loss becomes actual. In the instant case, the applicants suffered loss when Overton starting charging the full amount of the outgoings that it was entitled to charge. Their Honours said at [55]: “What the appellants did not know was that the estimate of outgoings they were given did not provide for all the outgoings that were then being incurred. Here, therefore, the appellants suffered no loss as a result of undertaking the obligations they did unless and until the contingency which the misrepresentation hid (that items other than those used to form the estimate were then being incurred and could be charged as outgoings) was first realised. That was a contingency in the sense that the adverse risk might never have eventuated. When the lease was entered in 1992, the respondent was charging levies in relation only to limited categories of the overall outgoings. The respondent might have chosen to continue to charge the appellants only for those limited categories. On the other hand, it was possible that after 1992 it might decide to charge for wider categories. It was only from the time when it in fact decided to depart from the 1992 position and charge for the wider categories that the adverse risk eventuated. When it did, but only then, the appellants suffered loss and damage. And this court’s decision in Wardley requires the conclusion, on the evidence in this case, that it was only when the contingency came to pass that the appellants sustained loss or damage. It follows that no limitation defence was available.” (footnote omitted) 206               The Court also said at [66]: “The appellants had been induced by the respondent’s conduct to undertake an obligation which may, but need not, have been more onerous than the respondent’s representation led them to believe. When the respondent started to charge all the outgoings it was entitled to charge, the appellants suffered a loss. The amount of that loss was not to be determined, as the majority of the Full Court held, only by comparing the financial position of the appellants according to whether they entered this lease or took some other accommodation. The appellants did not contend that they had suffered loss in that way. The appellants suffered loss because the continuing financial obligations they undertook when they took the lease proved to be larger than they had been led to believe.” 207               The present case differs in several important respects from both Wardley and Murphy v Overton. There is no question of Energex having entered into a contract that exposed it to a “contingent loss or liability”. Nonetheless, the reasoning in those cases, and the reasoning in Karedis, at least lends some support to Mr Keane’s argument that Energex did not suffer loss or damage at the moment it entered into each of the agreements pleaded. Rather, it suffered loss only at the point that it could be ascertained that the price it had paid exceeded the market value of the goods. That is, of course, treating “market value” as a value untainted by market rigging.  208               It is not necessary, therefore, to determine whether Mr Keane’s alternative contention as to the meaning of the word “suffers” is arguable in order to conclude that Energex should not be shut out of court, at this stage, on the basis of s 82(2).  209               It is also unnecessary to accept as arguable Me Keane’s somewhat elaborate submissions regarding what Energex might do in the event that the respondents seek to rely upon s 82(2) as an answer to the claim for damages under s 82(1). Mr Keane pointed out that it was theoretically possible that the respondents would not plead the limitation defence. He submitted that no application for summary dismissal should be entertained until that defence had at least been pleaded.  210               I am not persuaded by that submission. The various notices of motion presently before the Court make it abundantly clear that the respondents will, if required to file defences, plead the limitation defence. Mr Keane’s suggestion that they may not do so is entirely unrealistic.  211               The next point raised by Mr Keane was that any attempt on the part of the respondents to plead a limitation defence would be met by an amendment to the statement of claim, by way of reply, in which Energex would seek damages based not upon the original breaches of s 45, but rather upon the unconscionable conduct involved in pleading the defence. Mr Keane contended that such relief would arise pursuant to s 51AC. Alternatively, he submitted that Energex would be entitled to recover damages, pursuant to the causes of action already pleaded, or to obtain injunctive relief to prevent the respondents from pleading that defence.  212               I am greatly impressed by the ingenuity of the argument. I am rather less impressed by its merits.  213               Mr Keane submitted that any attempt to plead the limitation defence would amount to conduct “in trade or commerce”. Section 51AC relevantly provides: “(1) A corporation must not, in trade or commerce, in connection with:   (a) the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a person (other than a listed public company); or   (b) the acquisition or possible acquisition of goods or services from a person (other than a listed public company);  engage in conduct that is, in all the circumstances, unconscionable.  (2) A person must not, in trade or commerce, in connection with:   (a) the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a corporation (other than a listed public company); or   (b) the acquisition or possible acquisition of goods or services from a corporation (other than a listed public company);  engage in conduct that is, in all the circumstances, unconscionable. …” 214               Section 51AC(4) contains a series of matters to which the Court may have regard when determining whether either ss 51AC(1) or 51AC(2) has been contravened.  215               Section 51AC(5) provides: “5. A person is not to be taken for the purposes of this section to engage in unconscionable conduct in connection with:   (a) the supply or possible supply of goods or services to another person; or   (b) the acquisition or possible acquisition of goods or services from another person;  by reason only that the first-mentioned person institutes legal proceedings in relation to that supply, possible supply, acquisition or possible acquisition or refers to arbitration a dispute or claim in relation to that supply, possible supply, acquisition or possible acquisition.”  216               Mr Keane submitted that any party who enters into a contract, and then seeks to plead a defence, or seeks to take advantage of a legal right, in circumstances where it would be “unconscionable” to do so, thereby contravenes s 51AC. He submitted that s 51AC(5) supported that contention, and he relied in particular upon the use of the expression “by reason only that”.  217               I am not persuaded by that submission. It requires the expression “in trade or commerce” to be given an unduly wide meaning. It is also difficult to reconcile with those authorities that have dealt with the meaning of that expression in this context. For example, in Little v Law Institute of Victoria & Ors (No 3) [1990] VR 257, the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria held that a statement made by the respondent during the course of proceedings brought against the appellant seeking to restrain the appellant from practising as a solicitor could not give rise to a claim under the Fair Trading Act 1985 (Vic).  218               In a joint judgment, Kaye and Beach JJ said at 273: “In our opinion, statements made during the course of litigation cannot be categorised as statements made in trade or commerce nor can they categorised as representations.” 219               Their Honours referred to Re Ku-ring-gai Co-operative Building Society (No 12) Ltd (1978) 22 ALR 621 where Bowen CJ explained that the words “trade” and “commerce” were ordinary terms which described all the “mutual communings” that comprised commercial arrangements or commercial dealings. They then concluded: “A statement made to a court during the course of litigation is not a statement made in connection with or as part of a commercial arrangement.” 220               See also the observations of Ormiston J at 292, which are to the same effect.  221               I also note that in Australian Associated Motor Insurers Ltd v NRMA Insurance Ltd (2002) 124 FCR 518, Conti J held that a claim that the NRMA and the second respondent, who was a solicitor who acted under retainer agreements from NRMA–insured parties, had contravened s 52, should be struck-out because the conduct about which the applicant complained did not occur “in trade or commerce”. His Honour applied the test laid down in Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd v Nelson (1990) 169 CLR 594 at 603-604 in arriving at that conclusion. In substance, he accepted that the conduct of litigation in court on behalf of a client does not amount to engaging in an activity having a trading or commercial character. 222               On the present state of the authorities, any attempt on the part of Energex to invoke s 51AC in response to a pleading of a limitation defence is unlikely to succeed. The same may be said regarding Mr Keane’s submission that the equitable jurisdiction of the Court could be invoked to enjoin the respondents from relying upon any limitation defence. There is no basis, in the present case, for invoking an estoppel of the kind raised in The Commonwealth v Verwayen (1990) 170 CLR 394. The respondents have not undertaken, expressly or impliedly, not to plead a limitations defence. I accept that in Hawkins v Clayton, Deane J flagged the possibility that an injunction might go to prevent reliance upon such a defence in circumstances where it would be unconscionable to permit it to be raised. However, his Honour’s analysis does not seem to have commended itself to the other members of the Court.  223               Mr Keane also relied upon what is known in the United States as the “doctrine of fraudulent concealment”. He referred to Atlantic City Electric Co v General Electric Co 312 F2d 236 (1962), a decision of the United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit. In that case, the majority referred to that doctrine, and its application in every Federal statute of limitation. In effect, the Court held that the doctrine applied unless Congress expressly provided to the contrary, in clear and unambiguous language.  224               A similar approach had earlier been taken by the United States Supreme Court in Bailey v Glover 88 US 342 (1874). There, it was held that, at least in equity suits, time did not run in cases of fraudulent concealment until the fraud had been discovered. The Court observed that the position at common law was less clear, but on balance, the same principle ought to apply. 225               The difficulty with my placing any reliance upon these authorities is that the Full Federal Court in Wardley expressly considered, and rejected, any such principle. It noted, for example, that in England, historically, limitation statutes had been construed in a manner that favoured defendants. That led to the enactment of the Latent Damages Act 1986 (UK) which inserted s 14A into the Limitation Act 1980 (UK). This had the effect that the starting date for the reckoning of the period of limitation would be the earliest date on which the plaintiff first had both the knowledge required to bring an action, and the right to do so.  226               The Full Court in Wardley observed that the older English authorities had not escaped criticism. Nonetheless, those cases had been repeatedly followed in Australia and left little room for the invocation of any equitable doctrine of concealed fraud. The Full Court observed at 269: “The equitable doctrine of concealed fraud does not operate to prevent a defendant to a purely legal claim, not being a claim also cognisable in the concurrent jurisdiction of an equity court, from pleading the Statute of Limitations.” 227               The Full Court noted that strong criticisms had been levelled at this approach by various commentators and law reform bodies. It said at 270: “In 1936, the contrary views of McCardie J in Lynn v Bamber drew some anxious comment in par 22 of the Fifth Interim Report of the Law Revision Committee which dealt with statutes of limitation: see also the cautious treatment of the subject by D B Ross, “Concealed Fraud and the Statute of Limitations” (1930) 4 ALJ 174. The result was a recommendation by the Committee (since embodied in the British legislation) that in all cases in which the statutes of limitation apply, or are applied by analogy, (a) where a cause of action is founded on fraud, committed by the defendant or his agent or some person through whom he claims, or (b) where a cause of action unconnected with fraud is fraudulently concealed from the plaintiff by the defendant or his agent or some person through whom he claims, the right of the plaintiff to sue should be deemed to have first accrued at the time when the plaintiff discovered such fraud, or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it. The New South Wales and Victorian legislation, to which Davies J referred in Fenech v Sterling, expresses the same policy. We were told that there was no such legislation in Western Australia. (No question arose on this appeal as to whether, consistently with the scope of s 82 of the Act, there remained room for the operation of s 79 of the Judiciary Act to pick up any State limitation statute: see Vink v Schering Pty Ltd (No 2) [1991] ATPR 52,113.)”  228               Having given the matter careful consideration, the Full Court concluded: “But the question for us is whether there is room for the application of this particular equitable doctrine to defeat reliance upon a limitation provision contained within the statute conferring the cause of action. The equitable doctrine is expressed in terms of claims arising under the general law, whether they might be characterised as legal or equitable. It is not couched in terms which extend to claims created purely by statute. In such cases, the statute has to be given its full effect including any engrafted time limitation of whatever character. That, in our view, is what follows from the decision of the High Court in Crown v McNeil.” 229               Nothing said by the High Court in Wardley, when the case went on appeal, casts any doubt upon the correctness of the approach taken to this issue by the Full Court. Other cases that are in point, including Scarcella v Lettice (2000) 51 NSWLR 302, point in the same direction. See generally the observations of Handley JA in Scarcella at 306 and 308.  230               In Scarcella it was held that time commenced to run, in an action for negligence, when damages accrued, even though the purchasers were not aware of the defect in title. The defect in question was not latent, and could have been discovered had the solicitors who acted for the plaintiff adopted normal conveyancing procedures.  231               On the present state of the authorities, the doctrine of concealed fraud cannot be invoked in answer to the respondents’ foreshadowed reliance upon s 82(2). The authorities suggest that there may be some scope for the application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel, but it is clearly premature to consider that possibility. There would need to be a great deal more known about the facts before any definitive conclusion could be reached.  232               Some commentators have noted that in cases of fraud, statutes of limitations have been given a special application in equity. For example, I C F Spry, in The Principles of Equitable Remedies 5th ed, 1997, observes at pp 424 and following, that courts of equity would not ordinarily allow a statute of limitations to be set up, in equitable proceedings, in respect of time during which, by reason of the fraud of the defendant, the plaintiff was not aware of his or her right of action. He says that the precise basis upon which equitable relief was granted had been the subject of controversy but “should probably be found in the general disposition of courts of equity to prevent fraudulent reliance on rights”. He also says that there has been some uncertainty as to whether courts of equity would intervene to prevent the setting up of statutory limitation periods in common law actions.  233               The learned authors of Meagher, Gummow & Lehane’s Equitable Doctrines & Remedies, 4th ed, 2002, essentially agree with this analysis. They point out that when the Court of Chancery developed the doctrine of applying statutes of limitation, by analogy, it refused to do so in cases of “concealed fraud”. There were two main classes of case to which the doctrine applied: (a) when the action was one alleging fraud, in which case time did not run until the discovery of the fraud; and (b) where the cause of action did not involve fraud but its existence was fraudulently concealed by the defendant, in which case time did not run until both the concealment had been discovered, and the cause of action ascertained. They suggest that the former category included actions involving the common law notion of deceit.  234               Whatever rules developed in equity regarding the taking of limitation defences in cases of fraud seem to have been confined to purely equitable proceedings. In Meagher, Gummow & Lehane, it is said at [34-095] that the equitable doctrine of concealed fraud furnished an answer only to equitable claims. It could not be used to furnish grounds for an injunction restraining a defendant at law from pleading the statute of limitations. See generally Imperial Gas Light and Coke Co v London Gas Light Co (1854) 10 Exch 39; 156 ER 346, Hunter v Gibbons (1856) 1 H & N 459; 156 ER 1281, Armstrong v Milburn [1886-90] All ER Rep 596, and R v McNeil (1922) 31 CLR 76 at 99-100. The New South Wales Court of Appeal took the same approach in Metacel Pty Ltd v Ralph Symonds Ltd (1969) 90 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 449 at 452, a case cited with approval by the Full Court in Wardley.  235               In such cases, time did not begin to run against a plaintiff so long as, by reason of the fraud of the defendant, the plaintiff was not aware of the matters giving rise to the cause of action. See for example Gibbs v Guild (1882) 9 QBD 59 at 69. According to Dr Spry, the better view was that fraud included, for these purposes, fraudulent concealment after a cause of action accrued. He noted, however, that much of this old learning had been superseded by the passage of legislation dealing with limitation periods.  236               In summary, I am not persuaded that Energex’s claims for damages under s 82(1) are untenable. It is at least arguable that any loss or damage suffered by Energex did not occur until after 26 July 1998, the date on which time began to run. Whether or not the limitation defence ultimately succeeds will be a matter for the trial. It is not a matter for summary dismissal.  237               I am fortified in my conclusion regarding this matter by what the High Court said in Wardley. The majority observed in its joint judgment at 533: “We should, however, state in the plainest of terms that we regard it as undesirable that limitation questions of the kind under consideration should be decided in interlocutory proceedings in advance of the hearing of the action, except in the clearest of cases. Generally speaking, in such proceedings, insufficient is known of the damage sustained by the plaintiff and of the circumstances in which it was sustained to justify a confident answer to the question.”  238               In Cubillo v Commonwealth (1999) 89 FCR 528, O’Loughlin J adopted a similarly cautious approach at 580-590. His Honour supported that approach by reference at 588 to a passage from the judgment of the Queensland Court of Appeal in Noble v Victoria [1999] QCA 110. Abuse of process 239               Because I have rejected the respondents’ contention that it is clear beyond argument that Energex’s claims for damages under s 82(1) are time barred, so as to warrant summary dismissal, it is not necessary, strictly speaking to deal with their alternative argument that the attempt to invoke s 87(1), as a by-product of a spurious application for injunctive relief, constitutes an abuse of process. Clearly, if s 82(2) does not constitute a bar to the claims under s 82(1), it cannot be an abuse of process for Energex to plead an alternative claim.  240               However, even if the claims brought under s 82(1) were statute barred, it would not necessarily follow that bringing an alternative claim under s 87(1), in conjunction with a claim for injunctive relief, would amount to an abuse of process.  241               In the first place, I see no reason why Energex should not seek the additional protection that would be afforded if an injunction under s 80 were granted in the terms sought. The fact that the ACCC has already obtained injunctive relief is relevant to the exercise of the discretion as to whether additional injunctive relief should be granted. It is not, however, a bar to such relief.  242               Once it is accepted that Energex is entitled to seek injunctive relief, there is no reason why it should be prevented from seeking damages under s 87(1). If Energex can make good its claim that the respondents have systematically engaged in collusive tendering over many years, there would be every justification, in my view, for permitting it to plead its case under s 87(1) so that it could recover damages.  243               The current weight of authority in this country is against the existence of a doctrine of fraudulent concealment in answer to a limitation defence, save in purely equitable proceedings. However, the principles that underlie that doctrine are relevant when considering whether the applicant’s attempt to find an alternative basis upon which to press its claim should be regarded as an abuse of process.  244               There is nothing wrong, in my opinion, with what Energex has done. If the respondents have engaged in systematic fraud, as alleged, it hardly behoves them to complain about Energex’s reliance upon a remedy for which the Act expressly provides. The respondents describe Energex’s conduct as an attempt to “circumvent” a protection that the Act affords them. I do not accept that as a valid characterisation. This is a case in which not only is fraudulent conduct alleged against the respondents, but so too is fraudulent concealment of that conduct. It is, in my view, quite inappropriate to describe Energex’s application for injunctive relief, and for damages under s 87(1), as an abuse of process. Deceit 245               This takes me to the next issue, which is the challenge to the manner in which the tort of deceit is pleaded. I propose to deal with that point briefly.  246               I accept Mr Keane’s submission that it is at least arguable that the conduct of the respondents in engaging in the tender process, as they did, gave rise to an implied representation that that process was being conducted in a proper and lawful manner. I also accept his submission that Energex need not, and does not, rely upon the existence of some duty, on the part of the respondents, to inform it of the true position. The question is simply whether the respondents’ conduct was apt to indicate that what were in truth collusive tenders, were genuine and separate bids.  247               There appears to be no real issue between the parties regarding the necessary elements of an action in deceit. It seems clear enough that there must be a representation of fact made by words or by conduct, and mere silence is not sufficient.  248               There is a helpful summary of the requirements for pleading the tort of deceit in Bullen & Leake & Jacob’s Precedents of Pleadings, 14th ed, Vol 2, London, Sweet & Maxwell, 2001, at pp 813-816. A representation can be a statement which is implied from the context in which words are spoken, or by conduct.  249               An example of how conduct that appears not to involve any representation may in fact be held to do so is to be found in Director of Public Prosecutions v Ray [1974] AC 370. In that case, the defendant and four friends went to a restaurant intending to have a meal there and pay for it. After eating the main course, they decided not to pay for the meal. However, they remained seated until the waiter went out of the room. They then ran from the restaurant. The defendant was convicted of dishonestly obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception. The House of Lords held that the conviction should stand on the basis that the defendant’s conduct, in remaining seated in the restaurant, amounted to a continuing representation of his present intention to pay. His change of mind produced a deception, the effect of which was that he was treated as an honest customer whose conduct did not call for precautions.  250               This decision has not escaped criticism. Nonetheless, it remains good law in England, and although he did not cite it, it certainly supports Mr Keane’s argument. Bullen & Leake makes the point that active concealment of a material fact may operate as a misrepresentation but mere non-disclosure of facts will not give rise to a cause of action unless there is a duty of disclosure, for example, where there is a fiduciary relationship: see Smith v Hughes (1871) LR 6 QB 597.  251               It is at least arguable that the respondents, by their conduct in submitting tenders in accordance with a regulated tender process, made the representations pleaded. That is sufficient to avoid summary dismissal, or a strike out application. Other pleading points 252               The final matter that needs to be considered is whether Mr Gray has succeeded in demonstrating that the statement of claim is so defective as to warrant being struck out in whole or in part. In my view, he has not made good that contention.  253               The statement of claim is certainly a complex document. At times it is difficult to follow. That is because it encompasses a large number of transactions, involving many different entities. Nonetheless, I am not persuaded that it is so complex, or unclear, that it would “embarrass” the Schneider respondents to require them to file a defence. If any uncertainty exists regarding the nature of the allegations made against those respondents, it can be overcome by the provision of further and better particulars.  Orders 254               Each notice of motion will be dismissed. I will stand the matter over to 16 June 2004 at 9.30 am to hear submissions from the parties regarding the matter of costs, and to give directions as to the future conduct of this proceeding.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

1                    
The Applicant, on 23 September 2002, commenced
proceedings in the High Court seeking an order nisi for a writ of prohibition
and in addition, injunctive relief. 
Gaudron J remitted the proceedings on 6 February 2003 to this Court for
hearing. 

2                    
When the hearing of the matter commenced the
parties requested an order, by consent, that the Application be treated as an
application for an order absolute that the Respondent Minister be prohibited
from giving effect to a decision or decisions, purporting to be made by the
then Minister on 25 May 2002 under s 501(2) of the Migration Act 1958
(“the Act”) cancelling the Applicant’s permanent visa and issuing to him in its
place a bridging visa Class E to allow the Applicant to remain in Australia to
complete his custodial sentence.  The
Applicant sought also an injunction restraining inter alia the Minister from
removing the Applicant from Australia.  
I made that order notwithstanding that no order nisi had been granted
but on the basis that the present proceedings should be treated as an
application for final relief as if an order nisi had been granted.

3                    
The application for a writ of prohibition
alleges jurisdictional error, error of law, denial of procedural fairness and
unreasonableness in respect of the exercise of the Minister’s discretion to
cancel the Applicant’s visa. It is asserted by the Applicant that in exercising
his discretion, the Minister failed to take into account the best interests of
the Applicant’s children, took into account an irrelevant consideration, namely
that the Applicant’s offences could be characterised as serious, and that there
was a failure to afford procedural fairness in that the Applicant was not
specifically informed that a letter had not been provided to the Department of
Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (the “Department”) from his son’s mother
concerning his relationship with his son.

4                    
The Commonwealth appeared and submitted to any
order which the Court might make other than as to costs.  It was unclear whether any order was really
sought against the Commonwealth and thus whether it was a necessary party.  However, I refrained from dismissing the
Commonwealth as a party upon the request of Senior Counsel for the Applicant
not to so do.

Background

5                    
The Applicant came to Australia with his parents
at age 14 on 14 October 1980. At that time he held a K 11 class visa and
resided with his family in Sydney. In 1986, the Applicant’s parents became
Australian citizens by naturalisation, but he did not become a citizen because,
he said, he was not “ready” at the time to do so. 

6                    
The Applicant attended Ashcroft High School
until year 10.  He completed his School
Certificate. Since leaving school, he has worked as a station assistant for
CityRail, engaged in labouring and welding work, studied languages at TAFE in
1989 and 1990, and has worked in Spanish restaurants. The Applicant also
commenced degrees in Arts, and Languages and Teaching, at the University of
Western Sydney in 1994. The Applicant has resided in Australia for more than 23
years.

7                    
The Applicant has had two long-term relationships
in Australia.  He has two sons from those
relationships, Yves Lorenzo (currently aged 10) and Aiden Lorenzo (currently
aged 15). Both of his children are Australian citizens by birth.  Aiden lives with his mother in Brisbane.  He has “very limited contact” with his
father.  Yves lives with his mother,
Laura Sosa in Sydney.  

8                    
Both the Applicant and Yves’ mother, Laura Sosa,
gave uncontested evidence in affidavits filed in the present proceedings that
the relationship between Yves and his father was very close. Although the
Applicant and Ms Sosa terminated their sexual relationship and ceased living
together in May 1998, the Applicant has had daily contact with Yves, either by
telephone or in person, and even during the periods of his incarceration. The Applicant,
when at liberty, played soccer with his son, had meals with him, has taught him
Spanish and took him on regular visits to his grandparents’ place. Both the
Applicant and Ms Sosa say that deportation of the Applicant would have a
devastating effect on Yves.  I have no
reason to doubt that this is the case. Ms Sosa also said that if the Applicant
is deported, she would not have the financial means to take Yves to visit
him.  Her only source of income is a sole
parent pension. 

9                    
During the period between 1993 and 2001, the
Applicant was convicted of offences of larceny, possession of a prohibited
drug, possession of equipment for administering a prohibited drug,
self-administering a prohibited drug, entering inclosed land not prescribed
without lawful excuse, goods in personal custody reasonably suspected of being
stolen, shoplifting, goods in personal custody, common assault, contravening
apprehended domestic violence order, smoking Indian Hemp, offensive behaviour,
resisting arrest, refusal to leave premises, failure to leave licensed
premises, cancelled driver, MID PCA and drive whilst cancelled, and supplying a
prohibited drug. The sentences imposed as a result of these convictions were
cumulatively in excess of 2 years.   

10                 
The Minister acted under s 501(2) of the Act to
cancel the Applicant’s permanent resident visa. 
That section provides, relevantly:

The Minister may cancel a visa that has been granted to a person
if:

(a)              
the Minister reasonably suspects that the person does
not pass the character test; and

(b)              
the person does not satisfy the Minister that the
person passes the character test.

11                 
By virtue of s 501(6), a person is taken not to
pass the character test if the person has a substantial criminal record as
defined by s 501(7).  That subsection
provides that a person has a substantial criminal record inter alia if the
person has been sentenced to two or more terms of imprisonment whether on one
or more than one occasion where the total of the terms is 2 years or more.  Thus the Applicant was a person who did not
pass the character test.  The Applicant
does not contest that.

12                 
On 30 November 2001 and while the Applicant was
held on remand at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre at Silverwater
(the “Remand Centre”) in relation to larceny and a drug offence there was issued to him a Notice of Intention to
Consider Cancelling a Visa under Subsection 501(2) of the Migration Act 1958
.  The notice annexed a copy of the
relevant legislation and the Ministerial Direction for Visa Refusal and
Cancellation under section 501 of the Migration Act 1958 (the
“Direction”).  Importantly the notice
advised the Applicant that if there was any information that he felt the
Minister ought to be aware of and take into account, that information should be
provided no later than 21 December 2001 to the Department.  

13                 
The Applicant was also interviewed  by an officer of the Minister’s Department, a
Ms Heidi Speed at the Remand Centre on the same day. At that interview, the
Applicant was informed that he was liable to have his visa cancelled because of
his past and present criminal conduct. Ms Speed also told him that he would
require letters of support from his family detailing his relationship with his
son Yves. The Applicant said that he would provide them.  The record of interview in response to the
question, “Why should your visa NOT be cancelled?” noted that the Applicant had
answered, “Because of my children.  I
have done some positive things.  My
parents”.  Ms Speed wrote a letter that
day to the Applicant saying:

“As discussed at interview, if you wish to provide any further
documentation in relation to this matter to be presented to the decision maker,
you should do so by 21 December 2001.”

14                 
The deadline of 21 December 2001 was extended to
2 January 2002 by a letter from Ms Speed addressed to the Applicant and dated
12 December 2001.

15                 
On 29 January 2002, the Applicant appeared
before the Drug Court and was placed in a 12 month Drug Court rehabilitation
program at Adele House. It appears, however, that on or around 3 March 2002 the
Applicant left Adele House.  In
cross-examination before me the Applicant said that this was because he had
been told to leave. The reason is immaterial. 
The Applicant was thereafter arrested on 14 April 2002 and sentenced on
9 May 2002 by the Drug Court to a further term of imprisonment that would end
on 14 October 2002. 

16                 
On 31 January 2002 a File Note written by Ms
Speed indicated that she had spoken to the Applicant who had been released from
gaol.  The note records that it was
agreed with the Applicant that he would provide documents to Ms Speed by 8
February 2002.  There is a potential
conflict between the File Note of 31 January 2002 and an earlier File Note of
29 January 2002 in which Ms Speed notes that she was told that day by the
Applicant’s sister that the Applicant had been taken straight from the Drug
Court to Adele House and could be contacted there.  Be that as it may, Ms Speed  recorded that day that she had left a message
at Adele House that the Applicant call her.

17                 
On 6 February 2002 the South Western Sydney Area
Health Service Drug Court Program wrote to Ms Speed at the Applicant’s request
in support of the Applicant.  That letter
notes that the Applicant regularly saw his son with whom he had a good
relationship.  On the same day Adele
House wrote to Ms Speed in support of the Applicant.  Incidentally that letter makes it clear that
the Applicant was in Adele House as and from 29 January 2002 and reinforces the
view that Ms Speed’s File Note of 31 January 2002 was in error to the extent
that it suggests that the Applicant had his freedom as at the date of the note.


18                 
On 28 February 2002 Ms Speed in another File
Note records that the Applicant had said that the mother of his son would
provide further information but that this had not been received.  She suggests that a submission (presumably to
the Minister) could be prepared without this information but that the case
officer might “wish” to chase this up and include it in the submission.  The case officer evidently did not “wish” to
do so.  However, a submission was
prepared and presented to the Minister who made the decision to cancel the
Applicant’s visa on 25 May 2002.  The
Applicant was advised of the decision on 14 June 2002.

The unsent
letter

19                 
What was not known by the Minister, or for that
matter, anyone else in the Department is that after the interview with Ms Speed
in November 2001, the Applicant asked Ms Sosa, Yves’ mother, to prepare a
letter for the Department relating to his relationship with his son. In an
affidavit read without objection in these proceedings, Ms Sosa said that in
late 2001 the Applicant had requested that she write a letter regarding his
relationship with Yves. At no time had anyone from the Immigration Department
ever contacted her to find out about the impact deportation would have on Yves,
herself or the Applicant’s immediate family.

20                 
What is more, Ms Sosa said that she had indeed
written the letter.  She produced it to
the Court.  However, the letter had not
been sent.  She said that she had thought
the letter was for the Drug Court.  This
was so notwithstanding that the letter itself referred to the Immigration
Department and her request that it consider the effect of deportation inter
alia upon the child.  Ms Sosa also said
that she had spoken to an official at the Drug Court who told her that her
letter was not needed and that it would not make a difference. As a result, she
did not send it.  The Applicant was
unaware that she had not done so until after the Minister’s decision.

21                 
In cross-examination, Ms Sosa agreed that her
reason for writing the letter was her concern that the Applicant might be
deported.  She understood that the
decision to deport would be made by the Department of Immigration. Also,
although her recollection was not strong, Ms Sosa confirmed that she did not
send the letter because someone, presumably from the Drug Court, had told her
that her letter would not make a difference. In my view, although Ms Sosa knew
that the letter was connected to the Applicant’s deportation, I am satisfied that
she was confused as to where it should be sent, given that the deportation
issue was contemporaneous with the Drug Court proceedings.  On balance, I am satisfied that Ms Sosa did
write the letter, that she did contact someone at the Drug Court, and that she
did not send the letter because she was discouraged by that conversation.

22                 
A further Department File Note dated 9 May 2002
and prepared by a Simon Thompson, the case officer responsible for preparation
of the submission to the Minister 
indicates that a Mr Hayhow apparently from the Department of Corrective
Services had spoken with the Applicant by then in custody and told him that Mr
Thompson had left a message for the Applicant that a submission would be
prepared by the Department on its current information unless a further response
was received by 14 May 2002.

23                 
In his affidavit filed in the proceedings, the
Applicant says that during the period between his interview with Ms Speed and
receiving what he referred to as “the deportation papers” on 14 June 2002, he
did not have contact with any person from the Department. The Applicant also
said that at no time did a person from the Department explain to him the
factors that would be taken into account in deciding whether or not he should
be deported. In addition, the Applicant tendered some medical evidence that in
April 2001, he had suffered a frontal intracerebral haemorrhage resulting in
forgetfulness. According to a letter of Dr J M Knapik dated 15 July 2002, there
had been little change in the Applicant’s condition by 26 March 2002. 

24                 
In cross-examination, the Applicant agreed that
he had spoken to Ms Speed concerning further documents whilst staying at Adele
House. However, the Applicant said that he could not recall the name Richard
Hayhow, although he did remember that when he went to the Drug Court one of the
officers there had told him that “Immigration had been there and proceedings
for the deportation had begun”. 

25                 
I accept that the Applicant’s recollection was
affected by his medical condition at the time. 
However, nothing turns upon whether there was any conversation between
the Applicant and Mr Hayhow even if the conversation the Applicant did in fact
recall may in fact have been the conversation with Mr Hayhow.  What is clear is that Ms Speed had alerted
the Applicant of the need to provide information for consideration by the
Minister, the Applicant had advised Ms Speed that he would request Ms Sosa to
provide a letter, some documentary material had been provided to Ms Speed from
Adele House and the South Western Area Health Service, but no letter had been
forthcoming from Ms Sosa. Extensions of time had been granted from time to time
for the provision of information and submissions by the Applicant, until
finally, a submission was prepared for the Minister without any attempt to
ascertain what had happened to the letter which the Applicant had advised Ms
Speed he would obtain.   

26                 
In the letter which was not sent, Ms Sosa had
written that her son adored this father. 
She said that her son did not deserve to grow up without a father and
that she did not dare to think “of the grief and desperation Julio’s mother
will have to endure or the effect that it will have on my son if Julio was to
be deported.”

The evidence of the Applicant’s mother

27                 
An affidavit of Paulina Lorenzo, the Applicant’s
mother, was also read in the proceedings. 
In that affidavit  she deposed
that at no time had anyone from the Department ever contacted her about her son
and the effect deportation of the Applicant would have upon the family
including herself.  She said that if
contacted she would have said  that Yves
loved and worshiped his father, the Applicant, and that he loved and adored
Yves.  The two were, she said, very
close.  She said that they would come to
see her every Sunday and spend the whole day with her and that the family days
were very special.  She said that Yves
spent a lot of time with her son and that if he were to be deported to Spain it
would have a terrible effect on her and her husband.  They were a very close family.  She said also that she and her husband had
sold their previous house to purchase a house which had an extension where the
Applicant could live with them and where they could look after him.  She said that she would find it financially
very difficult to travel to Spain to see the Applicant if he were deported.

The Ministerial Submission

28                 
As already noted there was prepared for the
Minister a document entitled Issues for Consideration of Possible
Cancellation of Mr Lorenzo’s Visa under s 501(2) of the Migration Act 1958
.  That document is hereafter referred to
as “the submission”.  There is a question
which arises as to the significance the submission played in the decision made
by the Minister.  The Minister did not
comply with the obligations imposed upon him by s 501G of the Act to provide
timely reasons for his decision.  In fact
a document said to be the Minister’s reasons prepared after the present
proceedings had been commenced and some twelve months after the making of the
decision was sought to be adduced in evidence. 
In my view the document was not admissible in the form it was sought to
be tendered : Preston v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural &
Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCA 107 per French J.  It was not the subject of an affidavit
swearing to its correctness.  It was
prepared after litigation commenced and, while no time is set out in s 501G for
the preparation and service of reasons, it is clear that the legislative
intention was that reasons would be given within a reasonable time.  On no view can provision of reasons more than
12 months after the making of the decision be seen to be compliance with the
Act so that the document containing the reasons might be admissible as a
business record. However, even if it were admissible as a business record, it
would be impossible to give any weight to what is said in it: Dagli v
Minister [2003] FCA 298; Preston v Minister for Immigration &
Multicultuiral & Indigenous Afffairs (no 2).  Counsel for the Minister conceded that on the
present state of the authorities the tender of the document should be
rejected.  Accordingly I rejected
it.  However, that leaves the question of
the status of the submission.

29                 
I think that the inference can clearly be drawn
that the Minister read the submissions. 
Indeed his actual decision in writing is noted upon them.  I think it may also be inferred in the
absence of the Minister himself giving any evidence, that any error to be found
in the submission was adopted by the Minister. 
Otherwise the situation is that there is simply no evidence before the
Court as to what matters the Minister took into account in making his decision
or the weight which he attached to any matter in the submission.

30                 
Under the heading “Discretion” the submission
indicated that Mr Lorenzo had been notified in person at the Remand Centre of
the intention to cancel his visa and had been invited to submit any comment he
believed relevant to cancellation.  It is
noted that Mr Lorenzo had indicated that he would respond by 8 February 2002.  It is said that Mr Lorenzo was again
contacted on 28 February 2002 and “offered time to submit further information”
.  It is noted that Mr Lorenzo had
forwarded letters from the South Western Sydney Area Health Service Drug Court
Program and Adele House.  It is said that
he was contacted again on 9 May 2002 and informed that a submission would be
prepared with information then held unless a submission was received from him
by 14 May 2002, but that he had not responded further.

31                 
The submission in paragraph 7 lists offences and
sentences, the last of which was supply Prohibited Drug.  Under the Heading, “Primary Considerations” –
“Protection of the Australian Community”, consideration is said to be given to
the seriousness and nature of the Applicant’s conduct.  The document quotes from the Minister’s
Direction as follows:

“It is the Government’s view that the following are examples of
offences which are considered by the Government to be very serious: 



(l)                
serious theft (including “white collar” crimes): 

·         
such crimes are of concern because of the
amounts of money involved and/or the disruption caused to individuals, business
and Government;

(n)             
any other crimes involving violence or the threat of
violence: 

·       
such crimes are of special concern to the
welfare and safety of the Australian community; and”

It then notes that
“Mr Lorenzo’s offence” (singular) is listed as “a very serious offence under
the Direction”.  In fact, none of the
Applicant’s offences came within those referred to in the Direction unless the
drug offences are within the category of “special concern to the welfare and
safety of the Australian community”.  The
submission then continues to say that the Applicant had “further criminal
convictions in New South Wales” and lists them. That list does not include the
offence of “supply Prohibited drug”. 

32                 
Clearly this part of the submission is not
elegantly written.  It goes too far to
say as Senior Counsel for the Applicant says that it is muddled.  In fact, given that the list of “other”
offences excludes the offence of supply it can easily be deduced that the
reference to the “very serious offence” must be a reference to that.  While it may also be true that some of the
offences may not have, on their own, been particularly serious, it is the
cumulative effect of them which may have an effect on the Minister in deciding
whether to cancel the visa.  In any
event, a complete copy of the Applicant’s criminal history was annexed to the
document so that it was open to the Minister to assess himself the seriousness
of the Applicant’s conduct.  

33                 
The submission continued by suggesting that on
the basis of the Applicant’s criminal history it was open to the Minister, as
indeed it was, to find that the Applicant’s conduct against the community was
serious.  Reference is made to the
Applicant’s drug use as a possible mitigation of the offences.

34                 
Of greater significance is that part of the
document which relates to the best interests of the Applicant’s children.  After noting Article 3.1 of the Convention on
the Rights of the Child, the document notes that the Applicant had two children
and that the Applicant in the interview had stated that the children would be
affected by the decision.  After setting
out some other information the document continues:

 “[34] Mr Lorenzo stated
that his sons would be affected if his visa were cancelled, but did not
elaborate on the impact his deportation would have on them. 



[35] It is difficult to assess the impact of Mr Lorenzo’s
possible visa cancellation would on his sons due to the limited information
currently held…



[36] It is open to you to find from the information given that
the cancellation of Mr Lorenzo’s visa and his removal from Australia would have
a detrimental effect on his children.”

35                 
Attached to the document was the note of the
interview with the Applicant made by Ms Speed in which he had said, as noted
earlier, that he had constant contact with his family, including lunch each
Sunday and his submission that the visa should not be cancelled “because of my
children. I have done some positive things. My parents.”  That document indicated that the Applicant
would ask his family to write letters in support of his case.  The document noted also that although the
Applicant’s family, ie his mother, father and siblings had not been interviewed
it was not unreasonable to conclude that they would suffer some hardship if the
visa were to be cancelled.

SUBMISSIONS

36                 
On behalf of the Applicant it was submitted that
the decision should be set aside on the following grounds:

1       
The Minister had failed in accordance with his
obligation under s 501G of the Act to give reasons.  It is said that the inference was open that
there were no reasons which did or could justify the decision.

2       
There had been a denial of procedural fairness in that
the submission had characterised the offences committed as “serious offences”
or in the case of an unidentified offence “a very serious” offences and had
thus failed to present a balanced position. 
However, the Applicant was not given the opportunity to present a case
against the characterisation of these offences or to comment on the Minister’s
conclusion that there existed a “continuing” or “high risk” of recividism.

3       
That the Minister had taken account of an irrelevant
consideration, that being the characterisation of the offences.

4       
That the Minister had failed to take into account a
relevant consideration namely the interest of Yves in that he had not
interviewed the family nor was he aware of the mistake in the obtaining
information from Yves mother.

5       
That the primary consideration of the best interests of
the children was a common law right which could not b abrogated.  Hence the Minister was obliged to take it
into account but had failed to do so.

6       
That the Minister had failed to apply the correct test,
namely whether he was satisfied “in reality” having regard to the best
interests of the children as a primary consideration that the decision to
cancel should be made.

7       
The decision was unjust and manifestly unreasonable
because it amounted to the imposition of an unjust and disproportional
punishment for the offences he had committed.

General

37                 
To succeed, the Applicant must show that the
Minister’s decision was made outside jurisdiction.  The categories of jurisdictional error such
as to provide grounds for relief under the constitutional writs provided for in
s 75(v) of the Constitution (or the statutory writs in this Court
exercising jurisdiction under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903) may
not be able to be exhaustively stated. 
However, it is clear that failure to provide procedural fairness will
result in the vitiating of a decision: Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth of
Australia (2003) 211 CLR 476, and at least some decisions made in error of
law will involved jurisdictional error, although whether a legally erroneous decision
does involve jurisdictional error may ultimately involve a question of
interpretation of the relevant statute. 

Ground 1 – the failure to give reasons

38                 
This submission may be easily rejected.  First, s 501G itself provides that failure to
provide reasons does not affect the validity of the decision, whereas the
submission if accepted would have the consequence that every decision
unsupported by a timely provision of reasons would be taken to be made without
reason and thus invalid.  Second, and
more importantly, the High Court has rejected a submission that failure to
provide reasons constitutes jurisdictional error: Re Minister for
Immigration & multicultural & Ethnic Affairs; Ex parte Palme (2003)
77 ALJR 1829 at [46] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon J, and at [55] per
McHugh J and at [109] per Kirby J.

Grounds 2 and 3 – Procedural fairness – the very serious offence – an
irrelevant consideration?

39                 
I have already indicated my view that the
reference to “very serious offence” was a reference to the offence of
supply.  

40                 
As I understand the submission it is said that
the Minister characterised the offences for which the Applicant was convicted
as being either serious, or in the one case, “very serious”, and that the
Applicant was not given the opportunity of responding to this characterisation
of the offences.

41                 
There is the problem that in the absence of
reasons it can not be said to be clear that the 
Minister adopted the characterisation appearing in the submissions.  But even if he did it is difficult to say
that there is any procedural unfairness to the Applicant here.  The Applicant knew, or ought to have known,
that the Minister was to engage in a process which involved considering the
Applicant’s criminal record.  There is no
suggestion that the record as enumerated in the submission was wrong.  It was correct.  Further it could hardly be said that all of
the convictions were trivial.  Importantly,
here, however, the seriousness of the offences is capable of being judged by
reference to the sentences imposed on conviction.  In the circumstances it is difficult to see
that there was any obligation upon the Minister to seek specific comment from
the Applicant about the classification of the offences as serious.

42                 
Further, it can hardly be said that the characterisation
of offences as serious or very serious involves an irrelevant consideration, if
indeed, the characterisation was one adopted by the Minister.  What s 501 relevantly is concerned with is
the conviction of a visa holder of offences which, cumulatively, involve
custodial sentences of two years or more. 
That is the necessary precondition to the exercise of the power to
cancel under the section.  The discretion
conferred upon the Minister enables the Minister to weigh any relevant matter
against the criminal record of the visa holder. In the exercise of the
discretion the Minister will be entitled to consider the seriousness of the
offences against such other matters as may be favourable to the visa
holder.  The characterisation of the
seriousness of the relevant offence is thus not irrelevant.

Grounds 4, 5 and 6

43                 
The principal argument on behalf of the
Applicant was that the decision of the Minister miscarried in his consideration
of the interests of the child.  It is
submitted that the Applicant was denied natural justice or alternatively that
the Minister gave no real consideration to the rights of the child or for that
matter, the family of the Applicant.

44                 
It may be accepted that while the International
Convention on the Rights of the Child has not been enacted into Australian
municipal law, nevertheless the significance of the Convention with its
emphasis on the importance of the rights of the child gives rise to a
legitimate expectation that a decision maker would take account of the
Convention and thus give primacy to the welfare of the child: Minister for
Immigration & Ethnic Affairs v Teoh (1995) 183 CLR 273.  Failure to do so without giving a visa holder
the opportunity of making submissions would involve a denial of procedural
fairness.  It is not necessary in the
present case to consider whether, as Gaudron J said in that case, the common
law of Australia itself would require that the Minister not merely to take
account of the rights of a child, but to give such rights primacy.  It was submitted on behalf of the Applicant
that I should so find.  However, I do not
think that the question arises in the present case.  First, the author of the submissions put to
the Minister regarded the Convention as an important matter to be taken into
account by the Minister.  Reference was
made in the submission to the Convention and its requirement that the interests
of the child be given primacy.  Reference
was made also to the fact that the Applicant had two children and that the
Applicant himself had said that Yves would be affected by the decision.  Secondly, I do not think that the Applicant
has put before me any evidence which suggests that the Minister did not regard
the welfare of the children to be a matter of primary concern.  No reasons of the Minister were in evidence
and I do not think that it may be inferred from any material before me that the
Minister acted otherwise.  If anything, I
would infer that the Minister did take account of the submission and thus regarded
the interests of the children as primary since that is what he had directed
other decision-makers to do in his Direction. 
Why would he then do otherwise himself, notwithstanding that the
Minister would not be bound to follow his own directions?  It is not difficult to infer that he would
act in the same way as he had directed others to act.

45                 
More importantly, however, there is the question
of the letter from Ms Sosa which the Applicant had indicated he would obtain,
but which as a result of misadventure, and unknown to the Applicant, was not
sent.  Clearly there can be no suggestion
that a decision maker acts outside jurisdiction by relying on facts which are
true.  There had been no letter sent and
that fact was true.  Nor can it be said
that the failure to receive a letter from Ms Sosa was a matter which those
advising the Minister should have followed up. 
There is no general obligation upon the Minister to make his own
enquiries and this must be so, particularly where the visa holder has been given
the opportunity to put all that he or she may wish to put before the Minister,
including any submission from the mother of a child, which was nevertheless not
forthcoming.

46                 
The Applicant’s submission is, however, put
quite differently.  It is said on behalf
of the Applicant that the submission given to the Minister was inaccurate or
perhaps misleading in that it gave the impression that the Applicant had been
asked to provide further information but had not done so when this was far from
the truth. So it was submitted the Minister had not really been able to turn
his mind to the significant question of the primary right of the child.  Alternatively, it was submitted that the
submission lacked the ‘pitch’ or ‘balance’ such as to constitute a breach of
the requirements of procedural fairness: Re Minister for Immigration &
Muilticultural Affairs; ex parte Palme (2003) 77 ALJR 1829 at 1833 per
Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ. 
Further in the alternative it is said that the Applicant was denied
procedural fairness in that the Applicant was not told that the Minister was
proceeding to consider (and ultimately make) the decision on the basis that Ms
Sosa was not providing the information she had promised, and that the Applicant
was responsible for the lack of information concerning the welfare of his son.  It is said that had the Applicant been told
that this false impression was what was to be given to the Minister, then he
would have been able to respond, presumably by ensuring that Ms Sosa actually
provided the letter.  It can be said
clearly that there is a possibility, had the letter been provided, that the
Minister’s decision might have been different from that which it was.

47                 
It is a fundamental requirement of procedural
fairness, particularly where the decision involved has such serious
consequences as the decision here has, namely removal of a visa holder who is
the father of an infant child from the jurisdiction, that the person affected
is given the opportunity to be heard on the matters in issue in the
decision.  As was said in Kioa v West
(1985) 159 CLR 550 at 585, the general question to be asked will be “what does
the duty to act fairly require in the circumstances of the particular
case”.  Ordinarily that will require no
more than that, before the decision is made, the person affected by it is given
the opportunity to put his or her case. 
It may be accepted that there is no obligation on a decision maker to
reveal to a person affected by the decision what matters the decision maker has
in his or her mind.   Hence, ordinarily
there would be no obligation upon the Minister to show the visa holder the
submission that is to be put before him before making the decision since it can
be assumed that the visa holder will already have been given the opportunity to
put whatever he may wish to put in favour of his case that the visa not be
cancelled: Palme at 16ff. 
However, as Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ pointed out in Palme
at 21, there may be an entitlement to rebut adverse material received from
other sources.  The same may be said
where the submission contains material adverse to the visa holder where that
material was not apparent from the nature of the decision itself: Commissioner
for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR
576 at 591-2, cited with apparent approval by the High Court in Palme.  If the submission contained material
adverse to the Applicant which was false, and which the Applicant could not
expect to have been placed before the decision maker, then it can be said that
the Applicant would, as a matter of fairness, have been denied procedural
fairness unless this material was made known to him and he was given the
opportunity to rebut it.  That a decision
which contains misstatement of facts may be set aside on the grounds of
procedural fairness where the person affected by the decision is not given the
opportunity to rebut the misstatement may be inferred from the judgment of
McHugh J in Palme at [94].

48                 
Reference may also be made in support of the
case for the Applicant to Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte Aala
(2000) 204 CLR 82 where a decision was set aside upon the basis that the
Tribunal had so conducted the review that the prosecutor was deprived of a fair
opportunity to correct an erroneous and factual assumption relevant to his
credibility.

49                 
It seems to me that the question in this case is
thus whether the submission document implies and thus conveys to the Minister
that the failure on the part of the Applicant to provide a letter from the
mother of Yves son meant that no such letter could be provided and that in
consequence the relationship with the son was not particularly strong and
certainly not of the quality which the mother says is in fact the case.  Certainly the submission does not put the
case for a close relationship between the Applicant and his son very
convincingly.  In fact, the submission is
to the contrary.  Not only is it made
clear that the Applicant had been given the opportunity to provide evidence but
it is said merely that the Applicant had stated that the sons would be affected
but that he had not “elaborated” on the impact deportation would have.  Further it is said that it was difficult to
assess the impact the cancellation would have because of the “limited
information” which the Minister had.

50                 
On balance I am of the view that the way the
relationship is expressed in the submission is adverse to the Applicant and
indeed misleading.  Further the way it is
expressed is not something which the Applicant would have expected, as he
understood, incorrectly as it turns out, that Ms Sosa had written to the
Minister.  It seems to me that in these
very unusual circumstances, the Applicant was denied procedural fairness in
that he did not have an opportunity to respond to the material in the submission
so far as it related to the interests of the son Yves.

51                 
The alternative submissions that either there
was a duty on the Minister to make his own enquiries or that the Minister did
not in reality turn his mind to the best interests of the child I would
reject.  Firstly, there is, as Teoh  itself held, no obligation upon the Minister
to make enquiries.  Secondly absent
evidence from the Minister the Applicant has not shown that the Minister failed
to turn his mind to the issue which it is agreed was a relevant matter for him
to consider, namely the interest of the son Yves. Counsel for the Applicant
referred to what was said by the Full Court of this Court in Commissioner
for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR
576 at 591-592, where it was said that, “the decision-maker is required to
advise of any adverse conclusion which has been arrived at which would not
obviously be open on the known material. 
Subject to these qualifications however, a decision-maker is not obliged
to expose his or her mental processes or provision views to comment before
making the decision in question.”

52                 
Counsel for the Minister objected to the
Applicant raising at the hearing and after evidence had concluded, but without
any prior notice in the Application before the Court the natural justice
submission which I have just upheld. It was submitted that in any event the
submission did not sit easily with the evidence of Ms Sosa, that after the
decision had been made she had contacted the Applicant and asked him why he had
not had the Immigration Department contact her about the impact the deportation
would have on Yves and the rest of the family. 
She said that the Applicant had said that he did not want to trouble her
because at the time of the interview with Miss Speed, he had not thought the matter
to be that important but rather that it had been but a casual interview.  

53                 
With respect I do not believe that the matter
was treated lightly by the Applicant, nor for that matter by Ms Sosa.   I think the matter has to be seen against
the background of the criminal proceedings which were pending against the
Applicant and perhaps also the confusion that brought about the non sending of
the letter.

54                 
Further it was submitted (and the submission is
correct) that there was no factual basis for asserting that the Minister or his
officers were aware that the Applicant was labouring under a mistake.  All they knew was that no letter from Ms
Sousa had been submitted, and not the reason why this was the case.  That is, as I have said, true, but it does
not seem to me to be an answer to the submission.  The point is that the material in the
submission was such as to create a false impression, as I have found, adverse
to the Applicant.  The suggestion it
implied in it was also factually incorrect. 
It seems to me that natural justice requires a visa holder in this
position to be given the opportunity to correct what was in the
submission.  He did not have that
opportunity.  Had it been given to him
the Minister would have been able to make a decision on the real position,
rather than based upon a false implication.

55                 
In case there should be any prejudice to the
Minister being taken by surprise by the submission I afforded counsel for the
Minister the opportunity to make in writing such further submissions as he
might be advised.  Subsequently it was
indicated that the Minister did not wish to make further submissions.

Ground 7 – Proportionality and constitutionality -The Human Rights Argument

56                 
It is submitted that the Act in its application
to the present case is unconstitutional because it allows the executive to
impose a punishment upon a person who already has been punished for the
offence.  Alternatively it is submitted
that the Minister failed to take account of a relevant consideration namely the
proportionality of what was to happen to the Applicant as a consequence of an
adverse decision (ie removal), having regard to the conduct which the Applicant
had undertaken and for which he had already been punished.  

57                 
Reference was made to three decisions of the
European Court of Human Rights, namely Beldjoudi v France (1992) 14 EHRR
801; Nasri v France (1995) 21 EHRR 458 and Menhemi v France
(1997) 30 EHRR 739.  None of them have,
in my view, any relevance to administrative law in Australia.  However, as I have been referred to them it
is incumbent upon me to say at least something about them.   In Menhemi the applicant had been
born in France but was an Algerian National 
residing in Algeria at the time of the decision.  His parents and siblings resided in France
and he was the father of three children of French nationality.  He had been convicted of drug trafficking and
was deported.  The Lyon Court of Appeal
upheld an order that the Applicant be permanently excluded from French
territory on the ground that public policy considerations precluded the
presence within French territory of an alien engaged as a principal in the
offence of drug trafficking.  The
European Court of Human Rights upheld a decision of the Commission on Human
Rights that the decision of the Lyon Court be set aside.  The basis of the decision was Article 8 of
the European Convention on Human Rights. 
It was held that the power of the State to control public order and to
expel aliens interfered with the rights under the Convention for respect to
private and family life and to the extent that such Convention rights could
give way to matters such as public safety the deportation was disproportionate
to “the aims pursued”.

58                 
Beldjoudi 
involved an applicant who had been convicted of numerous criminal
offences for which he had served a total of ten years in gaol.  A deportation order was subsequently made
against him as he had been an Algerian by birth.   The order was set aside on the basis that it
would violate his right to family life and was not proportionate to the
legitimate aim of the power of deportation.

59                 
 Nasri
again involved an Algerian national who had been convicted of various offences
and against whom France had made a deportation order.  The order was held to violate various
articles of the Convention and it was not proportionate to the legitimate aim
pursued, that being presumably public order.

60                 
In my view these decisions do not assist the
Court.  Firstly they seek to apply
European Conventions, not even international conventions to which Australia is a
party.  More importantly, while it may be
said that there are equivalent international conventions to which Australia is
a party, these conventions are not part of the domestic law of Australia.  

61                 
Further, while I can understand an argument that
says that the Minister should take into account the fact that a person in the
position of the Applicant has been already punished by the criminal law, the
problem is that s 501 assumes that it will be appropriate and lawful for the
Minister to cancel a visa of a person convicted of certain offences where
sentences accumulate to two years or more thus rendering the person liable to
removal.  The legislature itself has
answered the issue of proportionality by legislating that cancellation may
follow conviction where the punishment for the one or multiple convictions is
two years or more.  It is then for the
Minister, and not for this Court, to determine whether the circumstances of the
case are such that a decision should be made to cancel the visa.  In my view the European cases have thus no
relevance in the present context.

62                 
As to the Constitutional issue, it too is
hopeless.  The submission is that s 501
in some way infringes Chapter 3 of the Constitution in that it involves the
Minister exercising judicial power.  In
my view, s 501 does not operate to permit the executive to impose a penalty for
the commission of an offence.  Rather it
permits the executive to determine whether it is or is not appropriate for a
person who has committed an offence of a prescribed kind to remain in
Australia.  The question what
non-citizens may remain in the country is a question conferred upon the
executive by legislation validly enacted under s 51(xix) of the Constitution: Chu
Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration (1992) 176 CLR 1 at 30-31.  It does not involve the exercise of judicial
power.

Conclusion

63                 
Accordingly, I order that the Minister be
prohibited from taking any further steps to give affect to his purported
decision under s 501(2) of the Act, made on 25 May 2002. I also order that that
decision be set aside and that the application be remitted to the Minister for
reconsideration according to law. The Minister is ordered to pay the
Applicant’s costs of the application.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

SPENDER J:

1                    
This is an appeal from orders made by a judge of
this court (R.D. Nicholson J) on 24 July 2003.  His Honour ordered that the respondent
Minister’s notice of objection to competency be upheld, that the application of
Mr Ngu be dismissed and that the applicant pay the respondent’s costs of
the application and the notice of objection to competency.  

2                    
Mr Ngu has filed a document headed
“Application” dated 12 August 2003.  In
paragraph 1 of that document Mr Ngu says:

‘I wish to appeal to the Full Federal Court of Western Australia
the decision of Justice J. Nicholson and the decision of Federal Court made on
24 July 2003.  



2.  Justice J. Nicholson’s
decision was handed down on 12 August 2003.’

 

3                    
The ground of the application is expressed to
be:  

‘This application is to appeal against the deportation order due
to the misleading information were given to the Immigration Department.  



4                    
The appellant filed submissions on
2 February 2004.  The written
submissions are somewhat extensive and number fourteen paragraphs.  I will return to that document shortly.  

5                    
The background to the appeal is as follows.  The appellant was born on 11 January 1974 and
is a citizen of Vietnam.  He arrived in
Australia on 10 June 1992 as a dependant of his mother who was granted a permit
to migrate to Australia to marry.  He was
granted permanent resident status on 21 July 1992.  

6                    
The appellant was convicted on 25 October 1996,
after a trial in the Supreme Court of Western Australia, on two counts of
unlawful wounding with intent and one count of unlawfully doing grievous bodily
harm.  The charges arose out of shooting
incidents on 15 April 1995.  A
deportation order was made against the appellant on 21 June 1998.  The appellant sought reconsideration of that
decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (“The AAT”).  The AAT decided on 11 August 1999 to
affirm the decision to deport the appellant.

7                    
The first application to the Federal Court was
an application dated 2 November 2001, made under s 39B of the Judiciary
Act 1903 (Cth), for judicial review of the decision of the AAT.  A notice of objection to competency was filed
on 7 December 2001 in relation to that application, based on the delay in
making the application beyond the time limit set by s 477 of the Migration
Act 1958 (Cth).  On 13 August 2002
the primary judge in the present appeal made orders upholding the respondent’s
objection to competency.  

8                    
A Full Court of the Federal Court allowed an
appeal against those orders and remitted to the primary judge the respondent’s
objection to competency.  The reason for
the making of the order by the Federal Court was that the first decision of the
primary judge had been made prior to the delivery by the High Court of the
judgment in Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth of Australia (2003) 195
ALR 24.  Accordingly, the primary judge
had not considered the question of whether the AAT had committed a
jurisdictional error in assessing whether the notice of objection to competency
should be upheld.

9                    
The notice of objection to competency remitted
to the primary judge by the Full Court and the substantive application were
heard together by the primary judge on 24 July 2003.  On that date his Honour made the orders
upholding the objection to competency and dismissing the application.  His Honour referred to the remittal by the
Full Court to him and the basis for it, and referred to the eleven stated
grounds in the outline of written submissions which had been lodged on behalf
of the applicant.  Before the primary
judge the present appellant had been assisted by a law student acting as a
McKenzie friend.  

10                 
After a careful consideration of the eleven
stated grounds in that outline, his Honour concluded that there was no
case for finding jurisdictional error in respect of any of the paragraphs in
that outline.  His Honour said:

‘The consequence of that conclusion is that the decision made by
the Tribunal is a privative clause decision under s 474 of the Migration Act 1958.  Consequently, the time limit under s 477 of
the Act applied.  The application before
the Court is therefore incompetent. 
Pursuant to s 477(2) of the Act the Court cannot allow the applicant to
lodge an application outside the time limit specified in s 477(1).  I therefore uphold the objection to
competency and consider that the application should be dismissed.’

 

His Honour then made the orders the subject of this
appeal.  

11                 
I have already referred to what was stated in
the initiating document of this appeal. 
The appellant has acted on his own behalf and it is obvious that he has
not had the benefit of any legal assistance. 
The fact of the matter, however, is that this is an appeal from the
decision of a judge of the Federal Court of Australia.   The Court’s role on this appeal is limited
to an assessment of whether the primary judge erred in law in concluding that
the decision of the AAT was not affected by jurisdictional error.

12                 
The notice of appeal filed by the appellant
acting in person does not contain any proper grounds or, indeed, any grounds at
all.  

13                 
The document which was filed by the appellant on
2 February 2004 and which canvasses a number of factual matters and aspects of
the decision of the AAT, makes self-serving statements as to the circumstances
of the offence on which a jury convicted the appellant and seeks to set up a
different version of events minimising the involvement and culpability of the
appellant.  In addition, those
submissions recite a number of complaints concerning his treatment both in prison
and in detention.  He also complains that
there were a number of errors concerning the proceedings before the AAT and in
respect of its conclusions, and there are also some matters of a personal kind
as to why he wishes not to be deported.

14                 
The submissions do not raise any issues which
might be arguable grounds of appeal. 
None of the material referred to in the written submissions can be
understood to raise any suggestion of error by the primary judge in his conclusion
that the decision of the AAT was not affected by jurisdictional error.  There are no proper grounds asserted in the
document initiating this appeal, nor are any arguable grounds of appeal raised
in the material before the court.

15                 
While it is understandable that a person for
whom English is a foreign language and who has not the benefit of legal advice
may not be able to appreciate what has to be established for a successful
appeal, this so-called appeal has been a serious waste of the court resources
and of public moneys.  In my view, there
are no arguable grounds of appeal and the appeal should be dismissed with
costs.

BRANSON J:   

16                 
I agree that there are no arguable grounds of
appeal before the Court and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.

STONE J:   

17                 
I agree that the appeal should be dismissed with
costs for the reasons given by the presiding judge and Branson J.

SPENDER J:   

18                 
The order of the Court is that the appeal is
dismissed with costs.

January 2002 (and its enclosures) from the applicant to the Court lodged with
the Court on 10 January 2002, stand as the application in this matter.  

2.         In relation to the form

was a decision made under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) and, if so,
whether it is reviewable under that Act, be waived.

Judge of this Court or until further order. 

5.         The respondent’s
decision is quashed. 

6.         The respondent pay the
applicant’s costs limited to such disbursements as the District Registrar consider
reasonable in relation to the preparation, filing and service of the

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

introduction 

1                    
In this matter the Court has to decide the
following questions.  First, whether a
handwritten letter dated 4 January 2002 lodged with the Court on 10 January
2002 is, or should be treated as, a valid application for judicial review of
the respondent’s decision, made on 29 November 2001 (notice of which was not
given to the applicant until 14 December 2001), to cancel the applicant’s
visa.  If not, what is the status, if
any, of a document subsequently filed by the applicant (on 31 October 2002)
headed “Application for Extension of Time to File and Serve Notice of Appeal”,
which the respondent says is an incompetent application for an order of
review?  The respondent has filed a
Notice of Objection to Competency challenging the Court’s jurisdiction to hear
that application as being out of time, and asserting that the Court has no
power to extend the relevant time – see s 477(1) and (2) of the Migration
Act 1958 (Cth) (“the Act”).  Another
question is whether the respondent’s decision was, as a matter of law, a
decision “made under” the Act for the purposes of Part 8?  That question involves consideration of a
claim for privilege or public interest immunity in respect of some information which
was not made available to the applicant. 
If the respondent’s decision was made under the Act, the final question
is whether any grounds for review have been made out, notwithstanding the
provisions of ss 474 and 476 of the Act?  


factual background

2                    
The applicant was born in Sri Lanka on 12 April
1961 and is a citizen of that country. 
He first arrived in Australia on 2 February 1989, entering on a student
visa.  The applicant has remained in
Australia since that date.  Since 21
February 1995 he has remained under a BF Transitional (permanent) visa for an
indefinite stay period.  He studied, but
did not complete, various courses at various institutions until imprisoned for
the criminal offences to which I now refer. 


3                    
On 31 July 1998 the applicant was found guilty
(having pleaded not guilty) of three counts of sexual penetration without
consent.  On 25 September 1998 he was
sentenced by the District Court of Western Australia for those three offences
to three terms of imprisonment, being four years on one count and two years
cumulatively on each of the other two counts, i.e. a sentence of eight years,
with a direction of eligibility for parole. 
The appellant appealed against the convictions to the Court of Criminal
Appeal.  On 11 October 2000 those appeals
were dismissed.  

4                    
On 18 September 2000 an officer of the
respondent’s Department gave written notice to the applicant that consideration
was being given to cancellation of his visa pursuant to s 501 of the
Act.  The cancellation grounds were set out
in that notice (by reference to various provisions of s 501, a copy of
which was enclosed with the notice) and the applicant was invited to submit any
comment which he believed relevant to the consideration of the issue of visa
cancellation.  The applicant responded to
that invitation by letter dated 11 October 2000.  

5                    
On 4 September 2001 another officer of the
respondent’s Department, Mr C Hutchinson, wrote to the applicant, referring to
the letter of 18 September 2000 and enclosing a copy of the then up-to-date
Minister’s Direction No 21.  All references
to Mr Hutchinson in these reasons are references to him as an officer in the
Cancellation Section of the respondent’s Department.  The letter invited the applicant to comment
“against the new Direction” and stated that if he did not respond by 25
September 2001 a decision on whether there were grounds to cancel his visa
would be made using information already held by the Department.  The letter was headed “NOTICE OF INTENTION TO
CONSIDER CANCELLING A VISA UNDER SUBSECTION 501(2) OF THE MIGRATION ACT
1958”.  The applicant acknowledged
receipt of that notice on 7 September 2001 and responded to the invitation by
letters dated 23 and 25 September 2001. 
He declined to provide a response to Mr Hutchinson but sent his
submissions direct to the respondent. 
The result was that the submissions were duly forwarded to Mr
Hutchinson. 

6                    
On or about 29 November 2001, Mr Hutchinson
submitted to the respondent a document which I shall call a “briefing minute”
seeking his decision about whether the applicant passed the character test
under s 501(6) and, if not, whether his visa should be cancelled pursuant
to s 501(2) of the Act. 

7                    
The briefing minute was in a familiar form.  It set out the applicant’s personal details,
the imposition of the prison sentences referred to above (including the remarks
of the sentencing judge) and what might be termed the migration history of the
applicant since he first entered Australia on 2 February 1989 as a
student.    

8                    
On 29 November 2001, the respondent cancelled
the applicant’s visa pursuant to s 501(2) of the Act.  On 14 December 2001, Mr Hutchinson forwarded
to the applicant notice of that cancellation in the form of a letter of that
date.  The letter contained this
statement: 

‘I enclose with this Notice:

·         
a copy of the decision record that sets out the
reasons for the decision (other than non disclosable information);’



9                    
The enclosure comprised the briefing minute (10
pages) and a page (page numbered 11) recording the respondent’s decision in
these terms:  

‘(d)      I reasonably
suspect that Mr Lloyd Nirmaleen FERNANDO does not pass the character
test and Mr Lloyd Nirmaleen FERNANDO has not satisfied me that he passes
the character test AND I have decided TO EXERCISE MY DISCRETION UNDER
SUBSECTION 501(2) OF THE ACT TO CANCEL THE VISA, so I hereby cancel the visa.



Philip Ruddock

Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs



Date:  29.11.01’



10                 
On 4 January 2002, the applicant sent a letter
to this Court which was received on 10 January 2002.  The letter was addressed to the “Registrar
(or Deputy Registrar)” of the Federal Court of Australia at 1 Victoria Avenue,
Perth.  The material parts of that letter
read as follows:  

‘Dear Registrar,



This is to inform you that I have to lodge my appeal against the
decision of Minister of Immigration on my Permanent Residency Visa.  AAT (Commonwealth) has not been able to find
provisions which would give it the jurisdiction in respect of the decision
which I need to have reviewed.  Therefore,
I am appeal to the Federal Courts on the grounds (or facts) produced in my
handwriting on the copy of the document I received on 21/12/01 from Perth
Immigration Department.  It was
handed over to me on 21/12/01 by the Supervisor who was on duty at K-Block
(ACACIA PRISON) on 21/12/01.’ (Emphasis added)



11                 
In the letter the applicant sought exemption
from fees, and a hearing date after April 2002. 
There were numerous enclosures in the letter, including correspondence
with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal from which it was clear that the
applicant had previously sought (a few days earlier) to have the Tribunal
review the Minister’s decision.  Another
enclosure (referred to in the passage from the letter set out above) was a copy
of the notice of visa cancellation on which the applicant had written the
grounds upon which he sought to challenge the respondent’s decision to cancel
his visa.  

Whether the applicant’s letter
should be treated as a valid application 

12                 
The letter, as an application, is defective in
form in a number of respects.  It does
not comply with Order 54A of the Federal Court Rules, nor is it in the form of
Form 5 or Form 56A, being the Order and forms relevant to applications under
s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).  However, the authorities show that, where
appropriate, the Court may waive the formal requirements.  

13                 
In my opinion, the applicant’s letter of 4
January 2002 sufficiently evidences the applicant’s wish to engage the
processes of this Court, that is, to invoke its jurisdiction to challenge the
respondent’s decision, as to be treated as an application under s 39B of
the Judiciary Act for judicial review of the respondent’s decision, and
for relief by way of a constitutional writ: see Yong v Minister for
Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 75 FCR 155, Sharif v
Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 278, Rishmawi
v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 611.  I think that the Court’s jurisdiction was
invoked when that letter and its enclosures were lodged on 10 January
2002.  

14                 
In the exercise of that jurisdiction and the
power conferred by Order 1 rule 8, I dispense with compliance on the
applicant’s part in relation to the form of his application with so much of the
Federal Court Rules as would prevent the Court from reviewing the respondent’s
decision for the purposes of ascertaining whether it was a decision made under
the Act and, if so, whether it was reviewable under the Act. 

15                 
In those circumstances the application is within
time.  The respondent, not being aware of
the applicant’s first approach to the Court, filed the Notice of Objection to
Competency referred to above.  I think
that the appropriate order in relation to that objection to competency is (as
the respondent submitted, should I form the view referred to in paragraph [13]
above) to dismiss it with no order as to costs. 
I will do so.  I now turn to the
challenges which were raised by the applicant in relation to the respondent’s
decision.  

was the respondent’s decision made within jurisdiction?

16                 
The applicant was not represented.  He lodged over 750 pages of submissions,
which he updated at various stages.  As a
result of that process of updating, I reviewed a total of well over 1000 pages
of his submissions.  Nearly all of them
were irrelevant to the matters which I have to decide.  The submissions included other documents such
as transcripts of evidence in the criminal proceedings and correspondence.  The applicant also tendered two affidavits.  

17                 
Much of the documentation submitted by the
applicant was repetitive.  Nearly all of
it went to the alleged injustice of his three convictions in the District Court
of Western Australia on 27 July 1998. 
The submissions included allegations of misconduct on the part of the
police, the prosecution, the trial judge, the various counsel who appeared for
the applicant, and the malfunction of the judicial system generally.  There were also numerous submissions
challenging factual matters set out or referred to in the briefing minute.  

18                 
I have examined the documentation with a view to
isolating any possible indications of jurisdictional error or other legal error
which might have the result that the respondent’s decision was not made under
the Act.  I was also assisted at trial in
that process, most fairly, by counsel for the respondent, Ms L B Price.  I should add, as a matter of fairness to Ms
Price, that she made it quite clear that she did not see it as part of her role
as counsel for respondent to make a case for the applicant. 

19                 
In my view, the only matters raised either by
the applicant or by counsel for the respondent were as follows.  First, the description of the three
convictions in the briefing paper submitted to the respondent.  Secondly, the applicant’s complaint that he
should have been granted an interview by the respondent or his Department
before the visa was cancelled, and thirdly whether there had been a denial of
natural justice in relation to what was said to be some “non-disclosable
information” which was placed before the respondent with the briefing minute in
respect of which the respondent claimed privilege or public interest
immunity.  I shall deal with those
matters in that order.  

20                 
The first mention of the applicant’s convictions
in the briefing minute was in the following terms: 

‘CONSIDERATION OF VISA CANCELLATION

 

Grounds

[2] Section 501(2) of the Migration
Act 1958 provides that the Minister may cancel a visa granted to a person if
the Minister reasonably suspects that the person does not pass the character
test (s 501(2)(a)), and the person does not satisfy the Minister that he
or she in fact passes the character test (s 501(2)(b)).  Under Section 501(6)(a), a person does not
pass the character test if he or she has a substantial criminal record within
the meaning of s 501(7).  



[3] Under s 501(7)(c), a person
is deemed to have a substantial criminal record if he or she has been sentenced
to a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more. 



[4] On 27 July 1998, Mr FERNANDO was
sentenced by the District Court of WA for the following s 501(7)(c)
applicable offences: 



      3
charges of SEXUAL PENETRATION WITHOUT     
imprisonment for 8 years

      CONSENT
AGGRAVATED. 



[5] Mr FERNANDO Appealed each
conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
Each application was dismissed on 11 October 2000.



It is open for you to find on the
above facts that there is a reasonable suspicion that Mr FERNANDO does not pass
the character test due to the fact that he has been sentenced to a term of
imprisonment of 12 months of more.’ 



21                 
Later in the briefing minute, there was the
following further reference to the convictions. 

‘[11] Mr FERNANDO has convictions for
the following offences: 



27 July 1998          SEXUAL PENETRATION WITHOUT        X3    
8 yrs imp.

                              CONSENT
AGGRAVATED,



[12] Mr FERNANDO appealed to the
Court of Criminal appeals (sic); his claims were dismissed on 11 October 2000.



A copy of Mr FERNANDO’s criminal
history is at Annex B.  



[13] The sentencing remarks of DCJ
Williams indicate the seriousness with which the court viewed the offences:



      In my view there are a number of aggravating
features in relation to this matter.  The
first is the particular vulnerability of the complainant due to her below
average intelligence and severe deficit in the area of social and communication
skills…



      In my view, the offender’s attitude was
predatory … he must have known at the time that she was intellectually
disadvantaged.  The variety of
penetration, one act of vaginal intercourse and one act of anal intercourse,
each in my view was a distinct act which would no doubt cause an accumulated
trauma to the complainant…



      In my view, these offences are serious and
I have come to the conclusion that the head sentence in relation to these
offences should be a term of imprisonment of 8 years.’



22                 
The essence of the applicant’s complaint is as
follows.  He says, quite rightly, that he
was originally charged with eight counts of aggravated sexual penetration
contrary to s 326 of the Criminal Code (WA) and one count of indecent
assault contrary to s 324 of that Code. 
After the committal proceedings those charges were withdrawn and
replaced with an indictment containing six counts.  He was acquitted on three of those counts by
the same jury which convicted him on the other three counts.  

23                 
The applicant’s point is that the counts upon
which he was convicted did not in their description or particulars include the
word “aggravated”.  

24                 
The source of the information reproduced above,
so I infer, was a computer print-out, provided to the respondent’s Department
by the Western Australian Police Service, headed “Court Outcomes”.  The computer print-out contained the notation
“AGGRAVA” after the description of the three charges.

25                 
The first reference in the briefing minute to
the applicant’s convictions was, again so I infer, to demonstrate that he had
been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more.  The second reference was in the context of
assessing the seriousness and nature of the conduct.  

26                 
The aggravating features of these crimes were
reflected in the sentencing remarks of Williams DCJ, a portion of which was
extracted in the briefing minute and is set out above.  

27                 
In my view, the applicant has not demonstrated
that the inclusion of the word “aggravated” in the description of the crimes
for which he was convicted has led the Minister into jurisdictional error
affecting his decision to cancel the visa. 
In particular, the applicant has not demonstrated that the respondent
took into account aggravation as an irrelevant consideration in making his
decision.  

28                 
I do not think that there is any substance in
the applicant’s complaint that the respondent or his delegate should have
granted him an interview before cancelling the visa.  He was entitled, of course, to procedural
fairness and he was given two opportunities (both of which he took up) to make
submissions.  The applicant’s
submissions, on each occasion, were extensive. 
His first set of submissions extended to some 25 pages.  The second set of submissions comprised about
77 pages.  

29                 
Sometimes an interview is granted before a visa
is cancelled, see for example the facts in M238/2002 v Ruddock [2003]
FCA 936.  The authorities show that the
precise content of the requirements of procedural fairness may vary from case
to case.  In all the circumstances, in my
view, procedural fairness did not require the respondent to grant the applicant
in this case an interview before deciding to cancel the visa.  Subject to the matter referred to immediately
below, he had a fair opportunity to present information and argument against the
cancellation of his visa.  

30                 
The next matter is the use of what was said to
be some “non-disclosable information”. 
That information is contained in four pages, referred to in the briefing
minute variously as “Annex L” or “Annex K”. 
I shall refer to is as “Annexure L”. 


31                 
At the hearing Ms Price drew my attention to the
existence of Annexure L.  This was in the
context of a discussion about some fairly recent authority on the content of
procedural fairness in relation to non-disclosable information at the stage
before a visa cancellation decision is made. 
There was then the following exchange with counsel:  

‘I suppose if the applicant were represented that’s a potential
ground that might have been raised which leads … to the question of whether the
court should look at the annexure, in this case annexure L, to decide whether
the substance of that should have been put to the – if Merkel J is right
whether the substance of that should have been put to the applicant.  



MS PRICE:  Yes.



And is annexure L available? 



MS PRICE:  It is your
Honour.  We do claim privilege in respect
of it and my instructions are we are happy to let you have a look at it for the
purpose of deciding it but we do claim privilege.



Yes.  I think the course I
will take will be to avail myself of that opportunity to read annexure L but on
the basis that privilege is claimed for it. 




MS PRICE:  Yes, and
certainly in our submission it clearly falls within the definition of non
disclosable information in the [A]ct. 

…



I should perhaps know the basis of the privilege.  Can you disclose the grounds of the privilege
without breaching it?  



MS PRICE:  I don’t think I
could in this case, your Honour.



I will have to glean the basis from examining it.



MS PRICE:  Yes.  I think it will be obvious once you examine
the material.’



32                 
The applicant sought access to Annexure L.  I informed him that I had to decide the
respondent’s claim of privilege, that I would make a ruling about the privilege
claimed as part of my judgment and that whether he had the right to see
Annexure L would be part of my reasons for judgment.  The applicant made it clear that if
unsubstantiated allegations had been made, he would like to respond. 

33                 
I have read Annexure L.  It comprises two documents, but I shall refer
to it as one document.  To decide the
respondent’s claim I turn to s 130 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth),
which largely reflects the common law on public interest immunity – see the
Australian Law Commission Report No 26 on Evidence, Vol 1 paragraphs
864-866.  

34                 
Section 130(1) provides: 

‘If the public interest in admitting into evidence information
or a document that relates to matters of state is outweighed by the public
interest in preserving secrecy or confidentiality in relation to the
information or document, the court may direct that the information or document
not be adduced as evidence.’



35                 
Section 130(4) lists a number of circumstances
in which information or a document may be taken to relate to matters of
State.  But the list is not an exhaustive
one.  In my view, the information in
Annexure L and Annexure L itself relate to “matters of state” within the
meaning of that expression in s 130(1). 
First, because adducing Annexure L as evidence would disclose or enable
the applicant to ascertain the existence or identity of a confidential source
of information relating to the administration of a law of the Commonwealth
(namely the Act) – see s 130(4)(e). 
Secondly, I consider the adducing of such evidence would prejudice the
proper functioning of the government of the Commonwealth, in this case the respondent’s
Department – s 130(4)(f).  The
respondent’s Department has, of course, a legitimate interest in obtaining
confidential information relevant to its functions.  Unless that information remains confidential
there is a risk that the sources will dry up. 
The situation is analogous to that in D v National Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children [1978] AC 171.  

36                 
The authorities show that the balancing test in
s 130(1) requires the Court to:  

‘… identify with precision, and then balance fairly and
sensibly, the two competing public interests to which sub-section (1) makes
reference.’  [Attorney-General v Kaddour & Turkmani
[2001] NSWCCA 456 at [15].  

 

37                 
The authorities also show that the public
interest in admitting the evidence is based on the assumption that all relevant
and otherwise admissible evidence should be admitted in order to achieve
justice in the case at hand: Sankey v Whitlam (1978) 142 CLR 1.  

38                 
Section 130(5) requires the Court to take into
account certain matters for the purposes of subs (1), but on the express basis
that the Court may take into account other matters as well.  Those matters which are applicable in this
case can be found in sub-paragraphs (a), (c), (d) and (e).  I exclude sub-paragraphs (b) and (f) because
this is not a criminal proceeding.  

39                 
Sub-paragraph s 130(5)(a) requires me to
take into account the importance of Annexure L in the proceedings.  I would assess Annexure L as being extremely
important in this proceeding.  It might
well mean the difference between success and failure on the applicant’s
part.  I make that assessment in
conjunction with taking into account the matters referred to in sub-paragraph
(c), treating the applicant’s application as a cause of action and the subject
matter of the proceeding as being an application for a constitutional writ to
quash the respondent’s decision.  

40                 
I also take into account the likely effect of
adducing Annexure L into evidence – see sub-paragraph (d).  One likely effect, which I have already
mentioned, would be to enhance the applicant’s prospects of successfully
challenging the respondent’s decision as having been made without
jurisdiction.  Another effect might be to
put a person at risk of harm.  A further
effect would be to deter members of the public providing important information
to those responsible for enforcing the laws of this country.  But I also take into account that this Court
has power, see for example s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act
1976 (Cth), to restrict publication of Annexure L or any part of it and
further to restrict access to Annexure L. 
Access could be restricted to the respondent and its advisers (who
already have access) and to Judges of this Court.  

41                 
There is no evidence that the substance of
Annexure L has already been published – see sub-paragraph (e).  

42                 
In my view, the public interest in admitting
Annexure L into evidence i.e. that in the administration of justice all
relevant evidence should be admitted to enable the Court to get to the truth of
the matter, outweighs the public interest in preserving secrecy or
confidentiality in relation to Annexure L. 
I decline to make the direction contemplated by s 130(1) and
(implicitly) sought by the respondent.  

43                 
That, of course, does not mean that Annexure L
automatically is admitted into evidence. 
However, the respondent tendered an affidavit from Mr Hutchinson
because, so I was told, it included the briefing minute and the respondent’s
decision and it was thought to be appropriate that a copy should be before the
Court as having come from the respondent. 
Furthermore, the respondent prepared for the Court the usual book of
relevant documents (“the Court Book”) which contained many relevant documents
but, unsurprisingly, not Annexure L.  

44                 
Although neither party has formally tendered
Annexure L, I consider it necessary for the disposition of this case to have
Annexure L adduced in evidence.  I shall
exercise whatever powers I have in that regard to order that Annexure L (a copy
of which was, at my request, passed up by counsel for the respondent) be
admitted into evidence.  An order was
made at the hearing that Annexure L be placed in an envelope, sealed and not
unsealed (other than by me) until further order.  It will be returned to that envelope and, as
foreshadowed above, an order will be made restricting access to it to Judges of
this Court until further order.  

45                 
The next question is whether evidence now before
the Court shows, on the balance of probabilities, that the respondent denied
procedural fairness to the applicant by not disclosing the substance of
Annexure L to him.  

46                 
First, I consider that the briefing minute sets
out the reasons for the respondent’s decision to cancel the appellant’s
visa.  I do so for reasons which are very
similar to my reasons for taking that course in a recent Full Court matter of Long
v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003]
FCAFC 218 at [44]-[52].  The other
members of the Court, Merkel and Hely JJ agreed with those reasons.  

47                 
To start with, as mentioned at paragraph [8] above,
Mr Hutchinson’s letter of 14 December 2001 to the applicant – the notice of
cancellation – stated that the decision record “… sets out the reasons for the
decision, (other than non-disclosable information)”.  That, in my view, is some evidence also that
the information in Annexure L itself was part of the reasons for the
decision.  

48                 
As in Long, the briefing paper in this
matter, although carefully worded in terms of “it is open for you to find …”
and the like, pointed the respondent quite firmly in the one direction i.e.
towards cancellation of the visa.  

49                 
The respondent’s decision was consistent with
the analysis and recommendations made in the briefing minute.  The respondent indicated his decision without
comment – both factors which Stone J regarded as important in Javillonar v
Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) FCR 311.  

50                 
There is no evidence from the respondent to deny
that the briefing minute set out his reasons for the decision.  Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, I conclude
that the briefing minute sets out the reasons for the respondent’s decision to
cancel the applicant’s visa.  

51                 
There were three references to Annexure L in the
briefing minute.  First, under the
heading “Protection of the Australian Community (a) seriousness and nature of
conduct” there was the following: 

‘[16]   Additional
information of relevance is set out in information that is “Non-disclosable
Information” for the purposes of section 501G(1)(e) of the Act.  “Non-disclosable Information” may not be
released to the applicant.  The
“Non-disclosable Information” is set out at Annex L.’ 

 

52                 
Secondly, under sub-paragraph (b) of the heading
“Protection of the Australian Community”, immediately after the observation
that it was open for the respondent to find that the applicant was at a high
risk of recidivism, there was precisely the same reference (except for a
different paragraph number) to Annex L which I have set out above.  

53                 
Finally, under the heading “EVIDENCE OR OTHER
MATERIAL ON WHICH FACTS/BACKGROUND INFORMATION IS BASED”, Mr Hutchinson as
author of the briefing minute said this: 

‘[51]   In support of the
above findings I had regard to the following material: … Annex K – Non
disclosable information of relevance.’



54                 
I was informed that Annexure L appeared to be
the only non-disclosable information involved in this case.  Accordingly I infer that the reference to
Annex K is in fact a reference to Annex L. 


55                 
My assessment on reading Annexure L was that it
contained information which was adverse to the applicant, that was credible,
relevant and significant to the decision to be made – Kioa v West (1985)
159 CLR 550 at 629.  In case I am found
to be wrong in my reasoning below, I shall not give any further details of its
contents.

56                 
On the current state of authorities, I do not
think that it is relevant that Annexure L may contain “non-disclosable
information”.  The matter under
consideration is the content of the respondent’s obligation to extend
procedural fairness to the applicant before he made the cancellation
decision.  Section 501G(1)(e) relevantly
provided that if a decision was made under s 501(2) to cancel a visa that
had been granted to a person, the Minister must give the person a written
notice that sets out the reasons (other than non-disclosable information) for
the decision.  I am prepared to work on
the assumption that Annexure L contained non-disclosable information because,
in terms of the definition of that expression in s 5(b) of the Act, its
disclosure would, in the respondent’s opinion, be contrary to the public
interest for a reason which could form the basis for a claim by the Crown in
right of the Commonwealth in judicial proceedings.  

57                 
In WAFG v Minister for Immigration and
Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 93, R D Nicholson
J held that it was not a breach of the rules of natural justice when the
annexure in that case, which his Honour was satisfied constituted
non-disclosable information, was not disclosed to a person who would otherwise
have been entitled to be provided with that information.  But his Honour was not called on to consider
what information should have been provided to that person before the
cancellation decision was made.  On appeal
to a Full Court of this Court, WAFG was allowed to raise that
matter.  The appeal was allowed by
consent on 29 August 2003.  

58                 
In the meantime, WAFG was distinguished
in two first instance decisions of this Court on the basis to which I have
referred immediately above.  Those
decisions were Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and
Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 437 and Ball v Minister
for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA
699.  Also of some assistance in this
area is an earlier unreported decision of Lehane J, Gilson v Minister for
Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, 21 July 1997 BC9703148, referred to
by Merkel J in VEAL at [31].  

59                 
I accept the sensitivity of the information in
Annexure L and the need to protect its source. 
But my assessment is that the public interests to which I have earlier
referred could have been, and could still be, protected by preparing a summary
of the essential information contained in that document.  That course was adopted in a matter which
resulted in a series of decisions in this Court culminating in the Full Court
decision of Chu v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1997) 78
FCR 314.  That information could be
conveyed to the applicant in such a manner as not to identify the source of the
information or otherwise to place any person at risk.  

60                 
In my view, by failing to take reasonable steps
to bring to the applicant’s attention the substance of the information
contained in Annexure L, the respondent denied the applicant procedural
fairness.  The information in Annexure L
was adverse to the applicant as it related not only to whether he passed the
character test but was also relevant to the exercise of the respondent’s
discretion to allow the applicant to remain in Australia despite having failed
the character test.  He should have had
an opportunity to comment upon the substance of that information and put to the
respondent submissions and information in response before his visa was
cancelled.   

61                 
In my opinion, the breach of procedural fairness
in this matter has been such as to amount to jurisdictional error to the extent
that the respondent’s decision to cancel the applicant’s visa cannot be said to
have been made under the Act. 
Accordingly it was not a privative clause decision within the meaning of
s 474.  The relevant principles to
be applied are explained by the High Court of Australia in cases such as Re
Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala (2000) 204 CLR 82, Re Minister
for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Miah (2001) 206 CLR 57;
Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30; Plaintiff S157/2002 v
Commonwealth of Australia [2003] HCA 2 and Re Minister for Immigration
and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6.  

62                 
In those circumstances, it is not necessary to
consider any other possible grounds of review. 


Conclusion 

63                 
For the foregoing reasons the application will
be allowed and the respondent’s decision will be quashed.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

1                    
This matter is remitted to the Court from the
Full Court on the question of the respondent's objection to competency,
specifically the Full Court held that the applicant should have the
opportunity of making a case before the primary judge of whether there had been
a lack of procedural fairness in the hearing before him giving rise to a
jurisdictional ground of review.  The
Full Court was unable to conclude that the applicant had no prospect of
succeeding on such a ground and therefore adopted that course.

2                    
In the reasons delivered on 13 August 2002 I set
out the background circumstances relating to the applicant and other matters
relevant to a consideration of the objection to competency.  I rely on that statement, save that in
par 8 in the second line the reference to a letter sent to him dated
21 June 2000 should read ‘a letter sent by him dated 21 June 2000’.

3                    
The applicant has been assisted by a law student
acting as McKenzie Friend who has helpfully compiled an outline of submissions
stating what the applicant wanted to bring to the attention of the Court in relation
to the fairness of the hearing before him. 
There are 11 stated grounds in that outline.  The first referred to documents which he has
from his fiancée’s family, the Vietnamese community and others, in relation to
the issue of whether he poses a danger to the community.  I have ruled in the course of this hearing
that those documents are not relevant to the exercise of jurisdiction which the
Court is now required to carry out.

4                    
The second ground alleged that the applicant
should be afforded time to raise some money for his fiancée and parents and to
see them.  That raises the possibility of
the applicant being freed from detention, and I have indicated that I will deal
with that as a separate matter subsequently to the delivery of these reasons so
far as I can deal with it at all today.

5                    
Thirdly, in the outline it was stated that at
the hearing no one assisted the applicant with his defence and the only person
who aided him was a friend who acted as an interpreter.  I have received detailed and helpful submissions
on that from the respondent and I accept the correctness of those
submissions.  The applicant's submission
is not factually correct, as reference to the appeal book discloses.  At the hearing before the Tribunal, the
applicant was represented by a friend, and was assisted by several different
official interpreters who were employed to translate between the English,
Vietnamese and Cantonese languages.  It
was stated in the reasons of the Tribunal, and not disputed, that the applicant
who could follow simple English requested that the proceedings be translated
into Cantonese language, and this was done. 
There also were independent interpreter services provided from the
friend who was assisting the applicant.

6                    
Furthermore, as reference to the reasons of the
Tribunal bears out, the friend made extensive submissions to the Tribunal, both
generally and in relation to the application of the ministerial general
direction number 9.  There is, therefore,
no factual foundation from which to conclude that the absence of representation
for the applicant, in the way he contended in par 3 of his outline of
submissions, gave rise to any jurisdictional error.  Furthermore, as a matter of law there is
authority to the effect that the absence of such representation cannot give
rise to that position.  I refer to Vo
Tuan Kiet v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA
706 and Van Cuong Nguyen v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural
Affairs (No 2) (2000) 115 A Crim R 324 at [6]-[7].  Furthermore, there was no factual foundation
to find any breach of the requirements of s 39 of the Administrative
Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth).

7                    
The fourth ground raised in the applicant's
outline repeated to some degree that his friend had acted as an interpreter, a
matter I have found is not borne out.  To
that was added a claim that the friend was subjected to a number of questions
which the applicant did not like.  That,
however, does not give rise to any jurisdictional error.  The fact that the applicant could not speak
or write English gives no rise to jurisdictional error, the extensive scope of
interpreter services provided to him have already been referred to.  It was also said in par 4 that there
were repeated questions to the applicant about his past offences.  That, however, was something which his case
gave rise to and no unfairness and jurisdictional error could possibly arise
from repetition of questions directed to a relevant issue, provided no
harassment was involved, and there is no evidence of that.

8                    
The fifth paragraph in the applicant's outline
of submissions draws the Court's attention to the fact that his mother was
sitting at the back of the court and was not understanding, he says, what was
going on.  No jurisdictional error arises
from that.

9                    
Paragraphs 6 to 11 raise matters addressing
the merits of the applicant's case, namely the situation of his parents;
particularly the illness of his father, the position concerning his fiancée and
what would happen to them if they were returned to Vietnam.  Those are matters that are not relevant
before this Court.  The Court is
reviewing the decision of the Tribunal. 
It is apparent from reference to the reasons of the Tribunal that all of
these matters were taken into account. 
The Tribunal recognised it had a discretion and it listed and considered
all of the factors relevant to that discretion, including the issues raised in
these paragraphs so far as they then existed. 
There is therefore no case for finding jurisdictional error as a
consequence of pars 6 to 11 of the applicant's outline.

10                 
The consequence of that conclusion is that the
decision made by the Tribunal is a privative clause decision under s 474
of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (‘the Act’).  Consequently, the time limit under s 477
of the Act applied.  The application
before the Court is therefore incompetent. 
Pursuant to s 477(2) of the Act the Court cannot allow the
applicant to lodge an application outside the time limit specified in
s 477(1).  I therefore uphold the
objection to competency and consider that the application should be dismissed.

11                 
I add that, in any event, for the application to
have succeeded under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1906 (Cth) the
applicant would have needed to establish jurisdictional error.  No case for jurisdictional error has been
made out.  Even if the application had
been open for consideration and the notice of objection to competency had not
succeeded, the application would have been required to be dismissed.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT ON CONSENT ORDER

Introduction

1                    
On 19 May 2003 I made an order that certiorari
issue directed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous
Affairs to quash a decision made by him on 14 January 2003 to cancel Mr
Sinclair’s visa on the basis that having had a sentence of imprisonment of
eighteen months imposed upon him in March 2001 he did not pass the character
test under s 501 of the Act.  The consent
order was made on the basis of the Minister’s concession as to error in the
departmental submission upon which he based his decision to cancel Mr
Sinclair’s visa.  I was satisfied that
the proposed consent order was within power and appropriate.  I now publish my reasons for so concluding.

Factual History

2                    
 Callum
Ross Sinclair is a citizen of the United Kingdom and a British subject.  He was born in Scotland on 20 August
1981.  At the age of twelve weeks he was
adopted in Scotland by Stewart Ross Sinclair and Elsie Joy Sinclair, both
Australian citizens.  They returned  to live permanently in Australia in 1983
about two years after the adoption.  They
have brought Mr Sinclair up as a member of the Australian community.  He has not, however, taken out Australian
citizenship.  His arrival in Australia
was authorised by a visa Class 1021 (Migrant Visa).  He has not left Australia since he came here
as a child in 1983.

3                    
On 14 January 2003 the Minister for Immigration
and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs made a decision under subs 501(2) of
the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) to cancel Mr Sinclair’s visa.  The basis for this decision was that Mr
Sinclair did not pass the character test specified in s 501.  

4                    
On 13 March 2001 Mr Sinclair had been convicted
in the Taree Local Court on one count of larceny and on a number of counts of
breaking and entering buildings.  The
transcript of proceedings on that day indicates that he had been in custody on
remand since 6 December 2000.  He was
sentenced to three months and seven days in respect of the larceny conviction,
backdated to 6 December 2000.  This meant
that his term of imprisonment in respect of that conviction expired upon the
day that the sentence was imposed.  He was
then sentenced for a number of offences of breaking and entering.  Only one sentence was imposed and was
expressed by the sentencing magistrate to be a form of “global
sentencing”.  This was a sentence of
eighteen months imprisonment backdated to 6 December 2000 with a non-parole
period of three months and seven days. 
This allowed for Mr Sinclair’s release on parole in respect of these
offences on the date upon which the sentence was imposed.  Conditions were attached relating to
psychiatric assessment, treatment and counselling.  

5                    
The submission from the Department of Immigration
and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs upon which the Minister made his
decision to cancel Mr Sinclair’s visa contained the following passage: 

“[6]    On 13 March 2001, Mr Sinclair was sentenced
by Taree Local Court for the following s 501(7)(c) applicable offence: 



            .           Break
and Enter Building and  Commit
Felony.  Sentenced to 18 months
imprisonment with a non parole period of three months, seven days. 



[7]      Further evidence that Mr Sinclair does not
pass the character test is set out in information that is ‘protected’ for the
purposes of s 503A of the Act (protected information).  Protected information may not be released to
the applicant or to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), unless you
permit the disclosure. 



[8]      It is open for you to find on the above
facts that there is a reasonable suspicion that Mr Sinclair does not pass the
character test due to the fact that he has been sentenced to a term of
imprisonment of 12 months or more.’





The Proceedings in this Court

6                    
Following the Minister’s cancellation of Mr
Sinclair’s visa an application was filed on 14 March 2003 for prerogative and
injunctive relief in relation to the Minister’s decision and for review of that
decision under s 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act
1977. 

7                    
The first ground of the application was that Mr
Sinclair, having been absorbed into the Australia community, is no longer a
migrant and is not and never has been an alien within the meaning of s 51(xix)
of the Constitution.  On that basis he
was said to fall outside the Minister’s power to cancel his visa, hold him in
detention and remove him from Australia. 
The other ground of the application related to the Minister’s failure to
provide reasons for his decision to cancel the visa as required by s 501G(1)(e).  Directions were made to progress the matter
to trial.  A motion was filed on 8 May
2003 returnable on 19 May 2003 seeking interlocutory relief by way of the
release of Mr Sinclair from immigration detention pending the hearing of the
application and to restrain the Minister from removing him from Australia
pending that hearing.  In the event, on
19 May 2003, counsel for the parties informed the Court that the Minister would
consent to an order quashing his decision. 

8                    
The consent order was based upon the proposition
that the submission upon which the Minister acted in cancelling Mr Sinclair’s
visa was in error in so far as it submitted that Mr Sinclair did not meet the
character test because he had a substantial criminal record. 

Statutory Framework

9                    
Section 501 empowers the Minister to cancel
visas on character grounds and relevantly provides: 

‘501(2)  The Minister may
cancel a visa that has been granted to a person if: 



(a)       the Minister reasonably suspects that the
person does not pass the character test; and 

(b)       the person does not satisfy the Minister
that the person passes the character test.’





The character test is defined by reference to the grounds
upon which a person is said not to pass it (s 501(6)).  One of those grounds, which is a sufficient
ground, is that “the person has a substantial criminal record (as defined in
subsection (7))”.  That is the ground
relied upon in the submissions to the Minister in the present case. 

10                 
Subsection 501(7) provides: 

‘(7)  For the purposes of
the character test, a person has a substantial criminal record if: 

…



(c)        the person has been sentenced to a term
of imprisonment of 12 months or more; or

(d)       the person has been sentenced to 2 or
more terms of imprisonment (whether on one or more occasions), where the total
of those terms is 2 years or more; …’





Whether the Consent Order is Within Power and Appropriate

11                 
The departmental submission to the Minister
relied upon the sentence imposed upon Mr Sinclair on 13 March 2001 as a
sentence for a term of imprisonment of twelve months or more within the meaning
of s 501(7)(c).  Counsel for the Minister
in explaining his client’s consent to a quashing order, said that the Minister
takes the view that the term of imprisonment of twelve months referred to in s
501(7)(c) is a term of imprisonment in respect of a single offence.  Counsel’s instructions were that the term of
eighteen months imprisonment imposed at the Taree Court was really in respect
of nine separate breaking and entering offences.  The Minister’s decision therefore proceeded
on a false factual premise as the submission gave the impression that the
sentence imposed upon Mr Sinclair was in respect of a single offence.  

12                 
In the circumstances, and having regard to the
Minister’s concession, it appears that a jurisdictional fact upon which he
relied to exercise the power under s 501 did not exist.  The case indicates jurisdictional error and
on the basis of the decision of the High Court in Plaintiff S157 v The
Commonwealth (2003) 195 ALR 24 
prerogative relief is available. 
The quashing of the Minister’s decision by certiorari is within power
and appropriate, matters of which the Court has to be satisfied before making
the order proposed – see Kovalev v Minister for Immigration and
Multicultural Affairs (2000) 100 FCR 323 at 329; Sanchez v Minister for
Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 265; Yulianti v
Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 142; cf the
discussion in Xiao v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs
(2001) 109 FCR 129 at 132-136.

13                 
For the reasons outlined above, I was prepared
to order certiorari to quash the respondent’s decision.

  REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

  1                     This is an application for declaratory and injunctive relief by Mr Ken Ha (also known as Ken Ha Khanh Phong ), a prisoner currently serving a lengthy sentence of imprisonment for an offence involving the importation of a commercial quantity of heroin into Australia.  The application is brought against the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (“the Commissioner”). 

  2                     The applicant was not initially represented when he filed his application with the Court.  As a result, that application is seriously defective in form.  Nonetheless, the issues which the applicant seeks to raise have emerged clearly during the course of the hearing, and the respondent, very properly, has not raised any objections to the form of the initiating document.

  3                     In substance, the applicant claims that the Commissioner should be restrained from proceeding to collect a DNA sample from him.  The power to collect that sample exists by virtue of recent amendments to the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (“the Crimes Act”), and in particular, the introduction of Div 6A Pt 1D.  Those amendments enable officers of the Australian Federal Police to collect samples of DNA from persons who are serving sentences following conviction of specific Commonwealth offences.  The applicant contends that, to permit a DNA sample to be taken from him, would contravene the agreement between Australia and Hong Kong pursuant to which he was surrendered to this country. 

  Background

  4                     The applicant was surrendered to Australia by Hong Kong in December 1997.  The basis upon which his extradition was sought was that he would be tried for an offence arising out of the importation into Australia of a commercial quantity of heroin.  The offence was said to have been committed between 1 August 1995 and 8 December 1995. 

  5                     The order for surrender specified that he would be charged with being knowingly concerned in the importation of a prohibited import, or counselling or procuring the importation of a prohibited import.  Both the offence of being knowingly concerned, and the offence of counselling or procuring, are contained in s 233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). 

  6                     When the applicant’s surrender was ordered, Australia gave what is commonly described as a “specialty undertaking” that if he were extradited to this country he would:

  “… only be proceeded against for the offence [sic] in respect of which his return is requested or for any lesser offence proved by the facts proved before the court of committal.”

  7                     The applicant arrived in Australia on 12 December 1997, and has been in custody since that date.  On 30 July 1998 he was committed to stand trial on one charge of being knowingly concerned in the importation into Australia of a prohibited import, namely heroin, contrary to s 233B(1)(d).  He pleaded not guilty.  For reasons which were never explained before this Court, he was presented for trial in the County Court, at Melbourne, on an indictment alleging that between 14 September 1995 and 8 December 1995 he imported into Australia a quantity of heroin, being not less than a commercial quantity.  He was not charged with being knowingly concerned, or with having counselled or procured that importation. 

  8                     On 11 June 1999 the applicant was convicted, and subsequently sentenced to a term of 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years.  On 29 January 2001 the Victorian Court of Appeal quashed his conviction and ordered that there be a new trial: R v Ken Ha Khanh Phong (unreported, Supreme Court of Victoria – Court of Appeal, Phillips CJ, Brooking and Ormiston JJA, 29 January 2001). 

  9                     On 5 April 2001 the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions filed over a fresh indictment, this time alleging that the applicant had been knowingly concerned in the relevant importation.  On 5 November 2001 the applicant was convicted of that offence.  He was subsequently sentenced to a term of 15 years and 3 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years and 3 months. 

  10                  On 30 November 2001 the applicant filed an application for leave to appeal against both his conviction and sentence.  That application has not yet been heard, and I was informed that it was unlikely to be heard before March 2003. 

  The request for a DNA sample

  11                  By letter dated 13 May 2002, received by the applicant on or about 8 July 2002, Federal Agent J M M Cheshire wrote to the applicant, relevantly, in the following terms:

  “Request for a person who is a convicted serious offender to consent to the carrying out of a forensic procedure in accordance with Division 6A Part 1D of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914

  Dear Mr Ha,

  I am Federal Agent James CHESHIRE, a member of the Australian Federal Police.

  Having given due consideration to the matters contained within Division 6A of Part 1D of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914, I am now required by the provisions of section 23XWJ of the Act to provide you with certain information.  After I provide you with that information, you will be requested to consent to the carrying out of what is described as a forensic procedure.

  Accordingly I offer the following information in compliance with those provisions:

  a)                 The forensic procedure for which this consent is requested is for the purpose of obtaining a sample for analysis in order to provide your DNA profile to CrimTrac.

  b)                 This matter is in relation to an offence contrary to Section 233B(1)(B) [sic] of the Customs Act 1901.

  c)                  The forensic procedure required is a buccal swab which involves the taking a sample of your saliva, with a sterile cotton bud.

  d)                 The sample taken from you may provide evidence against you which may be used in a court of law.

  e)                  The proposed forensic procedure will be carried out by an appropriately qualified person as required by the Act.

  f)                   You may refuse to consent to the carrying out of the forensic procedure.

  g)                 If you do not give consent, or withdraw that consent:

  a.      where the procedure involved the taking of fingerprints or a hair sample, another police officer may authorise the taking of the fingerprints or the hair sample; and/or

  b.      where the procedure involves the taking of a sample of blood or a buccal swab, an application may be made to a Magistrate to authorise such a procedure.

  h)                 …

  i)                   If you refuse or fail to consent, or withdraw your consent after initially having given it, evidence of that refusal, failure or withdrawal cannot be used against you in court proceedings, unless an allegation is made that police investigating this matter acted contrary to the law in conducting their investigations.

  j)                   …

  k)                 …

  l)                   Information obtained from any analysis of forensic material obtained from this forensic procedure may be placed on the DNA database and used for the purposes of a criminal investigation or any other purpose that the system is established for.

  m)               You may give informed consent to a forensic procedure after a constable:

  a.      requests you to consent to the forensic procedure under section 23XWH; and

  b.      informs you about the forensic procedure in accordance with section 23XWJ; and

  c.       gives you the opportunity to communicate, or attempt to communicate, with a legal practitioner of your choice.

  Signature of this form does not indicate your consent or otherwise to the forensic procedure, it is to acknowledge that I have given you this information to assist in your considerations on the matter.  You will know be given a period of time to seek legal advice should you so desire and to consider this request.  A copy of this form will be made available to you as soon as practicable.”

  12                  Enclosed with the letter was a document entitled “DNA Samples and the Law – A Guide for Commonwealth Prisoners”.  That document stated, inter alia:

  “Information obtained from a sample will be retained on a national DNA database.  This information may assist police to resolve serious crime and may also aid in the detection of future offenders.  Likewise, a recorded DNA sample can be utilised to eliminate a suspect for a particular offence.”

  13                  The document also set out a short précis of the rights of prisoners to decline consent to the carrying out of the forensic procedure.  It referred, in particular, to s 23XWP(4) of the Crimes Act which states:

  “An offender ordered to permit the carrying out of a forensic procedure is guilty of an offence if the offender, without reasonable excuse, refuses or fails to permit the forensic procedure to be carried out.”

  The document did not refer to the maximum penalty for a contravention of that section which is imprisonment for 12 months. 

  The application to this Court

  14                  On 11 July 2002 the applicant appeared in person before Heerey J, as duty judge, seeking an interlocutory injunction restraining the Australian Federal Police from taking the DNA sample from him.  His Honour ordered that, until the hearing and determination of this application, or further order, the respondent be restrained from taking any steps pursuant to Div 6A of Pt 1D of the Crimes Act to carry out forensic procedures in respect of the applicant.

  The competing submissions before this Court

  15                  The applicant was represented at the hearing of this matter by pro bono counsel, Mr WB Zichy-Woinarski QC with Mr G Connellan.  Mr Woinarski advanced two submissions on behalf of his client.  The first and primary submission, put simply, was that the proposed taking of a DNA sample from the applicant would violate what is commonly known as “the doctrine of specialty”.

  16                  The word “specialty” is sometimes spelt as “speciality”.  According to Garner’s Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage, “specialty” is American usage, to be contrasted with English usage.  However, in A Jones, Jones On Extradition and Mutual Assistance (London, Sweet & Maxwell, 2001) at par [2-048] it is accepted that English usage also adopts the spelling “specialty”: see generally R v Hong Phuc Truong [2002] VSCA 27 at par [2] per Ormiston JA. 

  17                  The doctrine requires that a person surrendered to a requesting state not be detained, prosecuted, or punished for any offence committed prior to surrender, other than for which extradition was granted, unless the requesting state has first allowed the person adequate opportunity to again leave that state.  It is one of long standing.  Its rationale is that where extradition is granted for specific offences – in accordance with the requested state’s laws governing extraditable offences, double criminality and non-extradition for political or other proscribed offences – it would amount to an abuse of process if the person surrendered were prosecuted for other, unrelated, offences: see E P Aughterson, Extradition Australian Law and Procedure (LBC, 1995) at 83–84.

  18                  Historically, there has been considerable disagreement regarding the underlying purpose of the doctrine.  On one view, it serves only to protect the interests of the surrendering state, and cannot be invoked by an accused in answer to a charge.  That debate may fairly be regarded as somewhat sterile.  In recent years, United States courts have accepted that an accused has standing to raise any objection to prosecution, or the extradition process, that the surrendering state might have raised.  In that sense, the rights of the accused in relation to specialty are derivative in nature.  Australian courts too have held that the accused is entitled to have the provisions of the Extradition Act requiring the requesting state to give a specialty assurance observed:  see Barton v The Commonwealth (1974) 131 CLR 477 at 500 per Mason J; Foster v Minister for Customs and Justice (1999) 164 ALR 357 at 367 per Drummond J; R v Ken Ha Khanh Phong supra and Hong Phuc Truong (supra).  Moreover, in Zoeller v Federal Republic of Germany (1988) 19 FCR 64 it was held that a specialty assurance needs to be clear and unambiguous. 

  19                  The doctrine finds statutory expression in modern extradition legislation.  For example, in the United Kingdom par 1(3) of Schedule 1 to the Extradition Act 1989 re-enacts s 3(2) of the Extradition Act 1870:

  “A fugitive criminal shall not be surrendered to a foreign state unless provision is made by the law of that state, or by arrangement, that the fugitive criminal shall not, until he has had an opportunity of returning to Her Majesty’s dominions, be detained or tried in that foreign state for any offence committed prior to his surrender other than the extradition crime for which the surrender is grounded.”

  20                  Paragraph [17] of the Schedule provides similar protection for a person surrendered to the United Kingdom. 

  21                  Article XII of the treaty of 1972 between the United Kingdom and the United States declares that a person extradited “shall not be detained or proceeded against” in the territory of the requesting party for any offence other than an extraditable offence established by the facts in respect of which his extradition has been granted, or on account of any other matters. 

  22                  In Jones On Extradition and Mutual Assistance (supra) at pars [2-058]–[2-078] there is a detailed analysis of some of the difficulties which have arisen in relation to the application and enforcement of specialty law – note in particular United States v Rauscher 119 US 407 (1886); Re Arton (No 1) [1896] 1 QB 108 and Re Arton (No 2) [1896] 1 QB 509. 

  23                  In Fiocconi v Attorney-General of the United States 402 F.2d 475 (1972) the Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit considered the case of two French citizens, extradited from Italy to the United States to be tried in Massachusetts for conspiracy to import heroin.  Although, there was an extradition treaty between Italy and the United States, it did not apply to narcotics offences.  However, an agreement existed between the two governments pursuant to which the two defendants were surrendered as an act of comity.  After their release on bail in Massachusetts, the defendants were taken to New York and charged with a series of drug offences, none of which had been laid before the Italian authorities prior to surrender.  The Court of Appeals accepted that the protection of specialty applied, but refused habeas corpus in the particular circumstances.  This case is said to reflect the modern approach to specialty in the United States.

  24                  In Australia, the doctrine is given statutory expression in s 42 of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) (“the Extradition Act”) which is in the following terms:

  “42.     Where an extraditable person in relation to Australia is surrendered to Australia by a country (other than New Zealand), the person shall not, unless he or she has left, or has had the opportunity of leaving, Australia or, in a case where the person was surrendered to Australia for a limited period, has been returned to the country:

  (a)     be detained or tried in Australia for any offence that is alleged to have been committed, or was committed, before the surrender of the person, other than:

  (i)      any offence in respect of which the person was surrendered or any other offence (being an offence for which the penalty is the same or is a shorter maximum period of imprisonment or other deprivation of liberty) of which the person could be convicted on proof of the conduct constituting any such offence; or

  (ii)     any other offence in respect of which the country consents to the person being so detained or tried, as the case may be; or

  (b)     be detained in Australia for the purposes of being surrendered to another country for trial or punishment for any offence that is alleged to have been committed, or was committed, before the surrender of the person to Australia, other than any other offence in respect of which the country that surrendered the person to Australia consents to the person being so detained and surrendered.”

  25                  Section 42 must be read subject to s 11(1) of that Act which provides:

  “(1)     The regulations may:

  (a)     state that this Act applies in relation to a specified extradition country subject to such limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications as are necessary to give effect to a bilateral extradition treaty in relation to the country, being a treaty a copy of which is set out in the regulations; or

  (b)   make provision instead to the effect that this Act applies in relation to a specified extradition country subject to other limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications, other than such limitations, exceptions or qualifications as are necessary to give effect to a multilateral extradition treaty in relation to the country.”

  26                  The effect of s 11(1) is to enable the Executive to modify the operation of the Act in relation to certain countries by agreement between Australia and those countries: Winkler v DPP (1990) 25 FCR 79 at 90; Papazoglou v Republic of the Philippines (1997) 74 FCR 108; and Federal Republic of Germany v Parker (1998) 101 A Crim R 234 at 238.  Hong Kong is one such country.  The Extradition (Hong Kong) Regulations 1997 (Cth) provide for the surrender of accused and convicted persons between the Government of Australia and the Government of Hong Kong in accordance with an agreement which is contained in a schedule to the regulations. 

  27                  Article 18 of that agreement sets out what is described as a “Rule of Specialty”.  It is in the following terms:

  “ARTICLE 18

  RULE OF SPECIALTY

  (1)       A person who has been surrendered shall not be proceeded against, sentenced or detained with a view to carrying out of any sentence for any offence committed prior to surrender other than:
  

              (a)        the offence in respect of which return is ordered;

              (b)       any lesser offence, however described, disclosed by the facts in respect of which return was ordered provided such an offence is an offence for which the person sought can be returned under this Agreement;

              (c)        any other offence being an offence for which surrender may be granted under this Agreement in respect of which the requested Party consents to the person being dealt with;

  unless that person has first had an opportunity to leave Australia or Hong Kong, as the case may be, and has not done so within forty days of having been free to leave or has returned after having left.

  (2)       A Party whose consent is requested under paragraph (1)(c) may require the submission of any document or statement mentioned in Article 9.”

  28                  Mr Woinarski submitted that the undertaking contained in art 18 prohibited the taking by the Commissioner of a DNA sample from the applicant.  That was because the taking of such a sample, in circumstances where it may have related to an offence committed prior to his surrender, would be tantamount to proceeding against the applicant for such an offence.  He submitted that there was nothing to suggest that the applicant had committed any offence since his surrender to this country in December 1997, and that it was inherently unlikely that he had done so.  In those circumstances, any DNA sample taken from the applicant which led to the laying of charges against him would, it was submitted, contravene art 18.  That is because the laying of such charges would relate to offences committed prior to the applicant’s surrender.

  29                  Mr Woinarski’s argument was developed by a careful and detailed analysis of the statutory regime established by Div 6A of Pt 1D.  I trust that I do no disservice to his argument by not setting out, in all its elaborate detail, the structure of this new regime.  For reasons which will shortly become apparent, it is unnecessary to do so. 

  30                  The doctrine of specialty, at common law, has been codified by the enactment of s 42 of the Extradition Act and, in relation to Australia and Hong Kong, art 18.  That article prohibits both countries party to the agreement from:

  ·                    proceeding against a person who has been surrendered for any offence committed prior to surrender;

  ·                    sentencing such a person for such an offence; or

  ·                    detaining such a person with a view to carrying out such a sentence.

  31                  Mr Woinarski’s submission requires that art 18 be construed as though it prohibited not merely proceeding against, sentencing and detaining a person surrendered, but also carrying out investigative procedures which might lead to one or more of those consequences.  A major difficulty with that argument is that it requires words to be read into art 18 which are conspicuously absent.  The concept of “proceeding against” plainly suggests an application of a curial nature and in context, connotes the institution of criminal proceedings.  Although the word “proceeding” is not generally regarded as being confined to applications to the court, that word, read in conjunction with the surrounding language used in this case, has that connotation.  It does not suggest the use of investigative procedures which are logically anterior to the institution of such a proceeding.

  32                  In that sense, Mr Murphy, counsel for the respondent, was clearly correct when he submitted that the application before this Court had been brought prematurely.  The specialty undertaking would only be contravened, if at all, were the DNA sample to be used to prosecute the applicant for an offence committed prior to his surrender.

  33                  Mr Woinarski submitted that to construe art 18 in this way would diminish significantly the protection afforded by Parliament to a prisoner convicted of a serious offence, from whom a DNA sample was sought.  He contended that, unless the Court enjoined the Commissioner from pursuing the sample, the applicant would be placed in the invidious position of having to choose between complying with the request made by Mr Cheshire, or facing the possibility of an additional 12 months’ imprisonment.  Indeed, Mr Woinarski submitted, there could be further requests, each of which could lead to a further 12 months’ imprisonment. 

  34                  The difficulty with that submission is, as I have indicated, that art 18 is not expressed in sufficiently broad terms to allow the proscriptions which it contains to override the wide powers conferred by the Crimes Act. 

  35                  Had s 42 of the Extradition Act not been modified by the operation of art 18, pursuant to s 11(1), there would have been greater force in Mr Woinarski’s submission.  It might then have been possible to argue that the prohibition in s 42 upon detaining a person for any offence alleged to have been committed before the surrender of that person, which was separate from the prohibition upon trying such a person, carried with it a prohibition upon the exercise of coercive powers of investigation.  It might have been argued that these coercive powers included the taking of a DNA sample under threat of prosecution.  However, the narrower language of art 18 stands in stark contrast with the much broader language of s 42. 

  36                  I am fortified in my conclusion that the doctrine of specialty does not preclude the use of coercive investigatory powers by a decision of the First Circuit Court of Appeals to which Mr Woinarski very fairly drew my attention.  In United States v Saccoccia 58 F.3d 754 (1995), the issue was whether the principle of specialty prevented an application from being made for the forfeiture of the assets of a person convicted of racketeering and money laundering.  The Court held that the principle does not impose any limitation on the particulars of the charges laid by the requesting state, nor does it demand any departure from that state’s existing rules of practice and procedure.  It rejected the contention that forfeiture was tantamount to prosecution and conviction for an offence on which extradition was neither sought nor granted.  Consequently, an accused could be subjected to a forfeiture order even if extradition had not been granted in respect to the forfeiture allegations.

  37                  It should be noted that Aughterson at 83 draws attention to Ahmad v Wigen 726 F Supp 389 in which it was suggested that, by an extension of the doctrine of specialty, the requested state is entitled to seek assurances from the requesting state that, following return, the person “would not be tortured or otherwise coerced into confessing and that he would receive a fair trial by a civilian tribunal”.  It is clear, however, that in the present case, no assurance of any kind was sought by Hong Kong from Australia regarding the use of coercive investigative procedures, including the obtaining of a DNA sample.  The only undertaking given was in accordance with the terms of art 18. 

  38                  It follows that Mr Woinarski’s primary submission regarding the effect of the doctrine of specialty must be rejected.  There is no basis upon which the Commissioner should be enjoined from proceeding to request a DNA sample from the applicant, assuming that the requirements of the Crimes Act are otherwise met. 

  39                  That takes me to Mr Woinarski’s alternative submission.  He contended that, in formulating his letter of request, Mr Cheshire had failed to comply with certain requirements of s 23XWJ of the Crimes Act.  He further contended that a breach of those requirements rendered the request invalid: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355. 

  40                  Section 23XWJ relevantly provides:

  23XWJ Matters that offender must be informed of before giving consent

   

  (1)       The constable must inform the offender of the following:

              (a)        the purpose for which the forensic procedure is required;

              (b)       if the constable wants the forensic procedure carried out in relation to an offence—the offence concerned;

              (c)        the way in which the forensic procedure is to be carried out;

              (d)       that the forensic procedure may produce evidence against the offender that might be used in a court of law;

              …

              (g)       that the offender may refuse consent to the carrying out of the forensic procedure;

              (h)       the consequences of not consenting, as specified in subsection (2) or (3) (whichever is applicable);

              …       

              (j)        that information obtained from analysis of forensic material obtained may be placed on the DNA database system and used for the purposes of a criminal investigation or for any other purpose for which the DNA database system may be used under Division 8A.

              …

  (3)       The constable must inform a serious offender requested to undergo an intimate forensic procedure to which this Division applies that, if the serious offender does not consent, an application may be made to a magistrate for an order authorising the carrying out of the forensic procedure.”

  41                  Mr Woinarski submitted that Mr Cheshire’s letter of 13 May 2002 failed to inform the applicant of the matter referred to in s 23XWJ(1)(b) above, namely whether “the constable wants the forensic procedure carried out in relation to an offence – the offence concerned”.

  42                  Plainly, Mr Cheshire was of the view that the word “offence” in s 23WXJ(1)(b) referred to the offence which gave rise to the applicant being what is defined in s 23WA as a “serious offender”.  Because the applicant is under sentence for what is defined as a “serious offence” (meaning an offence under the law of the Commonwealth punishable by a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life or 5 or more years) he is a “serious offender”.  Mr Cheshire assumed that he was required to inform the applicant of the basis upon which he was regarded as having that status.  Indeed, Mr Cheshire confirmed that this was his understanding in an affidavit which he swore in this proceeding.  In that affidavit he said:

  “5.      On 8 July 2002 the AFP were served with an Application for Judicial Review in Federal Court proceeding number V430 of 2002.  It was only after receipt of those papers that I became aware that the offence identified in the letter forwarded to the Applicant on 27 May 2002 made reference to a conviction that had been quashed.  The Forensic Procedures letter should have referred to the Applicant’s conviction for the offence of being knowingly concerned in the importation of heroin contrary to section 233B(1)(d) for which the Applicant was convicted on 16 November 2002 and not to the previous conviction for importation of heroin contrary to section 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901.”

  43                  Mr Woinarski submitted that Mr Cheshire had plainly misunderstood the nature of the obligation imposed upon him under s 23XWJ(1)(b).  The “offence” referred to in that paragraph had to be an offence other than the offence for which he had been convicted.  The structure of the section, and in particular, the use of the word “wants”, in juxtaposition with the expression “in relation to an offence” made it clear that the constable was obliged to inform the applicant not of the offence of which he had been convicted, but of any other offence in relation to which he wanted the forensic procedure carried out.  There was no other sensible reason for using the word “want” in that context.

  44                  After initially resisting this construction of the relevant paragraph, Mr Murphy conceded that Mr Cheshire had, indeed, misunderstood the relevant provision.  He also conceded that it must follow that Mr Cheshire’s letter failed to comply with the requirements of the Act.  It was a precondition to the taking of a sample of the applicant’s DNA, by order from a judge or magistrate, that the information specified in s 23XWJ(1) be provided.  Mr Murphy was asked whether, in those circumstances, the respondent would resist the making of a declaration to that effect.  He said that there would be no objection to such a declaration provided that it did not preclude a further letter from being sent to the applicant which complied with the requirements of the section.

  45                  Although the application to this Court filed by the applicant did not seek a declaration in these terms, it plainly sought both injunctive and declaratory relief.  The Court has power to grant a declaration regarding the rights of the parties, pursuant to ss 19 and 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), provided there is utility in doing so.  I propose to exercise my discretion in favour of granting a declaration regarding the invalidity of the letter sent by Mr Cheshire because of its failure to provide the information required by s 23XWJ.  However, I should emphasise that there is no impediment to the preparation of a further letter which complies with the requirements of that section.

  46                  The applicant has had a limited measure of success in this proceeding.  However, he has failed in his primary aim, which was to prevent the respondent from proceeding to obtain a DNA sample from him.  His argument based upon the doctrine of specialty was wholly unsuccessful.  In the circumstances, I consider that there should be no order as to costs.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

THE COURT:

1                    
On 20 June 2002 the Court published its reasons
for upholding an appeal from a decision of Crispin J sitting in the
Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory.  His Honour had allowed an appeal against
findings by a magistrate that the respondent was guilty of certain offences of
dishonesty.  The respondent had appealed
to the Supreme Court on numerous grounds, one of which was that the charges
should have been brought pursuant to s 99A of the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT)
rather than s 99 of that Act. 
Crispin J upheld the appeal on that ground without considering the
other grounds of appeal.  This Court
reversed that decision, holding that the prosecutor had correctly relied upon
s 99A.  The matter was remitted to
the Supreme Court for reconsideration. 
It should be noted that before the magistrate, counsel for the
respondent conceded that the proceedings were properly brought pursuant to
s 99A but asserted that it was inappropriate to do so in the circumstances
of the case.

2                    
This Court did not dispose of the question of
costs at the time at which it published its reasons.  The parties were invited to make any
submissions in writing.  Neither party
has sought an order for costs against the other, but the respondent has sought
an order pursuant to s 6 of the Federal Proceedings (Costs) Act 1981
(Cth).  That section provides:

“(1)     Subject to this Act, where a Federal Appeal
succeeds on a question of law, the court that heard the appeal may, on the
application of a respondent to the appeal, grant to the respondent a costs
certificate in respect of the appeal



(2)         
…



(3)         
The certificate that may be granted under subsection
(1) or (2) by a court to a respondent to a Federal appeal is a certificate
stating that, in the opinion of the court, it would be appropriate for the
Attorney-General to authorise a payment under this Act to the respondent in
respect of:



(a)              
the costs incurred by the respondent in relation to the
appeal;  and

(b)              
…”



3                    
The expression “Federal appeal” includes an
appeal to the Federal Court from a judgment of the Supreme Court of a
Territory.  The question is whether or
not this Court should certify that it would be appropriate for the
Attorney-General to authorise such payment to the respondent.  

4                    
The discretion is unfettered.  In Bullock v Federated Furnishing Trades
Society of Australasia (No. 2) (1985) 58 ALR 373 at 374, the Court
(Smithers, Sweeney and Woodward JJ) said:

“The unsuccessful respondent must satisfy the court … that it is
appropriate in all the circumstances for a certificate to be granted, and the
circumstances which could properly influence that decision are many and
various.”



5                    
The Court also endorsed the following
observations concerning similar legislation made by the Full Court of the
Supreme Court of Western Australia in Richards v Faulls Pty Ltd [1971]
WAR 129 at 137-8:

“The question is whether the power which is conferred upon the
Court should be exercised.  It is a
discretionary power and the grant of the certificate follows upon and requires
the exercise of the discretion.  Hence it
is a discretion to grant; it is not a discretion to refuse.  Hence it is not the position, adapting to
this case the words of the judgment of Latham CJ, Rich and Dixon JJ in Main v Main (1949)
78 CLR 636 at 643, that once facts are proved bringing the case within (the
relevant section) a certificate should be granted unless the court thinks on
discretionary grounds that the certificate should be withheld;  on the contrary, the unsuccessful respondent
to an appeal must show some ground calling for the exercise of the discretion
in his favour and he does not do this merely by showing that the appeal has
succeeded on the question of law …”



6                    
The respondent submits that because Crispin J
upheld the appeal on one ground only, not dealing with the other grounds, and
as a result of this Court’s decision, she must now incur the costs of further
proceedings in the Supreme Court.  It is
suggested that the measure of her financial disadvantage is the sum of
$3,000.  She also submits that it is
relevant that the appeal was upheld on a point of law.  

7                    
As we have observed in our reasons and again
above, the respondent took different positions concerning the proper
construction of s 99A before the magistrate and before
Crispin J.  It is not clear to us to
what extent this change of position led his Honour to decide the appeal on such
a limited basis, without disposing of the other grounds of appeal.  In any event, it is clear that had the
respondent adhered to the position adopted in the Magistrates Court, the matter
would have been disposed of by Crispin J upon other grounds, and the
present problem would not have arisen. 
The position adopted in the Magistrates Court has been vindicated by our
decision.  Any loss which the respondent
has suffered has been brought about by the way in which her legal advisers have
conducted the matter.  That does not
necessarily lead to refusal of the certificate, but it certainly does not
strengthen the respondent’s case.

8                    
The primary ground advanced in support of the
application for a certificate is that the appeal was upheld on a point of
law.  The authorities establish that such
a ground is not, by itself, necessarily enough to lead to a favourable exercise
of the discretion.  Having regard to all
of the circumstances of the case, we do not think it appropriate to certify to
the Attorney-General that he should authorise payment of the respondent’s costs
of the appeal.  The application is
refused.  There will be no order as to
the costs of the appeal.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

1                    
On 25 June 2001 Glendon Michael Unicomb (“Mr
Unicomb”), an officer of the third respondent (“ASIC”), applied to the first
respondent for the issue of search warrants under s 3E of the Crimes
Act 1914 (Cth) (“the Crimes Act”). 
On that day the first respondent issued various search warrants,
including Search Warrant No 431 of 2001 in respect of the premises of the
second applicant (“Adler Corporation”) at level 34, 264-278 George Street,
Sydney (“the warrant”).  The warrant in
respect of Adler Corporation was issued to Federal Agent Marjorie Brown.

2                    
Federal Agent Brown executed the warrant at
Adler Corporation’s premises on 26 June 2001. 
Officers of ASIC and of the Australian Federal Police (“the AFP”) were
present during the execution of the warrant. 
About 18,000 documents were seized from Adler Corporation’s premises in
purported execution of the warrant.  

3                    
The applicants filed an application for review
on 4 July 2001 seeking orders that the documents seized pursuant to the warrant
be returned, and other relief.  An
Amended Application for Relief was filed on 16 July 2001.

4                    
Following a judgment of this Court given on 13
September 2001 (Williams v Keelty (2001) 111 FCR 175), orders were made
on 2 October 2001 dismissing the Amended Application with the exception of the
questions raised under grounds 6, 7 and 8(a) thereof (“the deferred
questions”).  Subsequently, a protocol
was agreed upon, and further orders were made, with a view to limiting the
number of documents which were in dispute. 
The arrangement was that I would only be asked to determine the deferred
questions in relation to those documents upon which the parties could not reach
agreement.  The implementation of this
procedure has led to the number of documents in dispute being reduced to three.

The documents still in dispute are as follows:

(a)               
fax dated 14 September 2000 from the first applicant
(“Mr Adler”) to Morgan Mellish (“Mr Mellish”) re article “HIH Insurance on a
Hiding to Nothing”;

(b)              
fax dated 15 September 2000 from Mr Adler to Mr Mellish
re article “HIH Insurance on a Hiding to Nothing”; and

(c)               
fax dated 23 November 2000 from Mr Adler to Mr Mellish
re HIH articles.



These documents are
collectively referred to hereafter as “the disputed documents”.

The Amended Application

6                    
Grounds 6, 7 and 8(a) of the Amended Application
for Review provide as follows:

“6.       The procedures
that were required by law to be observed in connection with the making of the
decisions to seize certain documents pursuant to the first and second warrants
were not observed.  



            Particulars



            The officers of
the second respondent who made the decisions to seize the documents failed to
ensure that they fell within the terms of the first and second warrants.



7.                 
The decisions to seize certain documents pursuant to
the first and second warrants were not authorised by the enactment in pursuance
of which they were purported to be made.





Particulars



            Documents were
seized that did not fall within the terms of the first and second warrants such
that the seizure of them was not authorised by s 3F of the Crimes Act.  



8.                 
The making of the decisions to seize certain documents
pursuant to the first and second warrants was an improper exercise of the power
conferred by the enactment in pursuance of which it was purported to be made.



Particulars



(a)              
Documents were seized that did not fall within the
terms of the first and second warrants such that the seizure of them was not
authorised by s 3F of the Crimes Act.



7                    
The paragraph of the applicant’s Amended
Statement of Claim that deals with these grounds provides as follows:

“Seizure beyond the terms
of the warrants (ground 6, 7 and the first particular of ground 8 in the
Amended Application for Review)



63               
As a result of the execution of the first and second
warrants, documents were seized that fell outside the terms of the first and
second warrants in that:

(a)              
the said documents were not within the third condition
of the first warrant or the second warrant; and

(b)              
were not otherwise within the first and second warrants
because either:

(i)                
no belief was formed by the executing officer or any
constable assisting that seizure was necessary to prevent the concealment, loss
or destruction or use of any such document in committing an offence; or

(ii)              
any such belief was not formed on reasonable grounds.”



8                    
The “first warrant” is the warrant No 431 of
2001 in respect of the premises of Adler Corporation at level 34, 264-278
George Street, Sydney.  The “second
warrant” is search warrant No 433 of 2001 in respect of Mr Adler’s home at
Bellevue Hill.  The evidence and
submissions on the deferred questions were confined to the first warrant.

9                    
The warrant in question is a so-called “three
condition warrant”.  The relevant
conditions of the warrant as far as the disputed documents and this hearing are
concerned are as follows:

“First condition



Things which are originals
or copies or drafts of any of the following including any of them which are
stored in electronic or magnetic form: 



All
things referred to in (a) to (p) below relating to the period 1 July 1997 to 15
March 2001, whether or not created during that period being:

 … 

(e)              
records of communication including correspondence,
reports, announcements, media releases, files, file notes, memoranda, notes of
conversations, electronic mail and facsimile transmissions;

…



Second condition



Things which relate to any
one or more of the following:



(a)              
HIH Insurance Limited (“HIH”) …

…



(c)               
Rodney Stephen Adler (“Adler”);

…



Third condition



Things as to which there are
reasonable grounds for suspecting that they will afford evidence as to the
commission of the following offence(s) against the laws of the Commonwealth:



PACIFIC EAGLE EQUITIES
PTY LTD - Breach Of Director’s Duties And False And Misleading Statement By
Adler

Acquisition
of HIH shares

…

(b)              
An offence against s 999, namely that between 19
June 2000 and 21 June 2000 Adler made a statement, namely that he was buying
HIH shares, that was materially misleading which was likely to induce the
purchase of shares in HIH by other persons when he knew that the statement was
materially misleading in that he was not personally purchasing the shares;



…



HIH
INSURANCE LIMITED – Insolvent trading

(g)              
An offence against ss 588G and 1317FA, namely that
between 1 July 1998 and 12 March 2000 [Raymond Reginald] Williams and the other
directors of HIH recklessly and dishonestly and intending to gain an advantage
for HIH failed to prevent HIH incurring debts when at the time such debts were
incurred HIH was insolvent and Williams and the other directors of HIH
suspected that HIH was insolvent or would become insolvent as a result of
incurring those debts;

(h)              
an offence against s 588G, namely that between:
(a) 13 March 2000 and 15 December 2000 Williams; and between (b) 13 March 2000
and 15 March 2001, other directors of HIH dishonestly failed to prevent HIH
incurring debts when at the time such debts were incurred HIH was insolvent and
Williams and the other directors of HIH suspected that HIH was insolvent or
would become insolvent as a result of incurring those debts;



…”



The offences specified
in pars (b), (g) and (h) of the third condition are hereinafter referred to as
the “warrant offences”.  It is common
ground that the disputed documents fell within the first and second conditions
of the warrant; the dispute is about the third condition.

10                 
I find that the disputed documents were seized
by Jennifer Anne Balding (“Ms Balding”), an ASIC officer, in circumstances
to which it will be necessary to return later in more detail.  Ms Balding was not the “executing officer” in
relation to the warrant, hence she was only authorised by the Crimes Act to seize
the disputed documents if she was a “constable assisting” in relation to the
warrant within the meaning of s 3C of the Crimes Act.  The first issue between the parties is
whether Ms Balding was a “constable assisting” in relation to the execution of
the warrant.

11                 
The second issue results from by the applicants’
contention that the warrant was not validly executed, and the disputed
documents were not lawfully seized, as Ms Balding did not have an actual
suspicion that each of the disputed documents was within the terms of the
warrant.  In the applicants’ submission,
Ms Balding was engaged in an indiscriminate, “negative” search for
documents, without forming any view as to whether or not the documents, and in
particular, the disputed documents fell within the terms of the warrant.

12                 
The third issue identified by the applicants is
whether, if Ms Balding formed the view at the time of execution of the warrant
that the disputed documents fell within its terms, there were reasonable
grounds for that opinion.  In the
applicants’ submission there was no rational basis for a conclusion that the
disputed documents could afford evidence as to the commission of any of the
warrant offences.

The statutory framework

13                 
The authorisation to seize documents is found in
s 3F of the Crimes Act.  Section
3F(1)(c) provides:

“(1)     A warrant that is
in force in relation to premises authorises the executing officer or a
constable assisting:

(a)              
…

(b)              
…

(c)               
to search the premises for the kinds of evidential
material specified in the warrant, and to seize things of that kind found at
the premises …”



“Evidential material” is
defined in s 3C to mean:

“a thing relevant to an
indictable offence or a thing relevant to a summary offence, including such a
thing in electronic form.”



14                 
“Thing relevant to an indictable offence” is
defined in s 3 to mean, inter alia:

“(a)     …

(b)     anything as to which
there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it will afford evidence as to
the commission of any such offence …

(c)     …”



15                 
A “constable assisting” in relation to a
warrant, is defined in s 3C as meaning:

“(a)     …

(b)        
a person who is not a constable and who has been
authorised by the relevant executing officer to assist in executing the
warrant.”



Constable assisting

16                 
The relevant executing officer is Federal Agent
Brown.  The issue is whether Ms Balding
had been authorised by that officer “to assist in executing the warrant”.  If it is established that Federal Agent Brown
authorised Ms Balding to assist her in the execution of the warrant, it is not
necessary for the respondents to establish that the executing officer
specifically authorised Ms Balding to enter the premises to search for
documents or to seize documents, as authority in that respect flows from the
terms of the Crimes Act. 

17                 
It is not suggested that any written authority
or a written record of an authority was brought into existence.  However, Puglisi v Australian Fisheries
Management Authority (1997) 148 ALR 393 at 401 recognises that whatever the
practical desirability of the written record, it is not essential to the
existence of a valid authority.  I find
as a fact that Ms Balding was authorised by Federal Agent Brown to assist in
executing the relevant warrant.  I make
that finding for the following reasons:

–                   
Ms Balding was a member of a team put together to
assist Federal Agent Brown in the execution of the search warrant at the
premises of Adler Corporation;

–                   
Federal Agent Brown said at a meeting held on 25 June
2001, at which Ms Balding was present, that Ms Balding, amongst
others, was to assist her in the execution of the warrant;

–                   
when Federal Agent Brown went to the offices of Adler
Corporation early in the morning of 26 June 2001 she said to the team members,
including Ms Balding:

            “We will start
the search and seizure in Adler’s office and his secretary’s office.  If documents are to be seized, bring them out
to Chris who is the property officer and we will record all the documents.  If you have any doubt about seizing a
document, check with Glen Unicomb, Jennifer Balding or me.”



–                   
the execution of the search warrant at the Adler
Corporation premises took over 14 hours. 
During that time Federal Agent Brown observed members of the team
assisting, including Ms Balding, searching for documents, seizing
documents and having the documents recorded in the property seizure
records.  Federal Agent Brown expected
her advisers to make decisions about seizing documents; and

–                   
at about 4.35 pm on 26 June 2001, Federal Agent Brown,
Mr Unicomb and Ms Balding were in the conference room at the premises
of Adler Corporation.  The three of them
reviewed about two-thirds of the documents which had been seized earlier in the
day and decided whether those documents should be left at the premises, or
whether they should continue to be “seized”.



18                 
Ms Balding clearly assisted in the execution of
the warrant, and, equally clearly, the executing officer knew that Ms Balding
was rendering that assistance.  The
executing officer had prior knowledge that Ms Balding would assist in this way,
and had assented to Ms Balding providing that assistance.  Throughout 26 June, Federal Agent Brown
concurred in what Ms Balding was doing in this regard.  These circumstances are sufficient to
establish the requisite authority. 
Federal Agent Brown did not say to Ms Balding the words: “I hereby
authorise you to assist me in the execution of this warrant”, but the requisite
authority may be, and was, conferred by less direct means.  The failure to document the persons who were
within the description of a “constable assisting” is indicative of sloppy
administration, rather than illegality.

The scope of the search

19                 
Both the Crimes Act and the warrant authorised
search for, and seizure of, things as to which there are reasonable grounds for
suspecting that they will afford evidence of the commission of an
offence specified in the warrant.  The
applicants submitted that the disputed documents could never be admitted in
evidence in a trial in relation to the warrant offences, hence they were
necessarily outside the scope of the warrant.

20                 
The submission misconceives the reach of the
expression “afford evidence”.  Bearing in
mind that the power to issue a search warrant is in aid of a criminal
investigation, a thing may afford evidence as to the commission of an offence,
even though it may not be admissible in evidence at a trial: George v
Rockett (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 119.  A
thing will afford evidence of the commission of an offence if it assists,
directly or indirectly, in disclosing that an offence has been committed, or in
establishing or revealing the details of the offence, the circumstances in
which it was committed, the identity of the person or persons who committed it
or any other information material to the investigation of those matters: George
v Rockett (supra) at 120.  The
expression “will afford evidence” does not import a requirement that the documents
must necessarily be sufficient to achieve a conviction; it is sufficient that
they have relevance to or probative connection with, an issue arising upon an
allegation of the offence alleged: Parker v Churchill (1985) 9 FCR 316
at 326.  That includes things which are
adjectivally relevant as well as things which are of substantive relevance: Ozzy
Tyre & Tube Pty Ltd v Chief Executive Officer of Customs [2000] FCA 891
at [30]-[31].  

The executing officer’s state of mind

21                 
The executing officer or constable assisting has
to make a judgment as to whether seizure of a document is authorised by the
warrant.  The executing officer or
constable assisting has to consider whether “there are reasonable grounds for
suspecting” that the document will afford evidence as to the commission of a
warrant offence.  This is judgment which
the executing officer must make in relation to every “thing” which is to be
seized in reliance upon the warrant.  But
where the relevant thing consists of a folder or file, there may well be
justification for an executing officer, or constable assisting, to take the
entirety of the folder or file in which he or she locates an individual
document itself within the warrant, because the context in which the document
is found may itself be of assistance in evaluating the true evidentiary
significance of the document in question: Harts Australia Ltd v
Commissioner, Australian Federal Police [2002] FCA 245 at [39].

22                 
The
judgment is one which must be made at the time of seizure.  A warrant holder is not entitled to take
anything which he or she chooses in purported reliance on the warrant and to
leave it until later on, in the course of a subsequent examination, to
determine whether any of the material taken falls within the terms of the
warrant: Harts v Commissioner,
Australian Federal Police (supra)
at [24].  However, in an
evidentiary sense, there is no necessary inconsistency between seizing
documents in circumstances where the executing officer has an actual belief
that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that they will afford evidence
of the commission of a warrant offence, and that same officer later coming to
the conclusion on more detailed consideration of the document that it does not,
in truth, have that effect: Harts v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police
(supra) at [24].

Ms Balding’s state of mind

23                 
Ms Balding is a person who has had extensive
experience in reviewing large quantities of documents.

24                 
She said in her affidavit of 26 July 2002 that
when seizing documents pursuant to the warrant she had regard to the three
conditions in the warrant, although she presently has no recollection of the
basis upon which she seized particular documents.  Nor does Ms Balding have a recollection of
having seized the disputed documents, but she does not dispute a property
search record maintained by the AFP which records that the file in which the
disputed documents are found, was seized by her.

25                 
The property seizure record maintained by the
AFP shows that the search commenced at 7.20 am on 26 June 2001.  The first item recorded as having been seized
by Ms Balding is at 7.50 am when three files are recorded as having been
“located” by her.  Six folders are
recorded as having been located by Ms Balding at 7.55 am.  Two bundles of documents and two folders are
recorded as having been located by Ms Balding at 8.00 am.  Four folders (including the folder containing
the disputed documents) and a bundle of documents regarding HIH board meetings
are recorded as having been located by Ms Balding at 8.05 am.  The disputed documents are contained in a
blue folder marked “HIH Insurances Ltd 6 Sept 99 - 16 March 01 containing
various documents relating to HIH” which was barcoded SBA213028.  Ms Balding’s evidence was that at this
point she looked at the files carefully, and made a decision as to whether they
should be put back into the filing cabinet or shelf from which they had been
taken, or set aside for seizure.  Some of
the files seized at this point were quite small, consisting of folders
containing a few documents only.

26                 
At about 4.35 pm on the day of the search,
Federal Agent Brown, Mr Unicomb and Ms Balding met in the large
boardroom of Adler Corporation’s premises. 
The purpose of this meeting, which lasted until about 9 pm, was to
review the material that had been seized during the course of the day.  An Australian Federal Police Officer selected
a folder for review, and made notes of the details of the folder which he then
handed to Ms Balding. 
Ms Balding opened the folder in front of Mr Unicomb who was sitting
between Ms Balding and Federal Agent Brown.  Ms Balding made notes of her review of
the documents.  The notes include the
following entry:

“New box 213023-213028

SBA213028 – spring transfer
file 6 Sept 99 – 16 Feb 01

Seize HIH I.T.”



The words “HIH I.T.”
were Ms Balding’s abbreviation for HIH insolvent trading offence, referring to
either warrant offence (g) or (h) depending upon which time period the document
related to.

27                 
In the case of some files reviewed at this
meeting, Ms Balding’s note is “leave”, indicating that the file was not to
be removed from the premises. 
Ms Balding’s evidence was that her review covered many more times
the number of documents than were actually seized.

28                 
Approximately 18,000 documents were the subject
of the seizure from the premises of Adler Corporation on 26 June.  Ms Balding said in her affidavit that during
the course of the execution of the relevant warrant, AFP and ASIC officers
seized roughly only one-quarter to one-fifth of the material reviewed.  Since then about 15,000 of the 18,000  documents seized have been returned.  Ms Balding said that the documents were
not returned because they outside the scope of the warrant, but I have no other
information as to the circumstances of their return.

29                 
Counsel for the applicants, Mr Hammerschlag SC,
submitted that I should not accept Ms Balding as a witness of truth, and I
should not accept her evidence that she turned her mind to the question of
whether the disputed documents and other documents seized by her during the
course of the search fell within the terms of the warrant.  In counsel’s submission, Ms Balding was
engaged in a indiscriminate “negative” search in which no genuine attempt was
made to determine whether things seized fell within the terms of the
warrant.  Mr Hammerschlag points to
the property seizure record, and to the numerous documents which were recorded
as having been located by Ms Balding within a comparatively short time
frame, as making it unlikely that Ms Balding gave genuine consideration to
whether the documents seized, and in particular the disputed documents, fell
within the terms of the warrant at the point of their original seizure.  It is “inconceivable”, in
Mr Hammerschlag’s submission, that anyone could have “reviewed” later in
that day about 12,000 documents in the period of about 5 hours commencing at
about 4.30 pm on the day of the search, even though Ms Balding’s evidence
was that the documents were quickly and cursorily reviewed.  Further, Mr Hammerschlag submitted that
it is obvious on the face of the disputed documents, all of which are faxes
from a non-executive director of HIH to a journalist, that objectively they
could not form a basis to suspect that they will “afford evidence” of insolvent
trading by HIH in terms of warrant offences (g) and (h).  Reliance was also placed by
Mr Hammerschlag upon a number of other documents which were seized during
the course of the search which, in his submission, were so obviously outside
the scope of the warrant as to demonstrate the absence of a genuine attempt
properly to execute the warrant.

30                 
One of the elements of the offence of “insolvent
trading” created by s 588G of the Corporations Law is that a
director suspected at the time at which a debt was incurred by the company,
that the company was insolvent.  The
disputed documents were brought into existence by Mr Adler during the
period covered by warrant offence (h). 
The file in which the disputed documents were contained also included an
article headed “HIH Insurance on a Hiding to Nothing - HIH Heading into
Hospital” apparently written by Morgan Mellish. 
The article commences:

“HIH Insurance shares slumped another 30% yesterday after
scathing analysts’ reports that value the company as low as 50 cents a share.



Several analysts said the viability of the company was now in
question and a fall in its credit rating could leave it unable to write quality
insurance risks.”



The article concludes with the following paragraph:

“Former FAI Insurances CEO and HIH director Mr Rodney Adler is
understood to have sold about 1.3 million shares through Foster Stock-broking,
cutting the Adler family interest to about 19 million shares, or about 4%.”



31                 
The faxes from Mr Adler to Mr Mellish bearing
the date 14 September 2000 and 15 September 2000 appear to have been written in
relation to this article.  The article
appears to be the next document in the file. 
The letters take issue with the last paragraph of the article which I
have quoted, but otherwise do not take issue with the statements contained in
the article, and in particular do not take issue with the first two paragraphs
which I have quoted.  I do not think that
it can be said that these letters are necessarily outside the scope of the
warrant because the view is open that they throw light on Mr Adler’s perception
of HIH’s financial position at a relevant time.

32                 
The third of the disputed documents is a fax of
23 November 2000 from Mr Adler to Morgan Mellish, which asserts that in
every second or third article which Mr Mellish writes about HIH, there is
invariably a line, or a paragraph, that has a statement to the effect that most
of HIH’s problems have resulted from its “ill fated purchase of FAI Insurances
two years ago”.  Mr Adler comments upon
that statement in the fax and points out that although the acquisition of FAI
caused losses for HIH, this pales into insignificance compared to the losses
which HIH sustained on other investments which are referred to in the
letter.  Again, I do not think it can be
said that this document necessarily falls outside the scope of the warrant
because it may throw light on Mr Adler’s perception of the financial position
of HIH at a time relevant to warrant offence (h).

33                 
I have considered whether the objective
circumstances pointed to by Mr Hammerschlag should cause me to reject
Ms Balding’s sworn evidence that both at the time when the documents were
originally seized, and at the time at which the seizure was reviewed later on
that day, she gave consideration to whether the disputed documents, related to
warrant offence (g) or (h).  I am not
persuaded that I should do so. 
Ms Balding presented as a witness who was doing her best to tell
the truth.  The fact that she could not
remember whether she seized the disputed documents, and did not remember the
intellectual process which she engaged in on 26 June 2001 in relation to the
disputed documents, is unsurprising.  I
would have felt more cause for concern if she had claimed an actual recall of
what that process was in relation to the disputed documents.  The fact that Ms Balding cannot recall what
her mental process was does not lead to the conclusion that she did not apply
her mind to the question of whether the documents were within the third
condition of the warrant.

34                 
Whilst a number of folders are recorded as
having been “located” within a comparatively short space of time, I know
nothing about the nature of those documents, either in terms of their number or
in terms of their contents, which would enable me to conclude that
Ms Balding’s testimony cannot stand having regard to the objective
facts.  Some of the folders seized at
this time were, on the evidence, quite small and there was some duplication of
contents.  There was evidence from
Ms Balding that her examination of the files on the morning of 26 June
2001 began prior to the first entry in the AFP’s property seizure record
attributed to her.  A matter which has
caused me concern is Ms Balding’s evidence that about 12,000 documents
were “reviewed” in the period of about 5 hours after the original seizure
commencing at 4.30 pm.  Statistically
that would indicate that about 1.5 seconds was deployed in the “review” of each
document, but, for all I know, slabs of documents could be assessed without
individual consideration of the component parts.  

35                 
Mr Hammerschlag submitted that I should
reject Ms Balding’s contemporaneous notation on the afternoon of the
seizure: “seize HIH I.T.” as a fiction, as Ms Balding did not turn her
mind to whether the documents related to warrant offences (g) or (h) or not.  It was put to Ms Balding that this was merely
an attempt on her part to justify seizure of a file that she knew was not
within the warrant.  Ms Balding denied
that this was so.  One possibility, I
suppose, is that Ms Balding did not turn her mind to the question of
whether the documents satisfied the third condition when she first seized the
documents in the morning, but she did so later in the day at the meeting in the
board room commencing at about 4.30 pm. 
Ms Balding’s explanation for the afternoon review was that it was
intended as a second look at the documents which had been seized  for more abundant precaution.  She had learnt a lot more about the matter
during the course of the day’s events, and it afforded an opportunity of
getting the benefit of Mr Unicomb’s views of the documents in
question.  I accept this evidence.

36                 
Ms Balding’s evidence was that she arrived
at the premises of Adler Corporation at about 7 am on the morning of 26 June,
and that she was engaged in looking at documents thereafter.  Whilst there are a number of entries with
respect to Ms Balding at 8 am, followed by five entries at 8.05 am, it
does not follow that the documents the subject of the five entries were first
looked at by her after 8 am, or that her consideration of them was confined to
the period between 8 am and 8.05 am.  She
said, and I accept, that her review of the documents commenced prior to the
first recorded seizure attributed to her at 7.50 am.  

37                 
Exhibits B-G are individual documents which were
the subject of seizure.  I do not think
that any relevant conclusion can be drawn from the mere production of those
documents.  Perhaps the high water mark
of them is Exhibit C, which is a letter from the BRW sub-editors to
Mr Adler which discusses the use of “Mr” in front of Ray Williams’ name,
and the magazine’s policy of referring to people simply as “Smith”, “Jones”,
“Bloggs” or whatever.  Taken in isolation
this letter is incapable of being related to the warrant, but it is a document
taken from a file barcoded SBA213033.  I
have no idea what other documents were contained in that file which might be
connected with the letters, or whether the file, considered as a file, was a
thing which might be seized in terms of the warrant.

38                 
Ms Balding had extensive knowledge of the
HIH investigation in which she was fully involved as a team leader.  Her role in the investigation included the
drafting of the application for the search warrant.  The matters relied upon by Mr Hammerschlag
do not persuade me that I should reject Ms Balding’s sworn testimony that
at the time of seizure of the disputed documents she turned her mind to the
question as to whether they fell within the scope of the warrant.

The objective inquiry

39                 
The executing officer or constable assisting,
has to be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that
things seized will afford evidence as to the commission of an offence.  The notion of reasonable grounds for a
suspicion imports an objective test, but “reasonable” involves a value or
normative judgment (Greiner v Independent Commission Against Corruption
(1992) 28 NSWLR 125 at 167), and there may well be legitimate differences of
opinion as to what falls within the term, particularly when it is used in
relation to a nebulous expression such as “suspicion”.  A court is not entitled to substitute its own
opinion on that question for the opinion of the executing officer or constable
assisting.  That does not mean that the
executing officer, or constable assisting, 
has an unexaminable discretion; it does mean, however, that the officer’s
decision is only impeachable if the decision was one which the officer could
not lawfully reach on the materials before him or her: Minister for
Immigration & Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang (1996) 185 CLR 259 at
275-276.

40                 
In Propend Finance Pty Ltd v Commissioner,
Australian Federal Police (1994) 29 ATR 87 at 100 Davies J rejected an
invitation to examine a number of the documents seized under a search warrant
to determine whether or not they were evidence of the offences stated in the
warrant.  His Honour declined that
invitation as that is not his Honour’s task. 
His Honour said:

“The material before the court would not enable me to decide, by
merely reading a particular document, whether it answered the description in
the warrant.  A background knowledge of
the nature of the offences charged and of how the particular documents fitted
into the picture would be required. 
Presumably, the officers authorised to execute the warrants had that
knowledge.  The court has no jurisdiction
to interfere with their seizure unless their actions are proved to have been
excessive.  A mere examination of a
particular document would be unlikely to establish that.”



41                 
The onus, then, is on the applicants to
establish that the seizure decisions taken in relation to the disputed
documents were infected by reviewable error. 
In the light of my finding that it was open to Ms Balding to
conclude that the disputed documents fell within the terms of the warrant, and
that she in fact drew a conclusion to that effect, it follows that the
applicants have not established that the seizure decision was not authorised by
the Crimes Act, or that it was an improper exercise of the power conferred by
the Crimes Act, or that it was otherwise contrary to law or amenable to
judicial review.

42                 
The Amended Application should be dismissed
insofar as it seeks relief on the grounds alleged in pars 6, 7 and 8(a)
thereof.  In conformity with the
agreement reached between the parties, costs incurred on and from 2 August
2002, including the costs of the hearing on 10 September 2002, should be paid
by the applicants.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

THE COURT

1                    
This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme
Court of the Australian Capital Territory (Higgins J) given on 7 December 2001
by which orders nisi for the issue of writs of habeas corpus and certiorari
against the Parole Board of the Australian Capital Territory (as it then was)
were made absolute and by which certain decisions of the Parole Board were set
aside.

2                    
On 15 May 2002 this Court allowed the appeal and
said that reasons would be given later. 
These are the reasons.

3                    
The appeal was concerned with the operation of
parole under the Parole Act 1976 (ACT)(the former Act) repealed
by s 111 of the Rehabilitation of Offenders (Interim) Act 2001 (ACT)
(the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act), which came into force
on 10 September
2001.  Under the Rehabilitation of
Offenders Act the Parole Board under the former Act effectively became the
Sentencing Administration Board. 

4                    
On 31 August 1990, the Supreme Court sentenced
the respondent to a term of 10 years imprisonment for various property
offences and possession of heroin.  The
Supreme Court fixed a non-parole period of six years before the expiry of which
the respondent was not eligible for release on parole.  The respondent was released on parole on 30
August 1996 pursuant to order of the Parole Board on that day (the original
parole order).  At the time of his
release he continued to be under sentence. 
The term of that sentence was then due to expire on 30 August 2000.

5                    
On 7 October 1999, the respondent was convicted
after trial in the Supreme Court of two offences of using a false instrument,
charged on the ninth and tenth counts of the indictment.  These offences were committed on 16 September
1997 during the parole period.  The
sentencing judge proceeded to sentence the respondent in the following terms:

“[The respondent] will be sentenced to three months’
imprisonment but I suspend that sentence forthwith upon him entering into a
recognizance to be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months from this date;
that recognizance to be in the sum of $500. 
It is a condition of that recognizance that he pay a penalty of $500 and
further pay compensation to Diners Club in the sum of $99.20.  I will not attempt to split it between the
two.



So far as the second count is concerned – that is the 10th
count on the indictment – there will be a conviction recorded, and I will defer
sentence on that count on [the respondent] entering into the recognizance
referred to on the 9th count, and direct that he be released
forthwith accordingly.”

6                    
The respondent entered into the recognizance on
the same day and, it appears, was released on that same day.  

7                    
On 23 November 1999, whilst the respondent was
still at large, the Parole Board issued or purported to issue a notice stating
that the parole order of 30 August 1996 had been revoked by s 22(2) of the
former Act.  That section provided as
follows:

“Where the person to whom a parole order relates is sentenced to
a term of imprisonment in respect of an offence (including an offence against a
law of the Commonwealth or of a State or another Territory) committed during
the parole period, the parole order shall be deemed to have been revoked and,
if the parole period has already expired, to have been revoked immediately
before the expiration of the parole period.”

8                    
On 24 November 1999, the Parole Board made or
purported to make a further parole order in terms almost identical with those
of the original parole order, but expressed to commence on 7 October 1999 and
expire on 6 October 2003, since the time previously spent on parole did not
count towards serving the remainder of the 10 year sentence of imprisonment
imposed on 31 August 1990.  The
respondent remained under sentence but at large. 

9                    
On or before 17 October 2000, the respondent
pleaded guilty in the ACT Magistrates Court to a charge of possession of
heroin.  On that date, the Parole Board
revoked the further parole order of 24 November 1999, relying on the admitted
possession of heroin as a breach of that further parole order.  The respondent was returned to custody in
consequence of the revocation of that further parole order.  On 15 November 2000, whilst the respondent
remained in custody under sentence, the ACT Magistrates Court deferred passing
sentence on the charge of possession of heroin. 
The date on which the offence charged occurred does not emerge from the
material in the appeal nor is there anything to indicate whether the possession
of heroin was a breach of the recognizance entered into on 7 October 1999.

10                 
On 23 January 2001 the Parole Board had made a
further parole order (the latest parole order) expressed to expire on 17
October 2004 for the reason referred to in [8] above.  On 13 February 2001 the respondent was again
released on parole.  

11                 
On 23 July 2001 the respondent was arrested for
alleged breaches of parole.  On
27 July 2001 the Parole Board found those breaches proved and revoked the
latest parole order.

12                 
The respondent remained in custody pursuant to
the revocation of parole on 27 July 2001 until 7 December 2001, the date of the
orders absolute in the Supreme Court.

13                 
The orders for issue of writs of habeas corpus
and certiorari were made as a consequence of a ruling of law by the Supreme
Court that the sentence of three months imprisonment imposed on 7 October 1999
did not operate to revoke the respondent’s parole.  On that ruling it followed, as the Supreme
Court further ruled, that the decisions of the Board ever since were vitiated
by errors of law.  It further followed,
as the Supreme Court appears to have further ruled, that the term of
imprisonment of ten years imposed on 31 August 1990 would have expired before
30 August 2000 or at the latest on a date prior to the date of hearing in the
Supreme Court.  Accordingly, the orders
nisi were made absolute, and the respondent was discharged from custody.

14                 
It is common ground that the only question for
determination on this appeal is whether the sentence of three years
imprisonment imposed on 7 October 1999 should have been deemed to revoke the
parole order of 31 August 1990 pursuant to s 22(2) of the former Act.  It is also common ground that if the Parole
Board was correct in considering that the sentence was deemed to have revoked the
parole, the subsequent decisions made and the steps taken by the Parole Board
in relation to the respondent’s parole were lawful.

15                 
Contrary to the conclusion reached by the
Supreme Court, we are of the view that the sentence of three months’
imprisonment imposed on 31 August 1990 fell within s 22(2) of the former Act
and that the respondent’s parole was thereby deemed to have been revoked. 

16                 
The sentence of three months’ imprisonment, said
to be “suspended”, was imposed by way of an order under s 403(1) (formerly s
556B(1)) of the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT) (the Crimes Act) of the
Territory.  The terms of the subsection
are critical.  They are:

“(1)     Subject to
this section, where a person is convicted of an offence against the law of the
Territory, the court by which he or she is convicted may, if it thinks fit, by
order-

            

(a)  
release the person without passing sentence upon him or
her upon his or her giving security, with or without sureties, by recognisance
or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the court that-



(i)           he
or she will be of good behaviour for such period as the court specifies in the
order; and



(ii)         he
or she will, during the period so specified, comply with such conditions (if
any) as the court thinks fit to specify in the order, which conditions may
include-



(A)            
the condition that the offender will, during the period
so specified, be subject to the supervision on probation under a person, for
the time being appointed in accordance with the order; and



(B)the condition that the offender
will obey all reasonable directions of a person so appointed; and



(C)        
the condition that the offender will comply with an
order made pursuant to section 437; and



(iii)            
he or she will pay to the Territory such penalty (if
any) as the court specifies in the order on or before a date specified in the
order or by specified instalments as provided in the order; or



(b)  
sentence the person to a term of imprisonment but
direct that the person be released, upon him or her giving a like security to
that referred to in paragraph (a), either forthwith or after he or she has
served a specified part of the sentence imposed upon him or her.”

17                 
Thus whilst it may be common and convenient to
refer to a sentence imposed by way of an order under s 403(1)(b) (formerly s
566B(1)(b)) as a “suspended” sentence, the term is somewhat misleading.  It is not the sentence which is suspended by
the making of the order under s 403(1)(b). 
The sentence takes effect immediately but the liability of the offender
to serve the sentence by way of actual imprisonment may be regarded as
suspended if and when the offender enters into the recognizance authorised by
the direction for release made as part of the order.  The effect of the order and direction is
that, notwithstanding the sentence, the offender is to be released upon giving security,
with or without sureties, by recognizance or otherwise, to the satisfaction of
the court, that he or she will be of good behaviour for such period as the
court specifies and that he or she will during the period specified comply with
any other conditions specified in the order. 
Once the person has given the security to the satisfaction of the court,
the person is to be released, according to the terms of the direction, either
forthwith or after he or she has served a specified part of the sentence.

18                 
If, for whatever reason, the offender does not
give the security to the satisfaction of the court (which security in the
present case was to be by way of recognizance) the offender remains in custody
until the security is given.  Until the
security is given the offender is not eligible for release in accordance with
the direction.  Only after the offender
has given the security to the satisfaction of the court is he or she to be
released, either forthwith or after serving a specified part of the sentence as
directed.

19                 
In the present case, the respondent entered into
the recognizance on the day the sentence was imposed, namely, 7 October 1999
and, from what we were told, was at large from then until taken into custody on
24 November 1999 to serve the remainder of the existing ten year sentence.

20                 
In our view, the words of s 403(1)(b) are
plain.  We agree with the judgment and
the reasons of Forster J in Meehan v Lawrence (1974) 22 FLR 296 in which
legislation of the Northern Territory similar to s 403(1)(b) was
considered.  His Honour said at 297:

“It
seems to me that on its face the sentence is one of imprisonment which, for
reasons which are not now relevant, had its immediate operation suspended and
which, if the defendant observed the terms of his recognizance, would cease to
have any effect at all at the end of that term but which, if the defendant
committed a breach of the terms of his recognizance, would come wholly or
partially into effect.  When fixing a
sentence and using the provisions of the Criminal Law (Conditional Release
of Offenders) Ordinance 1971, the form of words habitually used by me
is  ‘the sentence of the court is that
you be imprisoned with hard labour for ... months but I direct that you be
released pursuant to the Criminal Law (Conditional Release of Offenders)
Ordinance forthwith upon your entering into your own recognizance in the sum
of ... dollars to be of good behaviour for ... years.’  I am informed that in the present case the
learned magistrate used a similar form of words.”  

His Honour continued at 298:

“…It is, of course, true that the sentence did not immediately
result in imprisonment but it seems to me that this does not alter the
essential character of it.  If the
learned magistrate wished simply to release the defendant upon a bond he could
have done so by using the procedure under s 5(1)(a).”

21                 
In our view, the character of the sentence is
made clear if the sentencing judge or magistrate uses the words of the section
itself, as suggested by Forster J.  It
may be confusing to use words such as “the sentence is suspended”.  It may be correct to regard the liability of
the offender to serve the sentence by way of actual imprisonment as “suspended”
until the expiry of the period of the recognizance.  However, the term “suspended” is nowhere to
be found in s 403(1)(b).  We note that
the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) uses the term “recognizance release order” in
relation to similar provisions, a term which is more accurate than “suspended
sentence”.

22                 
Another issue raised during the appeal was about
the effect of the notice given by the Parole Board on 23 November 2000 which,
on one view, purported to revoke the respondent’s parole.  However, that notice did not purport to
notify the respondent of any order made by the Parole Board.  It appears to have served the useful purpose
of recording the revocation of parole by the sentence of 7 October 1999 and in
consequence the revised expected date of expiry of the ten year sentence.  It also provided a formal basis for the Board
acting on the following day to make a further parole order.

23                 
We were told that procedural and administrative
difficulties will arise in the event of a finding that the sentence of 7
October 1999 revoked the original parole order. 
One such difficulty is in relation to calculation of the expiry of the
sentence, since it appears that the respondent should not have been at large
between 7 October and 23 November 1999. 
Another difficulty is that the sentencing judge should have calculated a
fresh non-parole period under s 23 of the former Act.

24                 
We find it unnecessary to express an opinion
about these matters except to draw attention to s 360 (formerly s 451) of the
Crimes Actwhich needs to be applied for the purpose of calculating the
eventual date of release of the respondent. 
We also observe that the respondent was the applicant in an allied
application for leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence of three
months imprisonment imposed on 7 October 1999 (A63/01) and that application is
the subject of a further judgment of the Court to be given this day. 

25                 
Accordingly, the appeal was allowed and the
judgment of the Supreme Court was set aside. 
The Court discharged the orders nisi for issue of writs of habeas corpus
and certiorari and set aside the orders absolute.  The cause was remitted to the Supreme Court for
execution of the judgment of the Court.  

26                 
We gave leave for any application for costs to
be made by written submissions within seven days.  None was received and no order is made for
the costs of the appeal.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

THE COURT:

1                    
Douglas John Marsden and Jason Paul Hawkins have
each applied for an extension of time in which to file and serve a notice of appeal
from sentences imposed upon them by Higgins J, in the Supreme Court of the
Australian Capital Territory, on 5 October 2001.

MR MARSDEN

2                    
On 6 July 2001, Mr Marsden pleaded guilty
in the Australian Capital Territory Magistrates Court to one count of theft,
three counts of burglary (though one was described as “trespass with intent to
steal”), and one count of possessing stolen property.  He was committed for sentence to the Supreme
Court of the Australian Capital Territory. 




3                    
The offence of theft contrary to s 99 (now
s 89) of the Crimes Act 1900 carries a maximum penalty of ten
years’ imprisonment.  The offence of
burglary contrary to s 102(1)(a) (now s 93(1)(5)) carries a maximum
penalty of fourteen years’ imprisonment as does the offence of possessing
stolen property contrary to s 113(1)(b) (now s 105(1)(b)).  

4                    
On 5 October 2001, Mr Marsden adhered to
his pleas of guilty in the Supreme Court. 
Two further offences, unlawful possession, and breach of community
service order, were taken into account on a Sixth Schedule (see s 357 of the Crimes
Act 1900).  He was sentenced as
follows:

·                   
on the first count of burglary (CC2001/2371)-
two years’ imprisonment;

·                   
on the count of theft (CC2372)– six months’
imprisonment, concurrent with the first sentence;

·                   
on the second count of burglary (CC2001/2956) –
two years’ imprisonment, cumulative on the previous sentences; 

·                   
on the third count of burglary (CC2001/2958) –
two years’ imprisonment, cumulative on the third sentence to the extent of
twelve months; and

·                   
on the count of possessing stolen property
(CC2001/2806) – six months’ imprisonment, concurrent with the previous
sentences. 

5                    
His Honour, in imposing these sentences, took
into account the scheduled offences.

6                    
The effect of these sentences was that Mr
Marsden was required to serve a head sentence of five years’ imprisonment, to
commence on 1 March 2001.  A
non-parole period of two years, to commence on the same date, was fixed.  

7                    
On 25 March 2001 Mr Marsden filed an
application for an extension of time, together with a draft notice of appeal,
in this Court.  That draft notice
contained the following grounds:

·                   
misrepresentation by solicitor;

·                   
misleading facts by prosecutor;

·                   
non-comparative sentences;

·                   
excessive length of parole;




·                   
non-consideration of rehabilitation program; and

·                   
mitigating issues in Magistrates Court.

MR HAWKINS

8                    
On 4 July 2001 Mr Hawkins pleaded guilty in
the Australian Capital Territory Magistrates Court to two counts of theft and
four counts of burglary.  He was
committed for sentence to the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital
Territory. 

9                    
On 5 October 2001 he adhered to his pleas
of guilty in the Supreme Court.  Five
further offences were taken into account, in accordance with the Schedule.  He was sentenced as follows:

·                   
on the first count of burglary (CC2001/2372) -
two years’ imprisonment;

·                   
on the first count of theft (CC2374) – six
months’ imprisonment, concurrent with the first sentence;

·                   
on the second count of burglary (CC2001/2964) –
two years’ imprisonment, cumulative on the first two sentences; 

·                   
on the third count of burglary (CC2001/2807) –
twelve months’ imprisonment, concurrent with the third sentence; 

·                   
on the fourth count of burglary (CC2001/2808) –
two years’ imprisonment, cumulative on the third sentence to the extent of
twelve months; and

·                   
on the second count of theft (CC2001/2809) –
nine months’ imprisonment, concurrent with the fifth sentence. 

10                 
His Honour, in imposing these sentences, took
into account the scheduled offences.

11                 
The effect of these sentences was that Mr
Hawkins was required to serve a head sentence of five years’ imprisonment, to
commence on 26 May 2001.  A
non-parole period of eighteen months, to commence on the same date, was
fixed.  

12                 
On 27 March 2001 Mr Hawkins filed an
application for an extension of time, together with a draft notice of appeal,
in this Court.  That draft notice
contained the following grounds:




·                   
misrepresentation by legal counsel; and

·                   
remand time not taken into consideration,
co-offender had full credit for remand time.

THE FACTUAL BASIS OF THE OFFENCES 

13                 
There was no issue before this Court concerning
the factual basis of the offences.  They
fell into two distinct categories, those committed jointly by both applicants,
and those committed by them separately. 

14                 
In relation to the offences committed jointly,
these arose out of two incidents.  The
first occurred on 16 February 2001. 
The applicants entered the premises of Bells Drycleaners in Griffith via
a smashed front window.  They stole a
safe which contained $590 that was bolted to the floor.  The second occurred in the early hours of
1 March 2001.  The applicants broke
into the Windfall Kiosk at Southland Shopping Centre, Mawson and stole various
tobacco products valued at $6,600.  These
included 500 packets of assorted cigarettes, 20 cartoons of cigarettes, 20 packets
of tobacco, and 3 glass tobacco pipes.

15                 
The first of the offences committed by Mr
Marsden in the absence of Mr Hawkins, occurred on either 15 or 16 February
2001.  He broke into First Choice
Drycleaners, in Kingston, and stole a wall safe containing $415.  The second of those offences occurred on
1 March 2001 when a search warrant was executed upon his vehicle, and
police located a grey steel safe.  That
safe was later identified as having been stolen from the “Brew Your Own Home”
Shop at Kambah between 10 and 11 February 2001.  

16                 
Police also searched Mr Marsden’s home on
1 March 2001.  They located six
cameras which they suspected of being stolen. 
This formed the basis of one of the scheduled charges which were taken
into account.  The other arose out of the
breach of a community service order imposed on 3 November 2000 for an
assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 
Prior to his arrest on 1 March 2001, Mr Marsden had completed 47
out of 208 hours of unpaid community work under that community service order,
but had failed to attend on a number of occasions.  

17                 
In relation to the offences committed by Mr
Hawkins in the absence of Mr Marsden, these consisted firstly of a burglary at
the Dickson Denture Clinic on 22 June 2000 in the course of which nothing
was taken, and secondly, a burglary and theft at the premises of Aboriginal
Hostels Limited, Phillip on 10 July 2000 in the course of which property
to the value of $8,531.15 was stolen. 
The scheduled offences taken into account included driving an unregistered
and uninsured vehicle, unlicensed driving, and cultivation of a small quantity
of cannabis.  

EACH APPLICATION FOR AN EXTENSION OF TIME

18                 
The principles which govern an application for
an extension of time within which to file a notice of appeal are not in
doubt.  They were most recently set out
in Parker v The Queen [2002] FCAFC 133. 
The Federal Court Rules provide that an appeal must be instituted within
21 days of the recording of the sentence imposed.  However, they contain a provision for an
extension of time in appropriate circumstances. 
Order 52 r 15(2) provides that “... the Court or a Judge for special
reasons may at any time give leave to file and serve a notice of appeal”.

19                 
In the civil jurisdiction the matters required
to be considered when dealing with an application to extend time were dealt
with by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3
FCR 344 at 348-9.  In Jess v Scott (1986)
70 ALR 185 a Full Court of this Court accepted the correctness of his Honour’s
analysis and observed that the expression “special reasons”, in O52 r15, was
intended to distinguish the case from the usual course according to which the
time is 21 days.  In Zocchi v R (2000)
116 A Crim R 245 at 246, Jess v Scott was cited as authority for the proposition
that the Court’s power to extend time was a flexible one, designed to enable
substantial justice to prevail over technical default, see too R v Williams
(2000) 199 A Crim R 490.

20                 
In Parker a Full Court comprising
Spender, O’Loughlin and Dowsett JJ said that what the Court will look for,
above all else, in an application to extend the time within which to file a
notice of appeal (in that case against a conviction which had led to a term of
imprisonment) is satisfaction that there has not been, and will not be a
miscarriage of justice if leave is refused. 
There Honours referred to R v Lawrence [1980] 1 NSWLR 122 at
165-6 as authority for that proposition. 
  

21                 
Mr Refshauge SC, the Director of Public
Prosecutions, submitted to this Court that neither appeal had any prospect of
success and leave should, for that reason, not be granted.  He did not otherwise oppose either
application to appeal out of time.  It is
necessary, having regard to the principles which govern the grant of an
extension, to consider the merits of each appeal before determining whether or
not to grant leave. 

THE PRINCIPLES GOVERNING APPEALS AGAINST SENTENCE

22                 
The principles upon which an appellate court
will interfere with a sentence imposed by a sentencing judge are well
established.  They are set out in House
v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505 and R v Tait and Bartley (1979)
46 FLR 386 at 388.  They were recently
restated by the High Court in Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR
321.  Because the imposition of a
sentence involves the exercise of judgment and evaluation upon which minds can
differ, it bears many similarities to the making of a discretionary
decision.  As with any such decision, a
sentence will not be disturbed on appeal merely because the appellate court
would itself have reached a different result. 
An appellant must point to error on the part of the primary judge,
whether that be the adoption of an incorrect principle, giving weight to some
extraneous matter, failing to give appropriate weight to material considerations,
or a mistake as to the facts.  

MR MARSDEN’S GROUNDS OF APPEAL

23                 
The complaint that Mr Marsden’s solicitor failed
to represent him competently before the learned sentencing judge was faintly
pressed on the appeal.  Essentially, Mr
Marsden argued that his solicitor had failed to emphasise sufficiently certain
aspects of his background.  It was
suggested that had he done so, his Honour may have been persuaded that Mr
Marsden’s prospects for rehabilitation were rather better than his Honour
ultimately found them to be.

24                 
In our opinion there is no substance in this
ground.  The sentencing judge had before
him detailed pre-sentence reports dated 23 May 2001 and 10 August
2001, together with an undated report of the Parole Board of the Australian
Capital Territory which provided a comprehensive assessment of Mr Marsden’s
prospects of rehabilitation.  It is fair
to say that the Parole Board was not unimpressed with the efforts which he had
made to rid himself of his problems with drugs, and his attempts at rehabilitation.  Nonetheless, it noted, as did the Probation
and Parole Officer who prepared the pre-sentence reports, that his criminal
record, which was substantial, as well as his past failures on parole and
community service made it difficult to have any confidence in his capacity to
adhere to his assertions of good intent. 
Although he was now in a relationship with a woman who had two children
aged eight and four respectively, the fact that she was in difficult circumstances
was regarded as possibly placing additional pressure upon him, thereby
increasing the risk of his re-offending. 


25                 
Mr Marsden conceded that he had previously
expressed a strong desire to refrain from committing offences, but had failed
in that endeavour.  He argued that had
his solicitor presented his case more forcefully, the sentencing judge may have
imposed a slightly shorter non-parole period. 
As indicated above, we are not persuaded by that submission.  

26                 
The only remaining ground of appeal which was
pressed complained of undue disparity between the non-parole period imposed
upon Mr Marsden, and that imposed upon Mr Hawkins.  

27                 
It is true that Mr Marsden received a non-parole
period of two years, while Mr Hawkins received a non-parole period of only
eighteen months.  However, it must be borne
in mind that Mr Marsden’s sentence and non-parole period were both backdated to
1 March 2001, while Mr Hawkin’s sentence and non-parole period were only
backdated to 26 May 2001.  That led
to a complaint on the part of Mr Hawkins that, if anything, he had been treated
unfairly.  For present purposes, it is
sufficient to note that each applicant had different subjective features which
made the task of achieving parity somewhat difficult.

28                 
Mr Marsden had a long history of criminal
offences, and had previously breached parole. 
He had served a lengthy gaol term for robbery.  He was several years older than Mr
Hawkins.  The pre-sentence reports were
both prepared by the same Probation and Parole Officer, within days of each
other.  They favoured Mr Hawkins.  It was said “some confidence” could be placed
in his stated good intentions and that his risk of re-offending was
“medium”.  

29                 
In our opinion, Mr Marsden can have no
justifiable sense of grievance arising from the fact that he will not be
eligible for parole until some months after Mr Hawkins.  There is no merit whatever in Mr Marsden’s
contention that the length of his non-parole period was excessive.  Relative to the head sentence, it was
lenient.  




30                 
One matter which occasioned concern was the
question of when precisely Mr Marsden would be eligible for parole.  It appears that he was sentenced to a term of
imprisonment in Western Australia, prior to being transferred, on parole, to
the Australian Capital Territory.  As we
understand it, his non-parole period had expired in 2000.  However, the balance of the sentence imposed
upon him in Western Australia was not scheduled to be completed until December
2003.  

31                 
There was some uncertainty on Mr Marsden’s part
as to whether the effect of the sentence imposed by Higgins J was that he would
be eligible for parole on 1 March 2003, or that would not occur until December
2003.  It is plain that his Honour
intended that Mr Marsden should be eligible for parole on 1 March 2003, and
that he might then go into a residential rehabilitation program if the parole
authorities thought his progress satisfactory. 


32                 
Mr Refshauge submitted that the effect of the
orders made by his Honour was that Mr Marsden would be eligible for parole on 1
March 2003, and that the December 2003 date could effectively be
disregarded.  We have noted that
concession, and assume that the parole authorities in the Australian Capital
Territory will apply the relevant principles in the manner described above.  

MR HAWKIN’S GROUNDS OF APPEAL

33                 
Mr Hawkins raised essentially one ground of
appeal in argument before this Court.  He
contended that he ought to have received some benefit from the sentencing judge
by way of a reduced non-parole period because two of the counts upon which he
was sentenced involved offences committed in June and July 2000.  However, although the police had overwhelming
evidence of his involvement in those offences as far back as September 2000,
they had held back from charging him. 
According to Mr Hawkins, had he been charged in a timely manner, he
would almost certainly have been imprisoned, rather than being given periodic
detention, as he was, in November 2000.  

34                 
In substance, Mr Hawkins complained that had he
been imprisoned, as he ought to have been, had the police conducted themselves
diligently, he would not have been in a position to commit the offences which
he did, in company with Mr Marsden, in February and March 2001.

35                 
In our opinion, there is no merit in this
ground.  It is true that there is no
explanation as to why the police did not charge Mr Hawkins with the offences
committed in June and July 2000 until after he was arrested for the subsequent
offences.  Nonetheless, in that regard,
he must be considered the author of his own misfortune.  There is no principle which holds that a
person who commits an offence can complain that, had the police arrested him
for earlier offences, he would not have been in a position to commit the later
offence, and is therefore to be accorded leniency.  

CONCLUSION

36                 
In our opinion, there is no substance in any of
the grounds of appeal set out in each of the draft notices of appeal.  It follows that each application for an
extension of time within which to appeal should be dismissed.

  REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

  WHITLAM and GYLES JJ:

  1                     The short point of substance sought to be raised in this appeal is whether a doubt or question as to the fitness to plead of an accused who is convicted is a doubt or question as to his or her guilt within the meaning of s 475 of the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT) (“the Act”) as it stood at 7 August 2001. Although the point can be simply stated, the resolution of it is not simple. The interrelationship between fitness to plead and the criminal process has a long history, with different solutions at different times and in different places. It is interesting to observe that there are current controversies in the United Kingdom in relation to that topic in the light of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (R v Grant [2002] 2 WLR 1409).

  2                     Section 475 of the Act was as follows:

  “(1) Whenever, after the conviction of a prisoner, any doubt or question arises as to his or her guilt, or any mitigating circumstance in the case, or any portion of the evidence therein, the Executive, on the petition of the prisoner, or some person on his or her behalf, representing such doubt or question, or a judge of the Supreme Court of his or her own motion, may direct any magistrate to, and such magistrate may, summon and examine on oath all persons likely to give material information on the matter suggested.

  (2)              The attendance of every person so summoned may be enforced, and his or her examination compelled, and any false statement wilfully made by him or her shall be punishable in like manner as if he or she had been summoned by, or been duly sworn and examined before, the same magistrate, in a case lawfully pending before him or her.

  (3)              Where on such inquiry the character of any person who was a witness on the trial is affected thereby, the magistrate shall allow such person to be present, and to examine any witness produced before such magistrate.

  (4)              Every deposition taken under this section shall be stated in the commencement to have been so taken, and in reference to what case, and in pursuance of whose direction, mentioning the date thereof, and shall be transmitted by the magistrate, before whom the same was taken, as soon as shall be practicable, to the Executive if the inquiry was directed by him or her, or to the judge directing the inquiry, and the matter shall be disposed of, as to the Executive, on the report of such judge, or otherwise, shall appear to be just.”

  Background

  3                     David Harold Eastman (“Eastman”) was charged with the murder of Assistant Commissioner Winchester of the Australian Federal Police on 10 January 1989. The trial in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, which was presided over by Carruthers A-J, commenced on 16 May 1995 and lasted for five and a half months, concluding with his conviction on 3 November 1995. During the trial Eastman exhibited erratic and unusual behaviour, and was unrepresented from time to time. None of Eastman, his various legal representatives, or prosecuting counsel raised any question during the trial as to his fitness to plead. The trial judge raised no such question, and, indeed, in the course of his remarks on sentence, described the applicant’s conduct as an attempt “to avoid the consequences of the damning nature of the Crown evidence by adopting a process of manipulating the trial process and attempting to frustrate its progression in any conventional manner”.

  4                     On appeal to this Court, numerous arguments were raised on behalf of Eastman but no issue was raised as to his fitness to plead. Indeed, counsel on his behalf expressly rejected any suggestion of mental illness which might bear on that question. The appeal was rejected: Eastman v The Queen (1997) 76 FCR 9. Eastman’s application for special leave to appeal to the High Court raised for the first time the question of his fitness to plead at the time of his trial. He sought leave to present evidence to the High Court on that issue. It was held that the High Court could not receive that further evidence. It was then argued that there was material before this Court such that it should have raised that issue of its own initiative. This argument was rejected. Special leave to appeal was granted, but the appeal was dismissed on 25 May 2000: Eastman v The Queen (2000) 203 CLR 1. The views expressed by certain of the Justices in that decision loomed large in the argument before us.

  5                     A document prepared by Eastman dated 9 June 2000, called “Petition”, and headed “Application for a Judicial Inquiry under Section 475 of the ACT Crimes Act 1900” was provided to the Supreme Court. It included:

  “A 4-3 majority of the High Court (Gaudron, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan) considered that the negative outcome of my appeal was ‘CLEARLY UNSATISFACTORY’ (see pages 26, 100, 115 and 147), and specific reference was made a Judicial Inquiry as one of the means of repairing this defect (see page 100).” (Emphasis in original.)

  and claimed that a judicial inquiry be set up.

  6                     The Registrar of the Supreme Court conveyed to Eastman, on behalf of the Chief Justice, the following:

  “1. The Chief Justice has made an administrative decision not to direct an inquiry under s 475.

  2.                  Your application relies upon the expression of opinion by three Judges of the High Court (and, possibly, a fourth, Justice Kirby) that the failure of your appeal was ‘clearly unsatisfactory’. The Chief Justice is not convinced that your application raises a doubt or question as to your guilt, or any relevant mitigating circumstances, or any portion of the evidence in your case, in respect of which it is appropriate to direct an inquiry.

  3. However, assuming that such doubt or question arises, you have the alternative of presenting your petition to the Executive. An inquiry under s 475 is conducted more appropriately at the direction of the Executive, which has the responsibility of the ultimate disposal of the matter.”

  7                     Eastman then directed a further communication to the Chief Justice on the topic of an inquiry pursuant to s 475, referring to what he called “further compelling evidence” under the following headings:

  (1)               “Psychiatric report of Dr Hugh Jolly dated 30 January 1998”,

  (2)               “Evidence of former Winchester murder inquiry detective, Cliff Forster”,

  (3)               “Evidence that organised crime committed the murder”, and

  (4)               “Forensic evidence of Robert Barnes is ‘unsafe’”.

  8                     The following appeared under the heading “Psychiatric Report of Dr Hugh Jolly dated 30-1-98”:

  “I attach a copy of this report, and I draw your attention especially to page 6, which states that I was unfit to plead during part of the trial. This opinion is supported by psychiatric reports of Dr Alan White and Dr Bruce Westmore dated April and October 1998 respectively. The former is contained in the High Court appeal books. The latter was commissioned by the DPP to contradict Dr White, but ended up substantially agreeing with him. I regret, due to lack of photocopying, that I cannot send you copies of these reports at this stage. The DPP has them.

  In addition, during my trial, the Prosecution had 13 psychiatric reports from Dr Rod Milton dated 1989-92 which raised at the very least a question as to my fitness to plead, pursuant to Sect 428E of the Crimes Act. The Prosecution failed to raise this issue with the trial judge, despite having a clear-cut duty to do so.” (Emphasis in original.)

  9                     The response of the Chief Justice was as follows:

  “1. With regard to the matters referred to under the heading ‘Psychiatric Report of Dr Hugh Jolly dated 30.1.98’, I have not yet been able to decide whether they raise a doubt or question under s 475, or whether, if they do, the doubt or question is of sufficient substance to justify directing an inquiry.

  2.                   In order to further consider the application I propose to instruct the Registrar to brief counsel to assist me at a hearing to take place in the Law Courts Building at 9.30 am on Thursday 12 July 2001. In the meantime I will receive and consider any further written submission which the applicant wishes to make. I will also consider, at the hearing, any application by a legal practitioner to appear and make submissions on behalf of the applicant or on behalf of the Attorney-General or on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The hearing may be adjourned from time to time.

  2.[sic] I have decided to decline to direct an inquiry into the matters referred to under the headings ‘Evidence of former Winchester murder inquiry detective, Cliff Forster’, ‘Evidence that organised crime committed the murder’ and ‘Forensic evidence of Robert Barnes is unsafe’.

  3.[sic] The grounds on which I have made the decision are as follows:

  The matters referred to add nothing of substance to the evidence in the trial as it was summarised in the judgment of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Eastman v The Queen.”

  10                  The hearing envisaged in that response took place on 12 July 2001, when counsel assisting appeared, together with counsel for the Attorney-General, a solicitor for Eastman and counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions. Submissions had been made on behalf of all those parties. Eastman favoured an inquiry. The Attorney-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions opposed an inquiry, each arguing, inter alia, that fitness to plead did not raise a doubt or question as to guilt within the meaning of the section. Evidence was received by the Chief Justice.

  11                  On 7 August 2001 the Chief Justice made what were described as “Further Remarks” which included the following:

  “6. I have considered the submissions and the evidentiary material before me. The decision whether or not to direct an Inquiry under s 475 is an administrative one and not a judicial one. However, the direction may be lawfully given only in the circumstances provided for in the section. The material which may raise the sort of question or doubt contemplated by s 475 does not, in my view, go to the issue of whether David Harold Eastman murdered Colin Winchester on 10 January 1989. In that sense the material relevant to the question of fitness to plead is not relevant to guilt.

  7.                  However in the administration of criminal justice, and in the criminal law, the term ‘guilt’ is often used not to refer to objective guilt but to a finding of guilt. If a liberal approach is taken to s 475, then it is not difficult to construe the section to cover questions and doubts as to a finding of guilt. If a person has been found guilty when an issue as to that person’s fitness to plead has arisen at the trial but has not been determined according to law, then it follows that a question arises as to the finding of guilt. On the material before me the present application raises the question whether that issue arose at the trial of David Harold Eastman.

  8.                  It is less clear whether an undetermined issue of fitness to plead gives rise to any mitigating circumstances. In my view, the sorts of mitigating circumstances contemplated by s 475 are those which are relevant to the sentence passed in consequence of the conviction. Circumstances suggesting unfitness to plead are not relevant to the sentence, except in so far as they may also go to suggest that the person was suffering from some mental handicap at the time of the offence which reduces his/her moral responsibility. It may be appropriate that they be taken into account also for the purpose of considering the person’s ability to take part in the sentencing process post-trial. However, it is not necessary at this stage to consider this aspect further, since as I have already indicated I am satisfied that the material before me raises the issue of whether the question of the fitness of David Harold Eastman to plead arose at his trial. Consequently it raises also a doubt or question as to his guilt.

  9.                  The next matter for consideration is whether I make an administrative decision as to whether there should be a direction that an Inquiry take place. The submission of David Harold Eastman argues that ‘the psychiatric reports of Drs Jolly, White and Westmore provide prima facie evidence that he was, at times during the inquest and trial, unfit to plead, that this issue was never addressed in a substantive way during the trial or appeal process, that he was denied both a fair committal hearing (or equivalent) and a fair trial and that the matter is serious enough to warrant an inquiry under s 475’.

  10.              The strength of any doubt hanging over the conviction must be one factor. The cases refer to a feeling of ‘unease’ or a ‘sense of disquiet’ as being sufficient to justify an Inquiry. Another factor, in my view, is the likely outcome of any positive indication flowing from the Inquiry that a question as to unfitness to plead did in fact arise at the trial. The trial is over. At this time the Mental Health Tribunal clearly has no power to determine the question of fitness to plead even if it did arise at or during the trial and there is no power in the Court to order David Harold Eastman to submit to its jurisdiction.

  11.              As I have indicated the issue which brings the case within s 475 is not whether David Harold Eastman was in fact fit to plead but whether during his trial the question of fitness to plead arose. Should an Inquiry under s 475 attempt for itself look for an answer to the question whether David Harold Eastman was in fact unfit to plead? If it did, what would be the consequences of a positive answer that David Harold Eastman was in fact unfit to plead? It must be remembered that the Inquiry under s 475 results in a report to the Executive and nothing more. The Judge making the report has no power to set aside the conviction. The Executive would have no power to act on any recommendation that the conviction be set aside. The Minister would have no power to refer the case for determination as in an appeal, as may be done under the present Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and as used to be done under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). There is however the Executive prerogative of mercy. There would also appear to be the unexplored scope of s 474 of the Crimes Act.

  12.              Ultimately I do not consider it appropriate to consider further the effect of the outcome of any Inquiry. It is enough to say that an Inquiry would not be necessarily futile and that there is a prospect that it might on the one hand go to expose a serious injustice or on the other it might go to clear any doubt and resolve any question as to David Harold Eastman’s guilt as contemplated by s 475.

  13.              I therefore propose to direct the Chief Magistrate, or a Magistrate nominated by him, to summon and examine on oath all persons likely to give material information on the matter of the fitness to plead of David Harold Eastman during the whole or any part of his trial for the murder of Colin Winchester. I propose also to direct the Magistrate concerned to consult me as to the identity of persons likely to give material information and generally as to the procedure to be followed in the Inquiry. I request the Attorney-General to provide independent counsel to be instructed by the Registrar of the Supreme Court or of the Magistrates Court for the purpose of assisting the Inquiry.”

  12                  On the same day the Chief Justice wrote to the Chief Magistrate of the Australian Capital Territory in the following terms:

  “Dear Mr Cahill

  Application by David Harold Eastman for Inquiry

  under Section 475 of the Crimes Act 1900

  David Harold Eastman has made application for an Inquiry under s 475 of the Crimes Act 1900 into his conviction for murder on 3 November 1995.

  I am of the view that a question or doubt arises as to his guilt. The question is whether the question of fitness to plead arose at his trial.

  I therefore direct you, or a Magistrate nominated by you, to summon and examine on oath all persons likely to give material information on the matter of the fitness to plead of David Harold Eastman during the whole or any part of his trial.

  I request that you, or the Magistrate nominated, consult me as to the identity of persons likely to give material information and generally as to the procedure to be followed in the Inquiry.

  I have requested the Attorney-General to provide independent counsel to be instructed by the Registrar of the Supreme Court or of the Magistrates Court for the purpose of assisting the Inquiry. This is a matter which I suggest be the subject of consultation between yourself and myself at a later stage.

  Yours sincerely,

  [Sgd] Jeffrey Miles

  CHIEF JUSTICE”

  13                  Thereafter the Chief Magistrate nominated Mr Ian Pike (“the Magistrate”) to act as the magistrate pursuant to s 475. The Magistrate took various steps preparatory to receiving evidence.

  Proceedings in the Supreme Court

  14                  On 20 March 2002 the Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) (“the Director”) commenced two proceedings in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. The first named the Chief Justice as the first defendant, Eastman as the second defendant and the Magistrate as the third defendant. The relief sought was:

  “(a) A declaration that the inquiry, directed on 7 August 2001 to be conducted under s 475 Crimes Act 1900 into the matter of the fitness to plead of the First Defendant [sic] at the whole or any part of his trial for the murder of Colin Winchester, and proposed to be conducted by the Second Defendant [sic], was not authorised by the enactment under which it was purported to be made;

  (b)          An order restraining the Second Defendant [sic] from conducting the inquiry, directed on 7 August 2001 to be conducted under s 475 Crimes Act 1900 into the matter of the fitness to plead of the First Defendant [sic] at the whole or any part of his trial for the murder of Colin Winchester, and proposed to be conducted by him.”

  15                  The second proceeding was an application for an order of review, with the Director as the applicant and the same persons respondents as were defendants to the first action. The relief claimed was:

  “1. An order pursuant to Sub-paragraph 17(1)(a) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1989, quashing or setting aside the decision of the First Respondent to direct a Magistrate to conduct the inquiry.”

  16                  The Director claimed to be aggrieved because:

  “1. The Applicant instituted and conducted the prosecution of the Second Respondent on indictment for the said offence;

  2. The inquiry directed by the First Respondent calls into question, amongst other things, the conduct of the said prosecution by the Applicant;

  3. Depositions taken in the inquiry may call into question the conduct of the prosecution of the Second Respondent;

  4. Any report made by the First Respondent under Sub-section 475(4) Crimes Act 1900 may call into question the conduct of the prosecution of the Second Respondent;

  (5)               Any disposition of the matter by the Executive pursuant that sub-section, may affect the sentence which was passed upon the Second Respondent at the end of the prosecution.”

  17                  The grounds of the application were:

  “1. That the First Respondent was not authorised by the enactment under which he purported to make the direction, namely under Section 475(1) Crimes Act 1900, to make the direction, …

  2.                  The decision of the First Respondent to make the direction involved an error of law, …”

  The basis of each ground (although put in various ways) was that fitness to plead did not touch upon or raise a doubt or question as to the guilt of Eastman or any mitigating circumstance in the case or any portion of the evidence therein. The proceeding was well out of time.

  18                  Each of the proceedings was ultimately amended to somewhat re-order the parties, so that, respectively, Eastman was the first defendant and first respondent, the Magistrate was the second defendant and second respondent, the Attorney-General was given leave to intervene and was the third defendant and third respondent, the Chief Justice was the fourth defendant and fourth respondent, and the relief claimed was amended accordingly. Each defendant/respondent was represented at the hearing, Eastman appearing for himself. At that hearing evidence was led as to the factual background of the matter, as to the position of the Director and as to the delay which had occurred in commencing proceedings. There was cross-examination of the Director by Eastman. The relief sought was opposed by Eastman and by the Attorney-General, reversing the position which had been put by the Attorney-General to the Chief Justice.

  19                  The judge of the Supreme Court who heard the proceedings considered the question of law as to the construction of s 475 at the outset, taking the view that he would only turn to questions as to the appropriateness of the proceedings and the remedies sought should he have been persuaded that the Chief Justice was not empowered to decide as he did. In the event, the judge agreed with the Chief Justice and thus did not come to those other questions.

  20                  After considering the history of s 475 and like provisions, and relevant authorities, the conclusion to which his Honour came was expressed as follows:

  “44. I am more inclined to think that the words used to convey the circumstances for the provision to operate were each descriptive of aspects of the trial and that ‘guilt’ encompasses the verdict that results from that process, just as mitigating circumstances and portion of the evidence are part of that process.

  45.              Having also made the potential subject of an inquiry ‘any portion of the evidence therein’, I do not think that the legislature was unmindful of the verdict and its relevance to such an inquiry. …

  46.              … it is the trial process which is under scrutiny in each of the circumstances which might give rise to the operation of s 475. In most cases I agree that this will measure the evidence given at the trial with other material, but I do not think that this was intended to be exclusive or to make unreviewable matters which might affect the ultimate verdict.”

  21                  On 3 May 2002 the Supreme Court made the following orders:

  “1. The application to extend time for the making of an order for review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1989 in respect of the decision of the Chief Justice made on 7 August 2001 in respect of David Harold Eastman pursuant to s 475 of the Crimes Act 1900 be refused.

  2. The applications for a declaration and injunction in respect of that decision be dismissed.”

  22                  Proceedings by Eastman for review of the decision of the Chief Justice to decline to direct an inquiry into guilt on the bases put forward by him other than fitness to plead have not yet been resolved in the Supreme Court.

  proceedings on appeal

  23                  The Director appealed to this Court and sought an order restraining the Magistrate from proceeding further until the disposition of the appeal. As the Magistrate had intended commencing hearing at least preliminary matters on 17 June and to commence examining witnesses shortly thereafter, the appeal was expedited and the Magistrate restrained from proceeding in the meantime. At the hearing of the appeal, the burden of contradiction was taken by Mr Mossop, counsel for the Attorney-General. Mr Harris of counsel, who appeared for the Chief Justice and the Magistrate, made some submissions to clarify the course of events and what was proposed, but did not enter upon the substantive debate.

  24                  Eastman was not represented at the hearing of the appeal. It is unnecessary to go into detail here as to the reasons for this beyond saying that he declined to appear unless collateral matters which he wished to raise were dealt with before the appeal. We should make it clear that it was not regarded as inappropriate for him to raise prior to the commencement of the hearing one of those matters, namely, disqualification of the judges sitting on the appeal. One result of this is that no party before the Court has sought to argue any procedural difficulty in the path of the Director’s appeal. It will be recalled that such issues as arose in the Supreme Court were put to one side by the judge, and there are other procedural issues involved in the appeal itself. As, in substance, the direction by the Chief Justice which is in question in these proceedings was the result of a request by Eastman, and as Eastman opposed the relief sought by the Director in the Supreme Court and is in no sense a consenting party to the appeal (albeit he has chosen to absent himself), it would not be right to ignore the procedural issues which exist. Indeed, it must be borne in mind that the issue of substance being considered is a doubt as to whether Eastman was fit to plead at his trial in 1995. If he were not fit to plead at his trial, it would not lightly be supposed that incarceration during the ensuing years would have improved his condition. That leaves it open to question as to whether he is fit to make decisions about the conduct of this litigation. In this connection, it may not be irrelevant to note that his conduct before the Court when the application to restrain the proceedings by the Magistrate was considered was similar in kind to that described in the account of the original trial. For this reason, members of the Court raised the procedural issues with counsel for the Director in the course of the appeal.

  25                  The most fundamental of the procedural issues is the standing of the Director. There are two aspects to this. The first is whether the Director has power to bring either set of proceedings. The second is whether, if there is power, the Director was a person aggrieved within the meaning of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1989 (ACT) (“the ADJR Act”) by the decision in question, and if the answer is “no”, what are the consequences for the proceedings for declaratory and injunctive relief?

  26                  Prior to considering these questions, we should make it clear that the actual decision in question is that reflected in the third paragraph of the communication from the Chief Justice to the Chief Magistrate, so that the topic of the examination on oath of persons is “the matter of the fitness to plead of David Harold Eastman during the whole or any part of his trial”. That is the question or doubt which has been suggested by the Chief Justice and upon which a report will be made to the Executive. That conclusion accords with the common submission of all those represented on the appeal and is plainly correct. The fact that Eastman may not accept that the function of the Magistrate and the Chief Justice is so limited is not to the point. It is no part of the function of the Magistrate or of the Chief Justice to examine persons as to the conduct of those concerned with or related to the trial as such. It may be, of course, that such persons might be able to give material information on the matter of fitness to plead, but that does not make the conduct of any such person a topic of investigation, inquiry or report.

  Power of Director

  27                  At the time of the institution of the proceedings in the Supreme Court, the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1990 (ACT) (“the DPP Act”) included the following provisions:

  …

  Part 4 Miscellaneous

  35 The Executive may make regulations for this Act.”

  28                  At the relevant time, reg 3 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Regulations 1991 made pursuant to s 35 of the DPP Act included the following:

  “3. For the purpose of paragraph 6 (1) (j) of the Act the following functions are prescribed:

  (a) instituting or responding to, or conducting, on behalf of the Territory or any other person as the appellant, applicant or respondent, an appeal, application or review (including administrative review) arising out of proceedings referred to in paragraph 6 (1) (b) of the Act;

  …”

  29                  It was submitted on behalf of the Director (as it had been in the Supreme Court) that the provisions of s 6(1)(p) and s 18 are sufficient to provide the power to institute and conduct (and respond to) proceedings by way of applications for judicial review of decisions made under s 475 of the Act. Stress is laid upon the width of the expressions in those sections, particularly s 18, of the DPP Act. Appeal was made to the cases which have considered the effect of s 51(xxxix) of the Constitution to support the width of what might be called the incidental power of the Director. In our view, those constitutional cases have little to say about the present problem.

  30                  We do not doubt the width of what might be called the incidental powers in relation to the performance of the functions of the Director. However, we can see no function of the Director which has any direct connection with a criminal proceeding once completed, in the sense that all appeals have been exhausted. We do not agree that he has any general role to uphold convictions. Furthermore, the Director does not have any roving commission to represent the Executive government or the public interest in relation to criminal law in the Australian Capital Territory. The Director has only those statutory functions vested in him. Any wider role would generally be the function of the Attorney-General or the Executive government as a whole. It is illuminating to appreciate that a principal plank in the argument for the Director on the question of validity was that there was no curial remedy arising out of s 475 of the DPP Act, that the function being exercised by the Chief Justice was purely administrative, and the response depended entirely upon the Executive government. The Director does not represent the Executive government in that sense. It has not been suggested that s 475 involved any appeal or right of appeal within the meaning of s 10 of the DPP Act and it clearly did not.

  31                  This is not to say that circumstances may not arise after appeals are exhausted where the Director might have power to act. For example, if there were an external inquiry into the conduct of a completed prosecution by the Office of the Director (“the Office”), or if the Director or member or former member of the Office were called to give evidence to such an inquiry, would his statutory functions would run far enough to enable a challenge to be made to the validity of such an inquiry? The issue of power is best tested by assuming invalidity of the s 475 direction. In the present case, the evidence before the Supreme Court makes it apparent that it is inevitable that some former officers of the Office, and perhaps the former Director, will be called upon to give information on oath to the Magistrate as to the fitness to plead of Eastman during his trial. Indeed, the Director has been given leave to appear. If the topic of the inquiry and report was the conduct of the prosecution of Eastman by the then Director, in our opinion there would be power in the current Director to seek to restrain such an inquiry. Whilst the constitution of an “office” without corporate personality is unusual and shadowy, it is a sufficient indication that there is continuity of an organisation such that it would be necessary and convenient that the present Director should have the power to defend former Directors and officers from an invalid inquiry into their conduct if so advised pursuant to s 6(1)(p) and s 18 of the DPP Act.

  32                  We have held that the Magistrate is not entitled to conduct such an inquiry. However, counsel for the Director submits that the distinction between such an inquiry and that which is proposed is more apparent than real for present purposes, even assuming that the proposed inquiry is kept within proper bounds by the Magistrate. The Magistrate, counsel assisting, and those cross-examining will be able to fully test the extent of knowledge of personnel of the Office as to the fitness of Eastman over a period of many months before and during the trial and doing so will inevitably, no doubt, involve to some extent an examination of the processes of the Office as well as the extent of involvement of individual officers. With some hesitation, it seems to us that, as suggested by counsel for the Director, the distinction is too fine. At the least, the current Director has a legitimate interest in the confidentiality of the conduct of a previous prosecution by the Office and the modus operandi of the Office during the time of a previous Director. That confidentiality will be disturbed, if not lost, by the inquiry. Further, the current Director is responsible for the records of the Office in relation to former prosecutions. Production of some or all of those records will, no doubt, be sought. The Director should have power to seek to resist such demands for production if he deems it appropriate. In our opinion, the Director has power to commence and pursue each proceeding and this appeal. It should be clear that we have only considered the scope of the statutory incidental power of the Director. It is entirely a matter for the Director as to whether bringing the proceedings is an appropriate use of the power. It should also be clear that affirming the existence of the power to bring the proceedings does not involve any implication that, leaving aside the scope of s 475 of the Act, there cannot be or should not be an inquiry involving a past or present Director or past or present officers of the Office.

  Other Procedural Issues

  Person Aggrieved?

  33                  The ADJR Act provides that a person who is aggrieved by a decision may make application pursuant to the Act and reference to a person aggrieved by a decision includes reference to a person whose interests are adversely affected by the decision (s 3(4)(a)(i); s 5(1)). Counsel for the Director referred to the decision of the Full Court in Ogle v Strickland (1987) 13 FCR 306 as establishing the width of these concepts. The circumstances as to the proposed inquiry to which we have referred when discussing power would also indicate that the interests of the Office, and so the Director, are affected in the relevant sense.

  Declaration

  34                  Although the proceedings seek an injunction, that relief was and is not pressed because of the identity of the respondents. Counsel for the Director confirms that the only utility of that proceeding would be in the event that leave to extend time to make the application under the ADJR Act were not granted on a basis which did not deal with the substance of the argument. It was submitted for the Attorney-General in the Supreme Court that such use of a declaration would be an abuse of process. Whether that be so or not, it is a discretionary remedy and there would be powerful reasons against making any declaration simply to avoid the statutory time limit. The grant of a declaration is not ordinary or usual relief where an extant administrative decision is being challenged. Section 34B of the Supreme Court Act 1933 (ACT) and O 55 of the Supreme Court Rules 1937 deal with the conventional administrative law remedies.

  Leave to Appeal Required?

  35                  The order of the Supreme Court dismissing the proceeding for a declaration was not an interlocutory order, but a final order, and there is an appeal as of right. However, as we have pointed out, there are discretionary reasons against granting the relief sought. It is contended for the Director that the refusal of the extension of time and the consequent dismissal of the proceeding under the ADJR Act were not interlocutory orders but, rather, finally disposed of the proceeding so as to give rise to an appeal as of right, citing Paramasivam v Flynn (1998) 90 FCR 489 at 493. In our opinion, the passage referred to in that case is, at best, equivocal on the topic and did not settle the question which arose in that case. We add that the question which arose in that case is not the same as that which arises here. An application for an extension of time to commence proceedings of the type considered in that case is an application in itself, rather than being a step in another proceeding. There are many authorities as to what orders are interlocutory to which we have not been referred and we are far from persuaded that leave is not necessary to appeal against the dismissal of the ADJR Act proceeding. Counsel for the Director did ultimately indicate that, if necessary, he applied orally for leave to appeal, and no other party who was represented raised any objection, although Eastman was not represented at the hearing.

  36                  The Supreme Court did not deal with the question as to whether time to bring the ADJR Act proceeding should be extended as such, and dismissed the proceeding because it was held that the main proceeding would not have succeeded in any event on the merits. There are a number of discretionary considerations which might have told against the grant of any extension of time, including the substantial delay, the lack of any substantial prejudice or interference with the interests of the Director even if there was standing, the repeal of s 475, the arguable nature of the point of substance, the concerns about the administration of criminal justice which are contained in the judgments of some of the Justices of the High Court in Eastman v The Queen and possible injustice to Eastman.

  37                  However, if the direction of the Chief Justice was not authorised by s 475 there would be compelling reasons for the grant of relief, and if there is a serious doubt about that authority there are compelling reasons for prompt resolution of the issue in the public interest. The Magistrate is about to embark upon what purports to be the compulsory examination of witnesses on oath. Many witnesses would, no doubt, prefer not to be examined in this way, either in whole or in part. It is inevitable that much that would otherwise be confidential will be disclosed. It is inevitable that much that will be said by witnesses and those examining them will be defamatory. The report by the Chief Justice is also likely to disclose much that would otherwise be confidential, and is likely to be defamatory of some persons at least. If the direction was not authorised, and the inquiry is beyond power, irretrievable loss of confidential information and reputation may have occurred, and many who participate will risk incurring liability as a consequence.

  38                  In our opinion, none of the procedural issues preclude the substance of the appeal being considered.

  construction of section 475

  Argument for the Appellant

  39                  Counsel for the appellant developed his comprehensive written submissions in oral argument under five headings:

  1. The ordinary meaning of the word “guilt” in s 475(1). It was submitted that the ordinary meaning of the word “guilt” necessarily involves complicity in the crime charged, whereas fitness to plead is only an aspect of the trial process and has nothing to do with guilt in the ordinary sense of the word. In this connection, counsel referred to the history of the manner in which fitness to plead has been dealt with up to and including the present time, both in the Australian Capital Territory and elsewhere.

  2. Absence of a remedy. It was submitted that if it were found that Eastman was unfit to plead during the trial there is no remedy available to the Executive government to repair the situation. The remedies which are available to the Executive government are the grant of a pardon or the remission in whole or part of the sentence. Neither is adapted to deal with unfitness to plead.

  3. The mechanism chosen. The way in which s 475 works is not consistent with irregularities in the trial process being the topic for investigation. The magistrate merely obtains information which, if the Executive directed the inquiry, is presented to the Executive without any judicial intervention. Even in the case where a judge directs the inquiry, it is odd that the magistrate is chosen as the person to inquire if the topic for inquiry is irregularities in the trial on indictment in the Supreme Court.

  4. The history of s 475 and the New South Wales equivalent and the extrinsic materials relevant to that history. These, it was said, support the conclusion that “guilt” involves complicity in the crime charged.

  5. Various judicial and extrajudicial statements by judges concerning s 475 (or, more particularly, the New South Wales equivalent) which used language consistent with the section authorising an inquiry into conviction, particularly those relied upon by the Supreme Court. The gist of counsel’s submission was that none of those statements was made in a context in which the present question was squarely raised, and certainly not in a context in which a s 475 inquiry was limited to an aspect of the trial process.

  Argument for the Attorney-General

  40                  Counsel for the Attorney-General supported the reasoning of the Supreme Court. It was submitted that there is no such thing as “guilt” in the abstract so far as the criminal law is concerned, and that “guilt” must mean guilt found at the particular proceeding which led to the conviction so that “guilt” in s 475 should be understood in the sense of a finding of guilt. So construed, a doubt or question as to whether there was a fundamental flaw in the trial process would amount to a question or doubt about guilt as the accused should not have been found guilty.

  41                  Counsel undertook a helpful analysis of the judgments in Eastman in the High Court in order to establish the proposition that those judgments had identified a potentially serious injustice which the appellate process was not capable of remedying, and submitted that this was the very kind of situation which should be covered by a beneficial reading of s 475. It was said that a majority of the High Court considered that the further evidence which was sought to be tendered in the High Court did give rise to a doubt or question as to Eastman’s fitness to plead during the trial, although a majority held that that evidence could not be received by the High Court. There were also at least three Justices who took the view that, even without that further evidence, there were sufficient indications before this Court on appeal to establish a doubt or question as to Eastman’s fitness to plead. It was submitted that it was apparent that the Chief Justice had concentrated his attention upon whether a real doubt or question had arisen and, although he had not been prepared to make that finding purely upon the High Court decision, he was persuaded to do so by the further information provided by Eastman, principally, no doubt, the report of Dr Jolly. Once he had reached that conclusion, it was apparent that there was a real question as to the administration of criminal justice in the Australian Capital Territory with which the appellate system was not able to cope, and that Eastman might have been improperly found guilty because the trial should not have proceeded. That question having arisen, the method of endeavouring to set it to rest was by inquiring into the actual fitness to plead of Eastman. Information obtained by virtue of the inquiry, and analysis of it by the Chief Justice, might enable conclusions to be drawn one way or another as to the fitness to plead of Eastman during his trial. If fit to plead, then the doubt about conviction would be resolved. If it was concluded that Eastman were unfit to plead, then the Executive would need to consider what to do about it. The question of pardon or otherwise in those circumstances was entirely a matter for the Executive. In any event, the Executive could propose a legislative solution to the problem such as had occurred in the Chamberlain case (see the explanation in Re Conviction of Chamberlain (1988) 93 FLR 239 particularly per Nader J at 241-242).

  42                  It was submitted that no authority would stand in the way of the construction of s 475 found by the Supreme Court and that such construction was supported by statements in the authorities referred to in the Supreme Court and by the approach of judges of the New South Wales Supreme Court who had acted as justices of the peace under the equivalent New South Wales section.

  Argument for the Chief Justice and the Magistrate

  43                  Counsel did not present any separate argument on validity, but did support the analysis of counsel for the Attorney-General of the Eastman decision in the High Court and of the approach taken by the Chief Justice. He also confirmed that the inquiry would be confined to the actual fitness to plead of Eastman.

  Conclusion

  44                  In considering the discussion which follows, it needs to be borne in mind that the Chief Justice did not refer to the other limbs of s 475, namely, mitigating circumstances or part of the evidence, in his remarks, and neither has been relied upon by the Supreme Court or in argument before this Court. We will also refer to the result of the direction under s 475 as being an inquiry followed by a report.

  45                  We have no difficulty in accepting that the Chief Justice was, and was entitled to be, satisfied that there is a doubt or question as to whether Eastman should have been convicted at his trial, as there is a question or doubt as to his fitness to plead during the trial. There is no issue about those matters in these proceedings. We also have no difficulty in accepting that, that being so, it was an appropriate case to direct an inquiry pursuant to s 475 if the section permitted it. Again, there is no issue about that in these proceedings. We need not rehearse the analysis by counsel for the Attorney-General in support of these propositions, nor conduct any detailed analysis of our own of the various judgments in Eastman in the High Court. The only question is whether, acknowledging that the doubt which exists about the justice of the conviction cannot be resolved by appeal, this can be cured by a direction pursuant to s 475.

  46                  We can appreciate that an affirmative answer to that question may be seen to provide a ready and convenient solution to what might otherwise be seen as a stain upon the administration of justice in the Australian Capital Territory in these very unusual circumstances. It is but a short step to say that a beneficial construction of a remedial provision, not precluded by authority, should be adopted in order to achieve that result. However, that short step involves negotiating a crevice of some magnitude. If the judgment of the Supreme Court is correct, then s 475 had always encompassed all cases in which there is a credible allegation of a defect or irregularity in the conduct of the trial (and presumably the process of bringing the accused to trial) which, if established, might lead to the conviction being regarded as unsafe or unsatisfactory. In other words, it would be a backstop against any form of injustice in relation to the criminal process which might have led to a conviction which should not have occurred. Although s 475 and its New South Wales equivalent have been repealed and another, more detailed, set of provisions substituted, the question in issue here is by no means academic (see s 422(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900 (ACT); s 474C(2), s 474E(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)).

  47                  The conclusion which we have reached is that an inquiry and report which is limited to the fitness to plead of an accused person who has been convicted is not authorised by s 475. Put another way, a doubt or question restricted to fitness of the accused to plead is not a doubt or question as to the guilt of that person. It does not follow that questions of fitness to plead (or other procedural irregularities) are necessarily excluded from an inquiry pursuant to s 475. This is not because the inquiry becomes an inquiry into the trial process, as on an application for a new trial, but, rather, because the procedural irregularity may throw light upon the facts and circumstances which it is necessary to understand in order to assess a doubt about guilt. For example, fitness to plead could conceivably be relevant to understanding why particular evidence was or was not led at the trial, or why particular lines of cross-examination were not pursued. There could also be cases in which the mental state of the accused at the time of the trial may be relevant in assessing the mental state of the accused at the time the offence was alleged to have been committed. The Supreme Court relied upon passages from the 1985 report by Wood J of the New South Wales Supreme Court sitting as a justice of the peace in an inquiry pursuant to s 475 into the convictions of Anderson, Alister and Dunn, which were again relied upon by counsel for the Attorney-General in argument. Those passages and their full context are too lengthy to warrant setting out. In our opinion, those remarks have been misunderstood. His Honour discusses how the process of investigation and of the trial were interrelated with the question of guilt which was being examined in the circumstances of that case. This illustrates the principle which applies. It is not necessary to consider the manner in which that principle was applied in the detailed circumstances of that case.

  48                  In our view, the argument on behalf of the Director is substantially correct in each of its integers. The ordinary meaning of the word “guilt” relates to the accused having committed the crime in question. If it had been intended that the section would pick up errors or irregularities in the process by which the conviction took place, it would be expected that the legislature would have said “whenever any doubt or question arises as to the said conviction”.

  49                  The development of the law concerning fitness to plead, including relevant authorities, was recently traced in the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in R v Mailes (2001) 53 NSWLR 251 at 273-293 [112]-[203]. See also R v Judge Martin; Ex parte Attorney-General [1973] VR 339. At common law, those unfit to be tried were liable to be kept in indeterminate detention at the pleasure of the Executive. As the historical surveys in both Mailes and Judge Martin show, there have been different statutory regimes established at different times to deal with the issue. However, the question of fitness to plead has never been relevant to guilt of the crime charged and, indeed, would be irrelevant and inadmissible as to that issue. Indeed, it has been said on occasion that a jury which has decided the question of fitness to plead should not decide the question of guilt.

  50                  We regard the absence of remedy in relation to any procedural irregularity found to have occurred to be a telling point made by counsel for the Director. In modern times, the remedy for a trial irregularity is a new trial or, in the case of lack of fitness to plead, compliance with whatever statutory regime is in force at the time. A new trial cannot be ordered by the Executive. The statutory regime as to fitness to plead constituted by Pt 11A of the Act would not be applicable. We do not regard the possibility that the Executive might propose legislation as being a remedy in the relevant sense. That step does not involve any power of the Executive which can operate in the individual case. Furthermore, legislation can be proposed by any member of the legislature on the suggestion of any member of the public. If an inquiry in order to consider legislation were in prospect, it would be expected that the Executive would utilise such tools as the Inquiries Act 1991 (ACT) or the Royal Commissions Act1991 (ACT). Incidentally, that was the course which was taken in the Chamberlain matter to which reference was made by counsel for the Attorney-General. Furthermore, the historical material to which we shall refer supports the proposition that the purpose of the section was to aid the Executive in the exercise of the powers it did have in relation to pardon and remission of sentence.

  51                  We agree with the submission that the mechanism chosen by the legislature points to the obtaining of information relevant to the commission of the crime, rather than information relevant to a review of the regularity of the conduct of a trial on indictment before a jury in the Supreme Court. The procedure laid down by s 475 is rather like the role of a magistrate at a committal hearing, and is singularly inappropriate for the kind of review of the regularity of proceedings at a trial which a court of criminal appeal might now undertake.

  52                  If any doubt remained as to the proper construction of the section taking these factors into account (and we do not think that there does), in our opinion, it would be set at rest if the history of the section and extrinsic material in relation to it were considered. Although the Court was referred to a number of sources relevant to that issue, it is unnecessary for present purposes to go beyond the account given in the judgment of Hope JA in Varley v Attorney-General (NSW) (1987) 8 NSWLR 30 at 43-47. Of particular significance in that account is the following quotation from the second reading speech when the predecessor of s 475 was originally enacted:

  “… Clause 383 contains an important provision. In cases of capital offence, especially where the victim is a female, representations are frequently made to the Government – after the person charged with the offence has been found guilty – which reflect on the character, the honor, or the chastity of the prosecutrix, or some of the witnesses on her behalf. As the law stands at present the Government have not the power to institute inquiries on oath to ascertain whether the imputations or reflections are or are not well-founded. The clause provides: (cl 383(1) was read).

  This appears to me to afford much more solid ground on which the Executive may proceed when they have to deal with capital cases where doubts are thrown on the character of persons connected with them.”

  53                  In this matter in the Supreme Court the judge referred in his reasons to other passages from the judgment of Hope JA in Varley as follows:

  “21. In his discussion of the provision, Hope JA, at 45, referred to the description of O’Connor J in White v The King (1906) 4 CLR 152 at 165 as to the objects of the section:

  ‘…The object of the new provision was to enable the case to be re-opened where no point had been reserved at the trial, but some facts had come to the notice of the Government indicating that the prisoner might have been improperly convicted, and also to enable the Crown, where the prisoner’s sentence had been served, and he appeared to have been unjustly convicted, to give him the opportunity of having his character cleared by a public proceeding.’

  Hope JA also observed, at 46:

  ‘Section 475 is a remedial section, and consequently should be construed beneficially. This well-known principle does not of course mean that courts can construe a statute so as to achieve a result which they think the legislature should have enacted; it means that they should construe the statute to give the fullest effect to the legislation’s intention to remedy the mischief aimed at which the language of the statute will allow.

   

  The principal mischief to which the provision was directed seems clear enough. Both in 1883 and in 1900, there was no way in which any doubt or question concerning a conviction or a resulting sentence could be effectively investigated. The Crown could arrange for an inquiry to be held, but there was no statutory basis for doing so, there could be no public inquiry, evidence could not be given on oath and persons could not be compelled to provide information. No doubt since it was established the appellate system has been able to handle many of these problems, but subject to the operation of an appellate system the Crown might be faced with a possible injustice to a convicted person which it could not deal with satisfactorily, and there would be no effective means available to the convicted person to seek to have his name cleared.’

  Later, Hope JA described the application of the section to the case before him, at 48:

  ‘To initiate an inquiry in the present case, a doubt must arise as to the guilt of the plaintiff. This doubt need not be shown to the satisfaction of the Governor or the Court to be well-founded; that is a matter for the inquiry. To adopt the language of Nagle CJ at CL in Varley v Attorney-General of New South Wales (at 12), ‘the section envisages the placing of any material before a Judge of the Supreme Court (Supreme Court Act 1970, s 40) … or, in a petition, before the Governor … which might cause him, for want of a better word ‘unease’ in allowing a conviction to stand’.’”

  54                  At the time of the introduction of s 475, there was only a rudimentary system of appeals from conviction and so there were no means of remedy in the hands of the Court in cases in which there may have been such doubt about the guilt in the ordinary sense of the person convicted such that the conviction ought not, in justice, to stand. The only remedy in such a case lay with the Executive power of pardon. The deficiencies in obtaining the information necessary to consider use of that power are referred to in the passages cited above. The development of a sophisticated and comprehensive appellate regime in criminal cases in the Australian Capital Territory and Australia generally in the ensuing years would not, in our opinion, support the view that the scope of s 475 would be widened now compared with its original scope. Indeed, rather the contrary would be the natural conclusion.

  55                  It is true that in the passages from Varley to which we have referred, and some of the passages from other cases referred to by counsel for the Attorney-General and by the Supreme Court, the section has been spoken of, in general terms, as relating to an inquiry into conviction. This, of course, is correct so far as it goes. Unless there has been a conviction, the section has no operation. It is the nature of the inquiry which is at issue and, in our opinion, none of the statements to which reference has been made focus upon an inquiry which does not involve a question or doubt as to guilt in the ordinary sense. We have already referred to the report on the convictions of Anderson, Alister and Dunn by Wood J (as he then was). The direction pursuant to s 475 in respect of which his Honour was acting as a justice of the peace related to guilt in the ordinary sense, although, as we have pointed out, his Honour looked at aspects of the trial process as part of that more general inquiry. In the present case, a general inquiry into the guilt of Eastman has been declined. If the Attorney-General remains of the view that there ought to be an inquiry, then consideration will no doubt be given as to whether it is appropriate to use other means to achieve that result.

  proposed orders

  56                  We would propose that the applicant Director of Public Prosecutions be granted leave to appeal from the judgment and orders of the Supreme Court in proceedings number SC 149 of 2002 made 3 May 2002, that the appeal be allowed, that the orders of the Supreme Court be set aside and in lieu thereof it be ordered that (1) the time for lodging of the application for an order for review under the ADJR Act in respect of the decision of the Chief Justice made on 7 August 2001 be extended to 21 March 2002 and (2) that decision be set aside. In view of the identity of the various parties, we would make no order for costs, but would grant leave to any party to apply in relation to costs provided the motion is filed and served within fourteen days of the date of the orders.

  57                  We would dismiss the appeal from the judgment and orders of the Supreme Court in matter number SC 148 of 2002 and make no order for costs. That proceeding has no utility in view of the orders which have been made in relation to Supreme Court matter number SC 149 of 2002.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

SPENDER J:

1                    
I agree with the reasons of Dowsett J.

O’LOUGHLIN J:

2                    
I also agree.

DOWSETT J:

3                    
On 6 March 2001, a Magistrate sitting in the ACT
Magistrates Court found that a charge of assault against the appellant was
proven but, without proceeding to conviction, ordered, pursuant to
s 556A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900
(ACT) that the appellant be discharged upon giving security in his own
recognisance in the sum of $5000 that he would be of good behaviour for a
period of six months and that he pay court costs and a criminal injuries levy
in the sum of $100.  From that decision,
he appealed to the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory where the
appeal was heard by Miles CJ.  His Honour
dismissed the appeal, and the appellant now appeals to this Court from that
decision.  The relevant evidence appears
in pars [8] – [14] of the reasons given by Miles CJ in dismissing the
appeal as follows:

“[8]    The following is a summary of the evidence
before the Magistrate.  However, it must
be emphasised that, despite the brevity of the events in question, they were
the subject of much detailed evidence which in turn has been the subject of much
dissection and analysis.  Not
surprisingly, the evidence of the various witnesses can be shown to contain
discrepancies, omissions and conflicts.



[9]      The appellant was in the business of
storing and selling fireworks at a shop in Fyshwick.  The alleged victim, Ms Read, was a Dangerous
Goods inspector.  They were well known to
each other.  Ms Read went there on the
afternoon of 24 December 1999 in the company of two colleagues, Mr Fabbo and Ms
Plovits, and two police officers.



[10]    The only persons in the shop upon their
arrival were two employees, Ms Anderson and Mr Seetoh.  Ms Read showed Ms Anderson a card
identifying herself.  Ms Anderson asked
Ms Read to leave.  Ms Read declined
to do so.



[11]    After about 5.30 pm, the appellant arrived
at the shop.  At that stage, Ms Read
and Mr Fabbo were standing in the shop, opposite the entrance door and
approximately in a position where access was to be gained from the shop itself
to a rear office.  Although the
Magistrate made no finding on the matter, it may be inferred from the
circumstances that there was an invitation to members of the public to enter
the premises for the purpose of purchasing fireworks and allied purposes.  However it is unlikely that the invitation
extended to entering the office.  At any
rate, the place where Ms Read and Mr Fabbo were standing was referred to in
evidence as the entrance to the office.  



[12]    The entrance area was about 1.2 metres wide,
and the distance between Ms Read and Mr Fabbo was less than that, possibly as
little as 30 centimetres.  Any person
wishing to go into the office would have had to go between them.  



[13]    Upon the appellant entering the shop, he
went to enter the office in order to get a camera with which he intended to
record what was going on.  



[14]    The events that then occurred did so over a
short space of time, no more than a few seconds.  The evidence of Ms Read and of the appellant,
in particular, is in conflict in important respects.  Ms Read said that the appellant pushed the
right side of his upper body against her right shoulder causing her to be
forced backwards against the counter and also causing pain in the
shoulder.  The appellant’s evidence was
that as he moved between Ms Read and Mr Fabbo, his feet unintentionally became
entangled and he tripped, accidentally colliding with Ms Read.  Both witness agreed that the appellant said
“Excuse me - I said ‘Excuse me’ ”, but disagree on whether he said those words
before or after he came in contact with Ms Read.”



4                    
To this extract from the reasons of Miles CJ, we
would add only two references to the evidence as summarised by the learned
Magistrate.  Firstly, she said of the
evidence of Domenic Fabbo:

“He did not see the defendant enter the shop.  The first time he was aware of the defendant
was when he became aware of his clothing in front of his face.  The defendant collided with his right
shoulder with minimal force.  Mr Fabbo
reacted to this by moving back and to the left slightly.  The defendant then took his place, his upper
torso moved forward and he took a sideways step in Ms Read’s direction - it was
like a shoulder charge with his right shoulder. 
The defendant collided with Ms Read’s right shoulder and the force of
the collision threw her against the counter. 
At that time Ms Read’s feet were evenly balanced.”



5                    
The Magistrate said, regarding the evidence of
Constable Cowling:

“The defendant entered the shop, he did not stop but headed
toward the back of the shop.  The
Constable did not see the defendant make contact with Mr Fabbo but he did see
Mr Fabbo move back as if to make clearance for the defendant.  The Constable said that there would have been
enough room for the defendant to pass between Mr Fabbo and Ms Read.  He demonstrated in Court the movement which
he recalled the defendant taking when his right shoulder came into contact with
Ms Read’s right shoulder.  He
demonstrated what was clearly a deliberate movement.  Constable Cowling stated that he saw a look
of surprise or shock on Ms Read’s face. 
He did not hear anything but he yelled out “Hey”.  He then went to Ms Read.”



6                    
The learned Magistrate, in a carefully reasoned
judgment, initially directed herself as to the elements of the offence and as
to the onus of proof.  She said:

“Assault for the purposes of the charge consists of the striking,
touching or application of force.  This
must be without consent, it must be intentional, that is not accidental, and
without lawful excuse.  The prosecution
must prove each of the elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt.”



7                    
Her Worship then went on to deal with the case,
more or less upon the basis that the principal issue was whether or not the
application of force had been deliberate. 
She concluded:

“I am left in no doubt that the defendant’s action was
deliberate.”



8                    
That conclusion was clearly based upon a careful
examination of all of the evidence.

9                    
At the beginning of the appeal today, the
appellant sought to lead further evidence. 
We declined to allow him to do so. 
It is not necessary to say anything more about our reasons for that decision,
save that the evidence clearly related to matters which were in issue before
the Magistrate, and that there was no suggestion that the evidence was then
unavailable.  The proposed evidence is
not fresh.

10                 
Turning to the grounds of appeal, grounds 2 and
5 relates to an assertion which is now made that the appellant was, at the time
at which he applied force to the complainant, seeking to overcome her
obstructing his entry to his office, she then being, as it is alleged, a
trespasser.  There is little basis for
the assertion that she was a trespasser, but it may be assumed for the present
purposes that she was.  It may also be
assumed that in some circumstances, an occupier of premises may lawfully apply
force to a trespasser who seeks to obstruct the former’s lawful use of the
premises.  I make those assumptions not
because I necessarily believe them to be correct, but because it is not
necessary to challenge their correctness in order to dispose of the grounds of
appeal.  The appellant gave evidence in
these proceedings.  At no time did he
suggest that the assault had come about as a result of any attempt by him to
overcome obstruction by Ms Read or anybody else.  His defence was that the contact was
accidental, a version which the Magistrate expressly rejected.  Had the appellant made any conscious attempt
to overcome obstruction by Ms Read, he would surely have said so in evidence.

11                 
In some cases a trial judge may be obliged to
leave for the jury’s consideration, defences which have not been expressly raised
by the accused.  A magistrate determining
summary proceedings has a similar duty to consider any such defences, even if
they are not raised.  However it has long
been established that such a defence must at least be suggested on the evidence
before the relevant tribunal is obliged to address it.  It cannot be said in the present case that
any such defence was raised on the evidence. 
In those circumstances, there is nothing in grounds of appeal 2 and 5.

12                 
It is also asserted that Miles CJ erred in
finding that the Magistrate had applied the correct onus of proof.  I can see nothing in the Magistrate’s reasons
which would suggest otherwise.  As I have
pointed out, she directed herself as to the onus and eventually recorded her
conclusion that she had no doubt as to the deliberateness of the act.  There is nothing in that point.

13                 
It is submitted that his Honour erred in finding
that the appellant’s actions were deliberate. 
His Honour, in doing so, merely reflected the conclusion of the
Magistrate at first instance, seeing no reason to differ from her.  On the evidence, such a view was fairly open,
and the Magistrate had observed the witnesses. 
This ground also fails. 

14                 
Finally, it is pointed out that whereas the
Magistrate described as “aggressive” the tone of voice used by the appellant on
a tape recording of the events in question in these proceedings, his Honour
formed a different view.  This is a
trivial matter and in no sense amounts to an error, either on the part of the
Magistrate or on the part of Miles CJ. 
It is merely a matter of opinion. 
No grounds are demonstrated for departing from the order of Miles
CJ.  I would dismiss the appeal.

SPENDER J:
