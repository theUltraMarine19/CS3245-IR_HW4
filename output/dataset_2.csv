 The case for the prosecution
The prosecution`s case was as follows. On the morning of 31 January 1997, Nancy Tee, a supervisor at the Clementi branch of NTUC Fairprice (NTUC), told Basuri bin Rosidi (Basuri), the security officer of NTUC, that there were some cans of abalone inside a Foster beer box under the appellant`s table in the office. Nancy Tee instructed Basuri to keep an eye on the abalone. During the day, Basuri went into the office at half-hourly or hourly intervals to check the box.
 3.Sometime after 6pm on 31 January 1997, Lee Swee Siong (Lee), a deaf mute storehand in the grocery department of NTUC, saw the appellant taking ten cans of abalone and two cans of shark`s fin. He identified the cans in exh P3, a photograph of the abalone cans, as the cans he saw. Lee saw the appellant place the cans in a Guinness box and move the box under the table. He then walked over to Goh Ah Keok (Goh), a supervisor of NTUC, to sign to her what was happening. At about 6.10pm, Goh saw the appellant put the cans of abalone into two Royal biscuits tins. The tins were those featured in exh P2, a photograph of the abalone cans in biscuit tins. The appellant sealed both tins with scotch tape. After sealing the tins, the appellant put them into her plastic bag.
 4.At 10.30pm that day, Basuri checked the appellant as she was leaving. She was carrying two plastic bags, each with a Royal biscuits tin in it. The appellant showed Basuri the receipt for the two tins of Royal biscuits. Basuri returned the receipt and the appellant left.
 5.Nancy Tee checked the Foster box with the abalone cans a total of four times that day. Sometime after 10pm, she checked the Foster box and discovered that the cans were missing. The abalone cans which were missing were of the type shown in P3. She then informed Basuri that the abalone cans were missing. After checking two people who were leaving, Basuri ran out to look for the appellant.
 6.Basuri found the appellant at Clementi Bus Interchange ten minutes later. He informed her that he needed to re-check her biscuit tins. She asked `Why`. He replied that a few cans of abalone were missing. She gave him one of the tins. He checked and found abalone cans inside. The appellant did not say anything. Basuri asked her to follow him back to the store. She initially refused but agreed when Basuri said she might be able to speak to the branch manager and he might give her a chance.
 7.Once back at the office, Basuri handed over the appellant and the biscuit tins to NT Lingam (Lingam), the security manager of NTUC. Basuri then called Tan Chin Chye (Tan), the manager of NTUC, to inform him about the matter. He also asked P Mohd s/o P Ahmad (Ahmad), the security supervisor of NTUC, to call the police.
 8.Inside the manager`s office, the abalone cans were taken out of the biscuit tins. The abalone cans Lingam and Tan saw were those shown in P3. Tan also confirmed that NTUC did not sell the white and blue colour type of abalone similar to exh D4, an abalone can white and blue in colour.
 9.The appellant was escorted back to the station at about 11.23pm. The ten cans of abalone and two empty biscuit tins were seized as exhibits. These exhibits were subsequently handed over to Sergeant Tho Yeng Kok (Sgt Tho), the investigating officer. Sgt Tho asked Jumato bin Saad (Jumato) to photograph the exhibits. This resulted in exhs P2-P4. Sgt Tho returned the ten cans of abalone to Basuri on 3 February 1997. Sgt Tho proceeded to record the long statement from the appellant at about 1.10am on 2 February 1997. Woman Corporal Tan Siok Hoon was present at that recording. In the statement, the appellant admitted to the theft of the abalone cans.
 10.
 The case for the defence
The defence`s case was as follows. The appellant reported for work on 31 January 1997 at 2.24pm. Sometime after 5pm she left for dinner. She returned some time after 6pm. She bought her biscuit tins during her dinner break. According to the receipt they were bought at 6.35pm. She subsequently brought the biscuit tins back to the office and placed them under her table. Her evidence was that she could not remember whether there was anything underneath her table. She denied putting the abalone cans into the biscuit tins. She left work at 10.31pm.
 11.At Clementi bus interchange, Basuri stopped her, checked her biscuit tins and asked her to follow him back to the office. The appellant testified that the abalone cans that were taken out of the biscuit tins were blue and white cans similar to some specimens in court, D4. The appellant`s evidence was that abalone was one of the items under her charge and that abalone of the type similar to D4 was never sold in the supermarket. Only the type similar to another specimen D5, an abalone can chilli red in colour, and another specimen D2, an abalone can pink and blue in colour, were sold.
 12.The appellant denied stealing the abalone cans from NTUC. Her defence was that someone planted the cans in her biscuit tins to frame her.
 13.The appellant was not on good terms with some of the prosecution`s material witnesses, namely Lee, Basuri and Nancy Tee. Her relationship with Lee was poor because she had to scold him on occasions when he made mistakes. Her relationship with Basuri deteriorated after an argument over closing door shutters, and she had an argument with Nancy Tee over one of the appellant`s storehands.
 14.The appellant denied that her statement was made voluntarily. According to her, she was not allowed to visit the washroom during the three hour interview in the police station, even though she was suffering then from menstrual pains. She said that Sgt Tho threatened her with seven years` imprisonment and a fine if she did not sign the statement. Her evidence was that Sgt Tho offered to let her off with a warning and a fine if she signed the statement. She testified that she did not read the contents of the statement. After her release, she told her sister and brother-in-law about the incident. She testified that she attempted to contact Sgt Tho several times to correct what she signed but he refused to see her. She eventually made a police report on 8 May 1997, admitted as D6. A day before she was formally charged in court, she made a second police report.

 The magistrate`s findings
The appellant made several allegations of threats and inducement. The magistrate conducted a voir dire. After considering all the evidence, the magistrate was satisfied that the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that the statement had been given voluntarily and was not brought about by any threat, inducement or promise. The statement was admitted as PS2.
 16.One of the issues in contention was whether the abalone cans in question were those sold by NTUC. The actual cans had been returned to NTUC. The only evidence the prosecution had of the allegedly stolen cans were exhibit photographs P2 and P3. The defence`s contention was that the cans shown in P3 were white and blue, and that NTUC did not sell the white and blue colour type of abalone cans. Tan and the appellant had testified that NTUC did not sell the white and blue type of abalone cans. In cross-examination, Jumato was referred to P2 and questioned as to the colour of the cans. He answered that they were white and blue and further confirmed that the cans in P2 were similar to the blue and white type of D4.
 17.The magistrate made a finding of fact that the cans of abalone in P2 and P3 were the pink and blue type sold by NTUC and not of the type similar to the blue and white D4.
 18.
 The appeal
The crux of the appeal was this. Were the abalone cans in question of the type sold by NTUC? The appellant and Tan, the manager of NTUC, had testified that NTUC did not sell the white and blue colour abalone cans. They only sold the red cans, and the pink and blue cans. The only evidence the prosecution had regarding the allegedly stolen cans were photographs P2 and P3, the actual cans having been returned on 3 February 1997. In cross-examination, Jumato, the police photographer, testified that the cans in P2 and P3 were white and blue and confirmed that the cans in P2 were similar to those in D4. It was also conceded by the counsel for the prosecution that the cans in P2 and P3 appeared more white than pink. Examining P2 and P3, I was also of the opinion that the cans in P2 and P3 were white and blue in colour and not pink and blue.
 19.The prosecution submitted that the magistrate`s finding was supported by the appellant`s statement to the police, in which she admitted that the abalone seized from her belonged to the management of the supermarket. The prosecution also submitted that the magistrate`s finding that the abalone cans in P2 and P3 were sold by NTUC was reinforced by the fact that the appellant did not, at any stage before the trial, protest that the abalone seized from her did not belong to the supermarket. In effect the prosecution tried to prove that the abalone cans were in the possession of Tan, by relying on evidence from the appellant`s statement and on a single strand of circumstantial evidence arising from the appellant`s behaviour. I am of the view, however, that such evidence is contradicted by other evidence tendered by the prosecution themselves, namely the photographs P2 and P3 of white and blue abalone cans, the evidence of Jumato that the cans in P2 and P3 were white, and the evidence from Tan himself that NTUC did not sell the white and blue type of abalone cans.
 20.The totality of the evidence in this case was clearly that the cans in question in P2 and P3 were white and blue and of the type not sold by NTUC. In my judgment, the magistrate erred with respect to a material finding of fact when she found that the cans in P2 and P3 were the pink and blue type sold by NTUC.
 21.There was therefore no proof that the abalone cans were in the possession of Tan, the manager of NTUC. As a result the charge against the appellant was not made out. It is settled law that the test to be applied at the close of the prosecution`s case is that set out in 
Haw Tua Tau v PP
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  [1980-1981] SLR 73 . At the end of the prosecution`s case the judge must consider whether 
 there is some evidence (not inherent incredible) which, if he were to accept as accurate, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence. If such evidence as respects any of those essential elements is lacking, then, and then only, is he justified in finding that `no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction `
 22.In this case, the prosecution failed to establish an essential element of the offence, in that they failed to establish that the abalone cans were in the possession of the appellant`s master. Accordingly the defence should not have been called.
 23.For these reasons, the appeal against conviction was allowed.",1998-04-29 00:00:00,SG High Court
